    "description": "Aberrations are entities that defy the natural laws of the world, often originating from alien dimensions or the unfathomable depths of the cosmos. Their forms and minds are utterly foreign, leading them to have little in common with the creatures of the material plane. Aberrations typically have bizarre and unsettling anatomies with features that are unnerving or grotesque. Their motives are often inscrutable, driven by alien logic or purposes beyond mortal comprehension. Many aberrations hail from the Far Realm, a distant plane of madness and chaos. They commonly possess powerful mental abilities such as telepathy, mind control, and psionics. Due to their alien nature, aberrations are often solitary, viewing other creatures either as tools, subjects, or threats.",

Created by spellcasters, artisans, or deities, constructs are formed through complex rituals, enchantments, or advanced technology.
