<p data-content-chunk-id="96136464-a4ec-4279-adcf-b77d0ed54f1a">The Mists of Ravenloft drift across worlds, sowing fear and abducting unsuspecting souls. These forces don’t claim individuals at random, though. The fear of innocents, the turmoil of the corruptible, the resolve of the truly heroic—the Dark Powers savor these traits. Whether for a night or an eternity, Ravenloft seeks heroes of all sorts and pits them against their greatest nightmares.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b32495c9-5906-4548-b43e-03bf2f7ff577">This chapter explores how to create a character prepared to face the horrors of Ravenloft, while also forging ties to the haunted pedigrees and grim fates common to the Domains of Dread.

<p data-content-chunk-id="bcd2288b-5688-42c0-9f69-2bd9cec585a8">Ravenloft encourages you and your group to safely explore the thrill of all manner of ghost stories, mysteries, and other tales of terror. While <a title="chapter 4" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="f05de3c4-1499-46a2-954d-a150bb183f3f">chapter 4</a> guides DMs in how to craft atmospheric adventures, the spookiest scenarios will fall flat if you and the other players aren’t prepared to engage with some degree of suspense. By the same token, the DM can’t craft an enjoyably spooky experience if they’re not aware of your interests in and thresholds for participating in fear-focused adventures. This section highlights elements common to frightening D&amp;D games, features that you should be mindful of as a player and that will help you create a character prepared to participate in suspenseful adventures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="597e1f00-fc8e-48cf-b3e7-f4bd82243419">But it all begins with one question: Are you sure?</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="InvitationtoNightmare" data-content-chunk-id="4cfb0781-f8d5-4081-82bf-6443b2a3df9f"><a href="#InvitationtoNightmare" data-content-chunk-id="71a92d7c-8a77-4fe1-bed5-075f247823e9"></a>Invitation to Nightmare</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="179c7df1-20f0-4048-aaa1-b840b1ce6036">You’ve been invited to play a scary game. What does a horror adventure or campaign mean? Who’s it supposed to be scary for, you the player or your character? Is it scary like a mystery cartoon or a slasher movie? What content makes it scary? What do you not want to see in a horror story?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2053a0e2-d85a-4852-bc48-0a16ea1d9b3f">These are all legitimate questions and ones you should have answers to before participating in a fear-focused D&amp;D adventure. Horror, as a genre, covers broad swaths of material. What you shrug off other players might find personally unsettling—everyone’s experiences and tolerances are distinct and real, even if they differ from your own. Before creating a character, ask your DM and the rest of the group the aforementioned questions, along with any others that come to mind. <a title="Chapter 4" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures#PreparingforHorror" data-content-chunk-id="206fe9c7-a2a5-45f7-94c8-9273ad4551de">Chapter 4</a> encourages DMs to facilitate pregame discussions to make sure the entire group agrees on content, boundaries, and tools to keep the terror fun. Think of this as establishing a film-like rating and content warning for the story you’ll all be creating. If you’re uncertain about aspects of the game, ask about them—before the game, during play, or whenever a concern arises. Everyone’s comfort and enjoyment of spooky adventures are what matter most!</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PreparetoBeScared" data-content-chunk-id="4b01ebf7-26cc-4b1a-8137-6ace2c59f807"><a href="#PreparetoBeScared" data-content-chunk-id="f6761298-d379-405c-9057-265e9ca949eb"></a>Prepare to Be Scared</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="57b4dda5-848f-457f-a0fc-ea0e1957d1d8">When planning to play a scary adventure, create a character prepared to be scared. Consider how your character reacts to being frightened and how that affects the creepy atmosphere of the adventure. Don’t consider fear a tactical disadvantage or something to be avoided. As part of playing a frightening game, you’re a participant in building and reinforcing a sense of dread for everyone at the table. If your character laughs in the face of every danger, they undermine the adventure’s threats and its broader atmosphere.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="798711ba-db4b-433b-afec-09657bb9b962">When creating and playing your character, consider courage not as the absence of fear but as the process of overcoming it. How might your character react in surprise before they rally to overcome the terror they face? Do they scream, flee, or freeze? Or might they throw themself into battle, perhaps recklessly or for too long? Record a default reaction on your character sheet so you can respond consistently when shocking events occur.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a77e67e7-5b69-46b5-8fc6-74b16d97f6c3">Beyond this, discuss with your group how much fear ties into the game’s rules. Would you prefer to keep frightful reactions narrative, or would you like to use game rules that present additional challenges and benefits? Ask your DM about the possibility of using the rules for inspiration to motivate fearful character reactions, as detailed in the “<a title="Fear and Stress" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures#FearandStress" data-content-chunk-id="c49a5fb8-4a59-4a4b-b7f4-e96c624a2d75">Fear and Stress</a>” section of <a title="chapter 4" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="9861f43a-2a39-4d87-9948-d5da07a52bef">chapter 4</a>. Using this system, a character who possesses particular fears and uses them to guide their responses to horrific scenes might earn inspiration for reinforcing the adventure’s frightful atmosphere. The DM might not employ these rules every time something frightening occurs, but your group might use them as a way to highlight individual fears and build an adventure’s overarching sense of dread.</p>
<aside class="rules-text" id="FromtheMistsorBeyond">
<p>FROM THE MISTS OR BEYOND?</p>
<p>Not everyone exploring the Domains of Dread comes from those grim lands. Work with the DM to determine your character’s origins. Has your character lived their entire life among the Mists? Or do they hail from another D&amp;D setting, a place of your own design, or a more mysterious homeland?</p>
<p>If you decide your character calls some corner of Ravenloft home, ask your DM which domains they could originate from. The DM can provide details from <a title="chapter 3" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/domains-of-ravenloft/">chapter 3</a> to help inform your decision. Although humans predominate many of the Domains of Dread, adventurers in Ravenloft can belong to any race in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" title="Player’s Handbook">Player’s Handbook</a> or other sources. The domains of Darkon, Dementlieu, and Hazlik, for example, all feature particularly varied populations.</p>
<p>If you decide your character is from some other world, collaborate with the DM to determine how you came to the Land of the Mists. As they’re familiar with true terrors, inhabitants of the Domains of Dread rarely mistake characters from even the most outlandish worlds for actual monsters.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="KnowYourFears" data-content-chunk-id="e0bc1e3b-1d1d-492f-a94f-57b114902f77"><a href="#KnowYourFears" data-content-chunk-id="cbd295f8-b039-4c6e-8af4-ecf07f895f17"></a>Know Your Fears</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="507ba306-d766-4106-ab16-f0915c725f5e">Knowing what frightens your character provides insight into their past and can motivate their behavior. A character’s fear of cats might stem from a terrible sight they witnessed at their grandmother’s home, while a fear of earthquakes might hearken back to the experience of being trapped after a tremor. Consider two or three things that unsettle your character, what they tell you about their past, and if those fears shape who they are now.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="EvilInside" data-content-chunk-id="f2e4bc45-3e32-4314-b506-971b1e3bbc42"><a href="#EvilInside" data-content-chunk-id="4c5c6d81-6a64-46df-af96-6dc8038842c6"></a>Evil Inside</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b510c007-dc7c-4f43-8f82-42106029124f">This book assumes you’re playing a character who pits themself against fearful foes. That said, if you’re eager to play a character with a shadowy past or sinister origins, the lineages and Dark Gifts presented later in this chapter provide such opportunities. How a character engages with the evil inside themself can make for exciting conflicts. Be sure that your choices allow your character to remain a reliable part of your adventuring group, though, and not a near-villain the other heroes only tolerate.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HabitsofHorrorHeroes" data-content-chunk-id="0b4b44bc-791b-4e51-986a-e17fc3dd9ec6"><a href="#HabitsofHorrorHeroes" data-content-chunk-id="d941b19b-74c7-4a08-986f-2de2151eaa31"></a>Habits of Horror Heroes</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8564fa80-59eb-4f0f-87aa-b8da9e8e4ec7">Playing horror adventures is similar to telling ghost stories around a fire. You and the game’s other players are allies in creating a fun, safe, moody atmosphere for your game. Contribute to this by keeping the following elements in mind:</p>
<figure id="imghero" class="compendium-image compendium-image-right">
<a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-right" href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/01-002.orc-hero.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title=""><img src="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/01-002.orc-hero.png" class="ddb-lightbox-inner" style="width: 329px;" alt=""></a><figcaption>

</figure><p data-content-chunk-id="28cfe073-f109-4048-8922-dae003227ce3"><strong>Focus on the Game.</strong> Atmosphere requires attention. You’re not embracing or contributing to the adventure’s moody atmosphere when you’re focused on something else.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fef19a1d-7b25-4ae9-9803-f5b01dddf9a0"><strong>Limit Comedy.</strong> Be aware that comedy breaks tension. Nothing dispels an ominous atmosphere like jokes, be they in character or otherwise.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4392404b-6546-435c-9b68-9c354f3fd0be"><strong>Player Fears Versus Character Fears.</strong> Understand the difference between scaring characters and scaring players. If you know a player has a fear of spiders, never employ that knowledge when contributing to a creepy scene.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f4dd4269-0ab1-4f8f-a684-9fbb3da395b4"><strong>Consent Is a Priority.</strong> If a plot leads you to consider a path involving another player’s character, always ask that player’s permission before acting. Their enjoyment is more important than shock value.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="62d52edd-ad3b-4085-91df-bbdea40d1176"><strong>Know What’s Too Far.</strong> If a game gets too intense or goes a direction you don’t want to explore, make sure you and the other players have a method for raising concerns mid-game and support one another in doing so. Techniques for facilitating this are further explored in <a title="chapter 4" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures#ContentTools" data-content-chunk-id="dc37461b-2d9b-4542-99dd-60e4a0301d98">chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="723c2d46-5d0d-4e19-8da0-9267d259876a"><strong>Add to Your Own Terror.</strong> Feel free to make horrific circumstance worse for your character. If your character has a fear of goats and the DM describes some eldritch horror, don’t hesitate to ask if the creature has hooves or hourglass eyes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f0d4df8-b9f1-48ad-84bc-ce61b9f47eab"><strong>Enjoy the Struggle.</strong> Not everyone can expect to escape a horror story unscathed. While your character should do everything they can to survive and triumph over challenges, any scars they gain along the way are part of what makes the horror meaningful and memorable.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Lineages" data-content-chunk-id="dc679a7f-c868-465a-a152-25b542cf9b45"><a href="#Lineages" data-content-chunk-id="bd0b01c6-4bf7-494b-a2aa-f2bde801ac0b"></a>Lineages</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef8a653d-2374-488e-ad94-27a9391d9580">In the Land of the Mists, power and dread lie in the simple question “What happened to me?” The following lineages are races that characters might gain through remarkable events. These overshadow their original race, if any, becoming their new race. A character might choose a lineage during character creation, their transformation having occurred before play begins. Or, events might unfold during adventures that lead your character to replacing their race with this new lineage. Work with your DM to establish if you’re amenable to such a development and how such stories unfold.</p>
<aside class="rules-text" id="WhatHappenedtoMe">
<p>WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?</p>
<p>The lineages provided in this section represent a physical and magical transformation that alters you in fundamental ways. You can still appear as you once were, but you’ve changed in significant ways that might overwrite your once physical or magical capabilities. A dragonborn who becomes a dhampir, for instance, loses their connection to their draconic ancestry as the deathless power of vampirism surges through them. Once able to exhale destructive energy, the dragonborn now feels a powerful hunger inside, and their bite is now able to drain life. Some racial traits might remain after you gain a lineage, a possibility captured in the Ancestral Legacy trait. Keep this in mind when you explore the details of how you change after gaining a lineage subsequent to character creation.</p>
</aside>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7dd8720c-f2a0-4f3d-81ad-262417dcf7cc">At 1st level, you choose whether your character is a member of the human race or of one of the game’s fantastical races. Alternatively, you can choose one of the following lineages. If you choose a lineage, you might have once been a member of another race, but you aren’t any longer. You now possess only your lineage’s racial traits.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cc79080f-554c-4fa0-b591-7f7d2f547df6">When you create a character using a lineage option here, follow these additional rules during character creation.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="AbilityScoreIncreases" data-content-chunk-id="21aad72e-c1c6-47af-b4c1-cfa186a44637"><a href="#AbilityScoreIncreases" data-content-chunk-id="408dc18e-35cb-4cbc-8fe7-5c0e3873a890"></a>Ability Score Increases</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="218f033e-6b54-4e5a-95ed-3be8de2597ca">When determining your ability scores, you increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or you increase three different scores by 1. You follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="56356019-cf21-4029-8652-86d5a761ab70">Your class’s “Quick Build” section offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You’re free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3f6602fd-f173-40f1-ba94-b4ca440956e4">If you are replacing your race with a lineage, replace any Ability Score Increase you previously had with these.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c36baf7e-ae56-4e57-a96e-30dafccd7a5b">Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" title="Player’s Handbook" data-content-chunk-id="a0c1e2c7-6f8b-4051-973c-9ae186b1d50f">Player’s Handbook</a> offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="007364e3-dc50-4fd1-abee-e1735be428e6">If you are replacing your race with a lineage, you retain any languages you had and gain no new languages.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="01c07370-4702-4791-a8c6-6f17628a3bdd">Every creature in D&amp;D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character’s creature type is.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e1ccfe02-a335-4f72-b4f8-cc1d044a9398">Here’s a list of the game’s creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2056-tooltip">cure wounds</a> spell specifies that the spell doesn’t work on a creature of the Construct type.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="709a542b-ea87-406e-bc20-dc2e288ec0fe">Poised between the worlds of the living and the dead, dhampirs retain their grip on life yet are endlessly tested by vicious hungers. Their ties to the undead grant dhampirs a taste of a vampire’s deathless prowess in the form of increased speed, <a class="tooltip-hover sense-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision" data-tooltip-href="/senses/2-tooltip">darkvision</a>, and a life-draining bite.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="afe8b4cb-85a0-4e32-8434-52308ea0a4da">With unique insights into the nature of the undead, many dhampirs become adventurers and monster hunters. Their reasons are often deeply personal. Some seek danger, imagining monsters as personifications of their own hungers. Others pursue revenge against whatever turned them into a dhampir. And still others embrace the solitude of the hunt, striving to distance themselves from those who’d tempt their hunger.</p><figure id="imgrogue" class="compendium-image"><a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-center" href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/01-003.dhampir-rogue.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title=""><img src="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/01-003.dhampir-rogue.png" class="ddb-lightbox-inner" style="width: 420px;" alt=""></a><figcaption>Dhampir rogue</figcaption></figure>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8ca33635-caba-4766-bba3-756950842a65">Every dhampir knows a thirst slaked only by the living. Those who overindulge their thirst risk losing control and forever viewing others as prey. Those who resist might find exceptional ways of controlling their urges or suppress them through constant, molar-grinding restraint.

<p data-content-chunk-id="34bfe9aa-32bd-44d3-9510-9e4368636481">If you don’t keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="625c03e7-e302-4264-9aea-34cc1099dfad"><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a3ce106f-4f5f-4519-90af-eeecdea58922"><em><strong>Deathless Nature.</strong></em> You don’t need to breathe.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="40a16a6e-41ec-442a-8270-0bb76788c228"><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, at 3rd level, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="849b5d9f-4652-4768-a2fd-3e405f8ef3f1"><strong><em>Vampiric Bite.</em></strong> Your fanged bite is a natural weapon, which counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. You add your Constitution modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with this bite. It deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit. While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with this bite.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7315d22f-ca01-4342-90fa-9c06c75c25c6">Where wishing fails, ancient magic can offer a heart’s desire—at least, for a time. Hexbloods are individuals infused with eldritch magic, fey energy, or mysterious witchcraft. Some who enter into bargains with hags gain their deepest wishes but eventually find themselves transformed. These changes evidence a hag’s influence: ears that split in forked points, skin in lurid shades, long hair that regrows if cut, and an irremovable living crown. Along with these marks, hexbloods manifest hag-like traits, such as <a class="tooltip-hover sense-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision" data-tooltip-href="/senses/2-tooltip">darkvision</a> and a variety of magical methods to beguile the senses and avoid the same.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ab187a2e-699d-4f66-93c9-e2579fbb36dd">While many hexbloods gain their lineage after making a deal with a hag, others reveal their nature as they age—particularly if a hag influenced them early in life or even before their birth. Many hexbloods turn to lives of adventure, seeking to discover the mysteries of their magic, to forge a connection with their fey natures, or to avoid a hag that obsesses over them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f13ecb8d-610a-4e33-b882-cb43e270fad3">One way hags create more of their kind is through the creation of hexbloods. Every hexblood exhibits features suggestive of the hag whose magic inspires their powers. This includes an unusual crown, often called an eldercross or a witch’s turn. This living, garland-like part of a hexblood’s body extends from their temples and wraps behind the head, serving as a visible mark of the bargain between hag and hexblood, a debt owed, or a change to come.</p>

<p>BECOMING A HAG</p>
<p>Hags can undertake a ritual to irreversibly transform a hexblood they created into a new hag, either one of their own kind or that embodies the hexblood’s nature. This requires that both the hag and hexblood be in the same place and consent to the lengthy ritual—circumstances most hexbloods shun but might come to accept over the course of centuries. Once a hexblood undergoes this irreversible ritual, they emerge as a hag NPC no longer under the control of the hexblood’s player, unless the DM rules otherwise.</p>

Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent. Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f947cc7b-4840-49f3-a878-2b66f000218d">Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a8528e42-6008-46cd-9133-b9daa5f2b721">Ravenloft is a place where your nightmares can run wild, where anything you can imagine in moments of dread or despair can come to frightful life among the Mists. The setting as a whole is made up of countless isolated domains, each one a perfect expression of a particular flavor of the macabre. Creating your own domain allows you to blend legendary evils, unexpected monstrosities, and grim settings into a tailor-made whole, bound together by mysterious mists and buried alive inside your favorite horror genres.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4bdaf28b-1e17-48f1-a44b-edc6f2f04590"> This chapter explores how to create such domains, a process that starts by defining a Darklord—the villain at the heart of each sinister realm. Descriptions of various genres of horror also provide details to guide and inspire your creations.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="bd6cd884-61f7-475e-a022-8a469766faa2">Domains are mocking reflections of the evils they confine. Each has a purpose, being a prison designed to torture a deliberately chosen villain. To devise a Domain of Dread, you must first conceive its central antagonist and prisoner: its Darklord. The following sections detail how to develop a Darklord that contrasts your characters and can serve as a central rival in your horror adventures.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SinisterReflections" data-content-chunk-id="57c8fcbb-806d-4c8a-a33d-6786b06f4028"><a href="#SinisterReflections" data-content-chunk-id="1ac5f8f3-187d-427b-8694-8fc7df198f7f"></a>Sinister Reflections</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2af07045-7368-458c-95e7-2f6c1ab078ca">A Darklord’s memories, desires, mistakes, and evil deeds shape the domain’s twisted lands, inhabitants, and features. You need not create these in a vacuum, though. When creating your own Darklord, consider the relationship that will define their evil in your adventures: their conflict with your players’ characters. Just as a Darklord is the inspiration for a domain, players’ characters can be a source of inspiration for a Darklord. Consider a Darklord a sinister reflections of those characters. If you explore this connection, have your players create characters then involve them in the process of creating a Darklord in the following ways:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7f974084-01fb-4b70-a327-3f482554c324"><strong>What to Reflect.</strong> Ask your players which of their characters’ personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws are their favorites. Request at least two favorites from each player. Write them down. If players have been playing characters for a while, ask them to rewrite these personal characteristics to reflect who their characters are now.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7940922b-e72e-4aac-bc02-99620da52214"><strong>Exaggerated Reflections.</strong> For each favored personal characteristic, imagine and write down a version twisted to its extreme. For example, transform “I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example” into “I’m obsessed with a hero of my faith, and I must become exactly like them so I can take their place.” The more unreasonable, the better.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8cce8a4f-d0a7-4538-bf4c-5ad847dd2048"><strong>Opposite Reflections.</strong> For each favored personal characteristic, imagine and write down its opposite—specifically, a version that compels characters into conflict. For example, transform “I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example” into “I loathe a particular hero and their followers, and I will prove the hypocrisy of that person’s deeds and example.” The harsher, the better.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c23c2c7a-584d-487a-8d07-97d93501e714"> Use these exaggerated and opposite reflections as inspirations for creating your Darklord. By basing your Darklord on intimate details drawn from the players’ characters, you create a feeling that the characters are trapped inside a collective nightmare. Through their interactions with a Darklord who mirrors them, characters discover how easily they could become the villains they face.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PastLife" data-content-chunk-id="712dc577-27e2-45ba-b640-c30b246f56ba"><a href="#PastLife" data-content-chunk-id="d692f809-16ed-46cc-bf75-ec6731a2ab06"></a>Past Life</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eda7883c-5dbc-4fb7-b65b-a61303325c1b">Darklords aren’t mindless killing machines; they are full but monstrous individuals. In a few sentences, describe who the Darklord was before they chose to become irredeemable. For inspiration, consider how the Darklord is a reflection of the players’ characters. You might also look ahead to the “<a title="Genres of Horror" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/genres-of-horror" data-content-chunk-id="1735f3c6-4373-4d74-aaf2-debfd6414e2d">Genres of Horror</a>” section to see if any of these types of horror seem right for your Darklord. Then consider the following questions.</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="8fdfa62f-882f-4019-b880-defbad6bf51e">
<li data-content-chunk-id="cd6a3fb6-6988-4628-9d4d-7796e6c9362c">Where was the Darklord before the Mists took them?</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="112113b1-f783-40bf-b0d2-00201aab2ba5">Darklords aren’t misunderstood souls condemned through no fault of their own. If a person’s potential for evil is particularly great, the Dark Powers might indirectly nurture further transgression, but they don’t force individuals to undertake actions against their will. When an evildoer’s wickedness ripens, the Dark Powers engulf them forever.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="22c13aed-14bd-4bce-9c36-0c4eb425dedc"> When creating your Darklord, consider the depth of their greatest evil and what made it more significant, abominable, or poetic than more common forms of villainy. The following elements all might be aspects of this corruption:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="157e303e-ae9e-41ba-b9c1-fae0a71d3214"><strong>Evil Acts.</strong> The Dark Powers consider an act to be evil if it is intentional, unnecessary, and successful, and most importantly, if it causes significant harm. Accidents, self-defense, deeds necessary for survival, and forced or coerced actions do not qualify. Early in the character’s creation, consider what evils your Darklord performed, and revisit these crimes as you develop the villain’s other details.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a49b81ba-f927-4418-97b1-8c80daae9910"><strong>Those Harmed.</strong> The people the Darklord harmed need to feel real. Give them names. Imbue them with agency, and don’t define them as victims or props. The people who survived the Darklord’s evil might be part of a Darklord’s history or allies who join the players’ characters, or might hold the key to righting the Darklord’s wrongs. For each character, consider whether they were important to the Darklord and how that relationship changed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ecdc5746-cd37-40e7-95a9-5f448d696481"><strong>Irredeemable.</strong> Once the Dark Powers take an evil person, that individual’s fate is sealed. Before the final corruption, a person can atone—but only if they take genuine responsibility, heal the harm caused, and reform to prevent future harm. Once an evildoer becomes a Darklord, it is far too late. Consider whether your Darklord had a chance to redeem themself and the decision that led to their current fate.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e766a655-729e-4122-883e-6e7479352cc3">Darklords are villains because of what they choose to do, not because of who they were. As you refine your idea for a Darklord, determine what deeds a Darklord committed, who was harmed, how the Dark Powers encouraged them, and the price the Darklord paid. Describe why they chose to commit these evil acts, including their ideals, flaws, and bonds.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0fdc1543-346c-4a59-b8ef-865eb045087d"> Consider these questions when creating your Darklord’s backstory:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="3b08c5d2-da6a-4710-a3d1-953da13e70c8">
<li data-content-chunk-id="a8a9f1df-2edc-435d-8e3f-02ea6292801b">What was the first depraved act the Darklord chose to commit, and how did their ideal encourage them down this path?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="81578498-bd13-4654-adc2-73edb792a54a">Was the Darklord rewarded or celebrated for their evil? Did that reaction encourage greater crimes? Were these rewards earned or justified?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="e3f0ad77-baaa-42fa-ba5a-4e70792d4603">Did the Darklord repeat or escalate their wickedness to obtain something they selfishly desired?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="6201077b-b1ab-44d4-a659-2a6d94456a8c">Did the future Darklord realize that they were losing any hope of redemption, yet choose to commit other heinous acts in keeping with their flaw?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="6d358a9f-aa30-4d3e-963b-d247df72c738">What evil act was so atrocious that the future Darklord’s friends and family rejected them? Did the Darklord think this was warranted or an unreasonable judgment? How did they react?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="de36f7ee-0aef-4857-b107-5692a883f55b">When and how did these acts attract the attention of the Dark Powers?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="921b3899-b463-4882-8e90-c98af7980505">How did the Dark Powers use these acts to craft the perfect prison domain for the Darklord?</li>
</ul>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f55c9f5e-0594-4c39-b4e8-618e1531d91b">Some Darklords have features that make them similar to familiar monsters. The Darklord might have been a supernatural creature to begin with, or perhaps they gained their form and related powers through their deeds or a curse. Maybe they even gained supernatural abilities via a pact with the Dark Powers or upon arriving in their domain.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ab67a5c5-9306-40d1-8a1c-87f29ab0e6db"> Consider whether or not your Darklord has a monstrous form. If so, in a few sentences, describe how the Darklord gained this form. You might also roll or choose an option from the Monstrous Transformations table to provide a twist on a Darklord’s monstrousness. The Dark Gifts in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/dark-gifts" title="chapter 1" data-content-chunk-id="0c2be023-f726-427b-9907-2d21d7801876">chapter 1</a> serve as examples of the sorts of forms and powers a Darklord might possess. In any case, consider how this transformation embodies the Darklord’s evil.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f727addb-b8ac-476d-be76-f42f53d216e4">Upon the completion of the Darklord’s greatest irredeemable act, the Mists drag them—and perhaps the lands around them—into the Domains of Dread. At this point, you should have an idea of who your Darklord is, what they did, what form their evil takes, and how they came to the attention of the Dark Powers. Flesh out these details, referring back to how the Darklord reflects your players’ characters and the section on <a title="creating nonplayer characters" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters" data-content-chunk-id="10015433-82a3-489e-b1d4-8833ead3c85a">creating nonplayer characters</a> in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg" title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" data-content-chunk-id="454935f1-73f4-44d1-9658-6826757ee323">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a> as you desire.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="dec34c12-2173-457b-aea8-979c3ea643a2">The guidelines in this section help you create your own unique Domain of Dread. This setting’s details should reflect the Darklord of the domain, being a reflection of that villain’s evil and torment. Use the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/genres-of-horror" title="Genres of Horror" data-content-chunk-id="82a56038-856d-4855-848b-44a4fbd7f53e">Genres of Horror</a>” section later in this chapter or your own grim imaginings to inspire the details of your nightmare domain.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="844d1e95-4791-4b0b-b92e-9e2f767cc341">A Darklord lurks at the heart of every Domain of Dread. Everything in their realm is inspired by or personalized to them in some way. Some domains might be dismal ruins reflective of past glories, others might be cheery realms where the Darklord is forever an outsider, and still others might embody everything a Darklord once strove for and be awful nonetheless.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a5c7eea6-60c3-4860-a01c-5562057fa537"> A Darklord’s domain often includes sights, sounds, and smells that serve as constant painful reminders of the Darklord’s wicked past. To start creating your domain, choose three of the evil acts your Darklord committed. Consider selecting those that best complement the players’ characters and that don’t conflict with any boundaries discussed in your group’s session zero (see “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures/#PreparingforHorror" title="Preparing for Horror" data-content-chunk-id="4e3b87b2-10a4-4eea-a226-6c7e90910411">Preparing for Horror</a>” in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures" title="chapter 4" data-content-chunk-id="551356f8-f482-4abf-ad58-f695a9da3c65">chapter 4</a>). For each evil act, imagine the scene where it took place, and then answer the following questions:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="017569c0-7384-4028-96ae-2aabf6f0ccef">
<li data-content-chunk-id="75671ac1-084f-469e-9c2a-fec4cf79c39b">What does the act sound like from a distance or to someone in the next room?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="cc40c2a5-171a-4eee-9df1-8326999f8a48">How does the act, or its consequences, smell?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a5beb4bc-9365-4ed3-9b60-8c754a49016a">What colors demand attention from the surroundings, decor, or aftermath?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="f01015ef-7cfc-4572-b2ab-2b23421e6b04">What shapes, symbols, or decorations stand out?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="fbbe17f0-6f80-4330-b10c-a6c8994dcbdf">What does the light or darkness hide or reveal?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="4f1c0b4d-d936-4a3c-b3c1-9d836a4ebe0a">Are there any sudden or subtle movements one’s eyes are drawn to?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a3e2cbfd-2892-4ad5-97b2-02a21b81eac4">Who is there?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="9470412a-9cd6-488d-8017-014a33fba018">How are they breathing?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a2733654-c7f2-4efb-8e5b-371889b31ea4">What are they feeling or thinking? Is it about this scene or something else entirely?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="e3ae3839-75b9-4cd3-9b46-06376330d8f6">Are words spoken? Are they relevant to the scene or unrelated?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="edc8d4f5-1fb9-48a3-a989-1c5f1bad1a0b">Where does this take place?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="18818aaf-6b4c-4848-990a-e702b1dae293">When the scene is over, what evidence remains?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="6eaf6761-fa06-4aef-bb7a-9700285f4f97">Before this unfortunate scene happens, what warnings were missed or foreshadowed?</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e2d86fe-9efe-4086-a5f3-58c2c8150b8d">Once you’ve considered these questions, write down your answers and review them. Mark or highlight the words that resonate or feel creepily evocative. As you proceed through domain creation, refer back to these details for inspiration.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="EndlessTorment" data-content-chunk-id="ccd020fa-4d7e-4ad9-bd03-24129115f4b4"><a href="#EndlessTorment" data-content-chunk-id="b097f4c2-4caa-4cc9-9fcc-34174cbd5023"></a>Endless Torment</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="27ff30ea-4922-459c-81c0-17c7dd034adb">In every domain, instruments of suffering from the Darklord’s past ensure their greatest desire remains in view but ever out of reach. Even though a Darklord is effectively immortal, their psychology never changes and their wounds never heal. Consider the following reasons why a Darklord’s torment remains unignorable and central to a domain’s story:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="33848b79-a17f-479d-99f2-004682fa6a77"><strong>Deathless Returns.</strong> Those who die in a domain return reincarnated, fated to repeat a version of their former lives.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a963b764-36e7-4f5d-969d-e77ea9718178"><strong>Endless Cycles.</strong> The Darklord shepherds another individual down a path of corruption in hopes of crafting a successor or recreating someone they lost. Despite the Darklord’s perceived care and tutelage, the object of their attention never satisfies their expectations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="34ba4df1-5596-44e6-8efc-f50d792444b9"><strong>Last Gasp.</strong> An impending threat is on the cusp of overwhelming the Darklord and their domain. They can never look away as they are endlessly assaulted by cascading catastrophes, ever stemming from past choices.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c822e1e-6864-43ef-b69d-e5da42ac8587"><strong>Obstinate Ignorance.</strong> The Darklord is cursed to be unable to learn from past mistakes or perceive their own failings, though they’re convinced that this time will be different.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="125015e8-598b-427a-b9c1-1aef0c41f446"><strong>Shocking Reminders.</strong> The domain is drowning in symbolic reminders of the Darklord’s inadequacies. When symbolism is too subtle, the literal specters from the Darklord’s past return to haunt them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b33fc0c8-7333-43e3-87ae-814e5706f5ae"><strong>Unpleasant Hope.</strong> The Darklord’s desire—commonly their bond—is present and obvious, but still unattainable. This instills hope in the Darklord that they are unable to deny, resist, or ignore. Furthermore, they are overcome by their desire’s presence, spurring them to act irrationally.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cfa35a50-59ca-4a30-960f-b08d0915a4d6">The domain’s buildings, natural elements, and landmarks all represent the Darklord’s vile past. When developing these features, follow these steps:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="95b51c9b-65be-463c-8602-5ae3d8404a71"><strong>Specify Locations.</strong> Choose locations similar to settings that appear in your Darklord’s past, or take inspiration from the Settings tables in the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/genres-of-horror" title="Genres of Horror" data-content-chunk-id="8f5e9443-041c-416f-9b93-213ceeb7687a">Genres of Horror</a>” section later in this chapter.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4c9e73ad-144a-4461-a941-a9adb942e24f"><strong>Combine Locations and Visceral Details.</strong> In a few sentences, describe how the domain’s most prominent locations are twisted with suggestions that arose from answering the questions in the “<a title="Darklords Shadows" href="#DarklordsShadows" data-content-chunk-id="67672f06-20f5-49ed-83c0-ae4205f204c9">Darklord’s Shadows</a>” section. Pair opposites together, something creepy with something cute, dead with alive, threatening with welcoming. Mix details together in unexpected ways, the more unnatural or off-putting the better.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="231d9ee6-0202-46d0-889f-8e521c6e8306"><strong>Rationalize and Normalize.</strong> Outline the justifications inhabitants use to pretend nothing is wrong. What could reasonably explain their surreal experiences? They claim rivers of blood are crimson due to natural clay deposits, the devilish lights in the swamp are nothing but swamp gas, and the current reclusive count is the descendant of the region’s original reclusive count. Many of the domain’s inhabitants are likely creations of the Dark Powers and the domain is the only reality they know, but what logical and psychological leaps might an outsider need to make to sleep at night?</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CulturalSpecifics" data-content-chunk-id="391795fd-9984-43f2-92b4-c729f6eecfaa"><a href="#CulturalSpecifics" data-content-chunk-id="f3f345a2-2dab-4cb2-b958-a5b8304f9ff7"></a>Cultural Specifics</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="51ad6c8c-0dfa-42e5-81ba-084df50ed3f1">As you develop your domain, consider the culture and how it emerges from this tragic setting. What might be most unsettling for the Darklord: if the culture is one with familiar strictures, one they opposed or were an outsider in, or something completely unknown or alien to them? While a domain’s culture might take inspirations from fantastical or historical examples, remember that a domain isn’t a functional or even logical construction. Domains are glimpses into the Darklord’s static and often exaggerated or flawed perception of a time, place, or situation. A domain’s inhabitants never develop, and they never reach their goals. A domain’s oppressive inquisition is no closer to rooting out evil today than it was a thousand years ago. This isn’t remarkable; it merely is as it has always been, and forces within a domain contort to maintain this status quo.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f132ae3a-76c6-47da-a639-645ef5220a8b"> For inspiration into your domain’s culture, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="d8cf69f6-fa44-4a10-bf4c-117a34ee033d">
<li data-content-chunk-id="ecf2adc3-c876-49b5-ad36-f5b041b73078">What does the culture fear?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="1035a5bb-cad9-4e4f-af87-46f3cc873fc0">What does the culture consider taboo?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="6e4d2ad8-f172-4aeb-b73c-1c66c8b372ff">What is scarce, and how do inhabitants compensate for this scarcity?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="be8e5e80-68d9-4362-9927-1e16181c24a5">Who or what does the culture inflict harm upon?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="1e3c728b-21ee-4b29-849a-30a87aa971c2">How does the culture treat outsiders?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="29eb91c3-5936-430b-8120-b193125a1a53">What values does the culture hold that not everyone abides by?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="ca7d8045-7598-4316-a572-d8a05a448b7d">How is the culture exaggerated, a parody, or otherwise unrealistic?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="15993e02-c826-4bca-8c70-66583907dbcb">How does the culture prevent change?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="34f96b47-4ecc-4d93-a18d-c770fb437edf">What is the general attitude toward the Darklord?</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fcf8fd74-7492-4c82-8a09-35aef7a8f574">Don’t get bogged down with the particulars of a working society. It doesn’t matter how a village in a domain of endless night grows crops, but it does matter that the supplies are about to run out. These details can fade into the background as your adventures focus on more exciting threats, or you can highlight the cosmic dread that declares, yes, this place doesn’t make sense at all, yet it persists.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="85585cd0-263c-47c9-b6ab-5074c0788dfd"> For a specific example, consider the domain of Barovia in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/barovia" title="chapter 3" data-content-chunk-id="773ef842-ea95-488c-9f43-1e73762a194d">chapter 3</a>. Not one villager in Barovia thinks it’s wise to live in the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, and yet the villagers don’t relocate, nor can they imagine living anywhere else. Life is as it’s always been and could never be better, but it’s constantly threatened with becoming worse.</p>

In a few sentences, describe which monsters best represent the Darklord’s evil and which might work against the Darklord’s schemes. For example, a wicked scientist Darklord might be aided by flesh golems and crawling claws, but they are opposed by dryads and ghosts who suffer from the Darklord’s experiments.

Once you know your Darklord and the general shape of their domain, consider the types of encounters and adventures that play out in this land. For inspiration, refer to the Plots tables in the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/genres-of-horror" title="Genres of Horror" data-content-chunk-id="d23bf47a-a02e-407e-905d-874978c5fbe1">Genres of Horror</a>” section later in this chapter, and consider the following story elements.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7496cc6a-083b-4ba9-b0aa-2a4152267e50"><strong>Captive Audience.</strong> Determine some aspect of the domain or Darklord that captures the characters’ attention. How is this matter urgent and time-sensitive? What can the heroes learn that points them to larger threats or the Darklord’s past? How does this threat connect to the Darklord seeking their desires? Consider who might need the characters’ aid and might guide them to deeper mysteries.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cedcc21b-3309-484c-a9f8-362ae6d6509c"><strong>Detail Key Locations.</strong> Briefly describe distinct locations suitable for adventure, where the heroes confront the Darklord’s threats.

<p data-content-chunk-id="28d9a101-ff82-4fe5-b7a6-8e9f3c052fa3"><strong>Supporting Cast.</strong> Consider what types of characters support the Darklord, exacerbate their threat, or oppose them. How do characters take the Darklord’s situation from bad to worse, whether as fanatical supporters or tragic victims? Write down three types of characters who are aligned with the Darklord and three who aren’t. Sketch out these characters broadly, perhaps noting only their professions or roles in adventures. You can expand on their details as your adventures take shape.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01bbc89c-3f37-4099-b369-fa8be4266360"><strong>Entangling the Heroes.</strong> The Darklord might instantly sense visitors entering their domain, while the heroes have no reliable means of identifying the Darklord. Describe why the Darklord is interested in the characters. The Darklord Connections table provides examples of such connections.</p>

As you review your notes, consider where you can make connections between elements, establish recurring themes, and potentially foreshadow circumstances your adventures will focus on. Don’t feel like you need to have answers for every question your Darklord or domain raises; many of these details can be defined as your adventures play out or by focusing on elements your players gravitate toward.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ecd42464-7d9c-412b-933d-96f4f994cdf7">Protean apocalypses scar the impossible vistas of Bluetspur, and none who witness them remember. This alien domain etches itself not upon the waking mind, but rather upon the body as inexplicable scars and on the psyche through nightmares.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6f5ab057-7da2-48e9-ae83-471c5d25688b">Not all the Domains of Dread are drawn from worlds hospitable to life. Bluetspur’s scale and impossible geometry induce instinctual anxiety. Gaseous tempests whirl upon the hooked peaks of gravity-defying mountains, oily spires twist in semi-organic contortions, caustic fumaroles yawn and snap shut hungrily, and above it all hangs a dying red orb. Little can survive this wasteland, which is why Bluetspur’s masters dwell underground.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4e3afb53-71e0-4301-b4e8-4d8b47cd4477">Beneath the alien surface, the mind flayers of Bluetspur drift through the howling darkness of their ancient metropolis-laboratory. Within this sprawling installation, the illithids’ numbers are few and their tentacles twitch with undisguised urgency. They toil to prevent the unthinkable: their primordial leader, the God-Brain of Bluetspur, is dying. Through these end times, the mind flayers work desperately to reconcile their god’s demented whims even as they struggle to delay its demise. To those ends, their tentacles slip through the Mists to drag unwitting souls back to Bluetspur for all manner of experiments. Many abductees are returned with only psychic scars, while others are never seen again. An unlucky few find themselves set upon strange routes leading back to the alien realm, arriving only to realize they’ve visited Bluetspur before.</p>

<li data-content-chunk-id="ef24afba-6a8e-44c7-ae12-67c8c6bcf91b">The land’s surface is a lethal, alien place, scattered with the ruins of long-extinct civilizations.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d479fbf2-2115-46a5-bc1c-29cf420cdb90">The surface of Bluetspur is vast, spanning a continent-sized region that is hostile to all but the most tenacious forms of life. Due to the endless assault of supernatural weather and earthquakes, civilization—as defined by the illithids—exists entirely below the ground. The Mists encroach even here, filling shadowed chasms and abandoned corridors. While the mind flayers have their own ways of describing the realm’s features, the half-lucid ramblings of those who dream of the domain stretch to name and relate several prominent sites.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MountMakab" data-content-chunk-id="1d442dce-9426-40fc-a898-638e18b183bd"><a href="#MountMakab" data-content-chunk-id="01a92fc8-71ba-442e-8ba1-4c1567544862"></a>Mount Makab</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6f8d81fc-7e92-4504-a1a3-2c20d1cd95a3">Calling Makab a mountain is a wild misnomer; it is a malignant deformation on a planetary scale, a spire with no apparent summit. Its contorted slopes stretch into the toxic heavens, and its form occupies the periphery of viewers’ attention no matter which direction they look.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="30d3e6d7-c927-44b5-81d2-28c16039a713">Mount Makab is not a natural feature, but rather part of a colossal, illithid-designed device. Its purposes remain largely mysterious to outsiders, but one thing is certain: it amplifies psionic energy, allowing Bluetspur’s mind flayers to project their thoughts into other Domains of Dread.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CitadelSubterrene" data-content-chunk-id="591e4072-4b33-43bc-8d2c-00b9311a9f60"><a href="#CitadelSubterrene" data-content-chunk-id="952fcde8-e88d-4e25-9e2f-be09908d6e76"></a>Citadel Subterrene</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3c8af10e-6637-42f9-bbc4-b9010a7662c0">Below Mount Makab stretches the hive-like lair of the illithids. This mind flayer metropolis comprises innumerable interconnected compounds—laboratory vaults, custom prison-habitats, intellect devourer preserves, incubation domes, brain-filled synapse libraries, testing hippodromes, surgical theaters, and facilities that beggar rational description. Non-illithids find travel within the citadel maddening, like trying to find a specific point within a writhing knot of worms. Locations are inaccessible to creatures reliant upon basic terrestrial mobility or without the ability to access psionically controlled mechanisms. Entering Citadel Subterrene is simple, though, as fissures across Bluetspur, particularly upon Mount Makab, lead within.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheChamberoftheGodBrain" data-content-chunk-id="3bbe3a77-127a-4749-b3ad-fce7df083741"><a href="#TheChamberoftheGodBrain" data-content-chunk-id="21f1ceb5-14cd-47f5-ae12-ed4d42c72e3c"></a>The Chamber of the God-Brain</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="35c39801-645b-4262-9787-1dd7cd781221">The Chamber of the God-Brain rests miles below Citadel Subterrene. The cathedral-like chamber is roughly ovoid in shape, with walls of gleaming, organic metal. The massive God-Brain trembles in a pool of medicinal brine and experimental chemicals capable of dissolving most other creatures. The massive, alien brain’s affliction is clear from the leaking holes pocking its deep-wrinkled lobes. Illithid attendants in eerie protective garb endlessly attend to their dying overlord and indulge even its most blasphemous schemes, such as the creation of <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/1680955-vampiric-mind-flayer" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/1680955-tooltip">vampiric mind flayers</a> (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/monsters-of-ravenloft#VampiricMindFlayer" title="chapter 5" data-content-chunk-id="0e1260d1-47fd-4c7a-ad6e-ca5fbf5ff2de">chapter 5</a>).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="059d314a-bb88-4ebd-9979-42c961b15ade">Mount Grysl’s polypous spires once served as a secondary installation of the domain’s resident mind flayers, but the residents rebelled against the God-Brain’s self-serving obsessions. As one might amputate an infected limb, the God-Brain cut off Mount Grysl from its psychic network. The abandoned residents largely succumbed to infighting and each other’s amoral experiments. The spirits of these tormented mind flayers remain within Mount Grysl, as does the rebellion’s leader: a bloated deviant that calls itself the High Master and seeks to undermine the God-Brain.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheGodBrain" data-content-chunk-id="4488fd07-14c5-496e-ac95-c86ded981d59"><a href="#TheGodBrain" data-content-chunk-id="30fd038e-4554-418d-8a36-524d28647c70"></a>The God-Brain</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fd763a54-4992-4664-9c1d-c908ab026ebd">The scope of what mind flayers call history exists on a cosmic scale. Through ages of empire and conflict, the illithid elder brains indulged experiments without comparison or reference for lesser beings, explorations beyond the boundaries of time, reality, immortality, and the multiverse. Many failed—at least one catastrophically so.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f9a68752-63ed-4a9b-a818-0ea9521a5900">To summarize an eon of atrocities, one elder brain’s reality-bending research had an unexpected result, revealing to it a malignant truth for which existence was unprepared. Guided by this burgeoning revelation, the elder brain turned and preyed upon its peers, consuming their discoveries and their physical forms to fuel an impossible apotheosis. Ultimately, though, the weight of the elder brain’s deeds caused its own physicality to rebel, giving rise to an alien disease that began devouring its fleshy form. Horrified by an affliction that infected only them, the other elder brains united and psionically expelled the diseased brain from existence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="96ec1bcf-bad2-4679-ad7a-3eddca8ea551">Or so they thought.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fcefc32b-9083-46f6-9e06-37fad6141708">From a place without time or reality, the Dark Powers plucked the dying elder brain and planted it upon a tormented world. Ever since, the God-Brain of Bluetspur has dreamed and desperately indulged ever more demented schemes as it seeks to save its own life and give action to a thought alien even to it.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheGodBrainsPowersandDominion" data-content-chunk-id="64421d6f-c148-4d2a-b7a8-9a4dfddef0be"><a href="#TheGodBrainsPowersandDominion" data-content-chunk-id="6146c8ae-9be6-4e23-a1a5-2bf7124a3d2d"></a>The God-Brain’s Powers and Dominion</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="05efd469-04c7-48e3-a212-b90a6bd8b7c3">The God-Brain is more akin to a physical location or massive object than a creature. Its droves of servants are more direct threats than the inscrutable Darklord itself.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5d1aefd8-90d7-45de-aa99-286d80b184b7"><em><strong>Overmind.</strong></em> The God-Brain commands untold numbers of <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17104-mind-flayer" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17104-tooltip">mind flayers</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17163-intellect-devourer" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17163-tooltip">intellect devourers</a>, and other creatures. Within Bluetspur, it is constantly telepathically linked with all its servants and knows anything that they know. The God-Brain delegates broad goals to its most effective servants, encouraging them to indulge all manner of radical experiments.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="df9a9d9f-6c4e-4810-b459-90a22edf64b1"><em><strong>Mist Vibrations.</strong></em> Through the awesome psychic resonances of Mount Makab, the God-Brain can guide any of its servants or other psychically aligned minds through the Mists to Bluetspur. In effect, it provides a vision or dream of the domain that itself functions as a <a title="Mist talisman" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/domains-of-ravenloft#MistTalismans" data-content-chunk-id="05018fe6-91d9-4f4d-ba81-3f25ebd16683">Mist talisman</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d0b76192-0fff-4a91-9fcb-ef542f48341b"><em><strong>Life Support.</strong></em> The illithids of Bluetspur toil to save their elder brain through all manner of outlandish scientific and medical means. Among the most bizarre of these schemes is the God-Brain’s own: the creation of degenerate servants that hunt for balms for its affliction. These <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/1680955-vampiric-mind-flayer" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/1680955-tooltip">vampiric mind flayers</a> (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/monsters-of-ravenloft" title="chapter 5" data-content-chunk-id="48b3ea81-c3ce-4269-8589-8e5c2e77e9ad">chapter 5</a>) slip from Bluetspur to prey upon Humanoids. They then return to the God-Brain, bloated with cerebrospinal fluid to momentarily dull its suffering.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e60feee1-4236-4036-8e3a-89c35c64fd00"><em><strong>Closing the Borders.</strong></em> When the God-Brain closes Bluetspur’s borders, the surface of the domain is wracked by extreme electrical storms, and alien vapors rise at the domain’s distant edges and within its hidden tunnels. Rather than barring creatures’ escape, these Mists repress memories. Any non-Aberration who leaves Bluetspur is transported to a familiar place where they soon wake up, even if they weren’t previously asleep. Their time in Bluetspur is repressed, altered as if by the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2196-modify-memory" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2196-tooltip">modify memory</a> spell. See “<a href="#RecoveringMemories" title="Recovering Memories" data-content-chunk-id="1669cdd9-719f-4c46-9345-48dad2a1fd17">Recovering Memories</a>” below for more details.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8f73a16d-cef1-44ab-969b-ecce8614fbd5">The God-Brain of Bluetspur is an entirely unreliable cosmic entity, an immortal inflicted with mortality. Although its death is likely still millennia away, this inevitability leads it to hastily indulge all manner of amoral extremes.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RoleplayingtheGodBrain" data-content-chunk-id="56af5a1c-f4e3-4b83-90b4-fb447c077805"><a href="#RoleplayingtheGodBrain" data-content-chunk-id="0cc3232b-568f-4a40-b7fe-3576e9706ee2"></a>Roleplaying the God-Brain</h3>

<p data-content-chunk-id="83194e6b-e7ad-4cae-90cb-224e48025449">While Bluetspur’s otherworldly hazards and the mind flayers’ defenses can challenge even the highest-level heroes, the domain’s menace proves most pernicious when it intrudes on other domains. Taking inspiration from sci-fi horror and tales of alien abduction, adventures involving Bluetspur’s mind flayers might begin anywhere with bad dreams or a stranger’s impossible rantings. Over time, disappearances, inexplicable scars, subdermal implants, and unlocked memories might reveal the mind flayers’ tentacles enwrap more than anyone thought possible.

<p data-content-chunk-id="d5da3fad-e81f-4f83-8376-3319fe19769f">Knowing that secrets lurk within one’s own mind holds unique terror. When running adventurers featuring hidden memories, consider how those memories might be revealed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f74af78f-5c3c-4a29-9e0e-b4ce6e2171c6"><em><strong>Magical Recovery.</strong></em> Both the mind flayers of Bluetspur and the Mists surrounding the domain employ methods similar to the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2196-modify-memory" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2196-tooltip">modify memory</a> spell to obscure victims’ memories of their abduction, replacing them with hazy events or gaps of missing time. A character’s true memories can be restored by a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2229-tooltip">remove curse</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2129-greater-restoration" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2129-tooltip">greater restoration</a> spell. A victim of the mind flayers might have endured dozens of memory modifications, each requiring its own magical removal, resulting in the recovery of a few traumatic memories at a time.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="79df2673-be81-4dca-923d-c8c1623e48d2"><em><strong>Alienism.</strong></em> Scientifically curious lands in your campaign might feature burgeoning practitioners of alienism or psychiatry. Inexperienced practitioners of these disciplines merge scientific treatments, spiritualism, magic, and hokum, yet still obtain results. A session or series of sessions with a committed alienist might allow a character to remember a forgotten event. By the same token, though, time spent with a duplicitous alienist might leave a character vulnerable to suggestion and false memories. Such revelations can play out in your adventures narratively at any pace you desire.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="374146dd-66e5-41a8-93c3-b6bbbc52f8b5"><em><strong>Gradual Recovery. </strong></em>Lost memories might gradually reveal themselves in response to events in adventures. As the characters encounter evidence of Bluetspur’s mind flayers, consider giving individuals access to information they shouldn’t logically possess or granting them advantage on rolls related to their hidden memories, doled out as you deem appropriate. This might take the form of allowing the character to navigate an alien installation, operate an inscrutable device, or read an otherworldly language. Don’t explain why the character gains these benefits, though, and let them make their own explanations to other characters. Lost memories might also take the form of Dark Gifts (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/dark-gifts" title="dark gifts" data-content-chunk-id="9f8815cc-629b-448a-82e2-1ec79c70e881">chapter 1</a>).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="796298fa-cb9d-4f6f-ba64-545ded59303f">The most effective way to reveal characters’ missing memories is to revisit them as an adventure. Players might run lower-level versions of their characters or use the survivors from <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures#Survivors" title="chapter 4" data-content-chunk-id="b637b19f-033d-47d2-b88a-117dae4c8e71">chapter 4</a> to represent their past selves. Or characters might play forgotten versions of themselves—perhaps very different from who they are now—or individuals in the memories of another character. Run this adventure as an experience detached from your campaign’s timeline, a flashback that relates the terrors of being a victim of the mind flayers’ plots. Death likely doesn’t mean much in these adventures, as characters somehow survived to remember their traumas—perhaps through miraculous mind flayer surgeries. However, developments in the past can provide all manner of revelations, potentially unveiling terrifying truths hidden within characters’ own minds and bodies.</p>

Silver-tongued schemers use dreams and ambition to tempt innocents into debt, blackmail, and ruin, while furthering their rivalries or searching for decadent thrills. Guile and apathy are virtues in Borca, and none embody them more than the domain’s two Darklords: the genius poisoner Ivana Boritsi and the childishly cruel stalker Ivan Dilisnya.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="911a9fb8-2de2-4dca-8fca-cf7be3165431">Outside the bejeweled playgrounds of the land’s elite, Borca’s common folk struggle against crime, poverty, and starvation. In scattered villages and tenement-filled cities, locals view nobles as celebrities, and their idealized vision of noble life leads them to mimic the aristocrats’ callousness and appetite for empty fads. These starry-eyed innocents provide ready pawns for corruption. And those who don’t bend to the whims of Borca’s rulers face humiliation before they’re inevitably crushed.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="af93f538-7541-470b-8b1e-3a55c1fe886a">Those familiar with Borca know the following facts:</p><ul data-content-chunk-id="e53b61ba-41b0-4da3-ae29-e88235e1871b">
<li data-content-chunk-id="8fa2a1b9-9f30-4c4f-b148-b966c425fc39">Powerful families control the government, commerce, and entertainment in Borca. The Boritsi family holds the greatest influence.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="b20baadb-9568-4283-a203-ae98efe7bdc5">Borcan noble families include a dominant main family and lesser branch lineages. Branch noble families (sometimes with different surnames) are subservient to the main family.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="764a9f71-1495-4667-a05e-90c499991a08">Each noble family maintains an estate with village-sized holdings nearby. These estates are testaments to the family’s prestige, fortune, and hidden secrets.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="d6bfed5b-4c70-4cce-8354-a1e4902da5cc">The common folk live in rural villages that serve noble interests or in crowded cities. Most either avoid entanglements with powerful but fickle nobles or desperately court their favor.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="592793ca-314f-422f-a080-3c014607ecf4">Culture and prestige in Borca reach their height in the fabulous city of Levkarest. At its heart rises the Great Cathedral of the god Ezra.</li>

<p>BORCAN CHARACTERS</p>
<p>Characters from Borca might be members of a decadent noble family or struggling peasants. In either case, much of the populace possesses dark hair and varied skin tones with cool undertones. Names often take inspiration from German, Slavic, and more fantastical conventions. When players create characters from Borca, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>Do you come from a noble family?</strong> If so, are you in contact with any of its other members? Whom do you love or serve in your family? If you don’t, why do people mistake you for nobility?</p>
<p><strong>How have you enriched a noble family?</strong> Have you invested in a noble’s business? Does a percentage of your pay go toward an inescapable debt? Does an arranged marriage loom in your future?</p>
<p><strong> Whom have you hurt?</strong> In your family’s struggles, your attempts to get ahead, or your desire to impress an acquaintance, you’ve done someone a significant wrong. What was it? Why did you do it? Do you regret it?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a7eb8271-4656-4533-befa-fed5d2964036">Most of Borca’s people live in small agricultural communities under the rule of noble landlords, or in poverty in the larger settlements of Lechberg, Levkarest, or Sturben. Nobles keep country homes among the nation’s forests or rolling hills, well apart from the common rabble. Mobility between country and town is a luxury of the wealthy, making horses and coaches symbols of prestige.</p><figure id="MapMap32borca" class="compendium-image"><a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-center" href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/map-3.2-borca.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title=""><img src="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/map-3.2-borca.png" class="ddb-lightbox-inner compendium-center-banner-img" style="width: 850px;" alt=""></a><figcaption>Map 3.2: borca <a class="ddb-lightbox-outer" href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/map-3.2-borca-player.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title="View Player Version">View Player Version</a></figcaption></figure>

<p data-content-chunk-id="30ba7502-2855-4a96-8a8a-7981ad34e8ca">Borca’s capital stands at the pinnacle of culture and power. Unpopular members of the noble families squabble in the halls of the People’s Parliament, the land’s ineffective seat of government. The true rulers of the nation conduct business in the offices of faceless mercantile ventures and the back rooms of avant-garde clubs. The commoners of Levkarest glimpse this world of toxic glamor only from afar, or when nobles exploit street-level fads.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="99d07da6-ec89-41fa-aac9-5b073785af26">Beyond the nobles’ elaborate rivalries, another force moves in Levkarest. At the Great Cathedral, pious commoners and aristocrats alike beg for the favor of the deity Ezra, but in the catacombs beneath the cathedral, a hidden cell of the Ulmist Inquisition meets. This society cultivates psionic prowess to undermine the evil in people’s souls before it comes to fruition. Yet despite its ties to heroes and vast lore, the society finds its numbers dwindling. (See “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/travelers-in-the-mists#OtherGroups" title="Other Groups" data-content-chunk-id="5e7a8722-bdee-43f9-8c86-b63ed769cec9">Other Groups</a>” later in this chapter for details.)</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="837e5176-baf5-444c-abbb-673ec915e4fc">Remarkably, when the town of Ilvin burned, no lives were lost. Rather than rebuilding, the seven hundred survivors moved their homes a few miles east and founded New Ilvin. This sleepy community seems ordinary in every way, but residents avoid speaking of Old Ilvin and never return, going so far as to pave a new road to avoid the burned-out ruins.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f96e68e5-a2a0-4d2a-91b5-b23fb2c22565">Long considered Levkarest’s unfashionable shadow, the city of Sturben has become a haven for those seeking distance from the domain’s elite. To counter the half-hearted justice doled out by local nobles, the city council of Sturben reinstituted a severe court system from Borca’s past, where anyone can bring and argue cases before five masked judges. The judges who hear cases at the Faceless Court change, but their masks remain the same: grimly ornate visages inspired by Borca’s mysterious first inhabitants. The court sends iron-masked circuit judges into the surrounding lands to execute justice. For especially contentious cases, judges imprison all involved and drag them to Sturben to face trial.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MisericordiaandOtherNobleEstates" data-content-chunk-id="72e70ff9-b0b6-4db0-938d-5e29b27ad897"><a href="#MisericordiaandOtherNobleEstates" data-content-chunk-id="5ddaa437-dc7d-4b9e-8af7-ec62b12e990c"></a>Misericordia and Other Noble Estates</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d6941f98-7734-4e63-b6e6-e0486a006993">Each of the domain’s prominent families maintains an opulent and extravagantly named manor, as noted on the Noble Families and Estates table. Following the custom of Borcan high society, each family is expected to host at least two formal balls, banquets, or other extravagances annually. These events provide the setting for intrigues, politics, business arrangements, seductions, embarrassments, and social warfare. (See the “<a href="#NoblesofBorca" title="Nobles of Borca" data-content-chunk-id="a00fb63d-dabe-482e-9305-bf311e383631">Nobles of Borca</a>” section for more on these families.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2e5e5c8a-18e3-44c4-abf8-f657b42ef974">Among the most decadent noble holdings is Misericordia, the Boritsi estate. Situated amid miles of fields, greenhouses, and alchemy labs used to create exceptional Boritsi-branded perfumes and tinctures, the manor features multiple widow’s walks and more than three hundred rooms. An awe-inspiring array of unique plants grows within the estate’s private conservatory wings. The distillates from these plants furnish the lady of the house, Ivana Boritsi, with a room-sized perfume organ—along with a hidden, parallel collection of remarkable poisons.</p>

<p>DOMAIN WITH TWO DARKLORDS</p>
<p>Ivana Boritsi and Ivan Dilisnya are coequal rulers of Borca. As they both committed depraved crimes in the same land at the same time, the Dark Powers gathered them both into the Domains of Dread. Generally, though, Ivana and Ivan have little to do with one another. Their homes occupy opposite ends of the domain, and their interests rarely overlap—that is, until suitably intriguing characters arrive.</p>
<p>Ivana and Ivan are opposite sides of the same tarnished coin. Ivana fought for all she has and now loathes it; Ivan was given everything and believes he was denied what he deserves. Ivana is forced into society; Ivan thirsts for attention. Ivana appears perpetually youthful; Ivan bears the weight of ages.</p>
<p>Although your adventures might focus on either Darklord, Borca presents the opportunity to explore multiple facets of arrogance, selfishness, and obsession. The characters might become the objects of both Darklords’ interests. This could put them at the center of a rivalry between the two or provide them with the unique opportunity to leverage one Darklord’s power against another. An adventure in Borca doesn’t have to involve a conflict between its two Darklords, but if it does, consider putting the party at the center of it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="38197e38-5adb-43c5-ab8f-b7271a1088c5">The firstborn of the fantastically wealthy Boritsi aristocrats, Ivana was clever, poised, and—in her father Klaus’s eyes—utterly unfit to lead their family. Unwilling to accept her father’s view, Ivana spent her youth eschewing the dalliances of her kin, instead learning every aspect of her family’s business in perfumes and medicinal herbs. Her mother, Camille, encouraged her daughter and tried to ensure that Ivana would one day lead the family.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9db53aae-6a1d-452c-b1f8-11eb2e572f21">Ivana’s focus on her goals faltered when she met Pieter, a skilled chemist in the family’s service. From him, Ivana learned alchemy and the perfumer’s art, and the two grew close. Camille recognized Ivana’s budding romance and saw the lowborn Pieter as a threat to Ivana’s prospects. Camille thus seduced the young man and arranged for Ivana to discover them, intent on convincing her daughter to forsake this and all future romances.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d23ba4b4-c77d-40fd-b7ee-6f911343e425">Ivana took a different lesson from the experience. Realizing the depths of her family’s corruption, she poisoned her mother and her callous brothers, with the goal of forcing Klaus to name her his heir. Creating and employing a series of aromatic toxins, she watched her siblings and treacherous mother sicken and die. None suspected her involvement.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2091006f-d3d0-4cf8-8c73-18928783d716">On Ivana’s eighteenth birthday, the aged and ailing Klaus summoned her to his office to share a momentous decision. Having lost his sons, Klaus named Ivana’s cousin, Ivan Dilisnya, his heir. He had already announced his decision to the estate staff and sent a messenger to inform the Dilisnyas.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f71d2fe5-95eb-497c-afdf-40519b0fc409">Ivana only laughed as a toxic mist poured across the Boritsi estate. Having expected her father’s pettiness, she had manufactured a disaster that turned all the estate’s perfume into poison. Drinking the antidote, Ivana watched as Klaus and all the manor’s workers and inhabitants died choking amid a violet fog. By the time the poison cleared, the land of Borca had become surrounded by the Mists.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="56aa400f-9dc9-43fb-9bb9-469ed2913ab0">Ivana appears to be a young human woman with statistics similar to a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17021-spy" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17021-tooltip">spy</a>. Since her arrival in the Land of the Mists, her blood has been tainted with poison, and angry red-and-black veins visibly show through her pale skin. While this discoloration is unignorable, the toxins grant her immunity to poison damage and being <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/11-tooltip">poisoned</a>. Her genius and ambition define her manipulations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d21c3bc-6505-48d9-9971-cb3513d19168"><em><strong>Alchemical Innovator.</strong></em> By spending one uninterrupted hour within her laboratory at the Boritsi Estate, Ivana can create ten doses of any poison or re-create the effect of one wizard spell of 7th level or lower. She keeps a variety of poisons on hand at all times. See “<a href="#IntrigueinBorca" title="Intrigue in Borca" data-content-chunk-id="b8c4b451-b81f-4a65-8c90-e91775e29745">Intrigue in Borca</a>” later in this section for details on how Ivana uses alchemy in her manipulations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="854cf46a-f737-4f64-88fd-2d5cb788b478"><em><strong>Callous Genius.</strong></em> Ivana’s genius and cynicism, in combination with the Dark Powers’ aid, grant her insight into the nature of Borca’s people that borders on precognition. She’s always one step ahead of her rivals and has prepared the perfect situation, stand-in, or poison accordingly. However, Ivana has a facile understanding of true love and companionship, so those who behave in an unexpectedly selfless manner might undermine her elaborate contingencies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="315cf23b-97f4-401d-ba87-69af8fe26350"><em><strong>Gardens of Evil.</strong></em> Ivana delights in her gardens, both the exotic conservatories within the Boritsi Estate and the flower fields surrounding her manor. She has created innumerable unique plants, as well as plant creatures with strange abilities and unflagging loyalty to her.</p><a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-left" href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/03-006.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title=""><img src="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/03-006.png" class="ddb-lightbox-inner" style="width: 280px;" alt=""></a>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fb377a9a-04af-48f8-8811-f38fab3f8e2f"><em><strong>Tyrant Maker.</strong></em> Ivana’s ambition drives her to take on any challenge. She reflexively seeks political and financial control over all Borca, and casually manipulates the domain’s noble families into destroying one another.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a93eec0-bca9-4249-8f0c-af49c4ae164a"><em><strong>Closing the Borders.</strong></em> Ivana can close or open Borca’s borders once per day. She rarely closes the borders, as her manipulations typically prevent her victims from leaving. She might open or close the borders to confound the whims of her co-Darklord, Ivan, though. When she does close Borca’s borders, the Mists rise as a wall of acrid chemicals that affect creatures as detailed in “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/domains-of-ravenloft#TheMists" title="The Mists" data-content-chunk-id="a00d91b4-94f5-4eb6-8b1f-15bcf9b26144">The Mists</a>” section at the start of this chapter.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6f9e30f7-32a9-4d4c-96ab-542f705be480">Ivana conquered her rivals, yet still suffers. The following circumstances endlessly torment the Darklord:</p><ul data-content-chunk-id="c985bf80-36ba-4f5d-8ab8-b251eac4b785">
<li data-content-chunk-id="45aec893-bc0b-4a5d-9fc2-bf65bb6cef2a">Ivana has not aged since the Mists claimed Borca, and her youthful appearance leads many to underestimate her.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="ce20b844-1c83-451b-b7f3-52671ca804be">Ivana rules her family’s business and political empire brilliantly. Despite this, she is endlessly doubted and second guessed. Many believe she is a typical, vacant noble youth or the puppet of her elder cousin, Ivan Dilisnya.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="5b13ab10-cb10-4c1b-a4f1-4608a75e5041">Ivana’s genius and refinement lead her to grow swiftly bored of most potential allies and rivals. She ever seeks her equal in intellect and ambition, and she is ever disappointed. Maintaining her family’s vast array of social expectations is especially tedious.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="174f43f3-b5b9-4bc6-a45d-861a956df62d">Ivana never found her father’s will and knows that should it fall into the wrong hands, her depraved cousin Ivan could claim all she’s earned. She’ll do anything to prevent this.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c22d5f49-2cf2-492a-8c60-b81f226253f6">Ivana Boritsi’s exceptional mind and remarkable senses of hearing, taste, and smell inform her elevated fancies and expansive knowledge of art, food, fashion, social protocols, alchemy, and perfume. Few people can hold her attention, and none can redeem themselves in her eyes from even a moment’s boorishness.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="86423b90-5959-47f1-aa14-42544137c5df"><em><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></em> “I’m perfect, and no one else understands the strain and expectation that comes with being the best at everything.”</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="833712b8-b166-4826-af76-05dd799d51b2">The Dilisnya family maintains a tradition of treachery. The land of Borca originates from the same world as Barovia’s conquerors, the von Zaroviches, and Dilisnyas were present at Castle Ravenloft the night of Strahd von Zarovich’s transformation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53669c55-66fe-4a29-aeb2-9d638740d16d">Ages later, the siblings Boris and Camille Dilisnya each plotted to steal the prestige of their cousins, the Boritsis. Camille manipulated her way into the Boritsi family while Boris prepared his son Ivan to be the new head of a united Boritsi–Dilisnya line. Despite abundant opportunities to excel, Ivan grew to embody childish vice and impulsiveness, with his family’s wealth and doting servants exacerbating these whims. Frequent “accidents” transpired around Ivan, forcing his family to cover up the maimings and deaths of numerous pets and servants. Only Ivan’s sister, Kristina, was exempt from his bullying and wicked tricks.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36b2a4f1-36c3-405c-a3b7-d400204a89c3">Over time, Kristina proved precocious and eager to learn. Ivan, however, became stubbornly obsessed with childish toys and behaviors. He encouraged his sister to indulge his idealized visions of their childhood, going so far as to affect childlike behaviors and ways of speaking. Although his family members grew increasingly unsettled, they sheltered the future head of their house, reshaping their estate and investing in whimsical diversions for him.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1e791f9f-55d4-41e0-9f4d-3b7a4a865e16">On the night Ivana Boritsi poisoned her family, Ivan learned of his parents’ intention to send Kristina to a prestigious boarding school. Screams, cruel cackling, and clockwork screeching filled the Dilisnya estate that night. When it ended, Ivan was the last living member of the Dilisnya family, and the Mists closed in around Borca.</p><figure id="imgdilisnya" class="compendium-image">

<p data-content-chunk-id="07eaac66-c635-4e3c-a1de-b3c6e9a14be2">Ivan isn’t a physically or magically powerful Darklord. He’s an extremely old man, but supernaturally he remains as physically fit as he was in the prime of life and has the statistics of a human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16966-noble" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16966-tooltip">noble</a>. His menace manifests in the form of psychological manipulation, making others doubt reality, and causing victims to overestimate his control.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5b9cf105-28f2-4639-864f-49a304689cce"><em><strong>Cursed Correspondence.</strong></em> Ivan loathes leaving his estate, but the Dark Powers have granted him the ability to have his letters delivered anywhere he pleases. See “<a href="#IntrigueinBorca" title="Intrigue in Borca" data-content-chunk-id="37d507ae-c6e5-4393-91d7-13447068a1c2">Intrigue in Borca</a>” later in this section for details on Ivan’s letters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa7f93ed-ce34-4453-abad-a6d2ed30130c"><em><strong>Manipulative Actor.</strong></em> One of Ivan’s favorite manipulations is using his letters and his high-pitched voice to pretend to be a lonely youngster. Ivan keeps out of sight from those he targets for deception so they don’t realize the discordance between his childlike affectations and his appearance. If forced to reveal his aged form, he pretends to be confused and employs elaborate clockwork toys, disguises, and conveyances that further mask his true ability.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="96529296-6622-49d7-be42-e514ba7e84d5"><em><strong>Toy Maker.</strong></em> The Dark Powers provide Ivan with any toy he desires. Creatures of many sorts serve Ivan, and any of them, from maids to monstrous guardians, could be clockwork devices or stuffed toys. This doesn’t change the creatures’ statistics and is revealed only in dramatic moments. Individuals the characters have known for years might eventually be revealed as Ivan’s toys.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aacc8c36-d892-40ca-bede-e896793f8c64"><em><strong>Wicked Wonderland.</strong></em> The Dilisnya estate, Degravo, is a confusing tangle of topiary gardens, hedge mazes, and neglected petting zoos that abut sheer cliffs. The mansion lies at the heart of the estate, and is divided into multiple structures, including the Laughing House, a playhouse where life-sized toys enact brutal operas, and Ivan’s Playroom, a wing dedicated to the master of the estate’s clockwork tinkering and private decadences. Ivan tempts victims to his home, where they gradually realize they’re trapped in a fun house of childish grotesqueries. Those unable to escape are eventually forced to don the ludicrous livery of the Dilisnya household staff and become Ivan’s new servants.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4aa5b6b5-9553-4358-aa8e-e59807cea913"><em><strong>Closing the Borders.</strong></em> Ivan can close or open Borca’s borders once per day. He closes them to prevent those he’s obsessing over from escaping. When he closes Borca’s borders, the Mists rise as detailed in “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/domains-of-ravenloft#TheMists" title="The Mists" data-content-chunk-id="f7e15490-95a8-4bb4-bc49-c6e607ca7e97">The Mists</a>” section at the start of this chapter. Additionally, the fog is filled with Ivan’s taunting voice and patrolled by grim clockwork toys.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="IvansTorment" data-content-chunk-id="dea060bc-321f-4025-bc01-bf12bf30c9dc"><a href="#IvansTorment" data-content-chunk-id="e4eacb17-54db-4518-8fc7-a50cb1893e4f"></a>Ivan’s Torment</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5902df8d-c529-4f69-93e1-9885f77c6460">Since the night the Mists took Borca, Ivan rarely leaves the Dilisnya estate. The following circumstances endlessly torment him:</p><ul data-content-chunk-id="5266cf7a-8b4e-4909-93f3-6660f6d8e24d">
<li data-content-chunk-id="5bbfc412-d863-4afd-a747-d81fa288d5d8">Ivan is alone, and the solitude terrifies him. He was given everything, destroyed it all, and doesn’t know how to live. He endlessly creates fawning, fake family from clockwork creations to distract him from his solitude.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="d330bcee-f903-476b-97a9-8e26ad404a18">Ivan resents Ivana Boritsi, his closest relative, for having the power he was groomed for, but he also views her as his only peer and as a potential replacement for his sister. Ivana, however, avoids him at all costs.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="d364def1-c6a9-47ef-8926-004cbdd83ce7">Ivan looks like a fantastically unkempt old man, a state he believes he has no control over and that grows more pronounced daily. He thinks Ivana keeps the secret of her eternal youth from him.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RoleplayingIvan" data-content-chunk-id="2ab16208-30c1-42a4-a5fb-ed4f77162347"><a href="#RoleplayingIvan" data-content-chunk-id="9657bbdd-8fb4-4cdf-ba6e-1b0f47b47e42"></a>Roleplaying Ivan</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c27e9e8f-a7ae-487f-8af4-f1de429364ff">Ivan demands to be the center of attention while remaining deeply suspicious of the world beyond Degravo. With his family gone, he coaxes guests to his home to indulge in a perverse mixture of fabulous decadence and his off-putting, childish whims. Ivan delights in his guests’ discomfort and in forcing them to entertain him.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="55e46c5b-f363-4bb5-ae45-3f7ee69c39d8"><em><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></em> “The world exists only to bring me pleasure.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e6af82a4-853b-4012-b8aa-254fa615f158"><em><strong>Ideal.</strong></em> “I never want to be bored or alone again.”</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="324e3ead-fef9-4cba-8ac6-91c6ebb30664">Borca provides opportunities for political intrigues, family power struggles, and callous betrayals set amid a backdrop of ludicrous wealth and perverse visions of refinement. Adventures set in Borca often involve characters participating in the machinations of the domain’s nobles, whether as involuntary pawns or as part of schemes to see them indebted to amoral patrons. The domain’s two Darklords also provide opportunities to explore different types of amoral arrogance and petty obsessions. Characters might become caught between Ivana Boritsi and Ivan Dilisnya’s unique obsessions—but could also learn that the best way to undermine these villains is to play them against one another.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4cbed97a-a05b-478b-b0e8-4060ead5b21f">The following sections detail the schemes of the domain’s nobles and Darklords, while the Borca Adventures table suggests other adventures appropriate to the domain.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="496650fd-0df9-4688-9ab2-f335de9b610b">From their decadent manors and lofty business offices, twelve prominent noble families rule over Borcan politics, industry, art, entertainment, religion, and every other aspect of life in the domain. The following families are Borca’s most prominent, though dozens of lesser branch families orbit each:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9df7ad05-d7e1-4eab-a1c3-2f617752fe38"><strong>Boritsi.</strong> The Boritsi name is a mark of quality and innovation, appearing across Borca on perfumes, tonics, and dozens of buildings and theaters. Countless families claim ties to the Boritsis.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="879e76d4-3e48-44bf-b29a-18ab6f1dac1f"><strong>Dilisnya.</strong> The family defensively guards its prestige, as its wealth is based in agriculture—particularly rearing pigs. Treacherous branch families have warred among themselves since the loss of nearly the entire main family.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e6881463-a750-488c-a723-fbb4bcc6d635"><strong>Eris.</strong> The elderly Tolashara Eris claims to be the last of her line. She pours her family’s wealth into supporting art in Levkarest and endlessly building her estate both taller and deeper.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="00d66a2b-1305-4922-a9c3-db29a4da0676"><strong>Ivliskova.</strong> The Ivliskovas run dozens of orphanages and the elite Ivliskova Finishing School. This boarding school boasts a flawless graduation rate—for those students who don’t disappear.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e46471c5-d703-43e7-9620-66846de34c15"><strong>Nobriskov.</strong> Pious and formal, the Nobriskovs claim descent from Borca’s ancient clans and hide their family’s lycanthropic curse.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ff94dc51-9b76-4149-a2f7-26dd3d4d4abc"><strong>Nuikin.</strong> Every member of this competitive family is expected to become a genius in their respective field. Numerous libraries, museums, and theaters advertise Nuikin accomplishments.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be03b233-bfd5-4ad4-aa60-06801bd4e6d7"><strong>Ocrotire.</strong> The Ocrotires descend from respected admirals and seafaring explorers (despite Borca’s lack of a coast). Their estate features a vast oceanarium featuring thousands of bizarre sea creatures and a complete megalodon skeleton.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="deead43c-fb3b-4488-8de2-16e45147b13e"><strong>Olzanik.</strong> This family of metalworkers obsesses over war. To them, every success is a conquest, but no Olzanik has ever seen battle in national service.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a52cc595-27ef-45cd-930d-0185469b85a4"><strong>Piechota.</strong> The estate of Borca’s best ranchers lies half ruined as the result of another family’s treachery. Their wealth largely expended, the Piechotas open their home to travelers along the Ruby Road.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f3d14850-2cf4-40a5-925e-8bd36239fb03"><strong>Pretorius.</strong> The Pretorius estate is a raucous casino surrounded by the Ash Gardens, a region burned in a vast wildfire. Those who can’t pay debts incurred at the casino are burned alive and their ashes scattered in the wastelands.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8529e235-3119-4fe2-884b-a9fb3edd07d1"><strong>Ritter.</strong> The shear-wielding Ritters define the cutting edge of fashion. Their coveted designs change seasonally, and any who create reproductions meet vicious ends.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d4f26ea4-e1bd-441d-9d3f-00ef146210c6"><strong>Tatenna.</strong> Bankers and landlords, the Tatennas track debts across the domain. They deal with every family except the Olzaniks, with whom they maintain a generations-old feud.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e364b1fe-b187-46be-b935-4227d7e6227d">Endless power games play out in Borca. Something as simple as having the right talent or piece of gear could cause a noble to take notice of a character and invite them to an outing or event that leads to further intrigues. These plots initially revolve around small, petty things, but culminate in disasters and true outrages. They often play out in familiar ways.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ReadyAccomplices" data-content-chunk-id="ec9beb8c-3601-4d4f-ae7b-771985461cac"><a href="#ReadyAccomplices" data-content-chunk-id="fb4c6536-3854-41b8-ad19-d69247e03e1a"></a>Ready Accomplices</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8afebcad-d6e4-4921-85e5-8043cf95cc63">Characters readily win contacts among Borca’s nobility, since the elite seem easily charmed by the adventuring life. Friendly nobles soon embroil new acquaintances in their schemes, asking characters for favors meant to prove friendship or trustworthiness. These requests typically play into characters’ action-first inclinations and gradually add up, giving the noble knowledge they can later leverage however they please.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="IgnobleBonds" data-content-chunk-id="5ca1f8fd-d0a6-4a65-a0bb-1765bd5f9726"><a href="#IgnobleBonds" data-content-chunk-id="371059e9-c7fc-4dec-bcc0-ac107e3db484"></a>Ignoble Bonds</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b47084fc-083c-4252-9212-7db8b04670d6">Between adventures, a noble contact might share their problems with a character or seek favors from a character. Roll or choose an option from the Ignoble Request table to determine what the contact wishes. These requests target a specific rival or member of another family, and lead to increasingly dramatic treacheries.</p>

The Lethal Leverage table suggests things a noble contact might seek to use against adventurers. Once they have such leverage, the noble contact is no longer a friend, but rather the characters’ debt holder or blackmailer. Most such treacherous individuals try to ensure that threats or magic can’t easily compel them to relinquish their leverage, such as sending it to a third party or disseminating it within a group of allies.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3a25206f-2892-4de7-b585-dac69e2c9204">Once the aforementioned noble has gained leverage over the party, they might make all sorts of demands. It’s then up to the characters whether they obey or find a way to escape the noble’s schemes. This might even be the point where the noble reveals that they’ve been an agent of Ivana Boritsi or Ivan Dilisnya all along, and now the Darklord they serve has a use for the characters.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="IvanasIntrigues" data-content-chunk-id="179d525a-9f64-4f43-9a90-90c69f4b8949"><a href="#IvanasIntrigues" data-content-chunk-id="66ed444a-6778-45c6-a930-1d8ae6a21376"></a>Ivana’s Intrigues</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="00f12bd5-e5af-416a-8b40-787c490dbebd">Ivana Boritsi’s interests lie in manipulating sweeping aspects of Borca’s society, asserting her dominance amid an ever-shifting landscape of petty noble schemes. She isn’t a spellcaster, but her insights into alchemy allow her to create chemically potent mind-altering effects. Ivana’s chemical arsenal includes drinks that convey illusory sensations, perfumes that charm creatures, and dramatic poisons activated by innocuous secondary triggers. Through suggestion and by subtly exposing targets to her chemicals, Ivana convinces victims she’s practically omnipotent.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bbbe82c3-88ef-4b93-98db-0e1befc41479">Use the poisons detailed in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg" title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" data-content-chunk-id="37a89b2e-ede5-4d1a-9492-3fee1b81ab96">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a> as a baseline for the effects Ivana creates and combine them with the effects of enchantment and illusion spells to design custom, nonmagical toxins for her. The following example combines an inhaled poison and the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2079-dream" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2079-tooltip">dream</a> spell, creating a tool Ivana uses to manipulate her agents.</p>

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or experience the effects of a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2079-dream" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2079-tooltip">dream</a> spell created by Ivana the next time they sleep. This poison is nonmagical, and Ivana doesn’t directly communicate with those affected during the dream. Rather, she creates the illusion of speaking with her intended target by alchemically crafting her message, predicting her target’s reactions, and chemically encoding in her responses. She wears this poison as a perfume or hides it within gift bouquets, allowing it to convey her message later.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b1a71509-1e1e-4c82-bf6f-c0d53e594813">Ivan Dilisnya has a simple desire: companionship. Unfortunately, he’s a selfish and controlling individual. To enable his need for attention, the Dark Powers granted him a subtle ability to have the letters he writes magically delivered. Ivan uses this simple power for amoral, cowardly ends. On rare occasions Ivan takes his clockwork coach through communities to watch for passersby worth writing to.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c2cace80-b9c9-40c5-93db-bf34a697baf5"><em><strong>The Darklord’s Letters.</strong></em> Ivan’s letters are supernatural missives relayed by the Dark Powers. If Ivan writes a letter and addresses it to a creature whose name he knows and whom he’s seen before, he can choose to have one such letter vanish at midnight of the following night. That letter then reappears in an unobserved but obvious space near the letter’s addressee during their next long rest. The letter might appear among the recipient’s mundane mail, on their bedside table, or among their gear. A letter’s mysterious means of delivery is never observed. Ivan’s letters can reach a target anywhere within the Domains of Dread.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="74488297-7c94-4612-b86f-139c7e5685e0"><em><strong>The Darklord Knows.</strong></em> Ivan supernaturally knows the location of every letter he has magically sent within the last month, pinpointed to within 1 mile. As a result, he can tell that one of his letters is in a settlement, but not in which house. He also knows when his letters are destroyed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2c81ab25-8a3a-464f-bb34-d11c614ef2f8"><em><strong>The Darklord’s Demands.</strong></em> Ivan persistently pesters people with his letters, often fixating on two or three individuals. He writes frequently, using the facade of the recipient’s secret admirer, a youngster in need of help, or a distant family member, though his lies fracture over time. His salutations are off-putting or childishly insulting, like “Dear Delicious Knuckle” or “My Preening Pig-Face.” His letters’ contents typically focus on him rather than the recipient, obsessing over his feelings, distractions, and self-indulgent rants. Inevitably, his cowardly cruelty shows through as the letters grow increasingly possessive and insulting. He initially coaxes recipients to fetch gifts for him or to undermine his foes, but his requests culminate in insisting that the recipient joins him at Degravo, the Dilisnya estate.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e4d4334d-0b9c-4c7c-a3be-dd6da8a2b144">The days of the living are numbered in Falkovnia. The people would flee if they could, taking their chances in the Mists, but they aren’t allowed that choice. The military has turned against the people, making them prisoners within their own country. With cudgel and pike, the soldiers of Falkovnia force every commoner into grueling labor, rushing them to raise fortifications and scrape scrawny roots from the dirt. Every lash strike, every day of meager rations is necessary—or so the soldiers claim—because time is short and the dead are coming.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8516a205-f008-492f-8bd0-c62001bad8c6">Falkovnia is a land besieged. Empty countryside surrounds ruined or crumbling cities. A few desperate pockets of civilization survive, carrying on not out of hope, but out of fear of the land’s merciless soldiers. Led by General Vladeska Drakov, Falkovnia’s military organizes a desperate and occasionally effective defense against an implacable foe: the ever-growing armies of the dead.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="157d6a32-3f1d-45b3-99e9-8c2c07e54cb9">Every month a new zombie legion issues from the Mists. Never emerging from the same place twice, the horde sweeps across the land, drawn to the densest populations of the living. That’s currently the Falkovnian capital of Lekar, where unfit and underfed conscripts defend crumbling walls alongside General Drakov and her crimson-armored elite soldiers, the Talons. Causalities stack up during the zombie sieges, but miracles and moments of valor have not abandoned Falkovnia. The people’s numbers dwindle, but they soldier on.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a9462f4c-4e36-4bcd-89d3-1ff0c325e805">In the aftermath of an attack, the Falkovnians burn their dead, repair what they can, and whisper that now might be the time to flee. Invariably, though, someone speaks too loudly and a so-called traitor is impaled upon Lekar’s walls. The people might want to abandon their homes, but Vladeska Drakov will not know defeat.</p>

<p>FALKOVNIAN CHARACTERS</p>
<p>Characters from Falkovnia have good reason to be in other domains, having fled their homeland’s zombie plague. Such individuals have likely seen horrors and know tragedy. Falkovnia’s residents often have brown hair and varied skin tones with warm undertones. Their names are broadly inspired by the German language. When players create characters from Falkovnia, consider asking them the following questions.</p>
<p><strong> How did you escape the Falkovnian military?</strong> Were you separated from your unit? Were you sacrificed or left for dead as part of a military strategy? Did you abandon or betray your unit? Were you once considered a Trueborn, or do you have a Blood Falcon tattoo?</p>
<p><strong>How did you escape the zombie hordes?</strong> Were you lucky enough not to encounter the undead? Did you defeat animate corpses or flee from them? Did you fall but somehow escape notice by the undead? Did they, for some remarkable reason, ignore you?</p>
<p><strong> What do you care for in Lekar?</strong> You know Lekar’s days are numbered; any day now the zombies will sweep over the city’s last defenders. Do you want to stop them to save loved ones? Do you want to prevent the hordes from destroying your life’s work? Do you know of something in Lekar that can save Falkovnia’s people?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2c6e9b0b-0bf6-42f0-8294-6ddbea79b770">Those familiar with Falkovnia know the following facts:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="3eda1060-90b2-45b8-9e74-70a34832e036">
<li data-content-chunk-id="f217b4ad-9714-4feb-9439-0b8968283fb8">Every month, on the night of the new moon, thousands of zombies appear from the Mists and invade Falkovnia.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="b2d2725d-d8b5-4e83-aa25-925e1a5b926a">Ruins cover Falkovnia—cities and villages crushed by zombie hordes and haunted by undead stragglers.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="fb9f462f-df0a-4522-9d24-2f139bcf9594">Elite Falkovnian soldiers known as Talons patrol the land, hunting for deserters, looters, and strangers to press into service. Talon officers bear the Blood Falcon, the symbol of Vladeska Drakov, tattooed prominently on their bodies.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="05ad8d1b-4782-4809-be8b-cc122d5ef12e">There is only one punishment for any crime in Falkovnia: impalement.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="ef53fc32-48b9-4502-9c62-25b752ee3404">Individuals earn public or military esteem for special acts of heroism. Dubbed “Trueborn of Falkovnia,” these national heroes are treated well, but the fickle public turns against them if they’re perceived as not doing enough to end the undead invasion.</li>
</ul>

<p data-content-chunk-id="95d609e5-9cfc-47a7-a96a-7f31741967d5">Falkovnia’s settlements lie in ruin, its cities crumbling and unprotected, its villages abandoned and overgrown. Still, bastions of civilization hold out against the undead infesting the land, while dangers more terrifying than zombies lurk in hidden places.</p>

<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Lekar" data-content-chunk-id="84a031bc-b344-465a-80a4-286efd76de74"><a href="#Lekar" data-content-chunk-id="75fb016d-a56f-4241-8d57-7aca2aeff09b"></a>Lekar</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f53ee7fd-59a2-48be-96fb-a26f838aaac0">The only city left in Falkovnia, Lekar now bears the brunt of the zombie invasion. The old city outgrew its walls multiple times since its founding, leaving its districts divided by fortifications. During the First Siege of Lekar, General Drakov sacrificed the entirety of the northern River Ward, leaving hundreds of souls to be slaughtered but allowing the remaining defenders to turn back the zombie horde.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7be8032e-68f9-4491-b5ab-d71212fc9101">The city’s survivors face harsh conditions. Talon soldiers patrol the walls and the streets, keeping peace in the cramped slums that now fill the city. Troops lead civilians outside the walls to scavenge from ruined settlements and work the fields of abandoned farms, but their harvests are never enough for the city’s survivors. Though bitter and desperate, soldiers live marginally better than civilians, being assured of daily rations and housing in the Bastion Ward—the Talons-only district around city hall where General Drakov established her command center. From here, Drakov orders daily public executions as conscripts dispense supplies to the masses, and she plans how to resist the next zombie attack.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Morfenzi" data-content-chunk-id="78196aa2-1cf9-4e87-a825-c5f61a99d912"><a href="#Morfenzi" data-content-chunk-id="fe5c8a98-12f6-42df-94b8-80ec6c949ab9"></a>Morfenzi</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="46f5f8d1-5e53-4b6d-bca5-89b53f395bc5">Once a rich rural community, Morfenzi now holds only rubble and graves. The fields surrounding it remain strangely fertile, making them a prime destination for bands of farmers dispatched from Lekar. The Talons keep an outpost hidden beneath the town’s ruins, under the command of one of General Drakov’s surviving aides, the brilliant arcanist and scientist Vjorn Horstman. Horstman runs the post as his personal laboratory, obsessively striving to create new weapons to help Drakov win her war.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Silbervas" data-content-chunk-id="5614b44b-3a12-49cc-9d35-380100e8d478"><a href="#Silbervas" data-content-chunk-id="4f11afab-8862-48cd-82d8-4b046519ca85"></a>Silbervas</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da3df2a7-1f26-4abb-b096-6526c47707ed">Groups of fractious survivors claim sections of this small city’s ruins, scavenging and skirmishing over territory and resources. The survivors are unified in their commitment to silence, to avoid attracting the notice of zombies—and whoever makes their home in the ominously lit Dekovan Palace overlooking the ruins.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="VigilaForest" data-content-chunk-id="dbd06572-8b3d-445d-873d-89e7428ecbd3"><a href="#VigilaForest" data-content-chunk-id="2e806b68-f11d-4a42-8923-ce0e70d948c7"></a>Vigila Forest</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b4a6cdfa-00b5-4e24-9bc0-7cc847713b84">Towering black deciduous trees pierce the canopy of Falkovnia’s dense, whispering forests. Called “sentries of death,” these trees inspire grim stories suggesting that their wood is haunted or their roots reach into the realm of the dead. In contrast, a ring of pale sentry trees stands in the depths of the Vigila Forest. Tales tell that none who enter the ring survive. The zombie plague seems to offer proof of their truth: few undead emerge from the forest, and those that do are entirely skeletonized.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="VladeskaDrakov" data-content-chunk-id="5e489db9-8307-4c9b-bd36-96ebbb91b3b7"><a href="#VladeskaDrakov" data-content-chunk-id="fa34e485-5490-4448-9a4a-c8cc11d2befb"></a>Vladeska Drakov</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2282d71c-1482-4d1e-b6fa-df7b1912e008">In the world of her birth, Vladeska Drakov was known as the Crimson Falcon, leader of a peerless mercenary army called the Falcon’s Talons. She and her troops executed a thousand ancient grudges and petty atrocities in a land of bitterly feuding royal families. Infamous but respected, Drakov amassed a fortune and planned to retire young, buying a title and a realm to rule.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="860b04ec-b15b-4e9e-9bbc-8cf86faaa08a">The sacking of Yeivere changed her plans. During that city’s razing, Drakov’s mercenaries went a step too far. The Falcon’s Talons killed a unique soul during their slaughter. None can say who the soul was—a prince, a saint, a witch, an angel—but with its death, the world turned against them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d7feecc7-f6c1-469d-aa38-1686daaf0d24">The ruling families united to hunt the Talons. Thanks to her tactical genius, Drakov repelled her pursuers and went on the offensive. One by one she attacked her former benefactors, burning villages, pressing citizens into service, and impaling anyone with a drop of noble blood. Though it took years, Drakov forged a bloody empire. But while sacking the burning city of her last remaining foe, Drakov and her troops were engulfed by strange smoke. When it cleared, everything they knew was gone.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0a69ceaa-81c1-40ad-aaed-7f5b266c6843">Transported to an unfamiliar land, Drakov and her troops wasted little time subjugating it. The realm fell quickly, even easily, and upon taking the city of Lekar, Drakov prepared to name herself ruler of her new empire: Falkovnia.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="892b4ee6-2344-421e-b57a-4c1edd318c76">Then, under a moonless sky, the dead rose against the land’s invaders. The surrounding villages fell to the zombies with hardly a sound, and undead claws scraped Lekar’s walls before the first alarms were raised. The First Siege of Lekar raged for four days. Drakov’s strategies, both brilliant and desperate, eventually turned back the zombie horde, but at the cost of most of her veteran troops.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8683ce3e-5b38-4c2f-b126-cb3d45006c35">Since then, Drakov has lost nearly her entire nation. Every month a new desperate battle unfolds. She prepares ceaselessly for each, certain of her plans and ultimate victory, but doubting the mettle of her troops. With threats and public, impalings she tries to keep her people more terrified of her than of the undead. And with every new moon she faces an unconquerable foe, never revealing to anyone that each zombie bears the familiar, rotting face of an innocent her soldiers once put to the sword.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="VladeskasPowersandDominion" data-content-chunk-id="2a18a1f9-1b85-4930-9c0d-4020a3ae06df"><a href="#VladeskasPowersandDominion" data-content-chunk-id="405abbc4-b514-4fb5-b09a-8d05d950359e"></a>Vladeska’s Powers and Dominion</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1f309423-4a38-453d-b321-06cbcb17825b">Vladeska Drakov is an experienced military commander with statistics similar to those of a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16938-knight" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16938-tooltip">knight</a>. While her martial skill is considerable, her true might comes in the form of the obedient army that unquestioningly enacts her every whim.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="21404f4e-e87f-41b3-955e-303c4ba086cc"><em><strong>The Falcon’s Talons. </strong></em>Vladeska’s military forces are both completely overwhelming and entirely outnumbered. As an occupying force, the Talons are terrifying. Their numbers are relatively few, but they’re organized enough to oppress Lekar’s ragged survivors and enforce Drakov’s totalitarian laws. In the face of zombie hordes, though, they’re fighting a losing battle against foes whose numbers only grow. And every time a Talon falls, Lekar’s final defeat grows closer. Talon soldiers use the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16915-guard" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16915-tooltip">guard</a> stat block, while commanders are <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17045-veteran" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17045-tooltip">veterans</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="48f116f9-7e5a-4e2b-94da-00bd841dbc83"><em><strong>Martial Law. </strong></em>Lekar—and, to an extent, all of Falkovnia—is a martial dictatorship. Drakov’s troops carry out example-setting impalings as punishment for even the slightest crimes. These executions serve the greater good and impose necessary order, but make it clear that zombies aren’t the realm’s only monsters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="18557352-4e93-4a8f-b853-44e47c122c25"><em><strong>Only Bad Decisions. </strong></em>There is one simple truth in Falkovnia: the dead are about to kill everyone. This sets the stage for countless bad decisions, from leaders making terrible sacrifices or permitting amoral acts to individuals making fatalistic choices. Everyone in Falkovnia behaves as if it’s their last day alive—because it probably is.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="859f7325-e999-415e-ac68-5f63f01d1a9c"><em><strong> Closing the Borders. </strong></em>Unlike most Darklords, Vladeska Drakov can’t open her domain’s borders, so Falkovnia’s borders are usually closed. Anyone who enters the Mists surrounding Falkovnia encounters an endless number of zombies. Even if travelers somehow avoid these shambling corpses, they emerge from the Mists back in Falkovnia, pursued by an undead mob. For one week every month, though, following the night of the new moon, the Mists surrounding Falkovnia are empty of zombies and the borders open. During this time, Drakov sends patrols of Talons to sweep the edges of the Mists for deserters. These patrols are difficult to avoid and battles with them often attract zombies.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="VladeskasTorment" data-content-chunk-id="67137e21-56bf-447a-95aa-727eacc43553"><a href="#VladeskasTorment" data-content-chunk-id="b7271b84-d0e0-49d7-a041-01a84c835902"></a>Vladeska’s Torment</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2db60636-9df9-4c1f-bfcf-5b005eb30da5">Vladeska Drakov is close to attaining her desired empire, but circumstances keep it ever out of reach:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="8a4904dc-ec38-4ad0-a54a-2bd59ceea762">
<li data-content-chunk-id="85793c0c-f162-4cf2-bfed-b932ee99d3e1">Vladeska knows it’s only a matter of time until zombies overrun Lekar. She has no time for rest or deliberation; every moment must be used to the fullest before the hordes return. Every wasted second is a life lost.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="fa205d5e-cd21-4cd9-9f50-5481ae30ce75">Vladeska refuses to flee. She knows doing so could save many of Lekar’s people, but it would mean admitting failure—a fate worse than death.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="3bcdf702-5348-4c86-b620-85c4dd8e3d0a">Vladeska recognizes every zombie’s face, knowing they’re her own fallen soldiers, the defenders of communities she razed, or murdered civilians. She doesn’t understand why this is, but she knows the zombies are coming for her alone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RoleplayingVladeska" data-content-chunk-id="6b60ab2f-38ac-4a82-ad5b-43d4cfab3dcb"><a href="#RoleplayingVladeska" data-content-chunk-id="10eb9c36-dfcc-4f99-aa27-37c903c30b52"></a>Roleplaying Vladeska</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c1a40550-7482-4dc1-98dd-b983ebb58552">Steely and fierce, Vladeska Drakov views softness as weakness and resents having her time wasted. She values cold competency and makes life-and-death decisions mercilessly. Her isolation and the stress of rule weigh heavily upon her, but daily catastrophes keep her focused on her nation’s needs and not her failures. She believes a foe from her past is responsible for the endless zombie attacks and quietly looks for trustworthy agents to find the zombies’ source.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f72e00b4-fabc-410e-a6fd-2efb002ef199"><em><strong>Personality Trait.</strong></em> “I am the only one capable of making the decisions required for the greater good. This proves my excellence and sets me apart.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2afc9365-385c-4299-9966-a7df252f4979"><em><strong>Ideal.</strong></em> “Once I’ve crushed my opposition, I will claim my realm, ruling not as a conqueror but as royalty.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d1ba5079-395e-45eb-9f05-5f7071959127"><em><strong>Bond.</strong></em> “All who live in my domain are my troops, and they exist to further my will. Those who deny me are traitors bound for execution.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="99aa5994-458a-49a6-9473-886ec76b453e"><em><strong>Flaw.</strong></em> “I and all I command will know death before we show weakness in defeat.”</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="162e8c74-fe03-4aec-a296-067a2530f063">Falkovnia provides the perfect setting for disaster horror, particularly of the zombie apocalypse variety. Characters might be harried by zombie pursuit across the empty countryside or asked to defend the last holdout of civilization against a relentless horde. The zombies could serve as direct threats or motivate others to monstrous deeds, with the ends supposedly justifying the means.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dafa3e51-4c14-4d9d-b46d-0debdcf4cbd9">You determine the composition and behavior of the zombie hordes of Falkovnia. The zombies emerge from the Mists on the night of the new moon and trudge toward the last holdouts of civilization. Whether they move in a single wave or scatter into smaller bands, this surge brings a monthly threat to besiege the walls of Lekar.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="75c3bae6-33ec-4d4a-abdf-03f3ae04a81e">When creating zombie encounters, consider the average level of your group and what threats you want to represent. The “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/monsters-of-ravenloft#Zombies" title="Zombie" data-content-chunk-id="3c01e103-1d04-4500-b667-197172683b43">Zombie</a>” entry in <a title="chapter 5" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/monsters-of-ravenloft" data-content-chunk-id="53aeabf6-50f1-42cb-92d2-918734516fc4">chapter 5</a> presents a variety of zombie types to complement the shambling <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17077-zombie" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17077-tooltip">zombie</a> of the <em><a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" title="Monster Manual">Monster Manual</a></em>, posing greater threats or terrifying surprises. The horde can also include other corporeal Undead such as <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17015-skeleton" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17015-tooltip">skeletons</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16872-ghoul" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16872-tooltip">ghouls</a>, or <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17059-wight" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17059-tooltip">wights</a>. Alternatively, the “zombies” might not be Undead at all but another group attempting to lay claim to Falkovnia—perhaps a forgotten human culture or relentless giants.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1f3ea93f-286a-429c-b050-55f01d6249b8">Falkovnia is one of the few domains where the characters and the land’s Darklord theoretically represent the same side, united against the zombies. The characters might defend Drakov’s people and enact her defensive measures, but might also try to subvert her Pyrrhic strategies or attempt to smuggle survivors to safe locations outside Lekar. Consider exploring plots in which the characters rise in the Darklord’s esteem as Trueborn of Falkovnia, but then must walk the line of both keeping Drakov’s trust and upholding their principles.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d31dfa51-b2ea-43bb-b248-8c62bdd237a0">Consider the plots on the Falkovnia Adventures table when planning adventures in this domain.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c79b4d1c-3625-4cc8-9bd0-ca1995f0d137">Falkovnia’s terrors culminate monthly in the zombie assault on Lekar. If you plan to involve characters in Vladeska Drakov’s war against the undead, first consider how they become involved. The following examples are just a few of the possibilities:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b9e7ab69-f990-4f39-88f8-33940c26bc6c"><strong>Forced Conscripts.</strong> The characters run into an overwhelming force of Talons and are absorbed into its ranks. When zombies appear at the city wall, the characters are offered their freedom in return for defending the city.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1f1d0c48-b7e4-46e2-9069-da155a7d5128"><strong>Last Bastion.</strong> Far from Lekar, the characters fall in with local survivors who say the city is the country’s last safe bastion. Upon arriving, they discover the sanctuary is not what they’d hoped.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="38ee8dae-1e9b-4cd9-b488-db4bbddb135f"><strong>Missed Connection.</strong> The characters come to Falkovnia having heard tales of it before the land’s zombie uprising. An individual or item they seek is now in Lekar, forcing the characters to search the city and then escape.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7399dcc7-704d-4698-b3e0-db61487b7fb6"><strong>Mindtaker Mists.</strong> The Mists deposit the characters’ consciousnesses into soldiers, Talon officers, or unprepared peasants preparing for the siege. Consult the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures#Survivors" title="Survivors" data-content-chunk-id="32e49c65-91a2-402c-8a53-4b745e486ae4">Survivors</a>” section of <a title="chapter 4" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="8e24ce9c-421d-4fe9-95aa-44b92ecf1e33">chapter 4</a> for suggestions on how to represent soldiers bound to face the horde.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BeforetheSiege" data-content-chunk-id="b1a323bd-f26b-4c69-90f9-938833e26734"><a href="#BeforetheSiege" data-content-chunk-id="6705993b-9357-4aec-ab6c-43c0c094fe16"></a>Before the Siege</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="067b6ca5-7866-4f02-b9bb-82cf6f5357db">However the characters become enlisted in Lekar’s defense, they face a hopeless battle. They join hundreds of unprepared defenders, including <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoners</a> holding clubs or longbows for the first time.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9605170a-aad5-4300-af20-d8fbec4d4309">Prior to the start of the siege, determine where the characters will be positioned among the city’s fortifications or on the streets. The specifics of these locations don’t matter—no precision tactics will change the characters’ fortunes against the zombie horde. Allow the characters to strategize however they please, though.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="55f60c98-c1ef-45ed-8c6a-02e9967b64a3"><em><strong>Fortifications.</strong></em> Stairways within Lekar’s 40-foot-high towers grant access to the 30-foot-high walls. Parapets guard both, providing defenders with three-quarters cover from those outside the walls. Fortifications around the gates hold controls for massive barred doors and portcullises. Both towers and gates contain <a title="suspended cauldrons" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#CauldronSuspended" data-content-chunk-id="551b0430-501a-456f-bf74-1642bed0c450">suspended cauldrons</a> (detailed in the <em><a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg" title="Dungeon Master’s Guide">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37f7787f-046a-42fd-a7dd-bc6001b9d88d"><em><strong>Streets.</strong></em> The streets are packed with poorly armed commoners and cruel Talon soldiers. Any character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check finds useful materials among the carts and cargo cleared from the streets— weapons, a variety of adventuring gear, or the resources to approximate one <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/198-gunpowder-keg" data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/198-tooltip">gunpowder keg explosive</a> (described in the <em><a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg" title="Dungeon Master’s Guide">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DuringtheSiege" data-content-chunk-id="a76df5fb-f93e-446c-a33c-709704821878"><a href="#DuringtheSiege" data-content-chunk-id="0644ca12-5049-410d-8fd9-b9ba9f14e2bd"></a>During the Siege</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="84571296-c5bd-4e45-9870-ec0a363f0c2b">Run the siege as a series of encounters rather than one extended battle. As terrible events unfold around the characters, it’s up to them to determine who and how they’ll help.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0b705f63-bf6f-4f86-bab9-0ba7aa6333a2">Begin the siege with zombies approaching Lekar’s walls. The characters might pick off distant zombies or enact plans to destroy dozens at a time. The characters’ strategies are likely successful, but the horde soon begins overwhelming defenses nearby. Once the characters defeat a few zombies, roll 1d6 and consult the Zombie Siege Encounters table. The event rolled unfolds within sight of one of the characters. It’s up to the characters to either take action or let the event transpire. When the characters complete an encounter, roll on the table again. If the characters ignore one of these events, the defenders’ situation worsens. Add +2 to the next roll on the table.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6fc79c6c-13cb-4cee-8268-5e02447b7580">The siege lasts as long as you like. Use frantic rushes between emergencies to describe small horrors and victories while wearing down the characters’ resources with brief zombie attacks. If the characters feel completely overwhelmed, Talon <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16985-priest" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16985-tooltip">priests</a> with <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/71-potion-of-healing" data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/71-tooltip">potions of healing</a> might appear, or an officer can enlist characters to deliver orders from General Drakov (likely related to the siege’s climax).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="edeedd28-0fb7-43cd-87e5-cf9c2977d0d1">As the battle reaches what you determine to be the halfway point, start rolling 2d6 on the Zombie Siege Encounters table and consult the “<a href="#ConcludingtheSiege" title="Concluding the Siege" data-content-chunk-id="53462838-47e6-45b4-8900-263204636638">Concluding the Siege</a>” section to guide the battle toward its climax.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d28ed430-ce29-46b5-a64f-28e22d0cdf13">Once you’ve determined how the siege will unfold, start foreshadowing Drakov’s scheme, giving the characters the opportunity to aid it, enact a less destructive plan, or save innocents. Use missives intercepted from messengers or a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5402-sending-stones" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5402-tooltip">sending stone</a> taken from a fallen Talon officer to clue the party in on Drakov’s strategy.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5ada24fd-2b28-4ce8-9028-a3a50d301038">Creating your own horror adventures is like crafting any other D&amp;D adventure with one exception: your goal is to horrify your players in the most fun way possible. Frightening adventures benefit from an atmosphere of dread, conceived through a combination of terrifying narratives, dramatic presentation, and game elements encouraging fear. Drawing out the anxiety and anticipation of players requires deliberate consideration, though. The tools and techniques in this chapter provide ways to make sure your game is both spooky and safe in ways right for your specific group. A toolbox of horror-focused rules also provides options for what sort of grim adventures you might create. At the end of this chapter, a <a title="horror adventure" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/the-house-of-lament" data-content-chunk-id="cbc0b19a-5878-42c2-a5ae-e3e81655db15">horror adventure</a> puts these methods to use and leads characters on their first steps into the Domains of Dread.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d24ec05e-71bc-4bb4-977c-c396f6180b4b">Before you run a horror game, consider the following steps to ensure the willingness and full engagement of your players. If a group gathers to play a fun, low-stakes adventure but is immediately thrust into unexpected horror, the game can feel like a trap. You should avoid this. Rather, set expectations with your players about what a horror-focused game means, and determine what topics and themes will encourage or discourage players’ participation.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="UnderstandingHorror" data-content-chunk-id="65a9e088-cd8a-4b93-a1d0-75a572e519a5"><a href="#UnderstandingHorror" data-content-chunk-id="f6db09fe-bf0f-417e-91ff-43c7f9556c5a"></a>Understanding Horror</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="20ee25e3-8d28-4480-a76a-569ccc3f0a87">Your primary goal as a DM running a horror adventure is to facilitate a fun D&amp;D experience. This book assumes you and your players enjoy the thrill and suspense of scary stories. The audience of a horror movie can enjoy the menace on screen because they know it can’t harm them (and they have an idea of what to expect from the film’s trailer). In the same way, your players count on you to make sure an adventure’s terror doesn’t target them personally or otherwise step beyond the game. Your goal is never to make players feel uncomfortable or threatened. As D&amp;D adventures aren’t scripted, unexpected elements can arise during play. If your whole group can agree to the terms outlined in this section, everyone should have an exciting, enjoyable experience.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SetExpectations" data-content-chunk-id="eda45d60-a16c-4d60-bc98-f693eeed3ffe"><a href="#SetExpectations" data-content-chunk-id="9d65b7fd-d23d-4835-a67f-fdd7127ab43a"></a>Set Expectations</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="316d5b75-dfe2-44f7-8f4a-d244df12ac8a">Well before you assemble a group around a game table, pitch the adventures you’re thinking about running to your prospective players. Note the types of conflicts that might arise, the tone, and major themes. Telling players what to expect prepares them as they imagine what sorts of characters they could create and launches conversations about content to be embraced and avoided. You don’t need to reveal the major plot points or twists in your story, but share the kinds of monsters and general themes you’re interested in using, other horror stories you’re inspired by, and which genres of horror from <a title="chapter 2" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/genres-of-horror/" data-content-chunk-id="dfe2cf33-0b33-4b90-9d91-5763b62fe534">chapter 2</a> interest you. Being transparent with your players allows them to decide if this is a game they want to play, which is best to know before play begins.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2f9d98b1-96a1-4489-a414-0245fc302756">Take advantage of the time before your first game session to learn about your players’ thoughts related to horror adventures. To do this, create a brief list of questions focused on the following topics. After preparing this survey, distribute it to your players as an e-mail, physical handout, or otherwise before gathering to play. Keep the survey’s results anonymous, but use them to guide what sort of adventures you’ll create.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d43c41b6-829e-4ad5-a2b7-129a082345aa">Start your survey by listing common story and horror elements to determine your players’ comfort with them. The following list is not exhaustive; customize your list to include elements you imagine could arise during adventures. End the list with a space where players can add other topics to avoid or that they’re interested in. For each of these topics, ask whether it should be included or avoided:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="216757ad-2153-403f-977e-545900af0cdb">
<li data-content-chunk-id="ac05a9e9-35ab-43b3-afa6-1eb3a75a38b2">General phobias and common fears, such as clowns, needles, or spiders</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="af155101-8c38-4768-8680-47508a621f57">Descriptions of gore or visceral violence</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="aa9dbec9-31b2-4a93-ac97-459ced6d6bef">Romantic in-character dialogue</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="ab8ab4a1-4314-41dc-8c01-c71ed54b8541">Themes of mental and physical health involving the body and the mind</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="69bbedd0-55d8-46b1-ad27-a34668ea8bf9">Real-world religion and politics, or analogs of them</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="ca35978c-49a2-408d-9842-3dc99f233927">Topics related to real-world social or cultural injustices and discrimination</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="02750d03-10d1-4eb4-8cdc-f010f84b80ef">Game-specific content, such as dangers, monster types, and setting details you might use</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="7c2c5b2e-fd20-4b76-8839-c009bb76b274">Specific genres of horror, like those in <a title="chapter 2" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/genres-of-horror/" data-content-chunk-id="43ff04e3-eb1e-45c1-916a-8b62915e02c8">chapter 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="72618c59-b790-4134-9025-7d4ad8b0ad2c">If you’re not comfortable adding any of these topics to your game, don’t include them as options, and use them as the starting point for a list of elements that your adventures won’t include.</p>
<aside class="rules-text" id="SeriousFear">
<p>SERIOUS FEAR</p>
<p>Many horror D&amp;D games are spooky romps not too different from typical D&amp;D adventures. Others venture into more unsettling territory. You and the players should decide what level of intensity is right for your horror adventures. This section provides guidance that applies whether your adventures are morbid comedies or explorations of mature themes. The advice here emphasizes structures that work for all players, including those with different tolerances for being scared or who have certain topics that are off-limits for them. Always consider what you can do to make players feel comfortable with your game, even if no one entirely knows how the horror might unfold. Never assume you know your players’ deepest fears—no matter how long you’ve been roleplaying with them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5c7de9e0-1fd7-4dae-9543-40d1ba5187e5">After your list of topics, use the following questions to query players about gameplay considerations:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="39bf7c97-1629-4017-8695-280935e8eca8">
<li data-content-chunk-id="45eca11a-5991-416b-80bf-27f1c1285607">How scary do you want the game to be? Do you enjoy being creeped out as a player, or should the characters alone experience fear?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="5788e23d-8181-4155-94a4-061ae5b316c9">How difficult do you want the game to be? Should there be a high, average, or low threat of death?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="c6bbfbd8-a0ac-4cef-9cf4-35e89535143c">How do you feel about effects that take away your ability to control what your character does?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="f19bbc5c-726a-45bc-a718-d293f2d0e070">Do you want to allow phones or other distractions at the game table, or should they be set aside?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="8b1141de-ebb4-406e-ba67-aaa12b71753d">Are there any specific stories or rules you’d like to see highlighted during the game?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="8aff52d6-43e1-4c64-a94d-0f1361ec07f1">Are there general events or experiences you don’t want to see during the game?</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cd8edafc-9c92-4cf2-8aaa-96aabfb249dd">Once you’ve completed this survey, distribute it to your players, give them a window of time to respond, then collect the results. Use this information to inform your adventure planning and to create an anonymized list of content that will not be featured in your game. Bring this list to your session zero.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5012a68f-30e5-439a-a353-02a5c1787599">Make it clear that D&amp;D is a group storytelling game. As the DM, you have a role in crafting adventures and arbitrating rules, but you aren’t solely responsible for how much fun the group has. Everyone is responsible for the group’s enjoyment of the game. By the same token, the whole group has a role in determining how scary the game is and how far that frightful content goes. <a title="Chapter 1" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/character-creation/" data-content-chunk-id="f050f75b-987e-411e-924b-a775e688677b">Chapter 1</a> provides guidance for players participating in horror adventures.

<p data-content-chunk-id="6521d3fc-d3cc-4d92-9a08-2d0e3aeec33c">Review your takeaways from the content surveys. Then, informed by players’ survey responses, present your list of content the game will not feature. These are your game’s boundaries and will not be included. Emphasize that boundaries aren’t negotiable, and neither you nor any of the players should bring them into the game.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7114528b-008e-4357-9153-6a351e94f86a">Note that boundaries may change during play. Encourage players to bring any additions to you, privately or in the moment, so you can add them to the list. When this happens, don’t refer to past survey data, defend past choices, or ask players to explain their boundaries. Trust that players know their needs best, and update the game accordingly.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9f597176-2b4e-4553-bc7b-b7a451a74774">Let players know that this list of boundaries will be accessible during every session and that by playing, they agree to respect these boundaries. Make it clear that players who don’t respect these boundaries will have to leave the game.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CustomizeYourExperience" data-content-chunk-id="90847143-9dc7-4370-b61a-3601b872ad15"><a href="#CustomizeYourExperience" data-content-chunk-id="a4f7b1a6-ecf4-4458-bdb2-ad89fc4b2b32"></a>Customize Your Experience</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="63ca39b7-af50-4106-8123-44ddd15e9b3c">During session zero, the group can discuss ways to customize the game in the following ways:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ab677d5c-faba-4a55-a111-4ec21041c6fd"><strong>Discuss Genre.</strong> If there are horror genres that players gravitated toward in the survey, see if there are elements players would like to use to inspire their characters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a199cbb2-b83c-4e64-9a5d-980c0e990b53"><strong>Discuss Campaign Themes.</strong> If you already have ideas for the sorts of adventures you plan to run or your own Darklord and domain, share the general concepts you’re interested in and see what players get excited about.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="49e93ee7-baa1-4c48-8c0e-5b6e3269e33b"><strong>Create Player Characters.</strong> If players want to discuss their characters or create them collaboratively, now is a great time to do so.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0c76aa60-3a43-4940-b814-eaad4923cb6e"><strong>Choose Optional Rules.</strong> If there are optional rules—like those presented later in this chapter— that you’re amenable to using, determine which ones work best for the group.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RunningHorrorGames" data-content-chunk-id="8036d444-213d-4211-8f4c-288e4e1f25ac"><a href="#RunningHorrorGames" data-content-chunk-id="f6f913e5-ca10-47a3-9eb0-46ce731610bc"></a>Running Horror Games</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2af3a8b2-7e15-41b1-97da-8790aa53a0ec">While preparing and running frightening adventures, keep in mind the ebb and flow of suspense. Atmosphere, pacing, description, and player involvement all influence a game’s tension and directly contribute to how scary your adventures feel.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HorrorAtmosphere" data-content-chunk-id="8ce2ae67-2833-4d42-b467-b509fb094c50"><a href="#HorrorAtmosphere" data-content-chunk-id="e26cd6bf-1d5b-4ecb-a4b5-0384c5834856"></a>Horror Atmosphere</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="32a83c5f-30dc-402c-a8e0-583993e7b6e9">Atmosphere is the overall mood of your game. It’s the sense of levity, excitement, or dread that stems from a story’s content and players’ perception of it. Atmosphere can be challenging to build and easy to disrupt, but any D&amp;D game—particularly scary games—benefit from your work to cultivate an atmosphere consistent with the experience you’re trying to create. Consider the following elements to influence your game’s atmosphere and create moody trappings for your horror adventures. Customize what you can and don’t fret about what you can’t.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Accessibility" data-content-chunk-id="237305f0-eeca-4dda-b464-e2b17ac96b48"><a href="#Accessibility" data-content-chunk-id="760bd1c1-1781-41ea-abc7-003ed7299fdf"></a>Accessibility</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="72749db9-3383-47c0-ab4e-472b7492262d">When choosing the space you’ll be playing in, review any accessibility needs communicated in the content survey. Accommodate what you can; communicate what you can’t as early as possible. Enlist players for help. Players may have difficulty with low light, loud background music, small printed text, strong odors, cramped spaces, specific allergens, or challenges with programs (if playing online). If any player identified these as an issue, don’t use them to create an unnerving atmosphere. Recognize the difference between creating a moody atmosphere and making it difficult for players to participate.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Location" data-content-chunk-id="296786de-602a-473b-a8ae-2ca97891a864"><a href="#Location" data-content-chunk-id="db62f514-5833-4791-b88b-78c34dc48645"></a>Location</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="80ee0b84-e2f9-40b7-b748-2c7c819083cd">If possible, play in an area with minimal visual or auditory distractions. Favor surroundings that appropriately reinforce your desired atmosphere and have little non-player traffic. If space is shared, negotiate with non-players to reserve the space in advance. You can also reduce distracting stimuli by turning screens off, covering decorations, and moving unnecessary objects away.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Music" data-content-chunk-id="28e0f259-91f7-4e64-a4b1-d375b32f9c62"><a href="#Music" data-content-chunk-id="7e507aa3-9396-441e-b714-34e9ddb1fbb9"></a>Music</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0a3f3783-d7b8-43ed-a217-c6e07d015b0f">Consider what fills the pauses in the game’s action or other quiet moments. Lulls breed distractions. Subtle music, though, can fill such instances while reinforcing the game’s atmosphere. Search for ambient, atmospheric, or instrumental music. Choose options without lyrics and that aren’t recognizably tied to popular media. Create playlists in advance. If you can subtly control volume, slowly raise it when you want attention, and lower it when players are talking. Experiment with how volume and tempo influence whether a scene feels subdued or energetic.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Lighting" data-content-chunk-id="59acc30a-a0e9-4b81-ae53-a74d856b87f2"><a href="#Lighting" data-content-chunk-id="5947f654-b583-4808-a5f8-a1d3a327b3d7"></a>Lighting</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="59387d33-681f-470c-bc44-1acb3f2ecd65">Dimming the lights can transform your game space, causing distractions to fade and making it look unfamiliar. If the lighting’s easy to control, you might adjust it to suggest a setting’s light level. More elaborate techniques might involve using colored lights or using patterned cut-outs to cast eerie shadows. Whenever manipulating lighting, though, always ensure players have enough light to read by.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Props" data-content-chunk-id="309949bb-e9af-4dcc-845d-83e82d623061"><a href="#Props" data-content-chunk-id="1c623364-4d1d-45ff-9063-f2fa349d1da2"></a>Props</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4e288e71-2263-4279-a056-f3973599ef72">Props can serve as artifacts from your game’s world, atmospheric focus pieces, or complete distractions. The first rule of creating props for your game isn’t to overdo it. Props can be nice to have, but shouldn’t become chores to create, reasons to delay game sessions, or distractions from play. Props can be as simple as a whiteboard for notes or sharing pictures of characters or monsters to increase their memorability. Furniture, whether by its arrangement or removal, can suggest a specific location. Props can even represent game mechanics, such as tracking hit points with crimson flat glass marbles in clear goblets. Ravenloft in particular has a history of featuring props in its adventures (see “<a title="Tarokka Deck and Spirit Board" href="#TarokkaDeckandSpiritBoard" data-content-chunk-id="700fd92b-85af-4f01-b1fd-03865aa06c4d">Tarokka Deck and Spirit Board</a>” section later in this chapter). The world of creating custom props is endless, but don’t compare your game to performances with whole production budgets.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Distractions" data-content-chunk-id="b4f4f6e7-bb5c-4e8f-ab4e-5816730b6db9"><a href="#Distractions" data-content-chunk-id="27f68199-eaec-4d77-b305-2c6a9d45d94b"></a>Distractions</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d0f3b711-9c6e-4972-ade4-765ff60ab133">A distraction for one player may be a necessity for another. Discuss compromises that benefit everyone. Maybe food and non-game items are kept away from the play space. Perhaps phones and tablets are permitted as long as they are silenced and used away from the table. Additionally, not everyone is comfortable being photographed or identified in public discussions of a game, whether in real-time or after a session, so ask about the place of social media in the game before making assumptions.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheDungeonMaster" data-content-chunk-id="695aa108-fffd-42b0-a163-433927434904"><a href="#TheDungeonMaster" data-content-chunk-id="a99674d1-800d-4097-b67e-0cbb8cc8c773"></a>The Dungeon Master</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b8f3ea22-8378-450a-972b-54d54fe91741">You have incredible control over your game’s tone and atmosphere. Model the behaviors you want players to emulate by staying focused on the game, letting others speak in turn, heading off encroachment on boundaries, and complimenting exciting choices. Stand or pace during intense moments. Speak faster or sound anxious when something scary is happening. Raise the volume of your voice during pitched battles and whisper during tense or conspiratorial moments. Allow yourself to sound uncertain, correct yourself, or pause as if you heard something outside. Ask players, “Are you sure?” Engaging with the suspenseful atmosphere you want to create helps bring it into being around you.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HorrorPacing" data-content-chunk-id="c444fd78-a14d-4996-b90e-bd6240085786"><a href="#HorrorPacing" data-content-chunk-id="9d394959-1ddd-45ab-a088-b86d63420d18"></a>Horror Pacing</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="77cb713d-43ca-4d17-b775-3cb8d7eaf8b7">Pacing is the speed and energy with which your story unfolds. This relates to the amount of action in your game and, in a horror adventure, the tension or frequency of suspenseful moments. Everything can’t be scary, and continuous terror is unsustainable. Before players grow numb to endless tension, create opportunities for them to catch their breath and regain a temporary feeling of calm. The best horror adventures are like roller coasters, ratcheting up suspense and releasing it before building toward the next harrowing moment. Also, mix up social interaction, exploration, combat, and other types of encounters to create interesting and engaging pacing. Ensure that scenes are always somehow relevant to your story and move characters toward their goals.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Logistics" data-content-chunk-id="ba0d81db-ac42-4a5f-a8f8-d43b6bd4b525"><a href="#Logistics" data-content-chunk-id="59f649da-8e63-422a-9a6d-1afec1d4a9a0"></a>Logistics</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a7e0120f-82a4-45d4-96c2-125ef7f16cea">You often have less time to play than you think once late starts, food breaks, and other interruptions are all taken into account. When planning your adventures, account for less time than your full game session.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="UndermineReality" data-content-chunk-id="c070a1af-f90d-414f-b5c3-0aa6ddff55f5"><a href="#UndermineReality" data-content-chunk-id="bfdf2839-f027-4f53-b03b-f1479beea0c5"></a>Undermine Reality</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e5354647-50fa-442e-9e92-4719e52aa407">Dread and uncertainty are keys to engaging horror adventures. Horrific experiences or supernatural settings undermine assumptions about what can or can’t happen. Have a character wake from a prophetic nightmare with a fresh scar. Have a threat characters are fleeing appear ahead of them. Make candles gutter, paintings cry, animals whisper curses, or gigantic eyes peer through windows. Did these things actually happen, or are characters’ senses turning against them? The answers often don’t matter, particularly when the Mists provide explanations for all manner of casually dreadful impossibilities.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="IdleUneasiness" data-content-chunk-id="5b0e6de5-d3c6-4527-bcc6-5099fec99506"><a href="#IdleUneasiness" data-content-chunk-id="d3053f1b-953b-4dfd-a571-c40f8f92381a"></a>Idle Uneasiness</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="227adb82-91c0-429c-a9d2-5efd7cd8c7b4">Occasionally slow your adventure’s pace to draw out the tension you’ve established. Linger on describing sensory details. Ask players to describe what their characters are thinking, feeling, or fixating on. Detail the ways objects could be used violently, words could be lies, and shadows could hide monsters. Ask players what they think is the worst possible thing that could happen right now. Describe feelings of being watched. Hint that the characters are being hunted. Let characters respond to these stray thoughts. Sometimes these impressions should just be their nervousness getting to them. But sometimes it’s the calm before a threat strikes.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="OutofTime" data-content-chunk-id="34d88797-565b-4416-8668-822a041a38b3"><a href="#OutofTime" data-content-chunk-id="3cd052e8-43f7-42f0-8e19-e3142a59f731"></a>Out of Time</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b644feb8-4bfd-4f90-bb11-5d1a1e0ae6f3">When the time for action comes, make your narration feel urgent. Speak quickly and in short bursts. Focus less on senses and more on descriptions of impact—a splash of crimson, who knows where it came from? Split the characters’ attention. Roleplay other creatures begging, panicking, and trying to escape. Politely demand players react quickly: “There’s no time to debate—what do you do?”</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ParallelScenes" data-content-chunk-id="712c69fa-8e10-4d1a-a636-d2f128621bd8"><a href="#ParallelScenes" data-content-chunk-id="d7847241-13ac-4603-b853-07988bb5504b"></a>Parallel Scenes</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0ddbff5f-972b-40a5-8c29-51f3504efcd4">Occasionally encourage players to split the party. When characters are separated, cut back and forth between them. Encourage everyone to watch even scenes their characters aren’t in. Keep these split scenes short, and when an exciting event occurs, cut away and make the players wait for resolution. Give characters things to tell one another when they meet again. Players can then decide whether or not their characters trust such reports.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ab1ce575-6057-41ca-bdbf-6f684c3173a5">Reliability and trust are just as important to your horror adventures as lurid shocks. Frequent betrayals encourage paranoia that can paralyze players. Emphasize that certain people and locations will never turn on the characters through repeated positive encounters. The players can trust these allies, but can they keep them safe?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cbb241ed-1d88-4a12-8b1e-12005bb92547">Fear without hope tempts paralysis and apathy, which can ruin the game. Reward characters who behave dramatically, heroically, or in ways that increase the game’s frightful atmosphere. Rewards might include brief scenes focused on a character’s actions, opportunities to regroup and rest, clues to adversaries’ weaknesses, and discoveries of actual treasure. To maintain character agency, avoid having strangers or allies of the group rescue characters from problems they got themselves into. By the same token, don’t throw characters into impossible situations. Never let hope die.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ded5e195-c6a9-4606-b385-4f16b3b9b0e3">Leave players excited to play again. When ending a session, implement one of the following to conclude on a cliffhanger: hint at a new threat, impose a complication on existing plans, increase the stakes, introduce a new mystery, have a foe appear, have the world change, or otherwise shock the characters, then call for a break before players can react.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e9b4ad5e-db78-469b-8c0e-1960989af782">The horrors populating your adventures can take endless forms, whether they be foes, impending events, or magical forces. Rather than just naming what the terrible thing is, inspire your players’ imaginations by describing a horror indirectly in stages. <a title="Chapter 5" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/monsters-of-ravenloft/" data-content-chunk-id="7962153a-58ca-4f14-bfd1-89825cd71e16">Chapter 5</a> features advice or making familiar monsters more frightful. Also consider the following elements when describing terrors:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2bd62201-cde5-49c5-9af8-d8ec885b068e"><strong>Before It Arrives.</strong> Foreshadow the horror’s approach. How do the environment, nearby animals, the weather and nature, and the light and shadows react?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ed55574b-2046-4700-83e6-cb0ef9e80386"><strong>Approaches.</strong> What sounds does it make as it moves? What parts do characters see before the whole comes into view?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5605d81f-09aa-49ea-a166-2bc268dd0e12"><strong>Up Close.</strong> What does it smell like? How does it breathe? Does it cool the air around it or bring heat wherever it goes? How does it stand? When it reaches out to grab a character, what does it feel like?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8b8a78c3-8b4a-4ecf-b485-882c9aa45fbc"><strong>Attacks.</strong> How does it attack? Does it have weapons, or does it use its body to fight? Does it have sharp claws that rake across flesh, or is it a supernatural force that warps what it comes in contact with?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c4bb1cbd-73c1-4ca5-8de6-e3da83d79e17"><strong>Wounded.</strong> When it’s wounded, how does it react? What does its blood look like? What is inside it instead of flesh and blood? When it becomes desperate, how does it react?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9a503805-cf0b-469a-8f97-393ca63579f5">Invite players to turn their imaginations against themselves. Leave details intentionally blank, describing just enough to reveal gaps that inspire horrific implications. Fixate on a specific trait, like only describing a vampire’s eyes as it attacks.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a810d03-2ea5-495e-9bb2-bc15931c4292">Alternatively, directly ask players to fill in details. Ask questions like these: What does the way it moves remind you of? It emits the worst smell—what is it? Something falls free and, for an instant, what are you certain it is? Players’ responses don’t need to control the narrative; it’s up to you whether they’re true or just one perception.</p>

<li data-content-chunk-id="bb55b91d-bac1-409b-b3a5-77e97e7076e5">Feature monsters that are immune to tactics characters often use but that are vulnerable to other strategies the characters could employ.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="f2b9dd26-2a31-41bf-88b7-61dcd2539f20">Have foes spend combat actions doing things that are fundamentally creepy, like chanting to sinister gods or regurgitating their last meal.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="b3099405-6d37-465b-b7b3-42a306f2c3d4">Use another creature as the opening act for the true threat. A notorious monster is all the scarier when it emerges and rips apart something the characters assumed was their true antagonist.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="77c5fdbc-f7cb-4c56-b02e-81470fdd839a">Have foes play dead, only to “return to life” after characters think things are safe.</li>

<p>SUBVERT CLICHÉS</p>
<p>When characters and worlds feature clichés, they become dull and predictable. If your favorite horror story features outdated tropes, your fondness doesn’t redeem them. To create dynamic and compelling characters, consider the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid drawing inspiration from stock characters in fiction or film.</li>
<li>Treat characters as real people with real motivations. Put yourself in their shoes. What would you do?</li>
<li>Show how multiple people from the same culture are different.</li>
<li>Feature members of different genders, ethnicities, and sexualities, as well as people with disabilities and of varied beliefs, as having broad roles, professions, interests, and outlooks. Endlessly work to quash stereotypes.</li>
<li>Don’t use cliché accents, especially to represent marginalized people.</li>
<li>Matter-of-factly provide opportunities for everyone to be exceptional. Magical settings bear no resemblance to real-world history, and character creation rules presuppose no standard bar for heroics.</li>
</ul>

<p data-content-chunk-id="21d3c928-b740-4c88-a97e-15e527aba921">A typical D&amp;D session is longer than a typical horror movie, and it can be hard to sustain the atmosphere for hours on end. Plan to take breaks during your game session, and encourage players to step away from the table if they need to. If you feel like the game has gotten intense or taken a turn someone’s not enjoying, ask, “Is everyone comfortable with continuing?” before proceeding. If anyone’s not, thank the players for their honesty and hasten the game to a cliffhanger. Before the next game session, talk with the group about the best way to move forward in a way everyone can enjoy. Work to create a supportive environment where players can admit to being uncomfortable without fearing that they’re going to ruin everyone’s fun. As DM, you can model this behavior by noting when you’re shying away from a creepy idea that comes to you or thanking players who uphold the game’s boundaries.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be1acbde-cd30-4e72-93d1-daa55bdc3e55">Beyond impromptu checks, once during a session, after a scheduled break, check in with the group and consider asking the following questions:</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="37bee47f-b67a-46d8-af1f-bb5d238de78f">Players put considerable thought and investment into their characters. Don’t impose rules on characters that might make players not want to play them anymore. For example, characters might gain any of the <a title="lineages" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/character-creation#Lineages" data-content-chunk-id="120d371b-97a9-46d5-881e-2429f8c55ba4">lineages</a> and <a title="Dark Gifts" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/dark-gifts/" data-content-chunk-id="ddab9eb7-d53f-4002-bbf3-b3fab6f691cf">Dark Gifts</a> from <a title="chapter 1" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/character-creation/" data-content-chunk-id="47f45def-a7c8-41bc-b917-eeedfe7a69b7">chapter 1</a> during play. If there’s an opportunity for a character to gain one of these options, ask that character’s player if they’d be comfortable with such an adjustment before imposing it. If the player says no, consider other options.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee383e53-a42e-4735-94da-52d1353002cb">Beyond rules considerations, some actions also require special consideration before they occur in game, such as these examples: romance between characters, violence between characters, one player’s character influencing or controlling another player’s character, and yelling. All players (including the DM) must ask and gain permission from everyone playing—not just the affected players—before introducing this content. Without any explanation or debate, if a single person gives a thumbs down or doesn’t respond, this action shouldn’t be performed. Players may change their minds at any time. If a topic was listed as a boundary, it is off the table entirely.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ContentTools" data-content-chunk-id="e894ea50-1bcd-400b-be20-09eb0ad4b041"><a href="#ContentTools" data-content-chunk-id="b1abdba4-3315-467e-aa0e-92099f571f56"></a>Content Tools</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b27d215a-66ad-4f9c-863b-858725170d38">Content tools enable you and your players to adjust the game’s content as you play. Since D&amp;D is improvisational, the game can go in unexpected directions. If a direction makes the game a worse experience for anyone, use these tools to correct course.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="825809e8-b96b-41f9-9eca-0f8873e8b58e">Many content tools exist, but a popular one involves passing a blank note card to each participant, (including the DM) and instructing everyone to draw an X on their card. One uses their X-Card to signal to everyone else in the game that a boundary has been crossed. If you are playing remotely, players can lift the X to the camera, type X in a chat window, or cross their arms to form an X. In any case, this is a sign that something that just happened is off limits. The person touching the card can comment on what they want adjusted, or whoever’s narrating the scene can walk back what just happened, try something else, or leave the scene with a vague ending (like in a film where things fade to black). The person using the content tool doesn’t have to explain why the content is objectionable, nor should anyone question it. Instead of a debate, thank the person for being honest about their needs and move on.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b0322c3e-4a50-405b-a21f-f32353d296db">Make it clear to players that if a person doesn’t feel comfortable using a content tool, they can wait for a break to check in or talk to you privately. Players may also give a friend permission to use the card on their behalf. As the DM, lead by example. Treat content tools seriously and use them to adjust how your shared story plays out.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6c08bc4f-8438-4aaf-9835-536eb3f8854d">If players seem disengaged, check in with them. Ask them what they would like to see happen next. If they don’t know, write two or three options down, hand them the options privately, and ask them to choose one. If issues remain, call for a break, and privately ask what you can do to make the game more engaging.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d7cfbaf1-c3d8-42ae-b6c8-5768737d0bd1">It’s always a good idea to check in with players at the end of a session, but this rings especially true for adventures where tensions run high and the stories can elicit strong emotional responses. At the end of a horror game session, leave time to check in with players and ask them how the game went, how they’re feeling, and what they liked about the session. You might ask the following questions:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="9c5d6d3f-2563-4e23-bf2c-f107f0127f81">
<li data-content-chunk-id="2ff9d9c9-1994-42f3-bdee-2283602f4bb5">What unsolved mysteries do you want answers to?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="4fa2791d-3af0-44c8-929d-c265d87c040b">Did you find anything confusing or off-putting?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="d8cb1774-4ec2-40c0-9a25-b1211db6a415">What are you looking forward to in the next session?</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="05929f9d-b4d2-4802-8fe9-d6f14ad19e3b">These answers can help you craft the next session to create a game your players enjoy.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dcb50979-74a6-4acc-b7d0-5aae7d8507af">If players give short or vague answers or you suspect that trust at the table has been broken, try creating an anonymous space to receive feedback. It’s important to hear honest feedback from players so you can ensure everyone is fully immersed in the story and you can address any issues that might prevent them from enjoying the next game session.</p>

Such atmospheric scenes immerse players in an experience unique to the Land of the Mist. Two fateful tools used in such encounters are detailed here, the tarokka deck and spirit board. Consider including these mystery-steeped props in your own Ravenloft adventures, or use them as inspiration to create other immersive experiences.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="de29ad05-a52c-4f50-b70e-175ce528761c">In both 1983’s adventure <em>Ravenloft</em> and 2016’s adventure <em><a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos" title="Curse of Strahd">Curse of Strahd</a></em>, the plot changes in accordance with cards drawn from a tarokka deck. A tarokka deck contains fifty-four tarot-like, fortune-telling cards, each one bearing one of the following symbols:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8f26be14-cf41-4ef5-8b89-1a6f4df8cbe5"><strong>Crowns.</strong> The portentous cards of the high deck are marked with crowns but are not themselves a suit. The figures on these fourteen cards represent distinct forces of fate, change, and despair.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01ec2659-04f8-4147-97bb-02746ceae35a"><strong>Coins.</strong> The ten cards of this suit symbolize avarice and the desire for personal gain.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee8e62f5-2958-4488-9ad6-7270abc73522"><strong>Glyph.</strong> The ten cards of this suit symbolize faith, spirituality, and inner strength.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7e6924ca-7b94-4b62-bc39-6401d7ff7d7a"><strong>Stars.</strong> The ten cards of this suit symbolize the desire for personal power and control over mysterious forces.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be8dd0ef-6051-4823-802a-9d4e02b7da01"><strong>Swords.</strong> The ten cards of this suit symbolize aggression and violence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c4bf5e5e-4437-44f3-bbf3-656b6ff25471">Tarokka decks allow you run encounters where fortune-tellers predict characters’ fates. Once you’re familiar with the cards and their meanings, you can interpret them in ways that tie in to the characters’ pasts or events in your adventures. You can also use the results of tarokka readings to guide your campaign and make sure predictions come to pass.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e7b909df-22ee-47c0-8793-a724eb776672">The tarokka hails from the same world as the domain of Barovia, but it and its users have since spread throughout the Domains of Dread.

<p data-content-chunk-id="a9d8975d-9159-4012-86d4-576b3784b685">Setting the stage for horror isn’t entirely a product of good storytelling. As highlighted throughout this book, any rule might take on a terrifying cast, whether you present it as having some grim source or you customize it with ominous new options. This section goes a step further, providing options to make existing rules more terrifying and presenting systems that encourage unique horror experiences.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Curses" data-content-chunk-id="ed8045df-2d9a-4114-b4af-57c5dca5d124"><a href="#Curses" data-content-chunk-id="cb12c0cb-06ac-4c3d-b61f-847625ccfa2b"></a>Curses</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cba679a4-b63f-4a02-960a-1209ebc6e797">An ancient warning echoes in a tomb robber’s mind. A lost treasure bears a magical affliction, assuring it remains lost. A dying priest’s last breath carries a portent of doom. Curses come in myriad forms, presaging terrifying tales and distinctive dooms.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4fb14db8-0791-4ea3-b526-1f2f1f539473">This section provides guidance for creating dramatic curses, either distinct from or as part of curses resulting from magic, monsters’ actions, or other effects. These curses provide ominously poetic responses to fateful choices and afflictions that last until they’re alleviated by specific remedies. Spells at the characters’ disposal might relieve these curses’ effects temporarily but can’t lift them completely. The price must be paid.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LayingCurses" data-content-chunk-id="ce61fea2-3683-4a0a-85f9-f639bd093b1d"><a href="#LayingCurses" data-content-chunk-id="94d01730-9a4f-4de3-bd21-3bf53a0b1d0f"></a>Laying Curses</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c2984d8f-31b3-403b-a730-a7f6304e4ced">Curses aren’t something to throw around lightly. They should be dramatically appropriate responses to meaningful choices characters make. If every goblin or bandit coughs out a dying curse, the narrative impact fades. There should always be a way to avoid a curse, and a curse’s effects should clearly arise from wrongdoing. Here are some examples of actions that warrant a curse:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="cc0299d5-c152-4fcc-918b-499d13df811f">
<li data-content-chunk-id="47b1c9ad-634d-4bcb-a202-c9d061a36c2e">Defiling a sealed tomb</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="284176b6-e0f4-4f32-9ab4-fdf68a5b75fa">Desecrating a temple</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="aae20816-0d85-4e2d-b7ed-50e49892e3e9">Slaying a villain who is backed by a powerful entity such as a demon lord or a deity</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="e346a4b4-e55c-42a4-a7d0-8ad198951101">Murdering or grievously harming an innocent</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="36ad82dc-6408-4d3c-b276-2faa70e01f91">Stealing a treasure that is meaningful to an entire culture</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="717c06e9-0617-4bcd-8eda-6900f70d0b2f">In cases where the curse arises from a creature, such as a dying villain’s last breath, the pronouncement of the curse is clear. When there is no wronged party present to lay the curse directly, the curse should be obvious in some way, such as a warning of dire consequences carved into the wall of an ancient crypt or relayed by a spell such as <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2177-magic-mouth" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2177-tooltip">magic mouth</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6a23b2b3-7329-4146-ac15-8699b9f3884c">Most curses have three distinct components: pronouncement, burden, and resolution. Whatever form these take, at least one of them, especially the burden or resolution, should have an ironic connection to the action that triggered the curse.</p><figure id="imgdyingpriestofezra" class="compendium-image compendium-image-left"><a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-center" href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/04-004.a-dying-priest-of-ezra.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title=""><img src="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/vrgtr/U9mBj5XfiTD1mHie/04-004.a-dying-priest-of-ezra.png" class="ddb-lightbox-inner" style="width: 400px;" alt=""></a><figcaption>A dying priest of Ezra

<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Pronouncement" data-content-chunk-id="ee825012-6a78-400a-840a-81b234d92826"><a href="#Pronouncement" data-content-chunk-id="6d773b5b-9d4a-452d-a4fa-a9fbab590d1e"></a>Pronouncement</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a3e6b885-c4fd-4a76-ab79-bd70518cea12">The first component of a curse is the pronouncement, which amounts to a threat. It promises suffering to those who dare to perform or have already performed a specific offensive act. The pronouncement can be a standing warning against taking some action, or it could be a declaration in the moment. The following examples suggest just a few possible pronouncements:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="445e7556-f76a-4d65-b662-3bd5adfe2e8e">
<li data-content-chunk-id="1d36dc3e-cf6d-4307-b6c8-975abeab5c5f">A widely spread story explaining that a particular action tempts terrible punishment</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="44d2a259-6a44-4c2f-b01f-90116f1b1345">A warning spoken on the cusp of a deadly battle, assuring dire consequences for the victorious</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="2e8bb419-5fe5-472a-a26f-b96fe8bc5078">A poem, rhyme, or song foretelling doom</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="edb29a91-da6e-4767-af04-8cc2b9dc41ee">A carved epitaph on a gravestone discouraging robbers</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="2263a4f4-3a26-4b03-95db-b2ab1e021de8">The last words of a dying person—either a powerful villain or a wrongly slain innocent</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="68ab2151-05a7-4e5c-97c4-63a3af17e6d6">Swearing a vow to refrain from or undertake some action on pain of great suffering</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Burden" data-content-chunk-id="a02f82ca-75f4-45b6-a423-8e69ea57aacb"><a href="#Burden" data-content-chunk-id="5b3d599d-c77e-4bc5-b810-0a17ebf4793d"></a>Burden</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="41c146c4-0ac0-41c9-aa0f-6f37b5864257">A curse’s burden is the effect that causes hardship and suffering to the curse’s victim. A burden is often reflective of what caused the curse in the first place, twisting the transgressor’s action against them. The burden takes effect immediately, along with a vague sense of foreboding—such as a chill down the spine or a wave of nausea. The victim might not notice the curse’s effect until a situation arises to make it obvious. For example, a character cursed with clumsiness that manifests as disadvantage on Dexterity checks might not notice anything until they make such a check. Burdens can take many forms, such as the following:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="c4bbe8aa-e32f-4724-9a3a-2be9ac77877f">
<li data-content-chunk-id="58cdb306-da2a-48f5-a42e-5f0cf320cc97">The victim has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, or some combination of the three. This can be tied to a single ability score or applied generally.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a8be1eed-3f07-4aaf-8a99-7a2078e49455">The victim can’t communicate using language, whether through speaking, sign language, writing, telepathy, or any other means.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="0d294884-cc28-4d4e-866f-3442998fc250">The victim gains 3 levels of <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/4-tooltip">exhaustion</a> that can’t be removed while the curse endures.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="86129c1f-8ca2-4d1b-9669-7cedf3230e7b">When the victim finishes a long rest, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or their hit point maximum is reduced by 1d10. If this reduces their hit point maximum to 0, the victim dies, and their body crumbles to dust.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="651763fc-31d7-47fd-85e3-0a59885db5f5">When the victim takes damage, they take an extra 1d10 necrotic damage. This effect can’t happen again until the start of the victim’s next turn.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="e62943e3-96eb-4e4c-9d5b-9fc0dfd4bd9c">The victim gains a Dark Gift (see <a title="chapter 1" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/dark-gifts" data-content-chunk-id="285707cb-4e08-49e8-9d51-00046a362ca9">chapter 1</a>) appropriate to the circumstances surrounding the curse.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="26aa44d6-521a-4e04-8134-01420cf7849f">The victim gains vulnerability to one damage type.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="8cd18214-ecf2-4c49-9786-bd42acf8626b">The victim’s Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score is reduced to 3, and the victim can’t be raised from the dead while the curse lasts.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="c73f4f8b-85d7-4a33-98c7-51a72a4da4f6">A monster hunts the victim relentlessly. Even if the monster dies, it rises again or a new one takes its place 24 hours later.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Resolution" data-content-chunk-id="b88a9b68-8c63-4645-ae1d-27f10b4a7c43"><a href="#Resolution" data-content-chunk-id="5a2aeaaf-f142-4f2e-88fb-f8d2759bb499"></a>Resolution</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c936028-7f41-4328-baa0-6b5499ac0979">Sometimes a curse can be ended by making restitution to a wronged party (or their closest kin in the case of a death) or reparation if something was stolen or destroyed. The resolution might be declared as part of the pronouncement, or it may be left to those who suffer the curse to make amends on their own. Research and divination can offer clues or even reveal the exact steps needed to resolve the curse.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="755b2501-d776-4301-996e-9a122916ed83">While more general curses can lifted by a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2229-tooltip">remove curse</a> spell, more specific or dramatic curses can’t be permanently lifted through spells. Magic can offer temporary respite, though. A <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2229-tooltip">remove curse</a> spell cast on the victim of such a curse suppresses the burden for 1 hour. A <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2129-greater-restoration" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2129-tooltip">greater restoration</a> spell suppresses the burden until the victim finishes a long rest. Death usually ends a curse, but the curse returns in full force if the cursed character returns to life without resolving the curse.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d29268ad-12a7-4770-8c6c-4768c7fec789"><em><strong>Persistent Curses.</strong></em> When a curse is resolved, its effects usually end immediately. Some more insidious curses might linger beyond the resolution but can then be removed by a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2229-tooltip">remove curse</a> spell or similar magic if the victim succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast. If the save fails, it can be repeated after a specific interval passes, usually 1 month, with the curse ending on a successful save. Adjust the DC of a particularly weak curse to 10 or that of a stronger one to 20.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1a0d00e6-e20e-41f2-b9a1-f238409bbc9e">Here are some examples of curse resolutions:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="7a3e3cac-9383-4211-a5aa-f77598c80b0e">
<li data-content-chunk-id="c1729985-b233-42ba-b4ac-d109aed206fe">Protecting a loved one dear to the person who laid the curse from some dire threat</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="81fff4b2-afc8-4f86-b0b5-32d5241fa8dd">Returning every piece of a stolen treasure hoard, down to the last copper coin, to the place where it once rested</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="52a0f35c-6e0d-403c-b190-a4ae08d14932">Slaying the head of a dynasty that has long held power in the region</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="55658791-f6c4-4464-a5e9-8d45dc85224a">Accomplishing a seemingly impossible task, such as raising a castle above the clouds or making the sun cross the sky in a different direction</li>
</ul>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fa8603dd-9a64-49c9-87f6-601bcf2028d3">Provided here are several example curses and the circumstances surrounding them. Change the details of any of these examples to customize them to your adventures.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cc0706ff-a077-4134-be0c-2a10f7f1e0c2">This curse protects the resting place of a long-dead ruler and punishes any who disturb the ruler’s remains or plunder the treasures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f61a2734-8573-4228-8ed6-be8b6fc116fd"><em><strong>Pronouncement.</strong></em> Carved into the stone of the crypt door are the words “Relentless death follows those who disturb the sovereign’s rest.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="347ece47-9bb5-4cd1-a8fb-bb7ef161e8f3"><em><strong>Burden.</strong></em> Each character that gains the curse is hunted by a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17064-wraith" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17064-tooltip">wraith</a> that appears at sunset and vanishes at dawn, pursuing the single-minded goal of slaying the cursed individual. The wraith manifests in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of its victim. Destroying the wraith grants a temporary reprieve; it doesn’t reform for 10 days. You can scale this curse for lower- and higher-level characters by choosing another kind of creature.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="12f6232d-571a-4771-9ae0-558a6f5a0aa7"><em><strong>Resolution.</strong></em> The cursed character sets right what they disturbed; stolen treasure must be returned, and if the ruler’s body was disturbed, it must be reinterred with proper observances.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BrokenVow" data-content-chunk-id="79b2752c-1f33-454c-a683-981dd6edf1fc"><a href="#BrokenVow" data-content-chunk-id="df5cc43f-3f84-4d5f-a214-f5fe1d9b3fa5"></a>Broken Vow</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3ce080e1-cc37-4625-a572-1fe678088397">A character breaks a solemn vow. The consequences stem from the powers that observed the oath’s swearing.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3da3692a-ef9a-4df1-9f48-de1be7745a2a"><em><strong>Pronouncement.</strong></em> Whatever vow the character made, it came with an implied warning that guilt and restlessness would beset anyone who broke the oath.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="133551ef-4231-413d-bfc3-09be64bd145f"><em><strong>Burden.</strong></em> The character is plagued by restless sleep and recurring nightmares featuring those the character swore to protect. The character gains 3 levels of <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/4-tooltip">exhaustion</a> that can’t be removed until the curse ends.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="41535b2e-9e00-42bd-bb7c-b2cde0fa0076"><em><strong>Resolution.</strong></em> The curse lasts until the character upholds the broken oath. That might require the character to wait until the circumstances arise again or, more questionably, to engineer the circumstances.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FinalBreath" data-content-chunk-id="4895d07c-31a5-424e-b0d4-0564b16884b8"><a href="#FinalBreath" data-content-chunk-id="7746b1cb-8211-4628-a480-c1911da9a48b"></a>Final Breath</h3>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1d16002b-0375-40c7-9889-0a3698e45c62"><em><strong>Pronouncement.</strong></em> The dying creature declares to the killer, “May your mind grow dim in battle until the sun sets forever.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b3b0fde8-9d14-405a-bd05-f3b72a8000d4"><em><strong>Burden.</strong></em> The character has disadvantage on attack rolls brought on by brief, sporadic bouts of confusion.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0dc46117-2d44-4d7d-9f14-ffa51aee3114"><em><strong>Resolution.</strong></em> To lift the curse, the character must cause a symbolic setting of the sun or an empowering of the night to appease the slain creature’s deity. The character might prevent a festival dedicated to a sun god or perform a ritual that shrouds an entire settlement in magical night for 24 hours, thus ending the curse.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="InnocentBlood" data-content-chunk-id="95ac2576-6ad7-4165-9b5b-501987bda6a4"><a href="#InnocentBlood" data-content-chunk-id="04201a58-d0c0-4db3-a049-2b5b78306f8a"></a>Innocent Blood</h3>

Options exploring fear provide guidance to create frightening moments for a character outside of spells or monster abilities, while rules for stress model the lingering toll such events can take. None of these options are required to create an enjoyable horror roleplaying experience, but they provide ways to measure the effects of characters facing and overcoming their fears.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="42d4ac40-3539-4124-b94f-d47bd71dc5f4">Aside from supernatural sources of dread and monsters who strike terror in their victims, fear is subjective and often quite personal. A battle-hardened warrior and a reclusive scholar might not deal with frightful circumstances in the same way. During character creation, a player can choose up to two Seeds of Fear to represent things their character finds truly frightening. The Seeds of Fear table offers some examples. These can change over time as characters grow, overcome old fears, and discover new uncertainties. Work with players to determine when their Seeds of Fear might change.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2d05d37d-4fd2-4991-98e9-c24a2b0362c6">A character never has more than three Seeds of Fear; if you gain a new seed and already have three, choose which of your old fears is replaced by the new one.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="aea37f53-8f68-432c-b1b5-903d13fb9d5f">When a character encounters one of their Seeds of Fear, and interacts with the situation in a way that reinforces the seed, such as screaming or stumbling back from a horrid event, consider giving the character inspiration for their fear-focused reaction (see “<a title="Inspiration" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#Inspiration" data-content-chunk-id="12e33c38-bc95-4bfd-8dad-12711c75b208">Inspiration</a>” in the <em><a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" title="Player’s Handbook">Player’s Handbook</a></em>). Once a character gains inspiration in this way, they shouldn’t be able to do so again until they finish a long rest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c2d49de8-2be7-436e-bbca-2f66889719e2">For example, imagine that a character has the Seed of Fear “I hate being stuck in tight spaces” and must squeeze through a narrow crack in a cave wall to continue an adventure. If the player portrays the character’s response in a way that reinforces that fear, such as refusing and finding another way around, taking time and making noise to widen the crack, or portraying some other fearful response, these would be perfect opportunities to reward the player’s consideration of a Seed of Fear by granting their character inspiration.</p>

During any frightful encounter, you can call on a character to make a saving throw to resist being scared.

<p data-content-chunk-id="e99a3e89-5ef5-4c83-af49-3ce4ec4255f5">Charging headlong into terrifying situations is the stock in trade for adventurers.

Even the hardiest adventurers find themselves worn down over time, their performance suffering as they struggle to cope with the dread and despair.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e9b2775a-16f8-4f51-a3b4-ef20747de040">Various circumstances might cause a character stress.

<p data-content-chunk-id="74da0d35-962b-4557-974b-c69d5549004f">Like other traps, haunted traps represent threats leveled toward trespassers. They originate in an area spontaneously, often resulting from overwhelming negative emotions, tragedy, or evil. Just as some terrible fates might cause a tormented individual to rise as an undead creature, so might supernatural evil and violent emotions manifest more generally as one or more haunted traps. Such traps provide a way to theme the dangers and monsters of a haunted place to reveal a grim history or frightening tale. When creating haunted traps, consider what events brought them into being and how the trap’s effects suggest those origins.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DetectingHauntedTraps" data-content-chunk-id="f9162932-0e98-4d86-a936-8530b356e3c9"><a href="#DetectingHauntedTraps" data-content-chunk-id="bb84adf3-4f27-45f1-a3da-7e563ceb5be0"></a>Detecting Haunted Traps</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8f00ac56-1471-40fa-8c0d-ca97660c784f">Every haunted trap has an emanation, which might be as subtle as a drop in temperature or as overt as an object moving of its own accord. A haunted trap’s emanation occurs before the trap takes effect. A character notices the emanation if their passive Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) score equals or exceeds 10 + the trap’s Haunt Bonus. A character who notices the haunted trap has until the start of their next turn to react, which might include fleeing to avoid the trap or attempting to disarm it (see the following section). Class features and spells, such as <a title="Divine Sense" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin#DivineSense-260" data-content-chunk-id="a1bc8b9f-d84f-466f-bdd7-e4ac67cbf110">Divine Sense</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2064-detect-evil-and-good" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2064-tooltip">detect evil and good</a>, that discern desecration also detect haunted traps.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c586be12-a617-4679-903c-7373f0295c6a">Characters who notice a haunted trap before it activates can attempt to disarm it. Typical methods of disarming traps, such as thieves’ tools and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2072-dispel-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2072-tooltip">dispel magic</a>, don’t affect haunted traps. However, the Channel Divinity class feature and the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2229-tooltip">remove curse</a> spell can disarm a haunted trap.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="23322d37-5ebf-4a52-8d63-015d70cb4533">To use Channel Divinity to disarm a haunted trap, a character uses an action to present their holy symbol and speak a prayer. To use <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2229-tooltip">remove curse</a> instead, a character must cast the spell and touch an object that is part of the trap. Whichever disarming method is used, the trap itself then makes a saving throw against the character’s spell save DC, adding its Haunt Bonus to the save. On a failure, the trap is disarmed for 24 hours. If the trap fails the save by 10 or more, the trap is disarmed permanently.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ffca677-bb03-43bb-b4f1-e1786fed3a58">Depending on the haunted trap’s origins, certain spells might also affect the trap. For example, a haunted trap with a fiendish origin might be permanently disarmed by the spell <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2071-dispel-evil-and-good" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2071-tooltip">dispel evil and good</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="465c4a59-7315-4bdc-a429-8e4a673e9ed4">Some haunted traps might also be disarmed in nonmagical ways related to the history of a haunted area. Such methods might be as simple as wearing the clothes of a haunted house’s former owner or singing a lullaby that soothes a restless spirit. Haunted traps disarmed in such ways typically remain disarmed for 24 hours.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8501d43b-1f5a-4774-8aeb-0baba911a2b4">This haunted trap affects a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on an ancient but pristine instrument. When a creature enters the area, the trap’s emanation manifests as the sound of distant, mournful music. A round later, a phantom performer appears and begins playing the instrument for the next minute. While the performer plays, any creature that enters or starts its turn in the haunted trap’s area must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or float 20 feet into the air and be affected by the spell <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2160-ottos-irresistible-dance" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2160-tooltip">Otto’s irresistible dance</a>. There they are joined by illusory dancers as they dance for the remainder of the performer’s song. As an action, a dancing creature can repeat the saving throw to end the effect on itself, whereupon it falls 20 feet and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. If a creature’s saving throw to resist the trap or to stop dancing is successful, the creature is immune to the haunted trap for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4a93fecd-2609-488d-a22f-905c1ce11b96">While the phantom performer plays, any creature within the haunted trap’s area can use an action to try to convince the performer to stop playing, doing so with a successful DC 14 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check.

When a visible creature enters the area, the trap’s emanation manifests as the creature’s distorted reflection in the mirror.

After the haunted trap is activated, it won’t activate again for 24 hours.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9825cdaa-206f-4e28-ad56-20408b8ce995">Terror doesn’t come just for the brave and prepared—often quite the opposite. Some of the most harrowing horror stories involve the least likely heroes, individuals who find their simple lives transformed into waking nightmares.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d9dc52e-0a34-4075-971a-d1084f717358">In most horror adventures, your players will employ familiar, adventure-ready characters. That doesn’t need to be the case, though. Instead, for short, low-power adventures, immersive retellings of tragic events, out-of-body experiences, or other unique tales, consider providing players with temporary, stand-in characters called survivors.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="39ecba4b-78e8-4cfd-8d4f-12313ee33532">This section provides guidance for using survivors, characters designed for one- to three-session adventures focused on survival rather than saving the day. Using survivors helps create horror experiences focused on the dread inherent to having limited resources and facing impending doom without forcing players to risk their favorite characters.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="UsingSurvivors" data-content-chunk-id="e7b56e69-79b3-4087-a5f3-a5aac64a0dba"><a href="#UsingSurvivors" data-content-chunk-id="31aea881-0912-482f-9106-3a0e437b70da"></a>Using Survivors</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7eb8f0a7-9ea5-49f8-b800-4810f9d00510">Survivors are premade characters that are simple and easy for players to master, while being customizable enough to fill broad roles in your adventures—whether they be farmers or bored nobles, constables or babysitters. Adventures employing survivors are meant to be asides within broader campaigns or otherwise short experiences.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CutScenesDreamsandMemories" data-content-chunk-id="68744edd-3911-474e-b2a0-b314e98aad49"><a href="#CutScenesDreamsandMemories" data-content-chunk-id="0b014d2f-83b1-417a-8e37-9fabc64d056b"></a>Cut Scenes, Dreams, and Memories</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b5ba6ca4-3db5-4b96-a927-152fe693f417">Use survivors to provide information to players in the form of a self-contained adventure. Even if it doesn’t make sense for a campaign’s characters to be present for an event, survivors can provide players with perspectives they wouldn’t otherwise have. For example, you might use survivors in the following ways:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="c954f63b-6fb6-46e8-a8b5-51cfbf3de69c">
<li data-content-chunk-id="54a1970b-c8a6-4418-92ce-9c64c18e6b95">Survivors serve as the first constables on the scene during a serial killer’s crime. Afterward, when the players’ other characters get involved in the investigations, the players know the details.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="cba0bb50-7d27-47ce-bb9d-8c8de7deeb4a">Survivors give every player a part to play in one character’s ominous nightmares, such as those resulting from encounters with the mind flayers of Bluetspur (see <a title="chapter 3" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/bluetspur/" data-content-chunk-id="0867dc78-2616-4cf3-9645-0e9a19245f84">chapter 3</a>).</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="4ace96d5-d428-4718-aae2-5fb3f8d686ad">Survivors provide players front row seats to important historic events. It’s one thing to hear about the massacre at Castle Ravenloft following Strahd von Zarovich’s transformation into a vampire, but it’s another to play it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MindtakerMists" data-content-chunk-id="258e25e6-e684-4501-81fa-273f11d1cec9"><a href="#MindtakerMists" data-content-chunk-id="6be7f3cf-3549-4dca-8e87-9df2f883cf4f"></a>Mindtaker Mists</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="80bf9de9-46bc-4767-83c4-cd141231e337">The Mists frequently kidnap characters from across the multiverse, dragging them into the Domains of Dread. They don’t always claim their victims bodily, though. Rather, the Mists might steal characters’ minds, placing them into survivors involved in specific terrifying scenarios. Perhaps characters suddenly find themselves mentally recast into someone defending against a zombie siege in Falkovnia, attending a ball in Dementlieu, or exploring the tombs of Har’Akir (see <a title="chapter 3" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/domains-of-ravenloft/" data-content-chunk-id="edc08979-5459-49b2-9b27-122e0be0a2fe">chapter 3</a> for details on such adventures). Whether the characters survive or meet spectacular ends doesn’t matter, as death might mean a return to the character’s original body, a second chance to try again, or a stranger fate.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TerribleFreedomDelightfulDoom" data-content-chunk-id="71b45586-fee3-4c8f-a0a9-58e0c0e9afe1"><a href="#TerribleFreedomDelightfulDoom" data-content-chunk-id="99bb2b98-f4e3-4047-9a92-cb584e2e3f5d"></a>Terrible Freedom, Delightful Doom</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08fb4738-f89a-4aa2-983f-8a63f7a8a572">Make sure your players know how long you plan to use survivors and that they’ll be playing their usual characters again soon. Also let them know that survivors are designed to engage with terrifying circumstances, but their triumph over such threats is not assured. Players’ decisions will certainly impact the survivors’ fates, but if it seems like doom is in store, encourage the players to embrace it and make sure their survivors meet unforgettable ends.</p>

When a group runs out of hit points, spells, food, or other vital reserves, tension and dread increase. High-level characters, though, have such resources in spades. By running an adventure using survivors, you can recapture some of the same tension adventurers experience early in their careers, encouraging players to use their wits and make desperate choices powerful characters can avoid.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ToolsforTerror" data-content-chunk-id="4e93377a-8b45-438e-a694-076f8e464300"><a href="#ToolsforTerror" data-content-chunk-id="3c29aee0-c3e3-431b-a175-b8a4a668d3de"></a>Tools for Terror</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a2ac776e-45a3-4c63-a748-146aafe8c1c0">Survivors allow you to control how players will engage with a horror adventure. The stat blocks in the following section are designed to be easy-to-use characters with a hint of talent but little that makes them remarkable:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f1891220-0e7e-40f3-a3df-043e3bef7f4f"><strong>Apprentices</strong> have a minor talent for magic and tend to be well-read.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="416d916f-984b-45d3-a79a-7c32731d0632"><strong>Disciples</strong> faithfully adhere to the tenets of their chosen religions and receive spells from the deities they worship.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="47b02e0a-ec9c-4ebc-97ee-1fcfb24043ae"><strong>Sneaks</strong> survive by their wits and are often charlatans or petty thieves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="feb9331b-2648-41c3-91a6-9f2904501a72"><strong>Squires</strong> possess a modicum of martial training and are stalwart companions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2cd59cec-1b17-4e7a-a4b1-57bae30c11ce">Determine how you want to use survivors in your adventure. If it’s important to the story, perhaps all the players use the same stat block, representing their shared experience—a group of Sneaks might all be detectives while a band of Disciples might face a terror unleashed upon a monastery. You can also allow players to choose their own survivors, as any survivor might fill a general role like noble, villager, or sailor with a touch of talent. Make use of these ready-made characters in whatever ways suit your adventure best.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CreatingaSurvivor" data-content-chunk-id="395e4fea-86c5-4e5a-8dd8-d4ca021b2dea"><a href="#CreatingaSurvivor" data-content-chunk-id="256574fa-f942-41a5-88ed-e00073a966fe"></a>Creating a Survivor</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="73ae875d-360f-43de-a363-ce78bcef50b3">When you plan a session using survivors, determine how you’ll use the <strong>Apprentice</strong>, <strong>Disciple</strong>, <strong>Sneak</strong>, and <strong>Squire</strong> stat blocks that appear in the following section. Once you’ve determined what survivors to use, take a few moments to individualize them. If the survivors have particular roles in your adventure, provide that information to players along with their survivors’ statistics; otherwise, let them come up with their own details. Players can give their survivors names, personalities, and lineages, but these details don’t affect the survivors’ stat blocks.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Levels" data-content-chunk-id="544a912d-6fed-4f30-b3b3-6150f3db73d3"><a href="#Levels" data-content-chunk-id="8843cf5c-c9b5-44ba-9002-ac11f93cee8c"></a>Levels</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="440bad33-59d2-47d3-aa9f-7eeef652ad70">Survivors don’t possess classes as detailed in the <em><a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" title="Player’s Handbook">Player’s Handbook</a></em>. Despite this, you can make a survivor marginally more powerful by increasing its level. The stat blocks present the survivors as they are at 1st level. Rather than gaining experience points, a survivor increases in level whenever it makes sense for your adventure. When a survivor gains a level, it gains the benefits on the Survivor Progression table. A survivor that advances from 1st to 2nd level and from 2nd to 3rd level gains access to the player’s choice of Survivor Talents (see the section below).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="448c0a6e-4b60-40e4-a442-5b4098ec96bf">Whenever a survivor gains a level, it gains one Hit Die and its hit point maximum increases. To determine the amount of the increase, roll the Hit Die (the type that appears in the survivor’s stat block), and add the survivor’s Constitution modifier. It gains a minimum of 1 hit point per level.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9f237f2b-f6f1-4efe-a7a4-82bebcf982e0">If a survivor drops to 0 hit points, it falls <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a> and subsequently makes death saving throws just like a normal player character.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="293bd587-2263-49f0-8a9e-4dcb32747c10">At 2nd level and again at 3rd level, a survivor gains their choice of one of the following talents. A survivor can’t gain the same talent more than once, unless a talent’s description says otherwise. If a talent has a prerequisite, the character must meet it to gain the talent.</p>
