        to the world of Krynn. In a single day, an age of wonders came to an end. Countless innocents died, the face of
        the world was reshaped, and the gods themselves faded into legend. Through ages of struggle, the peoples of
        Krynn survived, but the world isn’t what it was. Those nations that remain linger in the shadows of their
        ancestors’ wonders. Only slowly have they begun to push back centuries of darkness and rediscover how the world
        has changed.</p>

        devoted to the wicked god Takhisis the Dragon Queen, and the world faces ruin once more. The War of the Lance
        has begun, and in a conflict between gods and dragons, a wounded world hangs in the balance.</p>

                <p>To the Council of Maelgoth:</p>
                <p>War is coming—that truth I can no longer deny. Here in Solamnia’s eastern reaches, rumors swirl of
                    human-led armies on the march, their ranks swelled by hobgoblins, minotaurs, ogres, and mysterious
                    hooded mercenaries, all seeking a share of the spoils. Our allies in Nordmaar have fallen silent,
                    and desperate travelers say the people of Khur have joined the enemy en masse. Whispers also speak
                    of winged doom, wild reports of riders on dragonnels—and I dare imagine worse.</p>
                <p>I don’t yet understand the shape of our enemy. Their motivations, their origins, and their very
                    nature remain opaque. What is clear is that we face a threat unlike any since the Cataclysm. And
                    when it comes, it will come for Kalaman.</p>
                <p>Good lieges, I pray you make overtures toward healing the old wounds between our order and the Beacon
                    of the East. If we knights are to meet this threat, we need the sharp eyes and strong shields of
                    Kalaman as allies.</p>
                <p>To aid your efforts, I have compiled my notes on the Kalaman region’s history, neighbors, and lore. I
                    hope this knowledge proves useful in meeting the threat before us.</p>
                <p>Live with honor,</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="0e9d8bf2-0103-4d79-bf89-7db5a5f5e62e">While every world’s history is vast and fractured,
        with missing pieces and forgotten perspectives, Krynn’s tale has been shattered by the global catastrophe called
        the Cataclysm. The world of Krynn was forged and destroyed, yet—broken and scarred—it continued on. Most of its
        people, seeking merely to survive in their slowly healing lands, care little for eons past. But the sages who
        piece together fragments of the past focus on three periods: before the Cataclysm, the Cataclysm itself, and the
        dire age since.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BeforetheCataclysm"

            data-content-chunk-id="238789da-388d-4920-9ea2-deadac8eeff5"></a>Before the Cataclysm</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d1a5bf06-0f89-481e-9d76-ab4335603deb">Krynn’s earliest centuries have passed into
        mythohistory. The story begins in the Age of Starbirth when the gods forged the world from primordial chaos.
        This period’s records are mere legends and scriptures, and few credit their details as fact.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f09c0099-3851-48c9-97ab-3ca1726f7ba2">Next came the Age of Dreams, a time when heroes
        battled the forces of evil. Many modern cultures and institutions saw their origins in this era, including the
        Knights of Solamnia, the Mages of High Sorcery, and the dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin. Ironically, these
        cultures often dismiss one another’s foundational stories as baseless myths while fiercely insisting on the
        veracity of their own.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c549a8d7-329f-447e-a8cb-755bad038aa3">During a terrible conflict known as the Third Dragon
        War, the knight Huma Dragonbane was granted the first of the fabled <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"
            href="/magic-items/4047212-dragonlance" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4047212-tooltip">dragonlances</a>.
        He used it to defeat the evil god Takhisis the Dragon Queen and end the war, forcing the god and her dragons to
        leave Krynn. The good dragons of Krynn soon departed as well, leaving the world to mortals and the remaining
        gods.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="9cfb342f-d97b-4868-9568-53fe37f1ca67">During the thousand years before the Cataclysm,
        known as the Age of Might, several human nations flourished, conquering vast swaths of the continent of Ansalon
        in the name of good. But the triumph of the Age of Might sowed the seeds of its downfall.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c9f41169-aca5-499e-b2e4-436779c64e1f">Over the centuries, the city of Istar in eastern
        Ansalon grew into a continent-spanning empire, thanks in part to a military alliance with the Knights of
        Solamnia. Istar came to be ruled by a series of kingpriests who declared Istar the center of the world and
        themselves the holy messengers of the gods of good. Under their leadership, Istar declared war on actions,
        peoples, and even thoughts the kingpriests considered evil. Increasingly rigid and theocratic, Istar reached its
        apex of power just before its apocalyptic fall. The last kingpriest undertook ever more audacious magical feats,
        culminating in a ritual to attain godhood and rule Krynn forever in the name of good. At last, the gods acted,
        united in their condemnation of Istar.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheCataclysm"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="250741e3-0954-4171-8e6a-445f145ed620">As a last effort to avoid mass destruction, the gods
        sent the Thirteen Warnings, a series of signs meant to deter the kingpriest. Trees wept blood, fires raged
        unnaturally, and cyclones struck the gleaming Temple of the Kingpriest. The gods also warned a few chosen
        mortals, reasoning that if any of them reached Istar and prevented the ritual, the world might not be beyond
        redemption. But the messengers failed—the kingpriest and his followers dismissed the warnings as the work of
        evil and continued on their path. As the hour of the kingpriest’s ritual to attain godhood arrived, the gods
        whisked away their most devout followers and unleashed punishment on all who remained.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="aeff348f-31b9-42d6-8889-d90930c61c97">A mountain of fire fell from the sky, destroying
        Istar. The Blood Sea—a new ocean that split eastern Ansalon—consumed the empire. Coastlines shifted all over the
        world, sundering nations, drowning whole regions, and stranding ports miles from the sea. Though some lands
        escaped the worst of the destruction, none were spared divine wrath.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a285d881-d8eb-4e88-951f-7eb889bb6def">The gods and their blessings then faded from the
        world, and in time, even their names were all but forgotten.</p>

                <p>The Cataclysm! It looms larger than any other event in the history of our world, forever dividing
                    time into before and after. Even our calendar reflects this, marking our last four chaotic centuries
                    in years After Cataclysm (AC), while the millennia before, stretching back into shrouded myth, are
                    Pre-Cataclysm (PC).</p>
                <p>Many records of the time before the Cataclysm are lost to us. Those that do survive are often
                    perplexing, referencing nations and cultures that no longer exist and geography that has changed
                    beyond recognition.</p>
                <p>Still, it is possible to piece these scattered sources together. At the request of the good knights
                    of Maelgoth, here are my notes, compiling a rough introduction to the histories recorded here at the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="bdf900f2-c35e-49eb-be05-097042a03fdb">The Cataclysm ushered in a period of chaos. During
        the next three centuries, known as the Time of Darkness, cultures and ecologies were radically altered, causing
        famine, plague, and mass migrations. The Knights of Solamnia, the champions who might’ve kept Ansalon united,
        were distrusted as former allies of Istar and persecuted across the continent, even in Solamnia.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="92e2678d-31a5-4521-9932-d0cac9b3030a">The elven nations shut their borders. The dwarves of
        Thorbardin withdrew to their deep tunnels, refusing entrance to refugees from the surface. Many societies turned
        on one another or fell to disease and war. Nations of hobgoblins and ogres spread, capitalizing on humanity’s
        decline and claiming whole regions. Much that survived the Cataclysm was lost in darkness.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c22fff76-e548-4474-806a-ee56e1fcd185">At length, the worst effects of the disaster waned.
        Though many elves and mountain dwarves remained reclusive, other cultures tentatively rebuilt. Explorers
        ventured forth to map the drastically altered continent. Societies reestablished bonds of trade that united and
        diversified them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5a0952cc-5d0d-40be-be69-891ba4c38ef8">As the civilizations of Krynn rebuilt, and new
        societies arose, the world learned to live with a jarring truth: the gods were truly gone. Religion on Krynn was
        altered forever. True clerics, who once worked miracles on behalf of their gods, had vanished. While some people
        remained devout, many others turned to false religions in search of answers and comfort. Some of these new
        faiths were founded by charlatans, others by zealots. Some claimed the names of the gods, others dismissed them
        entirely. In this radically changed world bereft of immortal insight, truth became subject to conjecture, even
        among Krynn’s most dedicated scholars.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4e41c7f8-d9bd-4cb8-a36c-0d921f92590f">Even as Ansalon healed, a new threat grew. The
        Dragon Queen Takhisis—known as Tiamat on other worlds—was banished from Krynn over a thousand years ago. Since
        then, she had waited patiently, plotting her return. Unbeknownst to the other gods, she planted a piece of the
        kingpriest’s ruined temple at Neraka—hidden in the volcanic Taman Busuk region. There it grew into a baleful
        shadow of Istar’s greatest edifice. Though this allowed the Dragon Queen to influence the world through a portal
        opened there, a fragment of the temple’s foundation stone was missing, preventing her from fully returning to
        the world. She called on the evil dragons who served her, long withdrawn from the world, and began once more to
        plot the conquest of Krynn.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="42a1f52b-b4f6-4f0d-97fb-1680fa2f9917">Chromatic dragons, acting on their god’s orders,
        stole the eggs of good metallic dragons. The metallic dragons reluctantly pledged to not interfere in the coming
        war in exchange for the promised safety of their abducted broods.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6fe6b6d6-16e2-4b4f-81dd-b87999e1042e">But the Dragon Queen’s servants secretly broke their
        promises. Takhisis taught her followers to corrupt the stolen eggs into monstrous warriors known as draconians,
        gambling that draconian armies will conquer Ansalon by the time the metallic dragons learn of this betrayal.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e2286641-30de-4897-9e53-02c715305c20">Unrivaled by gods or dragons, the Dragon Queen
        unleashes her forces upon a shattered world. In their god’s name, these Dragon Armies begin their conquest of
        Krynn.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4ce6ea24-2f95-4404-9b57-34c853755424">The Dragon Queen’s forces are organized into five
        Dragon Armies. Draconians fill the ranks of each, though the armies’ numbers also include humans, goblins,
        hobgoblins, ogres, and others who seek wealth and a return to pre-Cataclysm glories. Each Dragon Army is
        supported by chromatic dragons and their smaller kin, such as dragonnels and wyverns. These winged terrors
        provide a staggering advantage not seen on battlefields for over a thousand years.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c8d3180c-356d-43bd-81f6-20df44746e75">The Dragon Queen has elevated her five most cunning
        and devout followers to the rank of dragon highlord, each commanding one of her armies. The highlords all report
        to Takhisis’s champion, Duulket Ariakas, but there is no shortage of treachery between—and within—the Dragon
        Armies. The Dragon Queen encourages these conflicts, trusting them to bring the most ruthless and capable
        leaders to prominence.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="422fdba2-6ad3-441c-818a-f40884ac6109">The Red Dragon Army—the first, largest, and most
        powerful of Takhisis’s forces—is commanded by the fanatical Dragon Highlord Verminaard, but he has temporarily
        given control of many of its troops to his acolyte, Dragon Highmaster Kansaldi Fire-Eyes, tasking her with
        spearheading a daring attack on Solamnia. Meanwhile, Verminaard’s force follows whispers from the Dragon Queen
        into the southern lands of Abanasinia.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="492d4972-2380-48f9-b3d4-4aead477f2d0">The ambitious Highlord Kitiara Uth Matar commands
        the Blue Dragon Army. Second in power among the Dragon Queen’s forces, the Blue Dragon Army prepares to join the
        Red Dragon Army’s multipronged invasion of Solamnia. The Green Dragon Army recently came under the command of
        Salah-Khan, a Khur leader who united the region’s nomads under Dragon Army rule. The half-ogre Lucien of Takar
        commands the Black Dragon Army, whose focused force supports the other armies and occupies the lands they
        conquer, including Nordmaar and Goodlund. Finally, the small White Dragon Army is led by Highlord Feal-Thas, a
        Silvanesti elf and black-robed member of the Mages of High Sorcery.</p>

        <p>During this book’s adventures, heroes have the opportunity to influence clashes between mighty armies. If you

        leader Salah-Khan to defeat the Green Dragon Army’s original highlord in battle, then offered to make Salah-Khan
        highlord in his place. In exchange for control over Khur and the surrounding lands, Salah-Khan accepted and
        pledged his people to Takhisis, adding to the Dragon Armies’ ranks. Few can say whether he did so to further his
        own ambitions or to spare Khur a long, bloody conflict, but many Khur view Salah-Khan as a traitor to his people
        and fiercely resist the Green Dragon Army’s occupation.</p>

        eastern reaches, Kalaman is one of the nation’s most vital gateways to the outside world. The city, known as the
        Beacon of the East, rises along a deepwater port near the mouth of the Vingaard River, Solamnia’s greatest trade
        artery. Blessed with the bounty of the river, the benefits of trade, and the fertile soil of the Solamnic
        plains, the Kalaman region flourished even after the Cataclysm.</p>

        coast of the Turbidus Ocean. It might have remained so if not for the arrival of an Istarian trading mission
        centuries before the Cataclysm. Seeing the potential of a deep harbor so close to the mouth of a great river,
        the Empire of Istar invested heavily in the town, transforming it into a thriving trade hub. Solamnia soon found
        Istar’s stranglehold on the booming port intolerable, and after a climactic battle on the plains west of the
        city, Istar ceded control of Kalaman.</p>

        of the Cataclysm, Kalaman remains a thriving port city surrounded by tall Istarian-built walls that have never
        been breached. In its busy harbor, vessels from all over Ansalon go about their business under the light of the
        city’s two grand beacons, pre-Cataclysm marvels that have survived for generations. At the center of the city,
        the ancient Castle Kalaman rises intimidatingly on a sheer hill. The castle’s architectural marvels include
        defenses yet to be recreated in the modern age. The city of Kalaman is further detailed in <a

        most people in surrounding communities make their livelihood through fishing and farming. Many of the region’s
        inhabitants are Solamnic humans, while others descend from the city’s Istarian founders. Traders from all over
        Ansalon settle in Kalaman through preference or necessity. As a result, some humans hail or have ancestors from
        Abanasinia, Nordmaar, Ergoth, Estwilde, and farther-flung lands. Kender, hill dwarves, and gnomes are common in
        the region, while some elves, mountain dwarves, and other people also make their home in the city. Anyone is
        welcome in Kalaman if they come peaceably with goods to trade.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c927c771-23c2-4e02-8274-2466a54ac46f">To the west of the Kalaman region lies Hinterlund.
        Even farther west lie the Plains of Solamnia, from where crops and crafted goods make their way to Kalaman for
        trade. Even in parts of Solamnia closer to the port of Palanthas, it’s often cheaper and easier to move goods
        down the river to Kalaman.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a846a1fe-6964-4449-beec-a25debffde8e">North of Kalaman, the grasslands characteristic of
        Solamnia give way to the broken steppes and labyrinthine canyons known as the Northern Wastes. Deadly beasts,
        treacherous cliffs, and unpredictable flooding make the wastes a dangerous land where it’s said nothing survives
        for long.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d771f02c-04fb-4e58-9a42-2f89891d9c90">East of Kalaman, the lands of Estwilde hold
        inhospitable terrain and peoples who have been unfriendly to Solamnia since the days of Istar. Across the bay in
        northern Estwilde lie the swamps of Qwalmish. To the south and east of Kalaman are the rolling steppes of
        Qlettaar, which in turn give way to the forbidding peaks of the Taman Busuk region beyond Estwilde.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1e32ab29-ab88-4a09-9b60-a0bf09f25c69">For generations, the Soths of Dargaard Keep—a family
        of Knights of Solamnia—ruled the Solamnic province once known as Knightlund. Before the Cataclysm, the gods of
        good forewarned Knightlund’s leader, Lord Loren Soth, about the coming destruction and offered him a chance to
        stop it, but he failed to accomplish this task. Since then, the province has had a cursed reputation. People
        have come to know the land as Nightlund and ascribe the region’s frequent storms to the old gods’ disfavor.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="66e2664c-7118-4ad9-9480-6a2117d9d3ab">The gods of Krynn are said to have abandoned the
        world, and in the great cities of Ansalon, temples and centers of faith are few. Nevertheless, small miracles
        occur across the world. Druids and hidden communities offer prayers in the old ways and employ mysterious magic.
        Long-lived peoples remember the worship of the gods and see their shapes in nature and the constellations above.
        Ancient, forgotten sanctuaries hold wonders beyond imagination, and divine whispers reach those with the minds
        and hearts to listen. The gods haven’t wholly abandoned Krynn, and as threats grow, mortals turn to them once
        more—sometimes after a remarkable encounter with a messenger of the gods.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0249983f-1f66-4755-835a-1649263eb6d7">The gods of Krynn loosely align with one another
        along the principles of good, neutrality, and evil. While such alliances can be tenuous, the gods often work
        together to enact their shared will across the world or to oppose unions of their foes. The Deities of Krynn
        table and the following sections summarize the gods most active in the world. Among Krynn’s diverse lands and
        peoples, gods take various names, genders, and forms. Those presented in the following sections are the
        representations best known in Solamnia.</p>

        <p>It’s easy to blame the gods for the Cataclysm. They sent the Thirteen Warnings and the burning mountain that
            followed. They sank Istar beneath the waves, shattered the continent, and withdrew from the world. They
            chose to cause the immense suffering of the disaster and the centuries since.</p>
        <p>But let us suppose that the gods of good love this world and want us to flourish. That the gods of neutrality
            strive to steward and uphold the agency of mortals. That even the gods of evil, selfish as they are, seek
            power and influence, not destruction for its own sake. Why, then, would they punish us with the Cataclysm
            and leave us in a godless world?</p>
        <p>I fear we’ve forgotten more than we remember. Worship of the true gods is ever waning, and false religions
            rise in their place. I pray every day that we’ve learned our lesson—that the gods will return, and that I
            may cede this chair to one who hears their voices and bears their true blessings.</p>

        eradication of evil or its gods. Rather, their highest pursuit is preserving mortal choice, despite the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5a403b3e-3217-4052-bf95-bda52a83d47e">Paladine is known as the Father of Good, the Master
        of Law, the Platinum Dragon, and—on other worlds of the multiverse—Bahamut. He leads the gods of good and
        watches over the world with an eye toward order, justice, and mercy. He teaches that wise and just laws are the
        basis of a functioning society, and his clerics often aid in crafting and upholding such laws. Paladine
        sometimes appears on Krynn in the guise of Fizban, a befuddled old human mage in faded robes.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="83f744a6-3fbe-43ea-8721-123783096459">Called the Bard King, Branchala is the god of music,
        poetry, and the inner beauty of all living things. Many elves and kender worship him above all other gods. Both
        groups revere him as a champion of life and laughter, bringing solace and joy to those who listen.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="8a7b9445-8ee4-4a83-80ea-d4d260569c95">Habbakuk, known as the Fisher King, oversees animal
        life, the sea, and the balance of nature. Many sailors, farmers, and hunters revere him. His holy sites are
        often marked with the image of a blue bird or a phoenix wreathed in blue flames.</p>

        particularly revered by the Knights of the Sword, an order of the Knights of Solamnia that seeks to root out
        evil wherever it dwells.</p>

        motivations and methods. Some are passive and distant, dedicated to recording the actions of mortals or
        upholding the balance between societies and nature. Others take a more active hand, injecting elements of chaos
        and innovation into mortal life. Unlike the gods of good and evil, the neutral gods have little interest in the
        struggle over mortal destinies.</p>

        neutral gods, Gilean embodies the ideal of neutrality. He stands back and observes, recording all that unfolds.
        Gilean is keeper of the <em>Tobril</em>, a book said to contain all the knowledge of the gods, though portions
        are sealed to all but Gilean. Some people believe the scribe Astinus of Palanthas to be Gilean in human form.

        governing the rhythms of life that unfold heedless of mortal action. Though enigmatic and shy, they are fiercely
        protective of their domain, regarding all plants and animals as their children. Chislev’s followers are often

        patron of the Mages of High Sorcery’s Order of the Red Robes and other neutral mages. With her cousins Solinari
        and Nuitari, she watches over the people of Krynn from the heavens, conveying her power through the red moon
        that shares her name. She appears as a trickster figure in mythology, using her mastery of illusions to fool
        gods and heroes alike.</p>

        commerce. Though many of her followers are merchants, her influence spans legitimate and underhanded commerce
        alike, and she receives occasional worship from thieves. Despite this, most consider her a god of fair dealing;
        supplicants pray she favors them as they bargain.</p>

                of alchemy, transformation, serendipitous creation, and flames. He embodies momentary excitement,
                flaring quickly into fiery passion and smoldering long afterward. Sirrion’s followers embrace extremes

    <p data-content-chunk-id="439f5dff-51ac-4efa-8538-c239e4893844">Takhisis, leader of Krynn’s evil gods, is known as
        the Dragon Queen, the Queen of Darkness, and—on other worlds—Tiamat. She is the god of power, pride, and
        control, as well as the queen of chromatic dragons. She tempts mortals to her service with offers of dominance
        over others. Barred from Krynn since before the Cataclysm, she found her chance to return in the centuries that
        followed. She sometimes appears as a powerful human warrior with gleaming armor and long black hair, but her
        true form is a five-headed dragon.</p>

        tempting his followers with the promise of immortality. Those who heed him find that while they may live
        forever, their bodies still decay and putrefy. Followers of Chemosh embrace his baleful reputation, dressing in
        white skull masks and black robes.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4efc3df4-e221-4896-ba7a-31d1450cb3ec">Hiddukel is the god of greed and treachery. He holds
        domain over all ill-gotten wealth in the world, and criminals and unscrupulous traders worship him in secret.
        While Hiddukel gladly accepts their worship, his true goal is the acquisition not of riches, but of souls.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6393632a-19bb-4654-85bc-1ddd186d2f75">Solitary and secretive, Morgion is the god of
        disease and decay. He doesn’t consult or act in accord with the other gods, preferring to brood in his
        otherworldly fortress, the Bronze Tower, and pursue his own schemes. His worshipers follow his example, meeting
        in the dark and maintaining secrecy in all things.</p>

                her behalf. He is worshiped by those who seek retribution. His true form is that of a monstrous
                minotaur, and many minotaurs revere him under the name Sargas.</p>

                beneath the Kharolis Mountains of southwest Ansalon for thousands of years, but the centuries since the
                Cataclysm have created new divisions within it.</p>
            <p data-content-chunk-id="7faf85c4-78b2-4ea5-af81-3e2c3edf745c">The dwarves of Thorbardin divide themselves
                into ancient clans. Many generations before the Cataclysm, dwarves who dwelled on the surface
                established the Neidar clan, known for working the land and trading with other surface folk. In the wake
                of the Cataclysm, with food scarce and the future uncertain, the High King of Thorbardin sealed the
                gates of the kingdom to all outsiders, including the Neidar. Betrayed and hungry, these surface dwarves
                allied with other desperate refugees and unsuccessfully attempted to take Thorbardin by force. The
                conflict that came to be called the Dwarfgate War caused deep enmity between the dwarven communities of
                the surface and those that live below.</p>

        are the unquestioned rulers of Thorbardin. Many great fighters, engineers, and artisans call these magnificent
        halls home. Proud and reserved, most Thorbardin clans want nothing to do with outsiders—dwarves or otherwise.
        However, some dwarves grow tired of life within their ancient tunnels and wonder about rejoining the world
        above.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3a65c4f6-5c4b-4717-83bc-682560143964">As a mountain dwarf, you might come from a dwarven
        nation like Kayolin or Thorbardin. You could be part of an expedition of traders or explorers, sent by your
        people to live on the surface for years before reporting back. Or you might have ventured forth on your own,

        years following the Cataclysm on the surface. Now known as hill dwarves, they lived among the lands and peoples
        of the surface for centuries. Few still call themselves by their old name, the Neidar, preferring to forget
        their ties to their mountain dwarf cousins.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d3f7609a-e84f-4781-9dee-9fd4bd4f91ce">Some hill dwarves live as traveling traders, while
        others make their homes among the communities of Ansalon’s other peoples. Still other groups eke out lives in
        ruins or harsh lands as reclusive survivalists.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="35eff976-2503-4504-a38d-64b3ca2bb208">Over two thousand years ago, the Kinslayer War
        divided the high elves of Ansalon into two groups, Silvanesti in the east and Qualinesti in the west. Through
        the intervening millennia, neither group has sought reconciliation. In the even more distant past, both high elf
        nations separated from their Kagonesti kin, while the waves themselves isolate Dargonesti and Dimernesti from
        their surface-dwelling cousins.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="93dd2b14-4959-48b7-841d-e4b2380ad37d">As the elves of Ansalon largely keep to themselves,

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b694faf1-7597-4900-9eb7-17e2cfbc98e8">Silvanesti, the original elven kingdom, lies in
        southern Ansalon. For untold generations, the aloof Silvanesti elves lived in a stratified society closed to
        outsiders. They don’t hate their cousins in Qualinesti, but they consider their ways misguided.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0c81c707-bae4-440f-92f4-fd3bc31357de">In recent years, war has come to Silvanesti. When
        the Dragon Armies besieged the realm, the leader Lorac Caladon, Speaker of the Stars, ordered his people to
        evacuate. Lorac then attempted to defend the kingdom with an <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"
            href="/magic-items/4690-orb-of-dragonkind" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4690-tooltip">orb of
            dragonkind</a>—but the artifact’s magic unexpectedly warped Silvanesti into a nightmarish land. The
        surviving elves of Silvanesti now find themselves a people without a homeland. Most journeyed together across
        the sea to Southern Ergoth, seeking refuge with the Kagonesti, while others refused to give up Silvanesti and
        sought to reclaim their ancestral home.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a90d1b6d-23f1-4b76-b39c-15cb76a04853">As a Silvanesti high elf, you know what few in
        Ansalon do: the home of the elves has fallen. During the Dragon Armies’ invasion of Silvanesti, you might have
        been separated from your people or even taken captive before escaping the Dragon Armies in unfamiliar lands. You
        could have fled Silvanesti with your people but now seek a way to restore your homeland. Or perhaps you’ve spent
        your life exploring the world, cultivating relationships with people other than your kin.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="11dbd870-88ee-4b8f-bd22-5263bd8f1eab">Long ago, a group of high elves left Silvanesti,
        desiring a more egalitarian society. They traveled far to the west and founded a new forested homeland called
        Qualinesti. Less hierarchical than their progenitors and more willing to deal with outsiders, Qualinesti elves
        even enjoyed good relations with the dwarves of Thorbardin. Since the Cataclysm, however, they’ve withdrawn from
        the world, and few outsiders dare approach their well-guarded borders.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4774c505-fb48-49ef-9d47-379c0b2660ec">As a Qualinesti high elf, you might have been raised
        in seclusion in the forests of Qualinesti. You could have been sent forth to learn the state of the wider world
        or to pursue rumors of Silvanesti’s fate. Or perhaps your family left Qualinesti long ago, and you have
        connections with folk from other lands.</p>

        settled in the forest cities of Silvanesti, instead living a nomadic way of life and seeking harmony with
        nature. Most of these wood elves live in small tribes in the forests of Southern Ergoth. Although few outsiders
        intrude on the Kagonesti’s ancient forested lands, thousands of Silvanesti refugees have begun seeking their
        aid. While the Kagonesti welcome their cousins and seek to support them, they refuse to be overwhelmed by the
        Silvanesti’s numbers and distinct ways.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3ebcdbcc-8d8a-4cc0-8589-ced9e1619fcd">As a Kagonesti wood elf, you likely spent a great
        deal of your life in the forest and know much about the natural world. You might have left years ago to explore

        are often called shoal elves. Although Dimernesti live closer to land, they have deep bonds with the sea and all
        life within. Both groups of sea elves are rarely seen by the peoples of Ansalon and keep to their own aquatic
        communities. Though sea elves are exceptionally rare, you can create <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="a9ba24a3-09db-4da7-b881-548ab9ddb072">Humans are ubiquitous on Ansalon. They ruled the
        continent’s largest empires before the Cataclysm, then were scattered during the devastation that followed. Many
        humans never resettled after the Cataclysm, joining itinerant and nomadic cultures. Human cities are few and
        usually small, developed around natural structures that sheltered communities following the Cataclysm.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dc71e6f8-ff4e-4a13-9dc3-262db13192c0">As a human, you might hail from any corner of Krynn.
        Below are just a few of the distinct human nations of Ansalon. You might be a member of any of these societies,
        or you can choose another home to define as you please.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3b7e979a-010b-46bd-a40c-056d5d4c838a">Several peaceful communities dot the Abanasinia
        region, including Solace, a village built among the branches of towering Vallenwood trees. In recent years, the
        theocratic Seekers have risen to power in the region. This power-hungry religion controls the city of Haven and
        surrounding settlements in the name of vague, fickle deities who condemn the use of magic.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="56f32d04-bb75-4b3d-a888-3ce204feb380">The broad plains of the northern Abanasinian
        peninsula are home to nomadic humans known as Plainsfolk. Divided into several tribes with territories across
        the region, Plainsfolk are skilled warriors, traders, and collectors of stories that predate the Cataclysm.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="82394247-9eca-4734-9ce1-db1f0ec48368">The Cataclysm split the land of Ergoth in two,
        dividing the remnants of the human empire that once ruled there. On Northern Ergoth, scattered communities claim
        to be inheritors of the fallen Empire of Ergoth and dwell among the remnants of its cities and fortresses. These
        Ergothians enjoy a prosperous peace with the kender enclave of Hylo and the goblins of the arid southern lands,
        with whom they share their island. Fewer humans make their home on Southern Ergoth, living primarily along the
        coast and avoiding dangerous groups of ogres and giants.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1b58d8f1-5d59-4c65-9701-822612a575e3">Once a mighty empire, Solamnia has fallen from the
        glory it knew. Though Solamnia remains one of the largest and most prosperous nations on the continent, its
        provinces are self-concerned and prone to squabbling. The land’s once-legendary defenders, the Knights of
        Solamnia, are much diminished in numbers. Nevertheless, the knights still stand as defenders of the innocent and
        paragons of honor.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Tarsis" data-content-chunk-id="1bc4a521-df03-4f7d-8b35-a66360ed63fe"><a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b8556bbc-317a-4152-ab3d-f49b8ce9b80c">After the Cataclysm, the verdant plains of southern
        Ansalon wasted away, becoming the Plains of Dust. Coastlines shifted, and the city of Tarsis found itself a
        seaport without a sea. In the dry harbor, decrepit remnants of the city’s famed ships list on waves of sand. The
        rest of the city clings to life as a trade hub for small communities and itinerant bands across the plains.
        Those who dwell here have adapted their ancestors’ seafaring ways to their current arid environment, becoming
        hunters, scavengers, and traders.</p>

        tribes of Khur inhabit a harsh, rocky land. These groups have been forcibly united under the local leader
        Salah-Khan, who allied his people with the Dragon Armies. A robust resistance, centered at the trade hub of
        Khuri-Khan, opposes the invaders.</p>

        almost supernatural curiosity and fearlessness. These were the first kender.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="029ac5d5-2e35-4a49-834f-c0f49bbfbb4a">Many celebrated heroes have risen from the Knights
        of Solamnia, the most storied knighthood on Ansalon. The knighthood began over a thousand years ago, during the
        reign of the Ergothian Empire in western Ansalon. Vinas Solamnus, head of the Ergothian imperial guard, was sent
        to eastern Ergoth to put down a massive rebellion. However, Solamnus learned of the rebels’ grievances and, won
        over to their cause, he and the rebels marched on the Ergothian capital of Daltigoth. The capital fell, and
        Vinas Solamnus was crowned king of a new independent nation on the eastern plains, called Solamnia in his honor.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c5f613fd-c41f-480a-a94d-74a0ea825c71">King Solamnus sought above all to rule this new
        society justly. On the Isle of Sancrist, at a black granite stone in a secluded glade, he prayed to the gods for
        guidance. Three of the gods of good appeared to him: Paladine, god of justice and order; Kiri-Jolith, god of
        just warfare; and Habbakuk, god of nature, loyalty, and the elements. The three gods inspired three orders of
        knights that would guard the realm together as the Knights of Solamnia.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6bd3631c-f508-464f-a8b5-c3b81b68013e">Before the Cataclysm, Solamnia was a beacon of peace
        and prosperity. The knights established great cities and castles across the Plains of Solamnia, including
        Solanthus, Castle Brightblade, and Dargaard Keep. They ruled in accordance with the ideals of Vinas Solamnus,
        and they forged an alliance with Istar that spread those ideals across the world. The people of Solamnia
        attributed their prosperity to the wise and just rulership of the knights.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8aaaffcc-50cd-424d-b418-772d267a5448">In the wake of the Cataclysm, faith in the
        knighthood soured to suspicion. Rumors spread that the knighthood had possessed the power to avert the Cataclysm
        and either failed to or chose not to—perhaps to dispense with Istar and solidify the knights’ power.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5832dfee-550d-44a9-8295-777976c985e3">Most knights still tried to defend the realm as
        their duty demanded, but they found themselves beset on all sides, dying to protect people who rejected and
        persecuted them. Most fled to Sancrist Isle in the west or retreated to the protection of their strongholds and
        keeps, while others disguised themselves to continue their work.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d3c0fe75-e72c-4768-b6c5-ff85a5302a7e">Their power waning, the knights today are locked in
        a bitter internal feud: Is it better to maintain their strict codes even in the face of obsolescence, secure in
        the knowledge they were true to themselves? Or should they embrace a changing world and fight to defend it, even
        if the knights must change with it?</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1876d272-acc1-4a6f-b379-b830600a680f">The Knights of Solamnia follow a chivalric code with
        two parts: the Oath and the Measure, both inspired by the writings of Vinas Solamnus. The Oath is simple and
        aspirational—a star to navigate by—while the Measure lays out specific rules for the organization and conduct of
        the knighthood.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f63211cf-4d99-4c9f-85fa-02eec413c51d"><em><strong>The Oath.</strong></em> The Oath of the
        Knights of Solamnia has been the same since Vinas Solamnus founded the knighthood: “Est Sularus oth Mithas,” or
        “My Honor Is My Life.” This principle—to sacrifice all for the sake of honor—guides the actions of every knight,
        at least in theory.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d39a1c57-139d-4433-a441-ce1d6a2217c6"><em><strong>The Measure.</strong></em> In contrast
        to the Oath, the Measure is a staggeringly complicated, excruciatingly specific guide to knightly life.
        Originally put forth by Vinas Solamnus as an organizational scheme and code of conduct for the knightly orders,
        the Measure grew over the years to encompass thirty-seven volumes, covering everything from courtly etiquette to
        the proper saddling of mounts. According to the Measure, the knights no longer have sufficient numbers to elect
        a new Grand Master, the highest office in the knighthood, leaving them without an authority who could overrule
        or update the Measure.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2d86ef76-0139-4558-9350-81fb6ab630c6">Despite this, a growing minority of knights push for
        a reform of the Measure, believing that it’s unwieldy and outdated and that it no longer serves the ideals laid
        down by their founder.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="0edd2e78-19f3-4f58-8744-3e8f17f39d86">Each Solamnic knight belongs to one of three orders.
        Each order, led by a High Knight elected from among its number, has its own hierarchy and rules for admission.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="40b54d35-6a48-4c9e-a168-85f62058388d"><em><strong>Knights of the Crown.</strong></em> Most
        knights begin their journey as squires in the Knights of the Crown, who honor the god Habbakuk as their patron.
        The order emphasizes ideals of loyalty and obedience that serve as a bedrock whether a knight chooses to remain
        within the order or move beyond it. Knights of the Crown are expected to aid any knight who requires assistance
        and any kingdom on the List of Loyalty, the official roll of the Knights’ allies.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9893bfb7-0c06-491e-97f8-581faf9fcf89"><em><strong>Knights of the Sword.</strong></em>
        Dedicated to heroic honor, courage, and reverence for the true gods, this order upholds the virtues of
        Kiri-Jolith, the god of just war. Members dedicate themselves to courageous sacrifice, pledging to defend the
        defenseless without regard for the knights’ personal suffering. Knights who join this order often undertake a
        heroic quest to prove their worth.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dad5f40e-0907-44dc-b864-366bb9cea743"><em><strong>Knights of the Rose.</strong></em>
        Guided by the god Paladine, the Knights of the Rose exemplify honor tempered by wisdom and justice. Before
        joining their ranks, most knights rise within the Knights of the Sword after serving with the Knights of the
        Crown. Those who prove both their loyalty and courage are fit to join this order, which upholds the knighthood’s
        highest ideals.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ad73f8b9-7ff2-4989-a1b9-b1c90f23d7af">Many magic-users on Krynn are members of an ancient
        organization known as the Mages of High Sorcery. Predominantly composed of wizards—with a lesser number of
        sorcerers, warlocks, and other spellcasters—members are divided into three orders. Each order dedicates itself
        to virtues extolled by a god of magic and honors the moon its deity is associated with. The three orders
        cooperate as part of a single organization, overseen by a council of experienced members known as the Conclave.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="26dc74bd-1d6d-4c5d-82d6-7fd725d65c02">Equally devoted to the study of magic and united in

        accept the solemn responsibility of using magic only to make the world a better place. The path they walk is a
        narrow one, and almost daily, a mage of the White Robes faces the agonizing decision of whether to intervene in

        help others when it suits them and use their gifts for their own enrichment as they desire. Mages of the Red
        Robes are expected to wield their power responsibly, represent their order faithfully, and uphold the balance
        between good and evil in their own actions and the world at large.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2bc42eec-032a-43ba-b86b-c86bc7627263">Often reviled and feared in equal measure, the Black
        Robes follow the example of the evil god Nuitari, the black moon of Krynn. A mage of the Black Robes is expected
        to first further their own ambitions, then pursue the goals of their order, and then support the continued

        cooperated to build five Towers of High Sorcery, centers of learning to advance the craft of magic and the
        interests of the orders. Three of the towers were destroyed during the Cataclysm, and a fourth—the once
        unsurpassed Tower of Palanthas—lies cursed and empty. The only tower remaining in operation, the Tower of

    <p data-content-chunk-id="124a9b91-db4d-43b2-b431-e2098517564f">An apprentice mage who seeks to join one of the
        three orders must first pass a trial known as the Test of High Sorcery. Every mage’s test is different, tailored
        to both the order they wish to join and their own personal challenges and aspirations. Nonetheless, a few
        elements are always present.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a6e02165-54a4-4ae7-a45d-023a7644ebea"><em><strong>Lethal Failure.</strong></em> The
        primary purpose of the test is to weed out those who would misuse magic. Every test is designed so failure means
        death. There is no judge, no score, and little chance of surviving a failed test.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a60db1b3-a91a-4098-ba30-d52f0e72af79"><em><strong>Magical Acumen.</strong></em> A mage
        must wield magic with competence, creativity, and control. Every test requires a mage to use the most advanced
        magic they’ve learned—and, sometimes, to push beyond it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="47fb974f-b6fe-4c0d-90b6-825ffcecd776"><em><strong>Test of Character.</strong></em> The
        mages of the Conclave need to know the apprentice will honor the laws of their order, no matter the
        circumstance. To this end, the test confronts an apprentice with bitter moral and emotional choices as well as
        magical challenges.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2fa9430f-99fd-4c59-9170-3c26c4f7b142"><em><strong>Illusion and Reality.</strong></em>
        Friends, enemies, and loved ones might appear in the test, along with all manner of hazards and puzzles. The
        applicant has no way of knowing which challenges are illusory and which are real. In some cases, the test has
        lasting consequences for an applicant’s life beyond the order.</p>

        Mages of High Sorcery, or they fail the Test of High Sorcery and survive, the organization’s leaders forbid them
        from continuing to practice magic. Mages who practice magic in defiance of the Conclave are deemed renegades.
        Members of the robed orders are duty-bound to report and oppose such renegades. Some order members hunt
        renegades, seeking to punish or slay those who’ve defied the Mages of High Sorcery.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="a9e4c0ec-1e55-47df-893b-a87b7c758e21">Your talent for magic came to the attention of the
        Mages of High Sorcery, an organization of spellcasters that studies magic and prevents its misuse. You’ve
        trained among the Mages, but whether you’ll face the dangerous test required to become a full member of the
        group remains to be determined. Your passion for studying magic has likely already predisposed you toward one of
        the organization’s three orders: the benevolent Order of the White Robes, the balance-pursuing Order of the Red
        Robes, or the ruthless Order of the Black Robes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="177c00b0-564e-43f2-811a-576b0066f94f">In the world of Krynn, many refer to the Mages of
        High Sorcery as the Wizards of High Sorcery. The organization accepts more than wizards, though, with sorcerers,
        warlocks, and other spellcasters included among their ranks.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="bfa77a1d-7f2e-47fe-a1d5-e8e95ccae1a2">Mages of High Sorcery are typically sorcerers,
        warlocks, or wizards and might have any subclass. Spellcasters who gain their magic through devotion are less
        likely to be welcomed among the traditionalist mages. Nevertheless, the Mages of High Sorcery are shrewd, and
        they rarely let unique opportunities or individuals pass them by. Even members of martial classes who train in
        magic might find a rare place among the group’s three orders.</p>

        her organized forces are known as the Dragon Armies. This book’s introduction provides additional details on
        Takhisis and the Dragon Armies. As the adventure unfolds, the characters find themselves opposed by several of
        the Dragon Queen’s agents. The characters’ goal in this adventure isn’t to lay low the entirety of the Dragon

        creatures born of the Dragon Queen’s foul magic. All draconians are fanatically devoted to Takhisis and want
        nothing more than her conquest of the world. They are utterly loyal to the Dragon Army and those who speak in
        their god’s name. In the course of the adventure, present draconians as magical, monstrous, fanatical, and
        unknowable. They aren’t creatures with their own goals and ambitions. Rather, they are magical manifestations of
        the Dragon Queen’s thirst for conquest, and they wreak her will with lethal efficacy.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="15abc98f-9761-42b7-b8d4-af2a49e75d0d">Before retiring to the village of Vogler, Ispin
        Greenshield traveled across Ansalon as a teacher, trader, and adventurer. Along the way, he forged friendships
        with each of the characters. Each character knows the following information about him:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="1b51d913-707d-4031-b133-c7fc74759361">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="57bcf961-e332-4c4e-9ed5-68748bf242af">Ispin was a good-natured human adventurer from
            Solamnia.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="5cdcac39-5e29-4148-980b-966fcddaa067">Ispin took his name from a distinctive green
            shield he found early in his adventuring career. He claimed the shield was magical, but it had no obvious
            magical properties.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="50353a58-77df-4a96-abc0-32bb1bc0d45d">The bighearted Ispin loved telling tall tales
            of his travels to anyone who would listen.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="0259d57c-1675-460d-b874-517a6e685176">Ispin used to adventure with a human Knight of
            Solamnia named Becklin and a hill dwarf warrior named Cudgel. These two featured in many of Ispin’s stories
            of fighting sea monsters and goblin raiders.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="d4d671f4-241f-4a9e-af0a-1367ed3f26d8">Ispin retired from traveling years ago,
            becoming a permanent resident of a little-known village in Solamnia called Vogler.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="00cdffb1-69e7-43b8-b3d3-d5b1d4c75e5e">The Meeting Ispin Greenshield table suggests a few
        ways characters might have come to know and likely respect Ispin. Players can elaborate on these connections
        however they’d like. Characters can use their relationship with Ispin to reinforce how they know one another.

                <p>I am Becklin Uth Viharin. I’ve heard much about you from our mutual friend, Ispin Greenshield. It
                    grieves me to share the news that our dear friend Ispin passed away peacefully here at his home in

                    here in Vogler on the eve of the Kingfisher Festival. I write to ask you to do Ispin one last honor
                    and attend. Should you come, accommodations will be available at the Brass Crab.</p>
                <p>Though the circumstances are sad, I am eager to meet you and, through our memories, to revel in the

        <p>If you are using the <em>Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn</em> board game alongside this adventure, consider

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f2d04e98-2c55-4c1f-ba44-bf32b3bab75d">The encounters in this section take place after
        characters have received their invitations to Ispin Greenshield’s funeral. Before heading to Vogler or on their
        way to the village, each character should participate in a prelude encounter.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f77354aa-8a0a-458a-949c-eeb7635d78f1">After you’ve determined which preludes to run,
        choose which characters will participate in which. Then consider how to best run each prelude you’re using:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="99754e56-2141-41e6-b911-661c3a5fa023"><strong>Focus on Specific Characters.</strong> Run
        the prelude with a spotlight on the focus characters. Consider running it with a single player or a small group
        of players before the adventure begins. The “<a href="#BrokenSilence"
            data-content-chunk-id="83101a7d-206a-4f53-a820-d5da08c8cd5f">Broken Silence</a>” and “<a href="#EyeintheSky"
            data-content-chunk-id="015804c7-fa35-42ba-8c3e-26e856f928b4">Eye in the Sky</a>” preludes lend themselves to
        this.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fb0dc07d-1408-4f57-9e09-75de19ec9310"><strong>Focus on the Group.</strong> Run the prelude
        for a group of characters. These characters meet during their travels and participate in the encounter together.
        The “<a href="#ScalesofWar" data-content-chunk-id="5bdf1548-c7b7-4328-a99c-5720316c2ef7">Scales of War</a>”
        prelude lends itself to this.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b95ba63b-a4fa-4693-b0fd-54ac0cd21f3f">Throughout these preludes, mentions of “characters”
        refer to those characters who are the focus of the prelude. Characters can participate in preludes that don’t
        focus on them; they just won’t gain a divine connection as a result of participating in the “Broken Silence”
        prelude or a relationship to the Mages of High Sorcery in the “Eye in the Sky” prelude if they don’t want to
        join that organization.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f72dca40-b638-4bb4-bb5d-d6725d2a689b">Once you’ve run any preludes you deem appropriate
        for your group, all characters advance to level 2. After this, proceed with <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="708fd48d-e6bb-4f60-a382-0427e2d3a1cf">For hundreds of years, the world of Krynn has been
        bereft of those who call upon the favor of the gods. Legends say deities turned away from the world after the
        Cataclysm, and the prayers of the few who remember them have been met with silence ever since. But that silence
        is now being broken. A chosen few hear the call of the gods and awaken to their power. This prelude suits
        characters who hear that calling and respond to it.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c9a1ba71-3515-4bb0-9dfb-457b8606512c">Characters in this prelude can come from any
        background. Perhaps they’re discovering the gods for the first time, or they might be steadfast followers.
        Characters who draw their magic from gods won’t have access to spells or magical class features until the end of
        the encounter, as this prelude details a meeting with their deity. Characters with no special interest in
        serving a deity might participate in the “<a href="#ScalesofWar"
            data-content-chunk-id="151d4d70-831f-459a-98f5-43d59128b7a6">Scales of War</a>” prelude instead.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="69a20453-a479-48ba-96bd-1ce3de5dac6f">The prelude unfolds in a surreal, dreamlike
        situation where characters can follow a divine calling to learn about their deity’s goals and become one of
        their chosen. You may alter any of this prelude’s elements to better match individual gods’ virtues and
        identities.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4b13645a-4b83-4174-b8ee-8b9d08a0de36">Before you begin, make sure any players involved
        have chosen gods for their characters. Krynn’s deities and their provinces are listed in this book’s <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="69cb2876-bfc2-4d89-a633-b4641a28d788">This prelude focuses on characters who have been
        experiencing a recurring vision that comes to them in times of great turmoil or doubt. This vision might be a
        recent occurrence or something they’ve been experiencing for a long time, possibly since childhood.</p>

        You can add details that correspond to each character’s deity. For example, a character who worships Sirrion
        might find the surrounding forest aflame, while a character called by Paladine might notice the fallen soldier’s
        eyes turning into pools of silver.</p>

        <p>You stand at the center of a forest clearing. Clashing steel echoes from the thicket beyond. As you look
            around, you realize piles of bodies cover the ground. One of the fallen clutches something against their
            chest. You’re not sure what it is, but you feel the urge to reach for it. Before you can, the object glows
            and then flashes with intense light.</p>

        nothing out of the ordinary. They realize the object in the vision was an amulet. The amulet bears a design they
        might not recognize, but is the symbol of the god the character’s player chose during character creation. The
        echoes of battle don’t mean anything in particular to the characters but feel like a bad omen.</p>

        to Vogler and had stopped to camp or rest near a forested path. After experiencing the vision, the characters
        wake to find their camp sacked and some of their belongings missing. The characters are the only creatures in
        the camp; no one else who might have been traveling with them is in sight.</p>

        trail of food, cloth, and discarded trinkets that leads into the brush. A few hundred feet away, the characters

        that closely matches the amulet from their visions. As in the vision, the characters might feel inexplicably
        drawn to the item. If the characters have different gods, they each find a holy symbol for their chosen deity.
        As soon as a character touches the amulet, a pulse of divine energy ripples from them, causing the amulet to
        vanish from their hands. The pulse flattens the surrounding vegetation, creating an unnatural clearing similar
        to the one in the characters’ visions. The cleared plants also reveal overgrown ruins nearby:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>A crumbling stone structure lies among the undergrowth. Its roof is pierced by the trunk of an immense tree,

        glow begins emanating from the statue of the god whose symbol they just discovered. The glow coalesces around
        the ruined statue, creating a spectral semblance of what the statue looked like in the past. Depending on its
        nature, the holy symbol might also appear somewhere on or near the statue, perhaps held or worn by it. If the
        characters have different gods, this happens to multiple statues.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d4cbdfd8-5916-457e-aa69-ced94a4c3295">Once a character approaches the statue of their

        deity wants the character to carry their power and divine message into the world now—when Krynn needs it most.
        The god won’t elaborate on why they chose the character or why they’re revealing themself now. This brief
        conversation allows characters to learn as much as you deem necessary about their gods, and it ends with the
        characters gaining access to any god-granted spells and divine class features.</p>

        one of the robed orders, a mage must officially join the Mages of High Sorcery and be subjected to the Test of
        High Sorcery, wherein their dedication to the magical arts is challenged. Failing the test can be deadly, but

        <p>The fishing village of Vogler clings to a spit of land reaching into the Vingaard River. Wooded cliffs
            overlook the community, and the only path from the north descends past the ivy-covered remnants of a
            crumbling stone keep. The village’s modest wooden buildings cluster around a quaint central circle and along
            the riverbank.</p>
        <p>Jutting into the river—out of place and seemingly out of time—stands an incomplete stone bridge of incredible
            artisanship. The structure clearly dates to before the Cataclysm, eclipsing its modern peers in size and
            sturdiness. The bridge crosses less than half the river’s width before giving way to a series of ropes and
            tethered rafts serving as ferries.</p>
        <p>On the river itself, dozens of small boats drift along the slow, murky waters as the fishers of Vogler ply
            their trade.</p>

        a partially built bridge on the Vingaard River. Fishers, lumberers, hunters, and farmers live here peacefully,
        only occasionally interrupted by bandits or predators from the Northern Wastes. In addition to a volunteer
        militia maintained by Mayor Raven Uth Vogler, the village is ostensibly under the protection of Hinterlund’s
        capital, Maelgoth. This protection takes the form of a retired Knight of Solamnia, Becklin Uth Viharin, who’s
        stationed at the crumbling Thornwall Keep—now more a historic landmark than a true fortification.</p>

        kickoff of the Kingfisher Festival, an annual celebration commemorating Solamnia’s victory over the forces of
        Istar during a clash near the town centuries ago. The festival takes its name from the kingfisher, a symbol of
        the Knights of Solamnia and a bird the fishers of Vogler consider lucky. Festivities culminate with the locals’
        reenactment of the Battle of High Hill, a clash between Istarian and Solamnic soldiers.</p>

        village wharf, and its exterior vaguely resembles its namesake. Its proprietor, an Ergothian woman named Yalme

            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoner</a>), has an odd love of bad storytellers and inept
        musicians. One wall of the circular common room features a faded mural of two enormous crabs locked in combat,
        inlaid with brass details. The mural’s origins are lost to time, but if asked, Yalme says she named the crabs
        Fancy and Gorgeous George. Four short halls branch off the common room, each lined with rooms for rent.</p>

        fishers gather at the Fishbowl to tell tales, quench their thirst, and indulge in baked fish pies. The cramped
        but well-kept tavern is known for its savory baked goods more than its weak ale. The Fishbowl’s proprietor is

        ago, Solamnic and Istarian forces clashed here, and legends claim the spirits of fallen knights haunt the hill
        and watch over the town. Each year, the Kingfisher Festival’s reenactment of the battle serves as a reminder of
        the village’s history and nominally honors any spirits lingering at the battlefield.</p>

        local farms, and all manner of mundane equipment. One notable stall is that of Froswin (chaotic good, kender <a

        Hill, lies a mercenary camp. Known as the Ironclad Regiment, the soldiers here are under the command of Captain
        Ridomir “Cudgel” Ironsmile (introduced in the “<a href="#FinalFarewell"
            data-content-chunk-id="bc503273-2bb9-4804-8e8c-53e2c160400d">Final Farewell</a>” section). Cudgel is a
        friend of the deceased Ispin Greenshield and many others in town, and she brought her company to Vogler a week
        ago to attend Ispin’s funeral. She volunteered her band to take part in the annual reenactment of the Battle of
        High Hill—her attempt to lift the village’s spirits after their loss.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="88148bcd-e65d-45c0-af2d-7bd62c22ec44">During the day, Cudgel remains in the camp with her
        lieutenants—the half-ogre Gragonis and the human Jeyev Veldrews—along with several dozen mercenaries. The
        soldiers spend most of the day participating in drills. At night, they keep to themselves, lounging and playing
        dice. They’re under strict orders from Cudgel not to interfere with the locals.</p>

        the unguarded River Gate, a 15-foot-tall wooden archway carved with two leaping fish on its frame. Over the
        years, locals have etched the coin-sized scales of these fish with prayers for bountiful fishing. Two large
        wooden doors stand within the arch, but they haven’t been closed for years and are embedded in the surrounding
        dirt.</p>

        rocky rise at the western edge of town. Thornwall Keep’s steward, the knight Becklin Uth Viharin (introduced in
        the “<a href="#FinalFarewell" data-content-chunk-id="2e13853d-5663-4388-97ae-ee960edcd91b">Final Farewell</a>”
        section), maintains the keep. Partially ruined walls surround the keep’s three-story tower. The tower’s ground
        level holds a small library and a collection of local relics: over forty pieces of rusty tools and armor. The
        second floor holds the quarters of Becklin’s squire, Darrett Highwater (introduced in the “<a

        later in this chapter). Becklin’s austere room lies on the uppermost story; from there, a ladder leads to the
        keep’s crenelated roof.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="48a35501-d480-4444-83a4-f38babe2ead0">Vogler’s resident tinker gnome, Than, built an
        elaborate catapult-like contraption on the roof of the keep. A friend of Becklin and Darrett, Than occasionally
        drops by to fine-tune this device, called a gnomeflinger (detailed in <a

        of war, the contraption is a mode of rapid transportation originally devised by the tinker gnomes of Mount
        Nevermind. Becklin tolerates the gnomeflinger—and the noise of Than’s occasional early-morning tinkering—because
        she sees the catapult-shaped device as a deterrent against attack.</p>

        leading north out of the village and south to the ferry across the Vingaard, and others radiating out into the
        town. The village circle serves as a public space, meeting spot, and festival ground. An iron bell hangs atop a
        tall pole near the mayor’s house. In times of need, anyone who vigorously rings the bell summons the mayor and
        2d12 volunteer militia members (<a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16915-guard"

        to stretch across the Vingaard River. Half-constructed before the Cataclysm using techniques lost in the ages
        since, the bridge looks like a glorified pier—a remnant of once-promised glory. A simple ferry system of ropes
        and winches follows the bridge’s supports and connects with posts on the opposite shore. Simple rafts and skiffs
        allow travelers and even small wagons to cross the river. The process is safe but slow, taking approximately 10
        minutes for a raft to cross the broad river. Travelers can make use of the crossing themselves or hire a ferrier

        burned his family home in Estwilde. In truth, Lord Bakaris and his son were driven from the region and sought

        dock extending from the rear of the Brass Crab. Becklin encourages the characters to linger near the dock, while
        many mourning locals in small fishing craft assemble in the nearby water. When you’re ready for the funeral to
        begin, Becklin takes the stage next to a simple boat, within which rests the body of Ispin Greenshield. Read or
        paraphrase the following:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>Those who were closest to Ispin Greenshield gather on the dock overlooking the Vingaard River. There, Ispin’s
            body rests in a small boat, his body wrapped in a shroud. A musician plays a soft song as the knight Becklin
            Uth Viharin steps forward in her ornate Solamnic armor. She smiles gently at those assembled, and her voice
            carries clearly across the water.</p>
        <p>“You all knew Ispin as a friend, and there were none like him. Before he died, he told me this: ‘There should
            be tales, not tears, for an old scoundrel like me. Make sure everyone knows my stories when I head off on
            the greatest adventure of them all.’”</p>
        <p>Becklin nods, and villagers carry the boat containing Ispin’s body to the dock’s edge, where she and Cudgel
            lowered it into the water. “So, let us do just that,” Becklin continues as the tiny vessel drifts out onto
            the Vingaard River. “On the eve of the Kingfisher Festival, we celebrate you, Ispin. Good travels, friend.
            Until we meet again.”</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="41cb792a-30f1-4f69-9f7c-e03ceabb3d41">With that, the boat bearing Ispin’s body drifts down
        the river and eventually out of sight. After a moment of silence, Becklin invites all assembled into the Brass
        Crab for a reception and opportunity to share stories about the departed.</p>

        affair. Yalme, the Brass Crab’s proprietor, keeps bread, cheese, and local ale coming for the dozens of
        attendees. Practically everyone in the village makes an appearance at the reception, and the characters can find
        anyone they’ve already met in the village with whom they might want to talk.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="364e4984-9ded-48c4-b90a-8bc82ff40c00">Soon after the reception begins, Becklin calls for
        everyone’s attention and shares one of Ispin’s favorite stories: the tale of the time the High Sub-Senior
        Artillerist of Mount Nevermind launched her pet weasel all the way from the gnome enclave to Sancrist Island,
        then hired Ispin to recover the critter—or, at least, to note its trajectory. Becklin tells several other
        charming stories about Ispin, then invites attendees to share other tales Ispin might have told them.</p>

        left to continue, he eventually blurts out, “We’ve heard this a thousand times!” or “You’re telling it worse
        than he did!” Bakaris cares nothing for Ispin’s death or the locals’ mourning—he’s only here for the free ale,
        which he claims is the worst he’s ever tasted. The other mourners grumble, but nobody directly confronts the
        heckler.</p>

        name, but he defers to his father—partly from unbroken childhood habit, and partly because all his privilege
        depends on his father’s wealth. Bakaris also has a violent streak. While living in Estwilde, he murdered the son
        of a local leader during a duel, and he and his father to Vogler to escape the consequences. Bakaris takes quiet
        pride in that killing, and he fantasizes about one day winning respect via the point of his sword. He loathes

        quest to prevent the Cataclysm, he became cursed to exist forever as a death knight. As part of his curse,
        Leedara and several of her companions returned as deathless spirits devoted to ensuring Soth never finds peace.

        <p>“Good morning, Becklin’s friends,” comes a cheerful voice. “I’m glad I caught you.” From a shop doorway steps
            a young man, no more than twenty years old. He has a sword at his hip and a cloth sack in his arm. “I’m

        travels, their weapons, and anything else about the world beyond Vogler. He knows all about the Kingfisher

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7f9ec0d0-6530-4710-9d00-eb064ad4f4e5">Traditional Kingfisher Festival events commemorate
        Vogler’s founding and history. Characters might participate in an annual competition, the season’s inaugural
        fish catch, where fishers try to catch the biggest fish during a set period. Darrett and other friendly locals
        encourage the characters to participate.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0be1ede6-e26c-45b7-8923-1f685af46b03">Characters can also carouse in the village circle,
        volunteer to perform on the festival stage, or socialize with locals. Any villager from the “<a

        the wharf. Here, the fish catch pits amateur fishers against the community’s best anglers, all competing to
        catch the largest fish. Characters who go to the wharf are invited to participate in this popular event and, if
        they accept, are lent fishing poles and bait. At the end of each 30-minute contest, participants are given
        charming but valueless trophies; bragging rights are the real prize at stake.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e36ec6da-fab1-4cb8-bd00-98c7be49651d">Should characters choose to participate, they find
        one of Vogler’s best fishers, Mayor Raven, is in their group, along with a dozen other locals. Read the
        following description when the characters have their fishing gear prepared and are ready to start:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>A fishing pole resting on her shoulder, Raven takes her place as one of the competitors and beckons other
            participants to line up with her along the docks. “It’s time to find out who among us kingfisher fisherfolk
            is the fisher king!” the mayor says as she casts her line into the Vingaard River. The competitors receive
            her pun with good-spirited groans and laughter, then cast their lines as well.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="73f3a769-9136-41a4-b29e-069d6780904c"><em><strong>Running the Contest.</strong></em> The
        contest plays out in three 10-minute rounds. After a character spends 10 minutes fishing, roll on the Fish to
        Catch table to determine whether a fish tugs on their line and, if so, the DC of the Wisdom (<a

        Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills"
            data-tooltip-href="/skills/15-tooltip">Survival</a>) check, catching the fish if they succeed and losing it
        if they fail. A character has advantage on this check if they brought their own fishing gear to the contest
        rather than borrowing gear. If a character fails this check by 10 or more, they are pulled into the water and
        are out of the contest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="872ac36d-682f-4412-8539-3096d052aa43">Repeat these rolls for every 10 minutes a character
        participates in the fish catch. After 30 minutes, the contest ends and a winner is determined.</p>

        This enormous cuirassed carp is a Vogler legend. Even sighting Benebog is considered good luck, and catching it
        makes a fisher an instant town legend. Benebog can be caught only once. If a character rolls a 20 on the Fish to
        Catch table after Benebog has been caught, a greater cuirassed carp tugs on their line instead.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="72f6413a-884a-4bca-b349-987d1e72cb52"><em><strong>Contest Winner.</strong></em> The winner
        is determined by totaling the length of all fish each participant caught. Mayor Raven’s catch totals 7 feet,
        followed by a villager whose catch totals 5 feet. The participant with the highest total is the winner.
        Participants then receive prizes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e7565543-0645-4c09-b5f8-b9f72c533a9a"><em><strong>Contest Prizes.</strong></em> All
        contest participants receive tiny wooden carvings of kingfishers, while the winner receives their choice of a
        blue knit cap or a fishing fly made from blue feathers. These prizes are charmingly made but have no significant
        value. Should a character catch Benebog, the mayor gives the character an exceptionally crafted fishing pole
        carved with kingfishers, worth 50 gp. Additionally, for the rest of the day, the villagers laud the character
        with congratulations and free drinks.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="37429034-1c48-415d-abd1-cfd0f98c64c2"><em><strong>Repeat Contests.</strong></em>
        Characters can participate in the fish catch as many times as they like. On future rounds, the best villager
        catches fish totaling 1d4 + 3 feet. Mayor Raven doesn’t participate again.</p>

        drinks heavily during the festival and spends much of his time on the wharf, watching the fish catch and

    <p data-content-chunk-id="cb438e4b-c761-44d2-aa70-a83b763c5178">The Kingfisher Festival culminates in the annual
        reenactment of the Battle of High Hill, held at a hill located about a 30-minute walk north of the village. The
        reenactment, which also serves as a drill for Vogler’s militia, is followed by a feast at the Brass Crab.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a0780f68-9609-4607-b2a3-b261e7a72f5a">The event is scheduled to begin in the afternoon.
        About an hour before, Mayor Raven rallies Vogler’s militia in the village circle. The militia then leads a
        haphazard parade from town to High Hill, followed by dozens of spectators and a wagon filled with drinks for
        participants.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="780898eb-06f9-447d-8000-f445394ff498">Darrett, Becklin, or another villager finds the
        characters as the parade begins and encourages the party to walk with them. If the characters agreed to honor
        Ispin’s last wishes, they easily find the other participants gathering at High Hill, either at the direction of
        this villager or by following momentum from the parade.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c4092252-65e1-4fd9-9cb2-b3b28e86396f">This year’s reenactment is a little different than
        in past years. Should the characters chat with Darrett or other locals during the walk to High Hill, they learn
        the following information:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="4f42079d-5cd2-484d-95ab-5bee527ec660">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="3bcd40b4-e50e-4212-8c0f-c80ab6412cce">This mock battle reenacts the Knights of
            Solamnia’s ancient victory over enemy forces from the eastern nation of Istar. The battle was led by Lord
            Vogler, a noble knight and the village’s founder.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="c4a96288-dc4a-496f-ac4b-f8bf4940561f">This year, Mayor Raven arranged for a friend of
            the town, the mercenary leader Cudgel Ironsmile, to participate. Cudgel’s Ironclad Regiment is playing the
            part of the invading Istarian forces. The mayor claims it’s a happy coincidence Cudgel’s band was in the
            area during the event.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="c0c51fd8-62a8-42b8-8b41-f97531ccdb93">Mayor Raven has given the village’s militia a
            lot of attention recently. Some villagers think she hired Cudgel to visit Vogler and help with this
            event—possibly because of vague rumors of war in the east. With trained mercenaries on the opposing side,
            this year’s reenactment could be more of a challenge for the militia than in past years.</li>

            href="/monsters/17185-half-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17185-tooltip">half-ogre</a>) has betrayed his
        leader. He has paid off many of the mercenaries under his command, and with the exception of Cudgel and a few
        mercenaries who aren’t attending the reenactment, the entire company secretly plans to attack lethally during
        the mock battle</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3bf5a30e-45bb-48ac-ab89-f15f37cf10e5">Agents of the Red Dragon Army—part of the greater
        army waging war in eastern Ansalon—hatched this plan when they learned the mercenaries would join in the mock
        battle. The commanders of the Red Dragon Army bought Gragonis’s loyalty, and they seek to take Vogler quickly as
        part of a greater scheme.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="96c17af9-8b13-4c28-b153-f92445a8eea5">A contingent of the Red Dragon Army slipped into the

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>Passing through woods and fields, Vogler’s parade of militia members and reenactment spectators finally
            reaches High Hill. The grassy slope is spotted with trees and crumbled stone fencing. Near the base, several
            dozen soldiers in matching armor stand in even formation. The contrast is striking between these mercenaries
            of the Ironclad Regiment and Vogler’s militia—with their mismatched armor and crooked helmets—but it does
            nothing to dampen the spirits of those assembled for the Kingfisher Festival’s climactic reenactment.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c64c3587-c67b-4c8e-ba2f-0e5f28ec6232">The parade follows a trail to the top of the hill,
        where Mayor Raven and Cudgel Ironsmile meet and discuss final preparations for the event. Soon, reenactment
        participants and spectators break up, with the former taking up wooden weapons while the latter settle down to
        watch the reenactment.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0a9d49db-bfa1-4153-8d75-b445e9a0e5b2">Encourage all characters to participate in the
        reenactment, if for no other reason than to honor Ispin Greenshield’s last wishes. If a character refuses, Mayor

        for aid if someone gets hurt.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e77c3909-df0c-4ad9-946c-2b8aa72737d2">To prepare for the battle, Mayor Raven calls out to
        those assembled, explaining the mercenaries will charge up the west side of the hill while the militia and other
        participants charge down. The two groups will clash midway in a mock fight, with the mercenaries’ Istarian
        forces eventually retreating. Participants are encouraged to use their own armor but are given wooden spears
        with padded tips to prevent them from dealing damage. The mayor reminds everyone not to use real weapons during
        the reenactment so nobody gets hurt.</p>

        <p>After much laughter and jostling, the mayor, Cudgel, and other spectators walk to a nearby vantage to watch.
            As they do, the militia takes up its position atop High Hill—the same hill Solamnic troops held centuries
            ago. They face the mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment at the base of the hill, arrayed as the forces of
            Istar once were. Although the event is only a reenactment, a tingle of excitement fills the field. Somewhere
            on the line, a reenactor hoots and yells, “Let’s send those Istarian rats running!”</p>
        <p>A moment later, a trumpet blast signals the start of the battle. “For Istar!” yells the mercenaries’ leader,

        <p>The “Battle of High Hill” section presents the first of several battlefield encounters in this adventure.
            These are events that take place on active battlefields. During these scenes, the wider battle is
            abstracted, allowing the characters focus on specific, tide-turning conflicts.</p>
        <p>At the edge of each mapped battlefield encounter and beyond is a region called the Fray. The Fray is an
            interpretation of the dangers of combat, from clashing combatants to deadly spells. It is also the source of
            additional threats. Each battlefield encounter explains the Fray’s effects and presents additional dangers
            that might occur at the end of each round of combat. A battlefield encounter ends when noted in the text.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c6d5b6b8-265c-44a6-838c-ce06632591b1">The mercenaries’ retreat is further motivated by the

        spectators. The group has already seen some fighting, as treacherous mercenaries tried and failed to kill Cudgel

        Ironsmile seeks answers. While the battle was taking place, one of her own mercenaries appeared and attacked
        her, only to be killed by Becklin. The typically unflappable mercenary commander is livid. It doesn’t take her
        long to find one of her mercenaries who was wounded but survived the battle—possibly Gragonis, if the characters
        spared him. She angrily shakes and yells at the wounded mercenary. If the characters don’t act first, Mayor
        Raven calms Cudgel and has the traitor bound for the walk back to Vogler where they can be interrogated (see the

            data-tooltip-href="/skills/13-tooltip">Medicine</a>) check can bring a villager back from the brink of
        death. A character can also use healing magic to save a wounded villager by restoring 1 or more hit points. Any
        healed villager thanks their savior, giving the character a piece of jewelry or lucky charm worth 20 gp.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6dcbca75-52f1-4163-8409-e45bab579241">If a character openly uses the power of a god to
        save a villager, locals who see this are awed and consider it nothing less than a miracle. A villager saved in
        this way is particularly thankful and seeks to learn more about the character’s deity.</p>

    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a17b0e5-5783-45fe-b493-c5c2403c77d8">Cudgel has only one concern: discovering the fate of

        answers many questions about the force near Vogler. Back at the Brass Crab, Mayor Raven consults with the
        characters, Becklin, and Cudgel. Raven sees no other option than to do as the message demands and welcome the
        Dragon Army. Becklin and Cudgel immediately oppose this, having witnessed the horrors of occupying forces.</p>

        mercenaries are camped north of the village, bringing them to Vogler without alerting the Dragon Army likely
        requires getting rid of the Dragon Army soldiers at the gate—a challenge while the soldiers hold the upper

        enemy than running headlong into battle. If necessary, use Darrett to temper characters’ desire for immediate
        revenge.</p>

        misinformation. Kalaman’s council listens to what the characters say, asking probing questions until the truth
        of what happened in Vogler comes out. As the characters speak, Lord Bakaris contradicts them, trying to bolster
        his own fictitious position as the village leader who deserves accolades for bravely facing the Red Dragon Army.

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>Governor Miat frowns. “This is all dire news. My heart goes out to your friends and families, but I hope you

        <p>The governor gestures to a stern woman wearing armor embellished with the blue and gold colors of Kalaman.

        and ogres from the Taman Busuk. Everyone here has heard rumors of war in the eastern nation of Khur, but until
        now, they hadn’t considered that far-off nation’s struggles relevant.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="822cda86-3e4d-4e1f-9007-0627af53388c">Marshal Vendri is eager to hear anything the

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>In a decisive tone, Governor Miat says, “The citizens of Kalaman are prepared to offer your people shelter in
            the neighborhoods outside the city walls, the protection of our soldiers, and—while we can spare it—food
            from our tables.” He folds his hands and fixes his eyes on you. “There is a condition, though.”</p>

        <li data-content-chunk-id="d775a4ca-fc79-406c-a28b-cb60027bafc3">The city has woefully little information about
            this foe, and the scouts sent to learn more have all disappeared.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="643aaa78-3d9e-404f-8642-82676031d492">The characters, however, both faced this foe

        <li data-content-chunk-id="0a6fb93f-661a-4171-93dc-173f8fd8cfe4">In return for Kalaman protecting the people of
            Vogler, Kalaman’s leaders want the characters and Darrett to report to Marshal Vendri as special operatives
            in the Kalaman military.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="717543e2-b36d-4962-95a7-a7df3dc00b3e">Let the characters discuss this offer. Marshal

        <li data-content-chunk-id="6009c220-2131-4b4a-960c-97ca432528d4">Sworn characters will be given a palm-sized
            emblem with the blue-and-gold symbol of Kalaman etched into its face. This is a symbol of their special
            rank, which is akin to a lieutenancy (higher than soldiers but lower than commanders).</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="87579456-15f5-43fe-9b57-da3b30cb804a">If the characters refuse, Darrett asks to speak with
        them for a moment. He plans to accept the governor’s terms and attempts to convince the characters to join him.
        He wants their aid not only to protect his people, but to counter the terrifying threat of the Dragon Army. If
        the characters still resist, Darrett suggests the characters could work for him as aides rather than working
        directly for the military—a proposal Kalaman’s leaders are willing to accept.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f966bb3f-ab4f-4733-83a8-a2c0d74fefac">If the characters and Darrett accept, Governor Miat
        is pleased and orders that Vogler’s people be provided with food and supplies. Marshal Vendri dispatches guards
        to help the refugees relocate to lodgings outside the Trade Gate.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c1b11a6d-5be4-4ce9-914c-21797cbd2da0">With that, the meeting with Kalaman’s leaders
        concludes. Marshal Vendri asks Darrett and the characters to come to her office on the second floor of Castle
        Kalaman when they’re ready to learn more about their position and their first duties. Until then, they should
        ensure their people are safe and familiarize themselves with the city.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5f9fa535-f48d-4a07-8e44-6883bd6059ec">After hearing that Darrett—and likely some of the
        characters—agreed to aid Kalaman’s military, Raven says she and the survivors of Vogler’s militia intend to
        offer their assistance as well. She also asks the characters to stop calling her mayor—so long as Vogler is in
        Dragon Army hands, she’s just Raven.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4fbedf29-70ec-4479-a770-cfb8c7d89c8a">Lord Bakaris and his son don’t return to the camp,

        contingent of soldiers from Kalaman reach the survivors’ camp with food and supplies. They aid the people most
        in need first, eventually assisting everyone in relocating to an unoccupied group of simple wooden buildings
        north of Kalaman’s Trade Gate. The survivors find dry, safe housing and pitch in to make everyone’s lodgings
        more comfortable. They also establish a communal cookhouse and infirmary.</p>

        Vogler’s people and make their accommodations more welcoming. If they wish, the characters can also find bunks
        here for the evening, but staying at Castle Kalaman would be more comfortable—and free up more space and
        resources for the other evacuees. Once the characters see to the safety of Vogler’s survivors, they’re free to
        explore Kalaman as they please.</p>

        centuries ago, the castle was long used by the Knights of Solamnia. Many of its large halls are decorated with

        following the disaster, in a few cursed places this Cataclysmic fire remained. One such place is the catacombs
        containing the tomb of Knight Sarlamir beneath Castle Kalaman. The Knights of Solamnia locked these tombs away,

        had enraged the metallic dragons that had long remained hidden on Krynn. Paladine tasked Sarlamir with going to
        this flying city, assuaging the dragons’ fury, and convincing the kingpriest to return the city to the land.
        Sarlamir agreed. The knight knew his task was daunting, though, and decided to hedge his bets. He took his

        Solamnic Knight of the Order of the Rose. He ruled the province of Knightlund from Dargaard Keep. However, his
        fall from grace began when he rescued a company of Silvanesti elves from raiders, including the priest Isolde
        and her attendants. Though Lord Soth was married, he fell in love with Isolde—and shortly after, Soth’s wife
        died. He and Isolde married days later. For disrespecting his dead wife’s memory, the Knights of Solamnia cast
        Soth from their orders.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6ed80f5c-d270-4797-8c52-397c1d3159ce">Soon after, the gods called Soth to redeem himself
        by preventing the Cataclysm, but Soth failed in his quest, and the gods rained destruction on the world. The
        Knights of Solamnia fell into disgrace in the aftermath of the Cataclysm, and Dargaard Keep became a cursed,
        haunted ruin.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1a85c577-ee49-40b7-a2ae-daaad1b91545">When Lord Soth began his gods-given quest to avert
        the Cataclysm, he encountered Isolde’s attendants, who blamed him for leading Isolde from her holy path. The
        attendants played on his jealousy, falsely accusing Isolde of being unfaithful. Enraged, Soth ignored the gods’
        direction and returned to Dargaard Keep to murder her. As he did, the gods unleashed the Cataclysm on the world.
        With Isolde’s dying breath, she cursed Soth to suffer one lifetime for every life lost in the Cataclysm.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="549c4c04-ecba-42e7-945f-5a5d2b7e4cb1">For his defiance of the gods, Soth became a death
        knight, while his followers were similarly reanimated as other Undead. Meanwhile, several of Isolde’s attendants
        became spirits devoted to ensuring Soth never finds peace.</p>

        the world, violet flames from the Cataclysm continue to burn in Sarlamir’s tomb. This magical fire lingers as a
        mark of disgrace on one who failed the gods and the world. Lord Soth has come to the catacombs seeking the
        Cataclysmic fire for its magical properties, which can be harnessed through rituals whispered to him by the
        Dragon Queen. These phantom flames respond to the memories of the dead and re-create illusory scenes from the

        Onyari. Built by the Kingpriest of Istar, it soared through the heavens, but it was brought low by enraged
        dragons who discovered its grim secret: its flight relied on the innate magic of the draconic graveyard it was
        built on. Now, Onyari’s ruins draw the attention of the Red Dragon Army, whose leaders believe they can raise
        the city into the heavens once more. The black-robed mage Lohezet and the priest Belephaion lead an expedition
        to claim the city as a massive weapon of war. The death knight Lord Soth joins them, following whispers from the
        Dragon Queen to use the Cataclysmic fire from the depths of Castle Kalaman to raise the dead dragons buried in
        Onyari’s foundations and bring them to her service.</p>

        <p>The marshal stands by a window, gazing toward the horizon. From a seat at the table, Lord Bakaris glances at
            you and then bitterly observes, “Here they are now, Marshal. Perhaps if we hadn’t put our faith in

        there. While Vendri isn’t confident the move is strategically sound, she thinks it’s a good idea for the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="fb2d8b28-94af-4edb-a44b-7a46081638c8">Every year, a group of Dimernesti sea elves from
        Thoradin Bay travels to the Blue Phoenix Shrine to honor the Sea Lord for his bounty. While most sea elves have
        forgotten the name Habbakuk, they faithfully continue this annual pilgrimage.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a9d7370f-c088-4d41-839a-08524aa21487">Though the Wash changes chaotically, the sea elves
        swim to the shrine following reliable rivers that flow through ravines. This year, however, the pilgrimage went
        awry when the sea elves crossed paths with the Red Dragon Army. Four sea elves were captured—including their
        leader, the priest Yearkal—and many others perished in the confrontation (the characters can rescue three of the
        captured sea elves at <a href="#I4PrisonerCages"

        motivations for traveling the Northern Wastes. He explains the nearby shrine is a sacred place, dedicated to an
        old deity the sea elves now remember only as the Sea Lord. If the characters approached the camp respectfully,
        he also tells them how the sea elves were attacked by the Dragon Army.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bf6f919d-6ab5-4977-8382-b349d8718b4a">Even if he is suspicious of the characters, Ishvern
        sees value in their presence—especially if there’s a cleric among them. He requests the characters help him make
        the group’s offering in the name of their lost priest, Yearkal. The elves seek to make this offering in keeping
        with their peoples’ centuries-old traditions, but they know little of the deed’s religious ties or the god
        Habbakuk. If the characters agree, Ishvern leads them to the shrine’s entrance.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a0a75b97-6a45-4b12-8fb6-3abd6e42e1b4"><em><strong>Yearkal’s Return.</strong></em> If the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="baa6db9b-b0f0-4880-9690-087bf290cc93">The funerary obelisk of Wakenreth—“House of Silence”
        in Elvish—was constructed by Silvanesti elves in the Istarian city of Onyari shortly before the city took
        flight. The tower served as an emblem of peace between the people of Istar and Silvanesti. However, as with all
        of Onyari, Wakenreth met a tragic end, and it’s now haunted by the spirits it used to keep safe. Dalamar is
        unaware Wakenreth was once part of the City of Lost Names—he knows only that Silvanesti writings speak of a
        magical tower rising from the wasteland.</p>

        Silvanesti and Istar, the tower of Wakenreth served as a crypt for the elves who lived in Onyari—though it saw
        little use before the city’s destruction. When Onyari began its slow fall across the skies of the Northern
        Wastes, the monolith broke from its foundations, toppling toward the ground far from where the rest of the city
        eventually crashed. As the structure fell, Wakenreth’s caretaker desperately invoked the tower’s magic in hopes
        of transporting it to the Feywild. However, the magic of the displaced tower went awry and partially transported
        the tower to the Shadowfell. Though this helped Wakenreth survive, the portal within the tower has corrupted the
        spirits of those who rested within and trapped the site in a state of perpetual dissolution.</p>

        that). Veriel asks for the party’s help in severing the link between Wakenreth and the Shadowfell, a feat that
        can be accomplished only from the other side of the portal. His time spent in the Shadowfell has linked him to

        generations before the Cataclysm, the hero Huma Dragonbane defeated Takhisis and prevented her conquest of
        Krynn. When the Dragon Queen left the world, her wicked dragon servants went with her. To maintain the balance
        between good and evil, most of Krynn’s metallic dragons agreed among themselves to retreat to hidden reaches of
        the world.</p>

        rose to power in the land of Istar. This religious leader dreamed of an earthly paradise—a pleasure city to
        reward those he deemed righteous. The kingpriest and his servants created a great flying island. He named this
        aerial city Onyari, the City Without Sin, claiming it would be a place where he and his worthiest (and
        wealthiest) subjects might cast off mortal weakness and live like the gods.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4a28ea1e-76f8-476a-8b8e-5e5a2fce697f">But the kingpriest and his servants were loath to
        reveal how they created their paradise. The city was constructed on an ancient sacred site where, for millennia,
        dragons of Krynn had gone to die. The kingpriest harnessed the magical resonance of the dragons buried there,
        lifting the city into the sky.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="14a380c9-a179-45be-9043-40fd3e4bc71b">When the metallic dragons remaining on Krynn learned
        the kingpriest had desecrated the resting place of their dead, they were furious. Though some dragons urged a
        more moderate path, the gold dragon Karavarix refused to hold back. He led a contingent of metallic dragons to
        the soaring city, intent on forcing it to land. The god Paladine tasked the Knight of Solamnia Zanas Sarlamir
        (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sotdq/shadow-of-war#KnightSarlamirsCurse"
            data-content-chunk-id="140de5ab-b437-4c8b-81e2-26345f8ec92e">chapter 4</a>) with peaceably ending the
        conflict between the dragons and the kingpriest. However, Sarlamir’s quest was a dismal failure, ultimately
        resulting in the knight attacking and killing Karavarix. The resulting battle between the dragons and Onyari’s
        people ended in Sarlamir’s death and the city’s ruin. The flying city fell apart across the Northern Wastes, its
        bulk ultimately crashing in the hidden depression where it lies now.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cec68d9c-6f20-4dac-9076-e0e641bcfc5b">Not willing to acknowledge his failure, the
        kingpriest suppressed all records of Onyari, and those who knew of the failed marvel refused to speak its name.
        In the wake of the Cataclysm, those few who remember Onyari at all know it only as the City of Lost Names.</p>

        experience that assesses a potential member of the Mages of High Sorcery and determines the order they’re most
        closely aligned with. If a character succeeds, they become a full member of the Mages of High Sorcery and are
        inducted into one of the group’s orders. If a character fails, they’re deemed unfit for the organization—if they
        survive the test.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ac5d0da2-6205-403a-bac3-4128bea617ec">The Test of High Sorcery is personalized for those
        who take it. Demelin’s version of the test takes place in the participant’s mind, casting them into a mental
        re-creation of Onyari’s final moments. In this vision, the character faces a magical challenge and a moral
        choice that tests their values.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="be315f97-b11b-4892-b88a-4a4bba952c78">When personalizing the test and determining the
        challenge the character faces, consider the following questions:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="21720b70-4ea8-451a-94e6-4a85527b0dbb">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="d3e7d8b9-28eb-40fd-81c7-677f2a29f33a">What is the character’s alignment?</li>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f673095d-b0a6-476e-85db-224978d5065e">The answers to the questions in the previous section
        might be straightforward and make it clear what order a character and their player want to join. If they aren’t,
        use events during the test to determine what order the character is best suited to.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ded530c8-41a6-4712-abc9-4b458f9176f7">The test should involve a clear choice between good,
        neutrality, and evil as represented by the orders of the White Robes, the Red Robes, and the Black Robes,
        respectively. As it unfolds, give the character the opportunity to choose any order they please. If the
        character makes a surprising choice, consider asking the player how they reconcile their choice with their
        character’s values. If the character feels strongly about a choice that conflicts with their values or
        alignment, their player might use this as a pivotal moment for character growth.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="EndingtheTest"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b562805a-87ad-40f4-84de-347d3367fada">As the test reaches its decisive moment, remind the
        character’s player that their character’s choices will result in them gaining membership in a particular order
        of the Mages of High Sorcery. If the player would like to change their choice, allow them to do so.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DyingduringtheTest"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="40b157aa-50a0-42de-b15e-c6913c904c12">The Test of High Sorcery can be lethal, but only if
        that’s part of the story the player wants to tell. A personal sacrifice within the vision that cements a
        character’s beliefs should result in the test ending and the character regaining consciousness unharmed.
        However, if a character forsakes all magic or refuses to engage with the test, let the player know these choices
        could result in their character being consumed by magic and dying. If the player approves of this, proceed with
        the test’s events. A character who dies during the test can be resurrected normally.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2982ad72-022a-4d2b-8e3f-2eb129948084">Characters who aren’t taking the test are generally
        unaware of what’s transpiring in the test-taking character’s mind. If you want to involve characters not taking
        the test, the test-taking character might create mental manifestations of their allies, which other players can
        control during the test. If you allow other characters to participate alongside a test-taking character, keep
        the focus of the encounters on the magic-using character. This should remain a character-defining moment for the
        spellcaster.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c8c5d2ed-5682-40c9-a7de-77247449e2f4">When a test-taking character is ready to begin the
        test, Demelin instructs them to move to the center of the room. Read or paraphrase the following text,
        addressing the test-taking character alone:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>Demelin raises her hands. The light in the room pulses, and spectral green flames trace the walls as she
            speaks.</p>
        <p>“In the old days, there would’ve been multiple tests. Casting every spell you know, spell battles, the like.
            But you’ve proven yourself by coming this far. This leaves just one trial—the most important question.”</p>
        <p>The flames swirl around you both, rising to obscure everything but Demelin’s glowing eyes.</p>
        <p>“Time to find out who you are...”</p>
        <p>There’s a flash of green light, and suddenly the ground shifts beneath you. Wind lashes your face, and the
            air fills with screams. Your vision clears, and you find yourself above the clouds, standing at the edge of
            an exquisite floating city of graceful marble spires. All around you, people flee as dragons dive from the
            sky, tearing swaths of destruction.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8144b9c7-d094-4ebd-b9d5-c4469c5df19f">The character taking the test finds themself in this
        re-creation of Onyari’s final moments before the flying city was destroyed. A moment later, a <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d8adf454-57b9-4e59-a64d-e7668b3ea622">Consider the following suggestions as you develop
        this scene in a way that’s influenced by the test-taking character’s alignment.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="GoodCharacter"
        data-content-chunk-id="409b4e1e-b801-4105-b72d-cd4b73e1a42a"><a href="#GoodCharacter"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="33a4d176-f75a-428d-abfc-2da02fcf4bfe">The dragon returns and attacks the fleeing people,
        including both a large group of innocents and a small group of people beloved by the character. There’s likely
        time to save only one group. The character might prove themself suited for white robes by trying to save
        everyone, by sacrificing themself, or by desperately trying to negotiate with the dragon. If they prioritize
        what they want over the good of others, they might earn red robes.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="EvilCharacter"
        data-content-chunk-id="91110b39-d5f0-43ff-a842-993e19c65da7"><a href="#EvilCharacter"
            data-content-chunk-id="ec8867fa-8bcc-4e93-b377-9bba9e553546"></a>Evil Character</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3cf87d35-015f-43b5-bf0f-e1ea154cf56b">The dragon returns, and the character’s rival or a
        non-spellcasting ally steps between those trying to escape and the oncoming dragon. Unaware of the character,
        this rival uses the incredible magic of a glowing staff to hold off the dragon. If the character attacks their
        foe, tries to steal the staff, or otherwise prioritizes their own ambitions, they prove themself suited for the
        black robes. If they put the city and innocents first, they might earn red robes.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="NeutralCharacter"
        data-content-chunk-id="fa3b6c57-a7ba-4840-877d-3f5d56e3b345"><a href="#NeutralCharacter"
            data-content-chunk-id="b6325c48-aa49-4674-a3a2-465ff665a9c9"></a>Neutral Character</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c9e0e287-dee6-4af5-81b2-d7949fc02b53">Scholars struggle to evacuate a collection of
        ancient tomes (or something else the character highly values) from a crumbling structure. The dragon then
        returns, threatening both the scholars and a larger group of innocents. There’s likely only time to save one
        group. If the character tries to save themself or the lore-protecting librarians, they’re probably suited for
        the red robes. If they protect the larger group of innocents, the character might be suited for the white robes.
        If the character tries to abscond with the books, they might be suited for the black robes.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="AdjustingtheTest"
        data-content-chunk-id="cf0997e7-4086-4015-a057-d18152bb2f1a"><a href="#AdjustingtheTest"
            data-content-chunk-id="ba3c4f06-f735-440d-9de5-c4899424e285"></a>Adjusting the Test</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4853738f-e92d-4d42-896d-d99e49c34178">The test shouldn’t be strictly a combat encounter.
        The point is to gauge a character’s values and disposition. Consider the following suggestions to make the test
        more dramatic:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="66dd6662-b788-4ba8-80a7-3596b8c0947d"><strong>Altered Magic.</strong> Spellcasting or
        other class features could function differently during the test. For example, perhaps each time the character
        casts a spell using a spell slot, they take 6 (1d12) necrotic damage or gain 1 level of <a
            class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition"
            data-tooltip-href="/conditions/4-tooltip">exhaustion</a> that lingers until the test ends.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="35924041-ce02-483f-96a6-e4e4ec0d6546"><strong>Dream Logic.</strong> Like a dream, the test
        doesn’t need to make sense or be consistent from moment to moment. It’s okay for the character’s surroundings to
        shift dramatically or for unexpected individuals to show up. Don’t let these changes make the character feel
        like their choices don’t matter. Rather, change situations to heighten the drama—like by turning innocents into
        allies or childhood friends.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5b27b375-2391-4d87-ba51-12896bce067f"><strong>Timing.</strong> The test should last as
        long as feels dramatic and end after a character-defining moral choice. If it seems like things are going too
        fast, raise the stakes and make things worse to see if the character sticks with their choices.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ConcludingtheTest"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5a0dd977-0398-4014-9658-9aba0d0fa6d7">When the test is complete, there’s another flash of
        light, and the test-taking character finds themself back with Demelin. If the character forsook magic or refused
        to engage with the test, they fall dead. If they completed the test, their clothing transforms into the robes of
        their new order in the Mages of High Sorcery. Read or paraphrase the following:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>Demelin assesses your new robes. Nodding, she says, “Welcome to the order, fellow Mage of High Sorcery.”</p>

            some of its broken districts scarred by fire and flooding. Here and there, crumbled structures and massive
            rocks bob gently in defiance of gravity. At the city’s center, a delicate tower of sharp marble and graceful

            out as long as we can. See if you can get at whoever’s in charge in there!”</p>

        Dragon Army’s leaders within the city rather than pursing Soth. The gnome is confident that Kalaman’s forces can
        retreat safely, telling the characters she has a few tricks in store for their pursuers. Make it clear the

        The northwestern district punctured a subterranean aquifer in its crash, flooding its streets, while fire raged
        through homes in the southwestern district. The western pleasure gardens have become an untamed jungle where
        descendants of the city’s monstrous menageries hunt amid vine-choked streets. Meanwhile, the eastern blocks lie
        propped against the crater rim, the whole district tilted at an angle.</p>

        <p>This familiar conference hall and its large round table have seen significant repairs since last you were

        Kalaman’s forces have held their own, but the Dragon Army has claimed much of the surrounding land. The enemy
        has conspicuously avoided Kalaman, and the bulk of its forces are camped near the ruins of Vogler, as if waiting
        for something. With the news of the flying citadel, Vendri now knows why. She has ordered all troops to return
        to Kalaman and shore up the defenses along the walls. However, she admits the city has little hope of defeating

            flying citadel. Otherworldly smokes roil from the ruined temple atop the floating island. As it drifts into
            place above the battlefield, reanimated corpses of ancient dragons circle the ruins, glowing with the same

        He doesn’t know what’s in the cave beyond the landing site, but he urges the characters to move fast and stay
        quiet, as untold numbers of Dragon Army troops occupy the land around the Bastion of Takhisis above. Soon after,
        Clystran and the dragonnels depart.</p>

        by the vampire Alstare Bellis, they assumed control of the temple and continued their worship. When Lord Soth

    <p data-content-chunk-id="770247ed-bbe9-4950-ba65-b0ec3fd25870"><strong>Marshal Vendri.</strong> Ever pragmatic,
        Marshal Vendri is wary the Dragon Army might soon return, and she seeks ways to reinforce the city’s defenses.
        She also plans to send agents to Maelgoth and Palanthas to court the Knights of Solamnia and the country’s other
        great cities to aid in Kalaman’s defense.</p>

        Kalaman’s support, Raven is leading an initial foray to Vogler. She hopes to see what can be salvaged and to

        honorable discharge are rewarded with platinum medallions bearing the symbol of Kalaman worth 2,500 gp.
        Characters who choose to remain a part of Kalaman’s army receive the same medallion and are granted a new title:

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4475e73c-5f58-4363-b3b3-235a5b571d16">Anhkoloxes are vicious undead creatures created from
        the bones of bears and other beasts. Their barbed bones grind and crack, often moving in seemingly impossible
        ways. Anhkoloxes are driven by territorial instinct and a predatory urge to hunt and devour living prey. They
        run on all fours and rear up onto their hind legs when they corner their quarry. When they strike, they wallop
        foes about with their claws—they delight in knocking foes into pits full of jagged bones—and their barbed rib
        cage cracks open like a hunting trap to snap closed around a victim.</p>

        Solamnia, Caradoc burned when Dargaard Keep was consumed in the fires of the Cataclysm. As with many of Soth’s
        retainers, Caradoc was cursed with undeath. Being duplicitous and cowardly at his core, the seneschal didn’t
        return as a skeletal knight but rather as an intangible spirit. Caradoc’s Undead form suits him well, allowing
        him to possess the living and use unwilling tongues to spread his lies. However, Caradoc is tethered to his
        scorched bones, which collect dust in Dargaard Keep. He can leave the accursed castle while possessing the body
        of a Humanoid, but he’s swiftly pulled back if caught beyond its walls without a host.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1ffee885-877a-40a4-88e0-730357e0f355">Death dragons are the Undead skeletal remains of
        metallic or chromatic dragons, infused with the lingering fires of the Cataclysm by foul magic. Rarely, death
        dragons arise when a dragon meets its end in a way that torments its soul and consumes it with a need for
        vengeance. Regardless of how it arose, a death dragon retains a shadow of its former personality. The stronger
        the death dragon, the more it fights the hate consuming it, holding on to some vestige of its memories.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e6547546-bf9b-4f43-b9aa-1dc1850571cf">A death dragon’s bones burn with violet Cataclysmic
        fire, which it can unleash in a horrific mockery of the breath weapon it possessed in life. The breath snuffs
        out life force and infuses undeath into corpses it touches. These zombies burn with Cataclysmic fire and serve
        the death dragon’s will, typically going on rampages to destroy all living creatures in sight.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3dac260d-5dc2-49d1-81f3-98576c7896c8">Some death dragons manage to retain almost all of
        their former selves, albeit twisted by their state of being. These greater death dragons scheme to achieve their
        ends, all the while amassing and jealously guarding treasure hoards as they did in life. In battle, they are
        deadly foes, channeling the Cataclysmic fire that limns their bones and fuels their breath. They take cruel
        delight in snatching foes in their jaws, rushing into the air, then dropping the snared creatures to their doom.

        noxious fumes resembling those of their dragon progenitors. Auraks are masterminds and strategists that serve as
        commanders in the Dragon Armies. They often lead contingents of less powerful draconians. When slain, aurak

        emerge from the eggs of brass dragons. They are the smallest of the draconians, and their slight wings are
        incapable of flight, though they do afford the draconians some control when falling. These wings are small
        enough to be hidden beneath a cloak or robe, and baaz draconians disguise themselves to spy for the Dragon
        Armies. The sight of dragons drives baaz draconians into a deadly furor. When baaz draconians die, their bodies
        turn to stone and unleash clouds of petrifying gas that turn their corpses and any nearby creatures into stone.

        fantastic structures that once marked the glory of Istar, these drones resemble short, stout mantises. They have
        four scuttling insectile legs and barbed, scythe-shaped arms for carrying and placing building materials. The
        drones create a viscous gel that hardens into crystalline mortar, which they can repurpose to restrain
        attackers.</p>

        recreate the glories of Ansalon’s past. During the Dragon Armies’ invasions of Khur and Kendermore, Lohezet’s
        investigations of Istarian ruins revealed the location of the flying city of Onyari. He now travels with the Red
        Dragon Army, intent on finding the City of Lost Names and restoring it to the skies.</p>

        Krynn. Once a Solamnic Knight of the Order of the Rose, Soth was a paragon of virtue and justice who allowed his
        pride to lead him down an evil path. The gods gave Soth a chance at redemption, charging him with confronting
        the Kingpriest of Istar and averting the Cataclysm. However, he was undone by his pride, abandoned his quest,
        and allowed the Cataclysm to devastate Krynn. Soth perished during the Cataclysm but then rose from the ashes as
        an Undead horror. In his cursed castle, Dargaard Keep, Soth long ignored the ruined world, but the Dragon
        Queen’s summons has called his evil forth once more.</p>

        regains its will and is free to pursue its own ends.</p>

        difficult to destroy. They cling to the sins that curse them, and they fight until their skulls are reduced to
        shards. Their blades deal lingering wounds that sap their victims’ life force and leave blackened scars even
        after magical healing.</p>

        who can accompany the player characters on their adventures. The following sidekicks are appropriate for a
        1st-level adventuring party. Consider adding one or more sidekicks to round out your characters’ group if there
        are fewer than four players. As the DM, you can play sidekicks, or players can play them alongside their own
        characters. You can read more about <a

        levels, the sidekick also advances in level. This represents a combination of the adventures the sidekick has
        shared with the group and the sidekick’s own training.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b841aea2-58f8-403c-9eb8-64f986543a48">A sidekick’s level should always equal the average
        level of the adventuring party, and it should go up whenever the group’s average level does. Consult the tables
        throughout this appendix for guidance on how to update the sidekicks’ stat blocks when they advance to levels 2
        through 11.</p>
