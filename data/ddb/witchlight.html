        world of your choosing—perhaps a world of your own creation—then ventures into the Feywild. Also known as the
        Plane of Faerie, the Feywild is a place of wonder and whimsy ruled by unfettered emotion. Before running this

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7d73e537-a800-4499-b9dc-9c4433334412">The main antagonists of this story are three hags
        who collectively form the Hourglass Coven, which is described in <a
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/twbtw/factions#HourglassCoven"
            data-content-chunk-id="57222553-74c6-4851-87c3-58e5f0519dae">appendix B</a>. These hags are the adoptive
        sisters of Iggwilv, a powerful figure from D&amp;D’s past and a key player in the adventure’s unfolding drama.
        Using an artifact called <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"
            href="/magic-items/3895570-iggwilvs-cauldron" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/3895570-tooltip">Iggwilv’s
            Cauldron</a>, the hags have trapped an archfey named Zybilna in temporal stasis and carved up her fey domain
        among them. This domain is called Prismeer. To enter it, the characters must first visit the Witchlight
        Carnival, which travels across the Material Plane and appears on the characters’ world once every eight years.
        The carnival owners are a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named Mister Witch and Mister
        Light, who can help or hinder the characters’ efforts to reach Prismeer.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fc5ce0d5-a9bf-4a55-beef-74a412f68dd6">One of the many novelties of this adventure is that
        the characters can accomplish their goals without resorting to violence—but only if they’re clever. They can
        fight their way through the adventure as well, but the odds won’t always be in their favor.</p>

        1st level. If your players are more interested in exploration and social interaction than combat, or if you want
        to make the characters’ Feywild excursion less dangerous, have them start at 3rd level instead. Advancement is
        handled the same way regardless.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0d0748e0-7589-4720-869a-f3525e2e8526">In this adventure, the characters receive experience

        the characters enter a hag’s realm (Hither, Thither, or Yon) for the first time, everyone in the party receives
        enough XP to advance 1 level. For example, when the characters leave the Witchlight Carnival and arrive in
        Hither for the first time, they gain a level.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6fcee7ac-dee6-487f-b348-1798a4feee0c">One side of the poster map shows the Witchlight
        Carnival and a Time Tracker, to help you track the passage of time as the characters explore the carnival.
        Certain carnival events occur only when the Time Tracker reaches a certain point. Though it’s not necessary,
        your group can place tokens or miniatures on the map to keep track of where the characters are in the carnival
        at any given time.</p>

        <p>EIGHT AND THREE</p>
        <p>As you run <em>The Wild Beyond the Witchlight</em>, look for ways to bring the numbers eight and three to the
            fore. For example, characters who take a long rest in the fey domain of Prismeer might, without fail, be
            awakened by three songbirds at the end of the eighth hour.</p>
        <p>The number eight is symbolically important, as this adventure plays with the themes of time and nostalgia.
            The numeral 8 resembles an hourglass, which measures the passage of time, and looks like the symbol for
            infinity (8) turned on its side. Hidden within the numeral 8 itself is the numeral 3. In the D&amp;D
            multiverse, there exists the Rule of Three, which states that events of cosmic consequence often manifest in
            threes. Time, for instance, has a past, present, and future. The Hourglass Coven has three members. The fey
            domain of Prismeer is divided into three splinter-realms, which adventurers explore with the help of three
            guides.</p>
        <p>Hidden within the adventure are numerous other mentions of the numbers eight and three. Can you find them
            all?</p>

        (such as secret doors and other hidden features) until the characters are able to detect and interact with them.

        advised to jot down information on the Story Tracker, as events that happen in earlier chapters can give
        characters an advantage in later chapters. The Story Tracker also allows you to record important details. For
        example, if a character falls under a curse, noting the specifics of the curse on the Story Tracker might remind
        you of the effect.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3faf4e7a-c40a-42fb-90e9-14b198a0ef4c">Creature stat blocks should be kept hidden from the
        players until circumstances warrant otherwise, as discussed below.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="957163e9-b3a6-4a4d-ae9a-bedabea53b89"><strong><em>Armor Class.</em></strong> When
        characters make attacks against a creature, you compare those attacks to the creature’s Armor Class to determine
        whether the attacks hit. After a certain number of hits and misses, players can usually pinpoint a creature’s AC
        on their own. However, in the interest of speeding up combat, you can divulge a creature’s AC once the
        characters have hit the creature at least once, allowing players to know without asking if attacks made against
        the creature hit or miss.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6b276d6d-7592-4c2c-beec-2b2f2a115ca4"><strong><em>Hit Points.</em></strong> It’s better
        not to tell players how many hit points a creature has. However, you can give the players a sense of how well
        they’re doing against the creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if
        the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded or on the
        ropes. Such information gives the players a sense of accomplishment and might spur them to press the attack. On
        the other hand, if the characters aren’t putting much of a dent in the creature’s hit points, either because it
        has a lot of them or it has a trait such as Regeneration, it’s a good idea to let the players know that the
        creature looks like it can take a lot more punishment. That information alone might encourage the players to
        consider a change of plan, such as a tactical retreat.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="30a083b5-1b5c-46d9-bb57-34e785a5880b"><strong><em>Damage.</em></strong> Players need you
        to tell them how much damage their characters take and what type of damage it is. Whenever the adventure
        presents damage that is variable, it shows the average damage first, followed by a die expression in
        parentheses, like this: 10 (3d6). You decide whether to use the average or roll the dice. Using average damage
        speeds up play, but it might feel less exciting, and players can take advantage of its predictability. Rolling
        the dice takes more time but can yield more volatile results. In the interest of fairness, commit to one
        approach or the other for the duration of an encounter or game session.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="37e6b9a0-4a23-413d-8de0-bcd1d6fb4e6d"><strong><em>Abilities, Strengths, and
                Weaknesses.</em></strong> As their characters fight a creature, players expect to learn more about the
        creature’s strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. It’s okay to share such information with them as it becomes
        apparent. For example, you can describe a creature’s wounds closing up when it regenerates.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="54441327-9daf-49ca-8336-7ffe4d87e2b3">Characters don’t need to fight a creature to know
        certain facts about it. For example, a character who has the Witchlight hand background and chose a sprite for a
        carnival companion would know a lot about sprites, including their ability to turn <a

            data-tooltip-href="/conditions/8-tooltip">invisible</a>. Similarly, if a character intuits that a <a
            class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17037-treant"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17037-tooltip">treant</a>, being a creature made of wood, has vulnerability to
        fire damage, just smile faintly and say, “That’s a reasonable hypothesis.” If the treant takes double damage
        from a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2102-fireball"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2102-tooltip">fireball</a> spell, be sure to let players know how badly the fire
        hurt it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="11e92237-5788-46ca-a00d-c8f7122b4142">Don’t be afraid to dole out information to
        characters who have the applicable knowledge. If you’re not sure whether the characters possess such knowledge,
        have them make an Intelligence check (see the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c7bd46c3-883f-4396-acc6-75a72ccaf0e5">Many DMs like to roll their dice in the open, for
        all the players to see, to maintain transparency. Other DMs prefer to roll dice behind a screen to maintain
        suspense. Either approach is fine.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ec7996a6-d635-4ccd-b5bb-16349bd08305">Even DMs who conceal their dice rolls might divulge
        certain results. For example, when a creature scores a critical hit against a character, it’s customary to let
        the player know that their character just took a particularly nasty hit before revealing how much damage was
        dealt.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0531213a-21ed-42ac-b968-957bfcaf5463">It’s okay to ask one of your players to make a die
        roll for you. For example, if you plan to use one of this adventure’s random encounters, you can have a player
        roll to determine what the characters encounter, rather than making the roll yourself.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="StoryInformation"
        data-content-chunk-id="695bcf0b-9831-418c-8422-9f9709849ecf"><a href="#StoryInformation"
            data-content-chunk-id="2dfd34c4-c511-4a90-a7d1-a38f86a51e5f"></a>Story Information</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e6845242-fda4-45d0-8bcd-a9198859e0b2">Important information that doesn’t appear in boxed
        text is usually communicated to players through roleplaying. As the DM, you roleplay all the creatures that the
        characters encounter in the adventure. Many of the DM-controlled creatures (also called nonplayer characters, or
        NPCs) in this adventure know information that the characters can learn through inquiry. The adventure outlines
        the most likely circumstances under which a creature will share what it knows.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b1bb10fc-1d8b-4ea9-be5f-9870fe6d2c2e">The adventure describes important creatures in
        detail, while creatures of little consequence get no more than a passing reference. As such, you have enough
        information to bring important creatures to life, but not so much that it becomes a chore to remember all the
        details. The adventure seldom goes so far as to describe what a creature sounds like, nor does it reveal
        everything that a creature might say or do. You’re expected to improvise and bring creatures to life as best you
        can. For example, the adventure describes Mister Light (one of the owners of the Witchlight Carnival) as a
        flamboyant figure, but you get to decide what his voice sounds like and how he reacts to a given situation,
        based on what the adventure says about him. You can also ignore what the text says and roleplay Mister Light or
        any other creature as you see fit.</p>

        are optional; they provide roleplaying notes for several other colorful characters who aren’t as pivotal. You
        can photocopy these cards, cut them out, and keep them in a handy stack behind your DM screen, sorted
        alphabetically or grouped by chapter. (The latter option works better if you expect the current game session to
        focus entirely on one chapter of the adventure.)</p>

        <p>MAKING MISTAKES</p>
        <p>Dungeon Masters are fallible, just like everyone else, and even the most experienced DMs make mistakes. If
            you overlook, forget, or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. This is a big adventure with
            lots of interconnecting elements; no one expects you to internalize or memorize every aspect of it. As long

        things. Perhaps you stumbled through a fey crossing by chance during a twilight stroll in the woods. Perhaps you
        were kidnapped by evil Fey but escaped from their clutches. Whatever the manner of your disappearance, you

        which they’ve lost.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5bd49230-2dbf-4b6e-bcd9-5ebd63dd41f5">The adventure begins shortly after the Witchlight
        Carnival returns to the characters’ world for the first time in eight years. One or more characters might be
        Witchlight hands or troubadours who have spent years traveling with the carnival; the remaining party members
        are assumed to be visitors who remember the carnival from childhood. It’s possible for certain characters to
        know each other, either because they work together at the carnival or because they’re from the same settlement.

        <p>The traveling extravaganza known as the Witchlight Carnival visits your world once every eight years. You
            have a dim memory of sneaking into the carnival as a child without paying for a ticket. That memory has
            grown foggy over time, though it still conjures a weird admixture of emotions—wonder and awe mixed with loss
            and regret. During this childhood visit, your character lost something. You tried to find it, but the
            carnival owners—a pair of elves named Mister Witch and Mister Light—were decidedly unhelpful.</p>

        <p>“The carnival goes round and round,” said Light. “The multiverse is our playground. Nothing’s free and
            nothing’s lost. Every visit has its cost.”</p>
        <p>As time passed, your heart became less heavy, and you gave less and less thought to those childhood events.
            Now, for reasons you can’t explain, the longing to retrieve that which you have lost has resurfaced, as
            though an old spell has faded away, allowing you to feel the loss as sharply as if it happened yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>The Witchlight Carnival has returned, and you find yourself standing near a ticket booth by the entrance at
            twilight, just as the carnival is about to open. There you meet others who look as troubled as you. Without
            knowing how or why, you sense that each of them has lost something as well. Perhaps fate has brought you
            together.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b6efafb8-c193-40a5-bcc8-5aa0842ae371">Use this hook if you or your players don’t like the
        idea of the characters having to find things that they lost as children and would prefer a more traditional
        adventure setup. This hook requires that one or more characters have backgrounds unconnected to the Witchlight
        Carnival.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ba48c8ec-cccd-4e11-b14e-d07851520b6d">If you’re using the adventure’s Story Tracker, you
        won’t need to fill out the “Lost Things” section. Just leave it blank.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a8f6abb4-9ae9-43cf-84fb-b6f2b12bed46">In this preamble, an aging warlock named Madryck
        Roslof tells the characters (those not working at the Witchlight Carnival) about a faerie realm called Prismeer,
        which can be reached only by finding and using a fey crossing in the carnival. Madryck says that his archfey
        patron, Zybilna, rules Prismeer. He begs the characters to journey to this domain and find out what has happened
        to Zybilna, with whom he has lost contact.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8b12368f-2a99-4edb-916e-1184e37ac4de">If you like, you can replace Madryck Roslof with a
        different NPC who better suits your campaign. Whether Madryck or someone else gives the quest, the characters
        must travel across the land of Prismeer to reach the Palace of Heart’s Desire (described in <a
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/twbtw/palace-of-hearts-desire/"
            data-content-chunk-id="73561c90-2ad2-4ff5-99dd-7b95dc86980b">chapter 5</a>), where Zybilna is frozen in
        time. Because this quest is more difficult than the one tied to the “Lost Things” adventure hook, the potential
        rewards are greater.</p>

        <p>WARLOCKS OF THE ARCHFEY</p>
        <p>If the adventuring party includes a warlock whose otherworldly patron is the Archfey, consider allowing that
            character’s player to choose Zybilna as the warlock’s patron. Warlocks who make pacts with Zybilna regard
            her as a generous, fairy godmother-like figure.</p>

        text to the players whose characters aren’t part of the carnival:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>You have been summoned to the abode of a human warlock named Madryck Roslof. He lives on a giant pumpkin
            farm, sharing his rustic farmhouse space with rodents and pixies. His adventuring days are behind him, and
            he looks quite old and frail. Nevertheless, he is delighted to make your acquaintance.</p>
        <p>“I’ve acquired many treasures and made important contacts during my lengthy adventuring career,” says
            Madryck. “I would like to pass the treasures I possess and the favors I am owed to you. In exchange, I ask
            that you travel to Prismeer, a domain in the Feywild, and find out what fate has befallen the archfey that
            rules it. This archfey, Zybilna, is my patron and inspiration—the source of my power.</p>
        <p>“I have been unable to contact Zybilna for the better part of a year, and I fear something terrible has
            happened. My adventuring days are over, but Zybilna has been good to me, and I would like to know she is
            well before I take my leave.</p>
        <p>“Every eight years, our world is visited by a traveling extravaganza called the Witchlight Carnival. It
            recently returned and is camped three days’ travel from here. I’m asking you now because this carnival might
            pack up and leave in a week or two, and it contains your only route to Prismeer—a fey crossing, if you will.
        </p>
        <p>“Seek out Zybilna of Prismeer, help her if you can, and return with proof that she is alive and well. Upon
            your return, all the hard-won earnings of my adventuring career shall be yours.”</p>

        for a summary. (If you allow your players to make wish lists of magic items for their characters, you can
        replace one or more of Madryck’s magic item rewards with items from those lists.)</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="72264c8d-d2a9-4420-aa31-d0e2a70ab99f">Madryck doesn’t need to have a past relationship
        with any of the characters, but if the players want to tie Madryck more closely to their characters’ back
        stories, allow it. Madryck is a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16947-mage"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16947-tooltip">mage</a> (neutral good) who speaks Common, Sylvan, and two other
        languages of your choice. Although he has been out of touch with Zybilna for almost a year, he knows that time
        passes differently in parts of the Feywild, including Zybilna’s realm of Prismeer. He can’t predict how much
        time it will take for the characters to complete their quest; they might come back in a matter of days, or years
        could pass on the Material Plane before they return. Not wanting to alarm the characters, Madryck tries to steer
        the conversation away from issues involving the passage of time, if one or more characters mention something
        about it.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f7845408-abae-4db8-8a4f-bf2639370a04">If the characters request more information about the
        Witchlight Carnival, Madryck says that he hasn’t visited the carnival in sixty-four years and admits that a lot
        can change in that time. He advises the characters to explore the carnival thoroughly on their own. He doesn’t
        presume to know what form the fey crossing currently takes or how well hidden and protected it is. He does
        provide the following reliable information:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="72c32f20-5882-438d-8d5d-722239206fc7">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="ce128f43-82b7-45c6-aeb6-8f227479e363">Zybilna is a fairy godmother to mortals. She
            created the carnival as a means by which mortals could enter her realm and beseech her aid.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="b4e753c6-befc-4620-965b-b1b0405f957b">When Madryck last visited the carnival, it was
            run by a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named Mister Witch and Mister Light. He assumes
            they’re still in charge.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="93164279-1d5c-4404-853b-b0fa36645497">Madryck dimly recalls that Witch and Light
            acquired the carnival more than a hundred years ago from an eladrin (an elf native to the Feywild). The
            eladrin’s name escapes him.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9f6c33ce-0aeb-4883-9555-762e56fba4df">If the characters request more information about
        Zybilna and Prismeer, Madryck offers the following descriptions, based on firsthand knowledge that is somewhat
        out of date:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="7eeb62ea-6b3e-4fa1-be88-528431bb1976">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="35762432-79ea-48f6-b214-efec6cf30141">Prismeer is a domain of delight ruled by
            Zybilna, who dwells in the Palace of Heart’s Desire, a magnificent structure in the heart of the domain.
        </li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="5d31ad52-3856-4d8a-a527-2ece184dd177">Zybilna can assume many forms and is brilliant,
            secretive, and wise. (Madryck doesn’t know Zybilna’s secret identity, as revealed in <a
                href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/twbtw/palace-of-hearts-desire/"
                data-content-chunk-id="8c8dbb1b-5ef5-44b6-8ce8-e12ef5717d14">chapter 5</a>.)</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="ddc65225-5579-4df9-87f8-73e525753fa0">When she presents herself to mortals, Zybilna
            usually assumes the form of a statuesque woman with long white hair and a small tattoo shaped like a
            chicken’s foot below one eye.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fc26384f-8228-47c2-8a3f-0269f30147d3">Each character who hears Madryck’s description of

        bears the signature and arcane sigil of Saya Kalternax, a wizard known throughout the land. (You can replace
        this wizard with another mage that better suits your campaign.) The letter describes the kinship between this
        wizard and the adventuring party to which Madryck once belonged. It concludes with, “By the terms of a magically
        binding agreement, the bearer of this letter is owed one favor from Saya Kalternax or, in the event of their
        untimely demise, one of Saya’s devoted apprentices.” Although Saya died a few years ago, this letter can be
        presented to one of their apprentices (who might be difficult to locate, at your discretion). Examples of an
        appropriate favor would be the brewing of a rare or uncommon potion, the scribing of a rare or uncommon scroll,
        or the loan of a spellbook containing a selection of wizard spells of 5th level and lower. If you need
        statistics for this spellcaster, use the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16947-mage"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16947-tooltip">mage</a> stat block. Give the mage whatever alignment and
        languages you like.</p>

        from their Feywild excursion (an event likely to occur only if the characters delay their return by a year or
        longer), he leaves behind a trusted associate who can give them the key and provide directions to his hidden
        treasure. This associate might be a friendly pixie or faerie dragon, an awakened squirrel (the beneficiary of a
        druid’s <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2008-awaken"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2008-tooltip">awaken</a> spell), or some other trustworthy creature of Madryck’s
        acquaintance.</p>

        kaleidoscopic tents and wagons crewed by wondrous beings, including many denizens of the Feywild. This is no
        ordinary carnival; it uses magic to travel from world to world across the Material Plane, visiting each world
        once every eight years and setting up business on the outskirts of populated areas. The carnival spends a few
        days at each location, then packs up and moves to another location on the same world until the decision is made
        to leave that world and visit the next. The carnival includes a fey crossing, allowing travel to and from the
        Feywild domain of Prismeer.</p>

        they please. There are many paths through this chapter, so it can play out differently each time you run it.</p>

        planeswalking gnome bard named Ellywick Tumblestrum. The characters don’t know Tumblestrum, but she knows them
        because her lute has magic strings that whisper secrets to her as she plucks them. These strings guided the
        gnome bard to the carnival and revealed to Tumblestrum that the characters’ fates are intertwined with the fate
        of Prismeer. She has bought a ticket for each character who isn’t a carnival employee. (The tickets are waiting

        eight hours, ending just before dawn. When the characters enter the carnival, place a d8 at the start of the
        track in the upper left corner of the poster map with the “1” facing up. Move the die to the next space at the
        end of each in-game hour, and turn the die so that its uppermost face shows the hour that is now beginning.
        Don’t worry about managing things down to the minute. If the players (and their characters) seem to be having
        fun, you can slow down the passage of time to give them time to enjoy the carnival’s attractions. If the game
        starts to lag or if the characters spend a lot of time engaged in the same activity, advance the die to the next
        hour.</p>

        can affect the overall mood at the carnival. When the characters arrive at the carnival, place a token in the
        starting space of the track in the lower right corner of the poster map. This token moves right or left along
        the track as the carnival’s atmosphere changes for better or worse.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="46233f30-6a21-4a75-9136-997a7881e796">The text informs you when to raise or lower the
        mood. When the token is to the right of the starting space, spirits are high: colors appear more vibrant,
        flowers bloom around the fairgrounds, and shooting stars sweep across the clear night sky. When the token is to
        the left of the starting space, the mood becomes darker: the calliope music plays discordantly, the staff is
        tense, and stormy weather looms in the sky above the carnival.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8eab7456-9ab0-4e9f-b820-c084f32bf522">The carnival’s mood is used to trigger an important
        meeting between the characters and the carnival owners. If the mood reaches either of the end spaces on the
        track, the carnival’s owners invite the characters to speak with them in their wagon (see “<a
            href="#MeetingWitchandLight" data-content-chunk-id="e025cb20-4b32-4530-bde4-edd78b3d2897">Meeting Witch and
            Light</a>” toward the end of the chapter). Characters who attend the Big Top Extravaganza can also receive
        an invitation to meet with the owners, even if the carnival’s mood isn’t in an extreme state.</p>

        <p>WITCH AND LIGHT’S HOURGLASS PACT</p>
        <p>When the hags of the Hourglass Coven took control of Prismeer, they gained leverage over Mister Witch and
            Mister Light. The hags know that Witch and Light are not the carnival’s original owners and have threatened
            to divest them of their status by orchestrating a reunion between the Witchlight Carnival and its
            counterpart in the Shadowfell (which would force Witch and Light to give up the former and return to the
            latter).</p>
        <p>Terrified of losing their Feywild fair, the two shadar-kai have agreed to let the coven steal from anyone who
            sneaks into the carnival without a ticket. Witch and Light have tried to neutralize this situation by
            diligently checking all visitors for tickets, but some unfortunates inevitably slip through, making them
            targets for the hags’ thieves (see “<a href="#ThievesoftheCoven">Thieves of the Coven</a>”).</p>

        devoid of pretense, while Light is flamboyant and coy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b7a836d8-861e-43f8-a51e-f4bfb37f5d00">How Witch and Light came to possess the carnival is
        a story worth telling. Under different names, they owned another carnival that prowled the edges of the
        Shadowfell. The two carnivals crossed paths many years ago, and after much wine was consumed, the owners could
        not agree on which carnival was the better of the two, so they decided it would be great fun to swap ownership.
        Isolde, the eladrin who ran the fey-themed carnival, traded places with the two shadar-kai who ran the
        shadow-themed carnival. This arrangement would last until the two carnivals met again, which has not yet
        happened.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="161f8a8f-f6c0-40e1-9436-94e589b417ab">After trading their sinister carnival for a more
        lighthearted one, the two shadar-kai took the names Witch and Light. Gradually, these morose, emotionally
        stunted shadar-kai transformed into fun-loving free spirits who secretly dread the day when the two carnivals
        cross paths again. They have no desire to return to their gloomy old carnival, which is described in more detail
        in <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr"
            data-content-chunk-id="49057b65-48b4-46c2-8703-eed7af09ecf5">Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</a>.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fd6f292d-7f87-4f77-822a-a93fe03dc06d">The shadar-kai are aware that the Hourglass Coven
        has usurped Zybilna’s domain in the Feywild. They don’t know how the coven accomplished this coup, but Witch and
        Light would like nothing more than to see the hags defeated and Zybilna returned to power. But they dare not
        play a part in making that dream a reality. If the coven caught a whiff of dissent from Witch and Light, the
        hags would punish the shadar-kai for their impudence (see the “Witch and Light’s Hourglass Pact” sidebar). Witch
        and Light do what they can to appease the hags while secretly rooting for Zybilna’s return. They know Zybilna’s
        true identity but dare not reveal it.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5d696698-e79f-4d33-9f1a-e1707d69208d">Witch, who used to go by the name Naeryx Krumple,
        spent his youth as a homeless orphan, eking out a meager and dreary existence on the fog-shrouded streets of
        Gloomwrought, a city in the Shadowfell. He earned a few coppers selling broadsheets as a young boy, then later
        swept floors until an old clock tower keeper took him on as a helper. The tower’s clock was in such poor
        condition that it would break down often. Naeryx helped with the repairs and found that the work gave him a
        sliver of joy. When the old keeper died years later, Naeryx replaced him.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="044b16aa-1c24-4908-896e-3a6226b02450">The wealthy family that owned the clock tower didn’t
        pay Naeryx a lot of money for his work, but they occasionally had him over for dinner. He owned one fine suit
        that he wore on such occasions, and though he didn’t care for the family’s matriarch or patriarch, he enjoyed
        the company of their eldest son, Urmius Umbrage—a brooding shadar-kai ne’er-do-well with a cruel sense of humor.
        Naeryx and Urmius were close in age and got along well in all respects. Years later, without informing the rest
        of his family, Urmius bought a run-down carnival and persuaded Naeryx to help him operate it. Naeryx and
        Urmius—now calling themselves Mister Witch and Mister Light—have been partners and collaborators ever since.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="bce0d3c3-2a49-4670-9492-5f943ab30628">This ornate pocket watch is fastened to the end of a
        gold chain. It glows with a faint golden light when opened, and it makes a soft ticking noise that can be heard
        only by the creature holding it. The face of the watch shows a miniature painting of the Witchlight Carnival
        ringed by a tiny henge, orbited at night by a mote of light small enough to slip through the eye of a needle.
        This light causes the henge to cast shadows, and these shadows allow the watch’s owner to track the passage of
        time.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="72770741-0147-4750-a596-d5bf008fa8f4"><strong><em>Carnival Setup and
                Takedown.</em></strong> The creature attuned to the watch can use an action to initiate the packing up
        or the unpacking of the Witchlight Carnival, provided the creature and the carnival are on the same plane of
        existence. In the span of 1 hour, all objects that are elements of the carnival are magically whisked about
        until everything is packed up and ready for travel, or unpacked and assembled. The watch has no effect on
        creatures, which can move about freely and safely while the carnival is being set up or taken down. Once the
        process of packing up or unpacking the carnival begins, it can’t be stopped until the task is complete. When the
        watch is used to pack up or unpack the carnival, this property cannot be used again until 8 hours have elapsed.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b3db89e9-414d-4a48-b8a4-581c9b3699e3">Light, formerly known as Urmius Umbrage, belonged to
        a filthy rich shadar-kai family that haunted a crumbling mansion in Gloomwrought. Although he wanted for nothing
        as a child, Urmius found himself surrounded by family members, caretakers, and teachers who were uniformly cold,
        callous, and mean-spirited. He grew tired of being seen as nothing more than the inheritor of the Umbrage estate
        and legacy, and he did everything in his power to make life miserable for everyone around him, especially his
        parents. He seemed bereft of ambition and spent much of his time playing in his room. He collected costumes and
        liked nothing more than to parade around Umbrage Mansion in strange garments and outlandish makeup.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9df1e18c-92ab-4cb9-b6c4-830d5dc4cac9">Urmius first met Naeryx Krumple at a family dinner
        and didn’t think much of the clock tower keeper at first. But Urmius found himself taken aback by Naeryx’s
        ability to find even a small amount of joy in his work. He was eager to get to know Naeryx better, though it
        took a while for Naeryx to trust him. After getting his hands on some money, Urmius bought a sad little carnival
        that was camped on the outskirts of Gloomwrought and asked Naeryx to help him run it. For Urmius, the carnival
        was a chance to emerge from under his family’s shadow and become the master of his own fate, but it also meant
        forsaking his inheritance in order to embrace the unconventional lifestyle, fashions, and friendships he
        desired.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4c165195-d974-4104-aabd-021be035fe9e">Mister Light has a slender frame. He is always
        dressed in some sort of costume and is rarely seen in public without makeup. He carries around a fancy weather
        vane given to him by the carnival’s previous owner. He twirls it and waves it around like a fool’s scepter, but
        its power is far greater than he lets on. With this magic vane, he can affect the mood of everyone in the
        Witchlight Carnival.</p>

        of one who is attuned to it, the vane can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage
        rolls made with it. In addition, the vane deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.</p>

        is inside the perimeter of the Witchlight Carnival, it can sense the mood of every creature in the carnival that

        location of the happiest creature in the carnival.</p>

        slowly clockwise when spirits in the carnival are generally high; if the general mood in the carnival is dour,
        the top of the vane spins slowly counterclockwise.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f57f1a48-3709-401d-b024-c21ab061107a"><strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The vane is a
        sentient, chaotic good wondrous item with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It has
        hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet, and it communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature
        attuned to it. Its purpose is to make sure everyone in the Witchlight Carnival is having a good time.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b5df94dd-b032-43fc-a4d6-d8b77d02142b">Witchlight hands are the backbone of the Witchlight
        Carnival, a motley collection of individuals who operate many of the booths, make repairs, feed and exercise the
        animals, keep an eye out for thieves and other miscreants, and perform other miscellaneous tasks as Mister Witch
        dictates. A few also work part-time as performers and attractions. Although they travel to many worlds
        throughout the Material Plane, Witchlight hands rarely leave the carnival grounds. The carnival is the only
        world they know and care about.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b292c01e-309a-4cbc-8507-a652fe8ba394">The carnival employs 124 Witchlight hands in total.
        All hands enter into an agreement when they join the carnival: they must never harm another staff member, and
        they can’t leave the carnival for more than a day at a time. (A longer absence is equivalent to resignation, in
        Mister Witch’s estimation.) On-duty staff members are required to wear fake butterfly wings strapped to their
        backs. Mister Witch and Mister Light also furnish them with small amounts of <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3d7abb66-a4fd-4f40-b222-ed497cfa2b59">Witchlight hands are paid only a small fraction of
        the carnival’s profits, but it’s enough to keep them fed, clothed, and cared for. Some hands work longer hours
        or do extra chores to pay off debts and loans.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8de5df93-23af-4957-a3e6-3621aba6399a">Most Witchlight hands are taught how to perform
        minor magic tricks, which they use to amuse themselves as well as entertain the masses. (Characters who have the
        Witchlight hand background don’t learn magic as part of their upbringing, but they can choose to account for
        this by selecting a spellcasting class.)</p>

        attractions in the carnival have a cost of 1 ticket punch. After the eighth punch, a ticket becomes a worthless

            escorted to the main entrance and directed to the ticket booth. If the character runs away from the
            Witchlight hands, the hands don’t bother giving chase, but the carnival’s mood lowers by one step (see “<a

        deal that ends when the Witchlight Monarch is crowned (see “<a href="#TimedEvents"
            data-content-chunk-id="60a6690e-1a90-47a9-baa0-3a990e98d8bd">Timed Events</a>” toward the end of the
        chapter). If a character chooses to enter into such a pact, roll on the Ticket Pacts table to determine the
        conditions. A character who barters for multiple tickets can have more than one pact in effect; if any table
        result comes up twice, choose a different result.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cc5230fa-4577-4d04-9b18-2b3ece147e2e">Any character who fulfills the conditions of a pact
        should be a strong contender for the title of Witchlight Monarch. A character who doesn’t abide by the pact
        loses their ticket, which transforms into an ordinary bat and flaps away. In addition, the carnival’s mood
        lowers by 1 step (see “Tracking Mood” earlier in the chapter).</p>

        carousel is named Diana Cloppington. Once a human, Diana sought the help of Granny Nightshade of the Hourglass
        Coven, desperately wishing to be reunited with her warhorse, which went missing in battle. The cruel hag
        magically fused the bodies of Diana and her horse, giving her the appearance of a centaur. Diana fled Prismeer

        sadness behind her eyes. She’s quick to correct anyone who calls her a centaur, saying that she’s “a human who
        made a bad deal.” If Diana discovers that the characters are investigating the carnival for their own reasons,
        she tells them how a hag made good on a promise to reunite Diana with her missing horse; however, due to the

        “Riddle of the Carousel” below). Diana tells them that they must “speak to the unicorns,” but to earn their
        trust they must learn the names of all eight unicorns. Diana gives one of the characters a clay pot of gold

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d9451afe-9837-46e4-a7d4-0d974b579992">The names for each pair of unicorns are key words
        from a well-known proverb. Before any of the unicorns share secrets with their riders, all of them must have
        their correct names painted on their tags. One unicorn in each pair has some letters missing from its name tag,
        but players who are familiar with the proverbs can fill in the missing letters.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cad9ae38-d1ba-4189-a154-c8568588bccb"><strong>First Pair.</strong> The first two unicorns

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e1e2d7bd-c5c7-4da2-8f4b-a12adeadb19b">If you are running this adventure for players who
        don’t have a good grasp of English proverbs, use different pairs of words that the players will have an easier
        time identifying. For example, each pair of unicorns might have names that are synonymous with each other, such
        as Jolly/Merry (M E _ _ _), Breeze/Gust (G _ _ T), Tale/Yarn (_ _ R N), and Dawn/Sunrise (S _ _ _ I S _).
        Otherwise, choose names from idioms or proverbs with which your players are familiar.</p>

        unicorns, Diana offers them a free ride on the attraction. Any unicorn whose name is incorrect gives a
        disgruntled whinny, and the characters learn nothing from any of the unicorns if they are ridden. If all the
        unicorns’ names are correct, each unicorn telepathically shares with its rider three secrets about Prismeer or
        the Hourglass Coven during this ride. These secrets can be imparted in response to questions asked by the
        character, or they can be shared without a prompt if the character doesn’t know what to ask.</p>

        Tumblestrum is necessary, since she won’t harm or hinder the characters and can’t be seriously harmed by them.
        Her thoughts are likewise hidden, since no magic can read them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="59ddf66d-6af5-4abb-9748-8d7fa28e1596">Tumblestrum is meant to be an enigma to the player
        characters. In truth, she is a savvy planar traveler who has visited and entertained folks on countless worlds.
        In some corners of the multiverse, she is what’s known as a Planeswalker—a fiercely independent and extremely
        powerful entity not to be trifled with. Tumblestrum disapproves of the Hourglass Coven’s cruelty and aims to
        deliver some much-needed comeuppance. The gnome sees the characters as agents of change who can undo some of the
        damage caused by the coven, and she suspects that if they do so, the characters will be on their way to becoming
        heroes worthy of epic ballads.</p>

        (The change lasts only as long as he can hear her sing.) This surprised them both, and when the pair met, they
        fell in love. Recently, Candlefoot was about to propose to Palasha when his voice was snatched by Kettlesteam.
        If questioned, Candlefoot tries to explain his sorry circumstances through mime and asks the characters to help
        him recover his voice from Kettlesteam so he can go through with his proposal.</p>

        indicate that Kettlesteam is the culprit. He doesn’t know where the kenku is, but he knows she has been causing
        mischief throughout the carnival and sometimes uses magic to conceal her true form.</p>

        if the check succeeds by 5 or more. On a failed check, the jockey’s snail moves 10 feet slower that round, or 20
        feet slower if the check fails by 5 or more. The race ends when one or more snails travel the 480 feet needed to

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d116ea90-19c4-4376-8dcb-1e540512dc2a">If asked about Kettlesteam, Witch and Light say
        she’s “a disgruntled guest and troublemaker whose fey patron, Zybilna, dwells in the Feywild domain of
        Prismeer.” They add that Zybilna is also the patron of the Witchlight Carnival, but Witch and Light have had no

            telling, but their hands are tied somehow. You’re the first people I’ve met who might be able to set things

        on schedule) and use it to compel Witch and Light to provide the answers they seek. He proposes that the best
        time to swipe the watch is during the Big Top Extravaganza, since it’s the only time when Witch and Light are
        separated. Although he doesn’t condone theft, Burly has talked himself into believing that it’s not really
        stealing if the characters give back the watch. Burly offers to assist where he can, but he doesn’t want Witch
        and Light to know that he plotted against them, because it would cost him his job and his home. He also warns
        that he’ll see no harm come to his bosses; they might be flawed, but without them, the carnival will fall apart.

            Zybilna, the archfey who rules the Feywild domain of Prismeer. Recently, Kettlesteam has become convinced
            something is amiss with her patron. As a warlock, she senses that Zybilna is no longer in touch with her—a

            Witch and Light talking in their wagon. She repeats the conversation, using her Mimicry trait to imitate
            Light’s agitated voice (“Someone is going to find out about this! They’ll shut us down!”) followed by
            Witch’s calm yet firm reply (“We agreed to this pact. Our hands were forced but our eyes were open. We let
            the Hourglass Coven take what it wants, and in return, we stay in business. That is what you want, right?”).

        off, a character retains the title of Witchlight Monarch forever, and this title bears great weight in Prismeer.
        Fey creatures in the domain will not attack a Witchlight Monarch unless the monarch attacks them first.
        Moreover, Fey creatures in Prismeer treat a Witchlight Monarch with great reverence, addressing the character as
        “Your Majesty” or “Your Highness.” The characters don’t become aware of these benefits until they arrive in
        Prismeer and interact with its inhabitants.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="46773ae8-d25b-4c24-8617-a9a245f1f548">The poster map of Prismeer shows the Feywild domain
        divided into four sections: the splinter-realms of Hither, Thither, and Yon, and the Palace of Heart’s Desire.
        These fragments are partitioned off from one another and the rest of the Feywild by walls of shimmering, silvery
        mist.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a6b86390-2ba5-4e14-a6dd-5771d3da585a">The hags of the Hourglass Coven and their minions
        can travel freely between Hither, Thither, Yon, and the Palace of Heart’s Desire simply by walking into or
        flying over the border mist, whereupon they are instantly transported to the border of whichever part of
        Prismeer contains their intended destination. Most other creatures—including the characters—are forbidden from
        leaving one part of Prismeer and entering another. Upon reaching the edge of Hither, Thither, Yon, or the
        palace, they find all paths forward blocked by the mist, which disorients them and sends them back the way they
        came. Those who try to fly above the mist never get where they intend to go, their destination always appearing
        to be miles away.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4c62fc90-f792-41fc-b243-cab4247cdadc">The outer borders of Prismeer are blocked by similar
        walls of mist through which no creature can pass without Zybilna’s consent (which she can’t give while frozen in
        time). Even the hags of the Hourglass Coven are bound by this restriction; they must use <a

            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2206-tooltip">plane shift</a> spells to leave Prismeer or reenter it. Other
        creatures capable of casting the spell can do the same.</p>

        characters can find a guide—a disloyal minion of the Hourglass Coven—who is willing and able to lead them from
        one splinter-realm to another. While in the company of one or more of these guides, the characters can move
        through the mist separating Prismeer’s splinter-realms without being turned back. These guides are as follows:

        palace, the characters must secure the help of Amidor the dandelion or other creatures in Prismeer. To leave
        Prismeer entirely, they need the help of Zybilna herself, as discussed in <a

            data-content-chunk-id="3a6e1e3a-a9a8-46d2-b194-e0aeac171784"></a>Rules of Conduct</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c9798d36-dd11-47f7-87db-abc5755b3864">Although Zybilna is indisposed, three of the rules
        she put into place when she created her Feywild domain continue to hold weight: the rule of hospitality, the
        rule of ownership, and the rule of reciprocity. These three rules are common knowledge in Prismeer, and both
        natives and visitors would do well to abide by them:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d8a12327-db5d-47b3-87e5-b9d5505bacf3"><strong>Rule of Hospitality.</strong> When a friend,
        an enemy, or a stranger enters your home, you are expected to be gracious and accommodating to them until such
        time as they prove, by their words or actions, undeserving of such hospitality.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a7bff6ac-3293-4ec5-86b4-85eeaca0da66"><strong>Rule of Ownership.</strong> You must not
        steal from a friend, an enemy, or a stranger. To take something that doesn’t belong to you without the rightful
        owner’s permission is a crime and an unforgivable breach of etiquette.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d6e329cc-db43-4fba-9dab-a9f40e7a3783"><strong>Rule of Reciprocity.</strong> When a friend,
        an enemy, or a stranger offers you a gift, you are obliged to accept it and offer something of comparable value
        (be it a gift or a service) in return. Such reciprocation need not happen immediately.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7841ac62-dcc7-4e8c-ae91-9e487939d14d">When Zybilna ruled Prismeer, few of her subjects
        dared to violate her rules. Those who did often disappeared without a trace. Now, with the Hourglass Coven in
        charge, the rules remain in force, though the circumstances are different. The hags believe strongly in
        hospitality and reciprocity, but they have a self-centered view of ownership—each claims ownership of everything
        in her realm. (For example, Bavlorna Blightstraw considers herself the owner of Hither and everything in it.)
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="812a77b2-8bbf-4fcc-8fcf-90ec0e301a26">Also, the hags are far less inclined to punish those
        who break the rules than Zybilna was, and it’s not even clear to other residents of Prismeer when a rule has
        been broken. For example, brigands are able to take what they want from other folk without paying for it, and
        nothing bad seems to happen to them as a result, but that fact alone is not enough to encourage most others to
        likewise break the rules—for all they know, the brigands might be acting in the hags’ interests.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2eed751b-94d2-4d27-a5ed-85f8565c8f87">If Zybilna were to return to power, strict
        enforcement of the rules would resume in a heartbeat, and brigands would be wise to take their propensity for
        malfeasance elsewhere.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ChildrenofPrismeer"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c176efb5-2328-4f1e-92e9-326a892284e8">In this chapter and in later chapters, the
        characters might encounter children who were lured to Prismeer from the Witchlight Carnival or who stumbled into
        Zybilna’s domain by other means. These children have been stuck in Prismeer long enough to forget about the
        worlds they came from, yet they haven’t aged much at all.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7feab646-1cf6-4b1f-8bae-bb86948f3e4b">Zybilna’s magic protects all children in Prismeer
        (but not creatures disguised as children). The hags of the Hourglass Coven are aware of this magic and unable to
        dispel it. Any child in Prismeer who would take damage as a consequence of another creature’s actions vanishes
        in a burst of multicolored light and is spirited away to a safe corner of Prismeer, unharmed and unreachable
        from the domain’s splinter-realms or the palace, until Zybilna wills the child to return to her. Children
        sequestered in this fashion are beyond the reach of everyone else and can’t be located or scried upon using
        magic.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3e9bcbab-ec4c-4c98-b231-4ba5c0906ef7">Prismeer, like other Feywild domains, is shaped by
        the emotions of the creatures that inhabit it. Even creatures of little consequence can transform the domain in
        minor ways as long as no other, more powerful force is exerting its influence. For example, flowers might wilt
        in the presence of a goblin who is terribly unhappy. Similarly, a satyr’s laughter might cause a smile to appear
        on the trunk of an inanimate tree nearby. A more powerful creature, such as a hag, can reshape a larger portion
        of the domain to reflect their emotional state. An archfey is so attuned to the Feywild that their emotions can
        suffuse an entire domain, overriding the emotional influence of all other creatures in it. From that standpoint,
        Zybilna’s dormancy enables other creatures to affect Prismeer more than they could if she were still active.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="87b19dc1-50e2-4df3-b338-a98dea02de3f">As the characters make their way across the
        splintered realms of Prismeer, any emotional outburst or change in mood they exhibit might be accompanied by a
        minor reaction in the environment, which you can determine by choosing an entry that you like from the Domain
        Transformation table or by rolling on the table to determine a random result. Not every emotion felt in Prismeer
        is worthy of a roll on the table; you can save these effects for occasions when emotions are running high, to
        remind your players that the Feywild is not like the Material Plane. Because these effects have no impact on the
        story, you can forgo using the table if you want.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9aa77574-2d01-40ee-9a25-6db66dadfd71">If Zybilna is released from her temporal stasis, the

        half-sunk in the muck. Weird and haunting creatures call Hither home, and the land is dotted with old wells that

        makes her lair in Downfall.</p>

        minutes, neck-deep murk might recede to reveal a soggy landscape of squelching mud and skeletal mangrove roots,
        but only until the waters ooze back into the swamp to fill it once again in an hour or three. The ebb and flow
        have a supernatural origin: Hither is dotted with ancient stone wells, known as o’-wells, which drink up and
        spew out the swamp water (see “<a href="#Owells"

        by Bavlorna, the will-o’-wisps are cheerful at the prospect of Bavlorna’s ruin. They are unable to move more
        than a few hundred yards from their well, but they’re eager to help strangers who are willing and able to avenge
        them. These will-o’-wisps have the following additional action option, which they use to grant boons to those

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f710259a-ba03-46f7-81a9-9b447abb403c">If the characters don’t attack immediately, one of
        the brigands with weapons drawn signals the others to stop singing with a wave of her hand. She introduces
        herself as Jebbek, and she says to the characters, “This is a robbery. If you resist, we’ll beat you black and
        blue.”</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="16231aac-fae6-4e32-939d-d9552d23f8ab">Jebbek has no interest in treasure. She demands that
        each character surrender the feeling of delight they remember from when they were given the best gift they ever
        received. Jebbek produces a stoppered gourd that can hold these memories. The stopper sports a golden knob, and
        any character who voluntarily touches the knob while Jebbek is holding the gourd loses the memory Jebbek wants
        to steal, as it is siphoned away and trapped in the gourd. (Give each player a minute or so to think about what
        the character’s memory could be and then to note it on their character sheet, as a matter of record.) Removing
        the stopper releases all memories trapped inside the gourd, whereupon they return to their original owners.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5e37ec20-a337-4956-bc84-d8d38727c4ab">If all the characters comply, the harengons leave
        with the gourd full of happy memories, saying that “Agdon Longscarf is much obliged.” If one or more characters
        refuse to give up their cherished memories, the brigands threaten the characters with a beating. At this time,
        the characters can make a DC 13 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip"

        brigands are cowed by the characters’ resolve and retreat into the swamp rather than risk getting whomped by the
        party. On a failed check, the harengons try to beat the characters <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7ca4c6cb-ffee-427f-aa3b-5efad98d2d1d">Jebbek’s gourd was a gift to Agdon Longscarf from
        Bavlorna Blightstraw. Although any creature can plug or unplug the gourd’s stopper, only Agdon or another
        creature he designates (in this case, Jebbek) can use the gourd to trap memories.</p>

        Hither. It crawls through the swamp on fleshy legs and has a walking speed of 30 feet. Its movement is not
        reduced by swampy terrain or water up to 10 feet deep. It crosses the characters’ path as they make their way
        through the swamp. Every mile, the inn stops for 10 minutes and lowers itself so that guests can enter or exit
        without risking injury.</p>

        is trapped in her palace, but she doesn’t know any details. Tsu would love to see Zybilna restored to power, if

        If the characters aren’t sure what to give her, Tsu says, “Any old trinket will do.” If the characters promise

        ahead of them. The sound foreshadows the arrival of six Humanoid creatures on stilts. The stilts allow these
        creatures to move more easily through the muck and to stay above the water. Their walking speed on stilts is 30
        feet, and this movement is not reduced by mud or water.</p>

        a battle between elves and fomorians long ago. The area is littered with rusted and broken weapons and armor,
        along with the bones of the dead. If the characters enter the area, two suits of <a

            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16786-tooltip">animated armor</a> stand up from the detritus. The suits are
        clearly of elven design, their helmets shaped like stylized owl heads. Both suits are 20 feet away from the
        party at the start of the encounter.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eeae52b3-6e08-49f4-b98e-7075b81a8ddc">Each suit of animated armor mimics the movements of
        the character closest to it. For example, if the character closest to a suit of armor swings a sword, the armor
        makes a similar gesture, though it wields no weapons. If the character casts a spell, the suit uses its action
        to mimic the somatic component of casting a spell on its next turn, though it lacks the ability to cast spells.
        If one or both suits are attacked, they stop mimicking the characters and defend themselves. Otherwise, they are
        harmless. They can’t leave the battlefield.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="467392bd-190d-4aef-8bdd-67af2494c42d">A suit becomes inanimate and collapses in a heap if
        its helmet is removed, if it is reduced to 0 hit points, or if the characters leave the area. Removing a suit’s
        helmet while the armor is animated requires an action and a successful DC 10 Dexterity (<a

        marked on the map of Hither. Move these locations as needed to put them in the characters’ path, and chalk up
        any discrepancy with the map to the shifty nature of the Feywild. (The Feywild is known to play tricks on
        travelers, redirecting them without their knowledge to places they are meant to go. Consequently, the characters
        might think they’re heading toward one part of Hither, only to find themselves arriving somewhere else.)

        <p>THE CALAMITOUS FLIGHT OF SIR TALAVAR AND WIGGLEWOG</p>
        <p>Prior to the events of this adventure, Sir Talavar, a noble faerie dragon and emissary of Titania the Summer
            Queen, traveled to Prismeer to persuade Zybilna to ally with the Seelie Court against its hated enemies, the
            fomorians. Sir Talavar soon discovered that Prismeer had been seized by the hags of the Hourglass Coven.
            Before he could return with news of their treachery, Bavlorna trapped him in an enchanted silver birdcage
            that inhibits his magic.</p>
        <p>A sympathetic bullywug named Wigglewog stole Sir Talavar’s cage and fled with it in one of Bavlorna’s
            balloons. Soon after, the balloon was attacked by a malicious wind (<a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"
                href="/monsters/16774-air-elemental" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16774-tooltip">air elemental</a>) that
            sent it careening into an ancient, crumbling tower in the middle of Hither’s swamp. The bullywug died in the
            crash, and Sir Talavar (still in his cage) has been stranded since then in the dangling wreckage of the
            balloon.</p>
        <p>A pair of serpents in Bavlorna’s service caught up to the balloon, but they are too lazy to climb up the
            tower to reach it. They have since fallen asleep near the base of the tower.</p>

        searching the swamp for truffles, Jingle Jangle was ambushed and roughed up by brigands. She suffered no
        permanent damage but has been convalescing in her den since the attack. Telemy Hill is worried for its friend

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7bbb27a2-d997-4aaa-9f5f-d3103d65117f">Telemy Hill is approximately half a square mile
        wide. A narrow game trail leads to Jingle Jangle’s den at the pinnacle of the hill. The willows that grow on the

            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16792-tooltip">awakened trees</a> that speak Common in low, rumbling voices.
        Telemy Hill uses the trees to communicate, rather than speaking itself.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9e160057-1250-496c-97fd-40956bf979ef">As the characters move up the hill, 1d4 + 1 awakened

        they can to drive the invaders off the hill. If the trees are not met with violence, they shepherd the
        characters up the hill to Jingle Jangle’s den, waving them on with their branches. Characters who stray from the
        path are met by 1d6 additional awakened trees. These trees don’t attack but join in coaxing the characters up
        the hill.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="71b5be5d-caab-441b-b88a-cc6d18d7ae7d">One of the keys in Jingle Jangle’s collection is the
        silver key that unlocks Sir Talavar’s birdcage. If the characters want this key, Jingle Jangle offers it freely,
        saying, “Better you should have it than those long-eared brigands. First they stole Jingle Jangle’s truffles.
        Next, they’ll want Jingle Jangle’s keys. Someone ought to give them a good shaking down so they know what it
        feels like!”</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c078d3be-c3f3-4f84-9ccb-ef0ee71c369c">Jingle Jangle’s obsession with keys serves as a
        cautionary tale for those who would enter into a bargain with Bavlorna Blightstraw. The goblin once sought the
        hag’s help in a desperate attempt to undo what she thought was a terrible curse: wherever Jingle Jangle went,
        she felt a tormenting fear of being caught on the wrong side of a locked door. When she appealed to Bavlorna for
        aid, the hag removed the goblin’s ability to perceive that fear and replaced it with an insatiable and
        overwhelming need to collect keys. So great is this obsession that Jingle Jangle has lost her own sense of self
        and now refers to herself only in the third person.</p>

        Longscarf and his gang of harengon brigands. It is also where the brigands collect tolls from travelers trying
        to reach Downfall. The brigands’ base is located on an enormous tree stump, 80 feet in diameter and 30 feet
        above the surface of the bog. Crisscrossing causeways of wooden planks converge on the stump, bringing travelers
        toward the brigands from all directions.</p>

        runs across the planks, roll a d8 at the end of the character’s turn. On a 7 or 8, part of the causeway falls
        away beneath the character, who must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling off the plank
        and into the bog. While <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f49d7ca3-422b-4ba1-94b2-efe384ef673a">As Agdon throws off his cloak, the sound of a
        bagpipe erupts from somewhere up ahead. After a few notes, the characters recognize it as the song sung by the
        harengon brigands they met earlier (see “<a href="#ArrivalinHither"
            data-content-chunk-id="7492fe50-6bf1-4c21-9a6b-c8b097e3d1ca">Arrival in Hither</a>”). Agdon sings the song
        as he takes off at a run, a wide grin on his rabbit face as he bounds from one plank to another in a circle
        around the party. He and his fellow harengons know the causeways well enough to avoid sections that are too weak
        to support their weight.</p>

        himself as he and his band of miscreants menaced travelers throughout various Feywild domains. It was in
        Prismeer, however, that Agdon’s antics came to an end by Zybilna’s hand. As punishment for his offenses, the
        archfey demanded that Agdon give up his beloved scarf. When he refused, Zybilna cursed him so that he would
        never be able to remove it. She then pinned the scarf to a young sapling with a magic nail made of gold and
        iron, and she bade the tree grow until its branches raked the clouds. Agdon was thus carried into the sky, where
        he was stranded for a long time.</p>

        <p>SWAMP GAS BALLOONS</p>
        <p>A swamp gas balloon has two separate parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The wicker basket, which can carry up to 750 pounds, is a Large object with AC 11, 27 hit points, and
                immunity to poison and psychic damage.</li>
            <li>The balloon, which contains the swamp gas that provides lift, is a Huge object with AC 11, 15 hit
                points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the balloon drops to 0 hit points, it bursts, and
                the vehicle loses the ability to fly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To rise into the air, the balloon must be filled with swamp gas. A flap at the bottom of the balloon lets the
            gas in, and the balloon takes 10 minutes to fill when empty. Once filled, the balloon rises into the air.
            One can force the balloon to land by using an action to open a flap at the top of the balloon, which allows
            the swamp gas to escape. To reach this flap, one must climb or fly to the top of the balloon, 20 feet above
            the basket. The balloon’s rigging makes such a climb possible.</p>
        <p>The vehicle has no form of propulsion, instead relying on the pilot’s ability to navigate air currents.</p>
        <p>As long as the balloon or basket has at least 1 hit point, it can be repaired. Repairing 1 hit point of
            damage to either part of the vehicle requires 1 day and the necessary supplies, which can be salvaged from

        the bridge, each one speaking of its own glorious rule and how the Soggy Court has become a mockery since its
        reign came to an end. In conversation, a head might share one or more of the following pieces of information:

            were deposed and killed by usurpers. Many of the former monarchs were betrayed by others whose rotting heads
            now also sit on spikes.</li>

            the scarecrow</a> (see the accompanying stat block), who is 3 feet tall. Created by Granny Nightshade using
        a tormented child’s soul she found in Gehenna, it ran away from home so that it wouldn’t have to perform evil
        tasks for her. After fleeing Thither, Clapperclaw was waylaid by Agdon Longscarf and his harengon brigands, who
        stole its head, which the scarecrow describes as a most glorious stag skull. It desperately wants its head back,
        and it’s a bit self-conscious about its replacement head: a hollow gourd that now sits askew on its shoulders.
        Eight copper coins are sealed inside the gourd, causing the head to rattle whenever Clapperclaw nods, turns, or
        shakes its head.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ab54ec66-3aa9-4c58-b558-f3f005b20c89">Clapperclaw knows the way to Thither from Hither and
        will guide the characters there if they help it recover its head. If the characters accept its offer, the
        scarecrow does its best to stay out of harm’s way while the characters continue to explore Hither. It fears
        Bavlorna Blightstraw too much to enter her cottage, but it will patiently wait for the characters outside the
        cottage if they choose to enter it. The scarecrow has a similar aversion to the other hags of the Hourglass
        Coven.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a1c13bef-6c2c-4aa4-bc5a-d616ff12ce09">When the characters arrive, Clapperclaw is telling
        the severed bullywug heads the story of how Agdon Longscarf stole its original head and how its current head is
        a poor substitute. Unknown to Clapperclaw, Agdon gave the skull to Bavlorna, who now keeps it in her cottage’s
        treasure room (<a href="#B19BavlornasHoard" data-content-chunk-id="c0d678e5-98e9-4018-a3f4-67c6a6081821">area

        <p>A grand marble gazebo stands atop a mound of soggy earth, its white stone streaked green with algae. The
            support pillars have sunk into the muck unevenly so that the domed canopy now sits askew.</p>
        <p>Short steps ring the gazebo, leading to a raised floor where bullywugs dressed in shabby clothing lounge on
            pillows. Among them, a harpist sends forth delicate notes that mingle with the murmured croaking of the
            gathered nobles. On a dais, a flabby bullywug wearing a crown of woven lily flowers sits on an ornate throne
            with his legs folded under him. He has a large leather-bound book open across his lap and is mouthing the
            words he reads on the pages. Without looking up, he says, “Have you no herald to announce your presence
            before King Gullop the Nineteenth?” He slams the book closed as if to punctuate his question, regarding you
            for the first time.</p>

        knights are stationed around the edge of the gazebo’s interior. Eight unarmed bullywugs (noncombatants) lounge
        at the king’s feet, eating insects from platters as they gossip among themselves. The king treats visitors as
        honored guests in accordance with the rule of hospitality (see “<a

        has only recently come into his position, but already his reign is a troubled one. Sir Talavar’s recent escape
        through the theft of one of Bavlorna’s prized balloons has left many of the king’s subjects questioning his
        ability to manage a crisis. He has grown paranoid over the prospect of incurring the hag’s wrath, a suspicion
        confirmed in the pages of the book in his lap—Bavlorna’s <em>Big Book of Bad Blood</em>—in which the hag’s
        displeasure with her enemies is spelled out in detail. He procured the book from a darkling merchant (see <a

        from Bavlorna a few hours ago.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="abd2f334-e62a-4201-adae-96d1d50f45cd">King Gullop is looking for a way to avoid Bavlorna’s
        ire, and the characters might be his way out. He wants them to return the book to Bavlorna and assure her that
        Gullop didn’t steal it, but merely ensured its safekeeping.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2290b7c8-1fa4-4933-b1a9-a309c2db8c71">If the characters portray themselves as allies

            data-content-chunk-id="b561c99b-ef9a-450e-9ef4-57d1af377992">area D4</a>), Gullop explains that only members
        of the Soggy Court are allowed to speak with Bavlorna (a falsehood he knows to be untrue), and he invites the
        characters to join the group. If they accept, he instructs them to proceed to the palace in area D11 to be
        fitted with the proper attire. Once they are appropriately garbed, Gullop gives the characters the <em>Big Book
            of Bad Blood</em> and encourages them, as duly appointed emissaries of the Soggy Court, to return it to the
        hag with great haste.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2c574047-a4c6-460b-b84f-2379cf703c0e">If the characters show hostility or refuse to join

        addresses the characters, one of the bullywug noncombatants passes a wine goblet to one randomly determined
        character. Inside the cup is a scrap of parchment with words written on it in Sylvan. The message reads, “Find
        Illig, the Baron of Muckstump, at once. The revolution lives!” Illig is an ambitious noble looking to take
        Gullop’s crown by force, and conspirators are gathering at his home in <a href="#D16BullywugHut"

        friendly bullywug of the Soggy Court about Illig’s whereabouts, roll a d8. On a roll of 1–3, the bullywug
        doesn’t know where Illig is. On a roll of 4–6, the bullywug assumes (incorrectly) that Illig is somewhere in the
        Sinking Palace (area D11). On a roll of 7 or 8, the bullywug knows and shares Illig’s actual location.</p>

        Heavily obscured by the fog are 2d6 bullywugs (noncombatants) spread out across several large lily pads and
        relaxing in rowboats. Some read to each other, and others nap or play music. When they see the characters, they
        wave in a friendly manner. If the characters ask for directions, one of the bullywugs tries to be helpful while
        the others gaze about listlessly. If the characters require any further assistance or information, the helpful
        bullywug suggests that they speak to King Gullop XIX and points the way to his Royal Majesty (area D6). Each
        lily pad can hold up to 250 pounds without sinking.</p>

            and her friend, Wigglewog, helped the honorable Sir Talavar escape. To delay their pursuers long enough for

        balloon can also deliver the characters safely to Thither if that’s where they want to go, as discussed at the
        end of this chapter.) She follows the party’s lead otherwise and tries her best to be helpful. Once she realizes
        the characters have important things to do, she tries not to embroil them in bullywug politics. In any

        horn is here, it is among the items available for purchase. If the characters seem interested in conducting a

        knows when one might come in handy. This one recently found its way into my possession.”</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c2fc6c8d-8b0c-46ae-a662-db1a7b8ba9fc"><strong><em>Payment.</em></strong> The darklings

    <ul data-content-chunk-id="481e7691-43f7-4ac8-9e59-02bf22f3f3e2">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="d068b9e4-3f00-4aed-a364-a86594f8bc8f">Trinket demands the color from the buyer’s
            eyes. If the buyer agrees to the trade, Trinket produces a small marble that drains the color from the
            buyer’s eyes when she utters the phrase, “Hue be mine.” Robbed of their color, the buyer’s irises turn
            transparent. Destroying the marble restores the buyer’s eye color to normal.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="4055add8-debe-43fe-9526-c691a020f16b">Bauble demands the rhythm in the buyer’s step.
            If the buyer agrees to the trade, Bauble produces an articulated wooden marionette and makes it dance on the
            countertop while repeatedly uttering, “One, two, three. One, two, three.” Deprived of this rhythm, the buyer
            loses all talent for dancing. Destroying the marionette restores the buyer’s dancing ability, but Bauble
            won’t give up the marionette without a fight.</li>

        who can fly it elsewhere. The balloon harnesses the energy of a rain cloud to stay aloft. To use the balloon,
        the harnessed cloud must be charged with electrical energy. This can be accomplished by dealing more than 20
        lightning damage to the cloud from a single source, or by surrounding it with electrically charged storm clouds
        for at least 10 minutes. Once charged, the balloon can stay airborne for 8 hours, moving at up to 8 miles per
        hour. If the balloon loses its charge while aloft, it plummets to the ground.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1b92e166-3892-4132-b548-0f8348920ccb">The vessel has two separate parts: the wooden basket
        that doubles as the merchant’s stall, and the balloon, which includes the rain cloud plus the net and lines that
        hold it in place and attach it to the basket. Each part has its own statistics:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0835386e-9d66-4589-b326-d84f231ba654"><strong>Basket.</strong> The basket, which can hold
        up to 750 pounds, has AC 13, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bd1a28ea-dd77-4145-8c6d-964791007d1a"><strong>Balloon.</strong> The balloon has AC 11, 50
        hit points, and immunity to lightning, poison, psychic, and thunder damage. If the balloon drops to 0 hit
        points, the cloud dissipates, and the vehicle loses the ability to fly.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e55a8401-7eb5-44ed-95f2-eb59c257eafe">Repairing 1 hit point of damage to the basket
        requires 1 day and appropriate supplies, which can be salvaged from <a href="#D4BurnedoutBalloonFactory"

        <p>Two creatures are having a conversation over tea in the middle of this room. The first figure is seated in a
            timeworn armchair. She is a tall, lean woman of gray complexion, dressed in black with a wide-brimmed hat
            obscuring her eyes. The other figure is a toad-like creature with bulging eyes and cracked skin. It is clad
            in a shapeless garment and sits on one end of a love seat with its legs pulled up beneath it. Flies flit
            into and out of its mouth, which hangs agape when it isn’t speaking. Two tiny versions of the creature cling
            to it like pets.</p>
        <p>The room is filthy. Dirty dishes and bits of discarded food lie everywhere. The furniture was perhaps once of
            fine quality, but now stains of mysterious origin mottle every surface, and the upholstery has been patched
            numerous times. Set with its back to the wall in one corner is a hulking wooden cabinet. Sturdy legs support
            the bottom of the cabinet six inches above the floor. A decrepit wooden staircase climbs up the wall in

        Before she’ll agree to help the characters in any way, Bavlorna demands that they complete the following three
        chores:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4b3d953a-48b3-4b3a-a5e9-73b4cadae2ad"><strong>Fix the Preservation Pool.</strong>
        Bavlorna’s preservation pool (see <a href="#B1PreservationPool"
            data-content-chunk-id="b26ffa54-289a-429e-b0da-787685eff2ac">area B1</a>) won’t fill with water. It seems
        the well that supplies it is plugged. Bavlorna wants the characters to fix the problem. (If the characters have
        already defeated the creature that was plugging the well, she considers this chore complete.)</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1ea4f5b0-3126-4ae6-b0e0-c2f504a9abd0"><strong>Find the Missing Book.</strong> Bavlorna’s
        <em>Big Book of Bad Blood</em> has gone missing. It contains copious notes on everyone who has wronged her. She
        assumes the book hasn’t been taken far and wants the characters to search Downfall for it. (The book is
        currently in the hands of Gullop XIX, the bullywug king in <a href="#D6HisRoyalMajestyGullopXIX"
            data-content-chunk-id="eb62bfdd-72f5-4990-8806-0ad6e2b71105">area D6</a>. If the characters have already
        dealt with Gullop and are returning the book to Bavlorna, she considers this chore complete.)</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6a153302-d5e2-4488-953a-88e0dc93318e"><strong>Pick Up a Package.</strong> Bavlorna fancies
        herself an expert in taxidermy, and a bullywug hunter has filled a crate with animal carcasses for Bavlorna to
        stuff. The crate can be found in one of the bullywug dwellings (<a href="#D16BullywugHut"
            data-content-chunk-id="c1d873e7-123a-4956-8dec-572537a193f6">area D16</a>), and Bavlorna wants it brought to
        her.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d96712d3-222e-4e20-9eeb-797c3fa516d2">When all three chores are complete, Bavlorna insists
        on taking a short rest in her preservation pool to moisten her skin. Only then will she consider bargaining with
        the characters.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ee427b0a-3753-4ba2-a445-b71c329d655a">While the characters are busy performing one or more
        of Bavlorna’s unfinished chores, the darkling elder and her elusive shadow find what they were after and return
        to their balloon (<a href="#D10TrinketBaubleandCharms"
            data-content-chunk-id="62e7dd91-48eb-4e83-b0d7-a1fcdb785515">area D10</a>). The darklings then unmoor their
        balloon and drift away toward Yon. If the darklings escape, the characters might encounter them again in <a

        one or more things in her possession that the characters desire, she agrees to give up these items on one
        condition: she wants the characters to steal a portrait of her older sister, Skabatha, and deliver it to
        Bavlorna’s cottage within eight days. Bavlorna provides three pieces of information before spitting into her
        hand and requiring the characters to shake it, thus sealing the bargain:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="05db2586-5535-42ba-8103-8243eb4457df">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="996155d1-26e0-4922-b8ab-8c712e0063a7">Loomlurch is a giant, hollowed-out tree located
            deep in the forest of Thither. Skabatha uses it as a lair.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="0e89bf80-ccb5-4cf4-aed2-ed4e01863214">Skabatha’s portrait is displayed in a circular
            room in the heart of Loomlurch, alongside portraits of her three sisters: Bavlorna, Endelyn, and Tasha.
            (Bavlorna won’t add anything about Tasha if the characters press for more information about her.)</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="da2defb0-ead1-44a0-9d43-fc7efc2e1b37">To reach Thither, the characters need a guide.
            There’s a scarecrow in Downfall who knows the way (she can’t remember the scarecrow’s name).</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="16da071c-1919-4db6-a634-e80a929c5553">If Skabatha’s portrait is brought to Bavlorna on
        time, the hag fulfills her end of the bargain. If the characters fail to deliver Skabatha’s portrait within the
        agreed-upon time, each character who agreed to the bargain must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or be
        cursed. While cursed in this way, the character loses one cherished possession (chosen by you). This possession
        disappears and is not regained until the curse ends. Bavlorna can end the curse on a character (no action
        required), as can any spell that ends a curse.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ec13cf0d-0d99-45f1-8422-855a1f4ff523">If the characters were drawn to Prismeer by the
        “Warlock’s Quest” adventure hook, they can strike a different bargain with Bavlorna, but she won’t deal with
        anyone who claims to be searching for a way to help Zybilna and thereby weaken the Hourglass Coven. First and
        foremost, Bavlorna wants Skabatha’s portrait (with the same time restrictions as the “Lost Things” bargain
        above) and is willing to trade for it. Once she has the portrait, her greed might focus on something else in
        Skabatha’s possession, at your discretion.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a08c9cd3-6d84-4205-a68e-4ccad584620f">If Bavlorna feels threatened, or if a fight turns
        against her, she flees to Thither on her <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6107fa99-97a9-426e-949a-8d60346df124">If she has no option but to fight, Bavlorna doesn’t
        hesitate to swallow one of the characters. If she is later forced to regurgitate the character, she also expels
        a small iron key. The key unlocks the potion cabinet in this room.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="596011a9-32d4-4472-a5a0-39b3561d4d58"><strong><em>Potion Cabinet.</em></strong> The
        cabinet in the corner is made of wood that is still covered with bark and patches of moss. There’s a lock in the
        middle of the right panel, but it’s obscured beneath hanging moss. (Bavlorna swallowed the key for safekeeping
        but can regurgitate it as needed.) A character can use an action and thieves’ tools to try to pick the lock,
        doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.</p>

            impenetrable darkness. A weak croaking sound calls your attention to a tiny, shriveled figure lying on the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3f269f1a-a0bb-4d38-a959-dcb3fc9a7be9">The tiny figure is one of Bavlorna’s lornlings. It

        it. It then moves onto the balcony in that area and jumps in the lake, where it waits to rejoin the darkling
        elder. The shadow doesn’t attack, and it drops the spool of thread if it can’t escape with it. The spool, unlike
        the shadow, is too wide to fit under the door.</p>

        perceived by the beholder (meaning that each creature sees the thread’s color as the hue it associates most with
        such emotions), and it confers these feelings on anyone who wears garments sewn with it. Even touching the
        thread evokes these negative emotions.</p>

            rests on a wooden table. The jar has legs that have been painted to look like the legs of a chicken. Inside
            the jar are two broken pieces of a wishbone. If the characters touch the two pieces together, they hear
            Bavlorna’s voice in their heads say, “Skabatha forgets the first creature she sees when she wakes up,

        Magical darkness fills the inside of this statue’s gaping mouth, allowing no light to enter. The mouth leads to
        an extradimensional space. If a character reaches into the statue’s mouth, read the following boxed text,
        addressing that character’s player:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">

        statue’s mouth, a character must say the name of what they desire. If the desired thing is in the
        extradimensional space, it materializes in the character’s hand. If you’re using the “Lost Things” adventure
        hook and Bavlorna has turned one or more of the characters’ long-lost possessions into magic items, these items
        can be retrieved from the statue’s extradimensional space.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9d89af6a-75bf-45c7-a49a-a085396a7388">The bronze frog statue weighs 750 pounds and is a

                Crossing.</em></strong> To use an uncorrupted fairy ring as a fey crossing, a creature must hold a wand
        or a stick of wood above its head and run in a circle counterclockwise while saying, “Three turns widdershins,
        and off we go!” If the creature performing this act is a Fey or has fey ancestry, its effort transports all
        creatures inside the fairy ring to a remote location on a Material Plane world of your choice. They might arrive
        inside a similar fairy ring that is hidden in an elven tomb or inside the tumbled-down ruin of an ancient tower,
        for example. If the creature holding the wand and running widdershins is neither a Fey nor of fey ancestry, the
        fey crossing activates only if exactly eight creatures are inside the ring.</p>

        poster per character can be redeemed. Granny Nightshade is not obligated to give a reward to any character who
        doesn’t hand her a poster. She must accept a poster that is handed to her; when she does, the poster vanishes in
        a puff of smoke, and the hag must offer the promised reward to the character immediately. In most cases, the
        reward is a creature or object that is magically delivered into Granny Nightshade’s custody when the poster
        vanishes. (Exceptions are noted in the Rewards column of the Wanted Posters table.) Whether the character

        the characters refuse to do so, the redcaps scream in fury and swear profusely before stomping away. Without
        their sickles, these redcaps are all bluster. If their weapons are returned to them, the redcaps attack the

        to determine each item. (All the items listed in the table are uncommon magic items.) If a character asks Nib to
        make something specific, Nib honors that request, provided the desired item is a nonmagical item worth no more
        than 1,000 gp, or a magic item of common or uncommon rarity. Nib can make only one gift for each character, and
        his spinning wheel can’t work its magic under any other hand. Nib’s supply of gold coins decreases by an amount
        equal to the value of the item he creates (minimum 1 gp). A common magic item reduces his supply by 100 gp,

            Pool, but the magic protecting the pool can’t tell the difference between a real unicorn and a make-believe
            one. To reach the lake themselves, the kids created a crude unicorn costume under which they can hide. (They
            keep the costume in their treehouse and can lend it to the characters, although it’s big enough to hold only
            two adults.)</li>

            another corner is a crude unicorn costume made of polka-dot quilts and a wooden horse’s head that has a

        head is mounted on a stick that the person in the lead holds up, and the children have glued a wooden horn to

    <p data-content-chunk-id="00f04ac5-7121-4599-8a91-222df5d3b1f2">Will of the Feywild has conceived a daring plan to
        free the children still being held prisoner in Loomlurch, which he shares with the characters if they decide to
        aid him. Using a stick, Will sketches a rough map of the lair in the dirt and outlines the plan as follows:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a605dceb-6876-4e64-848d-4b32f41f9973"><strong>The Approach.</strong> Bobi, Sloane, Zennor,

    <p data-content-chunk-id="48819fb9-5193-4cf2-a9cc-d5bb691bf579"><strong>The Distraction.</strong> The characters

        sweets, and arrange for a meeting with the hag. During the meeting, the children will alert the screaming
        scarecrows and thereby lure the tin soldiers into the garden.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="45218910-b5b6-4d2d-8c80-85d160adcf0a"><strong>The Escape.</strong> While everyone is
        distracted, the characters will free the captives from the workshop (<a

        the children are set free, everyone will run back to Little Oak.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="06186c2e-30b1-421e-99dc-ff78c0e09dc3">Will’s plan is sketchy, but he likes to live by the
        seat of his pants. Regardless of how events unfold, he never reveals his true form, fearing it would terrify the
        children he’s trying to rescue or frighten away the other members of the Getaway Gang. Consequently, he refrains
        from using his oni abilities in the presence of the children or the characters.</p>

        pool’s shoreline find that any path they take through the forest leads them back to where they started, and
        flying creatures find themselves unintentionally veering off course. This glamor is the work of a unicorn named
        Lamorna, who has claimed Wayward Pool as her domain. To reach the shore, one must be a unicorn or adopt the
        guise of one. The Getaway Gang has a unicorn costume that can accommodate two characters; other characters can
        satisfy the pool’s protective ward by attaching fake unicorn horns to their heads. False horns can easily be
        hewn from wood or created using a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2252-silent-image"

        mutters as Lamorna teleports away), but he’s smart enough not to antagonize the characters any more than he

        open at the back as a normal dollhouse would be. A Tiny creature can enter the dollhouse through its front door
        or one of its windows and explore its interior, which has a gloomy foyer, parlor, kitchen, and dining room on
        the ground floor; two bedrooms, a sewing room, and a nonfunctional bath on the second floor; and a spooky,
        spacious attic. If you used the “Lost Things” adventure hook and Granny Nightshade stole from the characters,
        any items that their lost things were transformed into are kept inside the dollhouse’s attic, along with the
        items listed in the “Treasure” section below.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="36beeb77-a70d-42d3-9669-61b7d6f4c823">Characters who inspect the outside of the dollhouse

            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2162-tooltip">knock</a> spell or similar magic opens it, granting access to the
        attic and its contents. Granny Nightshade also set a password (“rumpleclump”) that, when spoken within 5 feet of
        the dollhouse, suppresses the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2003-arcane-lock"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2003-tooltip">arcane lock</a> spell for 1 minute. Cradlefall and Pincushion know
        the password but won’t divulge it unless their very existence is threatened. Mishka (see <a

        spells or attacks that originate outside the dollhouse, and the dollhouse is enchanted to be immune to all
        damage. If it is knocked over, each creature inside the dollhouse must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
        or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage from colliding with walls, furniture, and junk.</p>

        Nightshade keeps these moths to ameliorate the effect of her curse: after she wakes each morning, she forgets
        all about the first creature she sees. This means that Granny Nightshade doesn’t think about the creature,
        doesn’t see it in front of her, and instantly forgets anything it says. The effect lasts until she finishes her
        next long rest or until she takes damage from the creature, at which point she remembers everything. So, to
        lessen the risk to herself, Granny Nightshade placed the jar of moths where it would be the first thing she sees
        when she emerges from her dollhouse each morning.</p>

            performed for her and the three things she’s willing to accept as the result of any bargain made with the

        Mudlump stumbles upon the characters while he is searching for Pollenella, his lost queen bee. Mudlump wears a
        hooded veil to protect his eye from bee stings and carries a large beehive on a stick, which doubles as a
        greatclub. Three times per day, as an action, Mudlump can shake his beehive to bring forth a swarm of bees;
        treat each one as a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/301415-swarm-of-insects-wasps"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/301415-tooltip">swarm of insects (wasps)</a>. The swarm attacks Mudlump’s

    <p data-content-chunk-id="13673d72-1e4b-47dc-9cfa-6482c82def29">If Amidor is with the party, the dandelion
        unsheathes its rapier to defend his beloved honeybee. Upon seeing Amidor, the cyclops roars in Giant, “You stole
        queen bee! Mudlump needs queen to make honey mead! Best mead in Yon!” Amidor doesn’t speak Giant and has no idea
        what the cyclops is saying, but Mudlump’s outrage comes through loud and clear.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f6228318-3252-457d-b6f3-fbd58ae7aeeb">Mudlump speaks no language other than Giant. Any

        party. Here are three options for settling the dispute, though clever players can come up with others:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b437e870-f9f3-4172-a9ca-2a0c683c856f"><strong>Honorable Duel.</strong> The characters
        convince Mudlump to participate in an honorable duel against one of their own. If Mudlump wins, he gets
        Pollenella; if he loses, he lets Amidor keep Pollenella and doesn’t trouble the party again.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c675ab76-3d53-4402-a451-030b9a06036b"><strong>Magical Deception.</strong> The characters
        use magic to fool or placate Mudlump. For example, a character might create an illusion of Pollenella that fools
        the cyclops long enough for the party to escape. Alternatively, a character might use a <a
            class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2258-speak-with-animals"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2258-tooltip">speak with animals</a> spell to find out what Pollenella wants. The
        bee would rather stay with Amidor than return to the cyclops; if Mudlump sees the spell being cast and learns of
        Pollenella’s preference, he lets Amidor keep the bee.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="878a9661-f161-4af8-9917-e67adb50f4a4"><strong>Explain Love to Mudlump.</strong> The
        characters tell Mudlump that Amidor and Pollenella are in love. This statement causes the cyclops to blink in
        confusion and ask, “What is love?” If the concept is explained to him, Mudlump declares that he’d like to be in
        love, too, and gives the characters a quest to find his true love. Although the characters can try to pair
        Mudlump up with any creature they deem suitable, his ideal match can be found in the Palace of Heart’s Desire:
        the fomorian Dubhforgail (see <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3ed3b97c-283a-4a02-a63a-992539e21b6a"><strong><em>Mudlump’s Home.</em></strong> If Mudlump
        survives this encounter, he returns to his home in the tumbledown, moss-covered ruins of a 30-foot-diameter
        stone tower that once protruded from a mountainside. There, in a small garden, the cyclops has cultivated three
        fat, 6-foot-tall mushrooms. These fungi have been hollowed out and turned into casks, their caps serving as
        lids. These casks are used to ferment a mixture of water and honey, which Mudlump combines with other
        ingredients to make honey mead. A great beehive—considerably larger than the one Mudlump carries around—fills an
        ancient, rotted-out tree stump on one side of the tower. The stump is 10 feet tall, twice as wide, and has
        openings at the top through which Mudlump can reach into the hive. A 6-foot-high, 3-foot-wide, naturally formed
        opening on one side of the stump leads to a cavity filled with honeycombs and swarming with bees. (Amidor used
        this opening to enter the hive and rescue Pollenella.)</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4a2b7c33-e93a-4496-a321-bb225d84b6a2">Feenia, an unhappy goblin child (neutral) in
        overalls, flies a kite on a blustery plateau. The kite is alive, has a hideous face stretched over its
        diamond-shaped frame, and cackles in the wind. The kite’s 40-foot-long string has five blue bows tied along its
        length at 8-foot intervals, starting about 5 feet from Feenia’s end of the string and ending 5 feet away from
        the kite.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="79b1c095-5085-4ede-a79a-76126907938d">Feenia’s goblin parents, Specklenose and Zolt, live
        and work in Motherhorn. Three days ago, Feenia was caught stealing theater props, but Endelyn Moongrave promised
        not to punish her as long as Feenia agreed to fly the hag’s kite. Feenia did so and is now unable to let go of
        the cursed thing. Yanking the string from Feenia’s grasp releases the goblin child from the pact but also ages
        her 10 years for every bow that is attached to the kite. The most she can age is 50 years—enough to transform
        her into a crone with skin like a shriveled apple.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="963affeb-f42a-4740-b41f-f32eaea1e7db">Feenia speaks Common and Goblin. If the characters
        approach her, she shares the following information while the kite taunts her from above:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>“My arms are so very sore, I don’t want to fly this kite anymore! But if I let go of this string, Creeping
            Lyn says I’ll become an old thing! The curse comes from those five blue bows, but they won’t come off while
            the wind blows.”</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a3b59e8-99a2-4533-b377-50e50becf9e0">The kite, which was created and brought to life by

            href="/spells/1997-animate-objects" data-tooltip-href="/spells/1997-tooltip">animate objects</a> spell for
        its statistics). The bows can’t be removed from the string while the kite is in the air, and the string can’t be
        cut. The kite, its string, and the bows turn to ashes if the kite is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="94a705c0-ed87-4310-a426-3a961b426a68">The safest way to free Feenia from the kite without
        aging her is to untie the bows, which can be accomplished only while the kite is on the ground (see “The Kite
        Falls” below). Once the kite falls to the ground, it takes an action to untie each bow. Another way to free
        Feenia is to reduce the kite to 0 hit points with a single attack or effect before it can react (see “The Kite
        Reacts” below).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ddce0510-771b-4e27-b26d-a881507d66eb"><strong><em>The Kite Falls.</em></strong> A

        correlation between Feenia’s foul mood and the strength of the wind around her. If the kite’s taunts are muted
        for at least 1 minute using a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2251-silence"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2251-tooltip">silence</a> spell or similar magic, Feenia’s mood improves, causing
        the wind to abate and the kite to fall. The same thing happens if a character uses an action to try to calm
        Feenia, doing so with a successful DC 15 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e9410a6b-9e28-48c7-bc9d-fc90a3ab811d">A wooden pageant wagon trundles toward the party on
        squeaky wheels. It moves by itself at a speed of 20 feet and is accompanied by a tall figure swathed in long
        robes and a cowl. The wagon is painted with stormy, windswept landscapes and carries a puppet theater with black
        velvet curtains drawn across it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d3ab0fbb-8d2d-4a9a-9e71-a52b7f4ce390">The wagon stops near the characters, and the
        curtains pull back to reveal a painted backdrop that matches the environment in which the characters stand.
        Marionettes representing each of the characters dance on the stage and begin to reenact a recent scene from the
        party’s time in Yon.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c1c2b54d-293a-482f-8ac2-6cdfe950e9f6">The marionettes, the wagon, and its attendant are
        magically animated. If the characters touch the hooded figure, it collapses into a pile of robes. If they try to
        board the wagon, it falls apart into a heap of wood scraps as thunder booms and lightning flashes overhead.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="23718cad-e882-4e5e-a7de-e09916911e5e">The play is 3 minutes long and ends with a scene
        that shows the characters standing around a tiny replica of the pageant wagon. A banner emblazoned with the
        words “To be continued!” unfurls in front of the scene, and then the curtains close. From the folds of its
        robes, the hooded figure presents a document to each character. Each one looks like a ticket with a tiny puppet
        resembling the character painted on it. Written under this effigy in script that the recipient understands
        (regardless of what languages it knows) are these words: “Good for one private audience with Endelyn
        Moongrave—no strings attached!” After the invitations are handed out, the wagon and its attendant disappear
        abruptly.</p>

        toward the characters. Everyone in the party (characters and nonplayer characters) must make a DC 17 Strength
        saving throw. If at least half of the party members succeed on the saving throw, none of them are swept away by
        the tornado.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="31432d12-b5a4-42f9-a8ed-ffcce012972f">If less than half of them succeed on the saving

        throw failed by 5 or more loses one nonmagical item in transit (determined by you). The item should be something
        that could reasonably be snatched away by the wind, such as a belt pouch or a helmet. This item is not
        recoverable.</p>

            trudges up the stairs on the column nearest to the rowboat. Eight winged beasts with antlers shout and howl

        dragon threatening the prosperity of his kingdom, Alagarthas caught the eye of Endelyn Moongrave, who visited
        him on his home world of Toril. The hag showed the prince a future in which he defeated the dragon but lost his
        life in the process. Endelyn also claimed to see an alternate future in which the dragon was defeated and
        Alagarthas survived; she would share the details of her vision with Alagarthas, however, only after he stayed
        with her in the Feywild for at least one year.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d1e45e36-5032-4ed2-9ff0-6a2064195df8">The prince saw a year of his life as a small price
        to pay, so he accepted the hag’s terms. The year seemed to drag on and on, and when it finally ended, Alagarthas
        found himself with only one way to get home: a path that, according to Endelyn, is visible “only in the light of
        the eight beacons.” The simple goal of lighting the beacons has been repeatedly thwarted by the perytons, who
        revel in Alagarthas’s despair. Each time he lights a beacon, the perytons snuff it out, yet Alagarthas is too
        stubborn and determined to give up. He hopes the perytons will grow bored of their antics and leave him alone
        eventually. He is, however, misguided in that expectation.</p>

            called the Greyhawk Mummers. Endelyn invited them to Motherhorn, where they performed pantomimes.
            (Alagarthas attended several of these performances.) When their popularity made them haughty and difficult
            to control, Endelyn locked them up. When they begged to be set free, the hag honored their request by
            releasing them into the wild—but only after she turned them into perytons. The transformation deprived them

        pantomimists known as the Greyhawk Mummers—so named because they got their start performing in the Free City of
        Greyhawk on the world of Oerth. The perytons remember their former lives as actors, and though they understand
        Common and Elvish, they can no longer speak.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5a0dd65b-9b01-45c7-ac73-9590e8c95411">Archillus and Mortia are the leading male and
        leading female of the troupe. The others are Verna (Mortia’s bitter understudy), Mauldower (an old-timer who
        believes his cohorts are amateurs), Angara (the troupe’s matriarchal dame), Gorgenal (a jester), Carthasar (a
        method actor), and Thornelia (a minstrel).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3be0c8f7-75cb-49bd-9fa2-36031ca384f7">The characters can help Alagarthas without resorting
        to violence by asking the perytons to perform one of their favorite pantomimes. The perytons are taken aback, in
        a good way, by the request and appreciate the opportunity to entertain a crowd. They perform a pantomime show
        that lasts nearly an hour, then take their bows silently. If everyone in the party claps or cheers, the perytons
        are thrilled and fly off. If one or more party members fail to clap or cheer after the perytons perform, the
        perytons become furious and attack the party. Once the perytons are placated or slain, Alagarthas can light the
        beacons without further interference.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e0f3b2b7-e1d6-4d8a-a482-5c23bbde1d72">The characters can also impress the perytons by

        for only then will they show him the way home. The characters are free to stay and watch as he climbs to the top
        of each rocky column and lights its beacon. It takes 8 hours for him to light all eight beacons—enough time for

        malignant wish stones (the ones born out of evil wishes). Molliver and their brigganock companions lead the

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>The route ends at a gaping chasm, on the far side of which is a grotto full of stalactites and stalagmites. A

        without provocation. They become indifferent toward any creature that walks or runs across the bridge and makes
        it past the midpoint (regardless of the direction it is traveling). Weaugh, Teaugh, and Peaugh congratulate the

        bottom is strewn with hundreds of malignant wish stones that give off purple light. These wish stones are
        unrefined lumps of crystal that shed bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet; any
        good-aligned creature that has one or more of them in its possession feels mildly nauseated, although this
        nausea has no game effect. Hags, liches, and other evil spellcasters can find macabre uses for these malignant

        8-foot-high, 3-foot-wide tunnel in the back wall of Obud’s grotto. This secret tunnel leads to a storage room
        (<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/twbtw/motherhorn#M12PartsStorage"
            data-content-chunk-id="fef74fcf-0bcd-493a-a892-4394c42a22ab">area M12</a>) beneath Motherhorn’s stage. The
        illusory wall has no substance, which means that creatures and objects can pass right through it. A successful
        casting of <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2072-dispel-magic"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2072-tooltip">dispel magic</a> (DC 19) causes the illusory wall to disappear.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a63a97b4-7ed7-44bf-b4a3-e6cdcdf7efa9">Obud informs the characters that Creeping Lyn is
        unaware of this tunnel’s existence (“Let’s keep it that way, aye?” he adds). The characters can return to the
        grotto through the tunnel whenever they want, provided they are on good terms with the brigganocks. If the
        characters use the tunnel without Obud’s consent, brigganock miners spend the next 8 hours collapsing the tunnel
        on itself, preventing the characters from returning to the mine by that route.</p>

        have crystallized in the depths of Yon and were mined by the brigganocks. As the characters are preparing to
        leave the mine, a cheerful brigganock named Ajak arrives with a wheelbarrow containing the characters’ wish
        stones. These stones look like round lumps of crystal and have not yet been shaped or cut. If a character’s wish
        was good-natured, its stone glows with golden light (bright light out to a range of 20 feet and dim light for an
        additional 20 feet). If the wish was evil-natured, its stone glows with purple light (bright light in a 5-foot
        radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c83d775d-814a-4023-afff-4a079bbc21cf">Characters whose wishes were good-hearted can keep
        their stones as mementos or leave the stones with the brigganocks to be cut into sparkling gemstones—a process
        that takes 8 hours with the help of the brigganocks’ Time Lapse action. (The characters can return to the mine
        to collect their gems after attending to other matters.) A fairly common wish produces a 50 gp gemstone, an
        unusual wish produces a 100 gp gemstone, and an exceptionally original wish produces a 500 gp gemstone (as
        determined by you). Once a wish stone is cut into a gem, it loses its magic and ceases to glow.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="25f57acd-f950-4696-9304-2d41feab67a7">The brigganocks don’t make gemstones out of
        malignant wish stones. Instead, they toss these purple-glowing stones into Rivenwish Chasm unless the characters
        who created them want to take the stones with them. Mild nausea plagues any good-aligned creature that has one
        or more of these stones in its possession, though this nausea has no game effect.</p>

            darkly humorous. I have just the play!” A rolled-up script suddenly appears in his hand. “Normally we would
            have several hours to prepare, but alas, time is of the essence. Since you don’t have time to memorize all
            the lines, we’ll need to improvise.” Tossing the script over one shoulder, he says, “Worry not! I’ll feed

        Stagefright lets them decide which one of them takes that role before suggesting another role for the other
        character (choose a table entry that hasn’t already been assigned). Allow characters to invent new roles for
        themselves if they don’t like the ones they’re assigned. If a character wants to play a talking pumpkin or a

        12-foot-high, stone double door with fancy scrollwork along its edges but no visible handles, hinges, or seams.
        If someone touches the door, read:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>The surface of the door assumes the likeness of a skull-faced hag. “The moon-twin is not welcome here,” it
            says in a raspy voice. “All others may step forward and pass through the black curtain at the end of the
            entrance hall.”</p>
        <p>The visage splits down the middle as the double door swings open, revealing a decorated hallway in which

        balcony, and it waits expectantly for creatures to pass through the open doorway. When no authorized creatures
        are left on the balcony in front of it, the door closes until its outer surface is touched again. Creatures that
        want to leave Motherhorn by this route need only touch the inside of the double door, which causes it to swing
        open; it remains open until 10 seconds pass without a creature passing through it. The door can’t be opened
        otherwise—not by using magic, thieves’ tools, or brute force.</p>

        tries to enter without having a convincing disguise, an invisible force pushes her back onto the balcony. Any
        disguise of a magical nature is sufficient to fool the door. A conventional disguise works as well, provided
        whoever created the disguise fools the door by succeeding on DC 12 Charisma (<a

        waits outside for the characters and urges them to find her sister as quickly as possible. Amidor, Pollenella,
        and any other guides accompanying the party stay with Gleam, keeping her company while she waits.</p>

        <p>An open-air amphitheater is carved from the slope of the mountaintop. Short, cloaked figures sit on tiered

            the stormy sky. A team of masked goblins is preparing the stage for a play while costumed actors huddle in
            the wings and recite lines. Lighting is provided by an intricate overhead contraption upon which several

        below). He is dressed to portray the green dragon in the tragedy titled <em>A Village No More</em>, but he has
        given up trying to remember his lines.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f5290993-4b51-4de7-a666-aa8d1f6a602a">Hurly used to work at the Witchlight Carnival, but
        his short temper and blustery nature made him unpopular. One of Endelyn’s spies lured him to Motherhorn, where
        the hag promised to make Hurly more likable before sending him back to the carnival—but only after he agreed to
        relinquish his shadow and work in Endelyn’s theater for three years. Hurly recently learned from another actor
        that three years in the Feywild doesn’t necessarily equate to three years where he came from, so he’s no longer
        certain how long Endelyn expects him to remain at the theater. The hag assures Hurly that his talent is becoming
        more refined and respected with every performance—but the magic mirrors in this room tell him a different story.
        It’s clear to Hurly that his dreadful performances are not endearing him to anyone, Endelyn most of all.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0bae8732-a6f1-4d40-b86c-40ca226576af">Hurly expects to be demoted to stagehand and wishes
        he had never left the Witchlight Carnival. His failure to win over audiences is due in part to his missing
        shadow, as explained in the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/twbtw/yon#Shadowless"

        feels about that creature:</p>

        from its shards, filling the room. Each creature in the room must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking
        22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The gas doesn’t spread

            data-content-chunk-id="fb105152-0e1b-49cf-ada6-b29cf6884fd0">area M14</a>. These accounts are written by
        Endelyn herself as rhymes in the Elvish script. Throughout these records, Endelyn acknowledges that not every
        future she glimpses comes to pass, for any possible future can be negated by another. The black books are
        arranged on the shelves in the order in which Endelyn has written them. No book mentions the characters or
        anyone closely associated with them; most of the accounts speak of individuals who are long dead, many of them
        victims of tragedies of their own making. Endelyn foreshadows her own doom quite often, noting that it will
        occur during an eclipse.</p>

        knows that her sister, Skabatha, is cursed to forget the first creature she sees when she wakes each morning. In
        the event of Endelyn’s death, she wants this secret to be known, so Endelyn wrote it on a scrap of invisible
        paper and placed it atop the highest shelf in the library. The paper becomes visible and blows off the shelf if
        Endelyn dies, which can happen only during an eclipse. If the characters enter this room after Endelyn has died,
        the paper is lying on the floor in plain view. Written in the Elvish script, it reads:</p>

        <p>The walls of this room are adorned with wooden masks, most of which look like shocked goblin faces. Dozens of
            masks hang neatly from hooks on the walls, and several more are stowed haphazardly on the shelves of an old
            bookcase.</p>
        <p>Two padlocked cages stand in a far corner; one is occupied by a panic-stricken goblin, and the other is
            empty.</p>
        <p>In the middle of the room, two copper poles ten feet apart descend from the eight-foot ceiling. Each pole has
            a one-foot-diameter copper sphere at the end of it, three feet off the floor. Between the poles, a
            struggling goblin is shackled to a thin, tall chair, so that the spheres are level with the goblin’s head.
        </p>
        <p>A tall, thin, cloaked figure stands in the shadows. A rictus grin forms beneath the cowl as the figure pulls
            a lever that juts from a wall. An instant later, golden lightning leaps between the spheres, catching the
            shackled goblin in its path. Before you can react, the goblin transforms into a wooden mask that falls to
            the floor. “Binky!” shrieks the caged goblin.</p>

        this room to punish those who irritate her. The device has 3 charges and regains all expended charges after 8
        hours. Pulling the lever expends 1 charge and causes a line of golden lightning, 10 feet long and 5 feet wide,
        to flash between the two copper spheres. Any creature in this line must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw
        or be magically transformed into an inanimate wooden mask, along with whatever it is wearing or carrying. The
        mask bears a striking resemblance to the creature’s visage, and the transformation lasts until the mask is

    <p data-content-chunk-id="92b5b1ab-b9f6-41c8-96f0-74447ff06016"><strong><em>Contraption.</em></strong> The Orrery of
        Tragedies is 20 feet tall and 60 feet in diameter. It uses magic and mathematics to produce its
        prognostications, and it can sift through possible futures to identify the most likely ones. As the contraption
        turns, it emits smoke in the form of letters that spell out predictions, which Endelyn transcribes in a black
        book like the ones shelved in the oracular library (<a href="#M7OracularLibrary"
            data-content-chunk-id="b07a5c89-3114-45bf-99f7-8b6664c43933">area M7</a>). The orrery magically predicts the
        future of creatures whose paths are destined to become entwined with the Hourglass Coven and who are doomed to
        meet a tragic end. It serves no other purpose.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cc032ff6-9801-46bf-86e6-5483c64a6943">The device is powered by electricity transmitted
        through its central element: an 80-foot-tall lightning rod that forms its vertical axis. A creature that touches
        any part of the lightning rod, enters the contraption’s space for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn
        in the contraption’s space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) lightning damage on a
        failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in metal armor makes the saving throw with
        disadvantage.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a0dfd4b8-ef14-49a6-b5bb-b4e8ae380808">The Orrery of Tragedies isn’t one object, but dozens
        of smaller objects joined together. To destroy the whole thing, at least eight of its components (not including
        the lightning rod) must be reduced to 0 hit points. Each component is a Large object with AC 19, 27 hit points,
        and immunity to lightning, poison, and psychic damage.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="57b38d15-1bfc-41a3-897a-91ad3141b3b2">The central lightning rod is eight 10-foot-long
        lightning rods attached end to end. Each smaller rod weighs 100 pounds and has AC 17, 25 hit points, and
        immunity to lightning, poison, and psychic damage. Reducing one of these rods to 0 hit points destroys it and
        causes the rods above it to fall, making the lowest rod the most obvious target. If three or more of these rods
        fall or are destroyed, the assembly is no longer tall enough to conduct lightning; the contraption shuts down
        after 1 minute and remains powerless until the lightning rod assembly is rebuilt.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3d007d30-dd3e-4eda-b0c8-12468bcc70cd">Contact with an antimagic field shuts down the

            href="/spells/2072-dispel-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2072-tooltip">dispel magic</a> spell (DC 19)
        causes the contraption to shut down for 1 minute, though it remains charged with lightning during this time.</p>

        Zybilna to hide from her most hated enemies. In the Feywild, she raised a magnificent palace and set about
        establishing herself as the benevolent archfey Zybilna of Prismeer, avatar of mercy for destitute mortals. Her
        closest allies saw the cracks in her facade, flashes of arrogance and cruelty that conflicted with her kindly
        persona, but they ascribed this behavior to the mercurial nature of archfey.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="851dcc5f-a964-4f79-b4e5-590d317085e1">Over time, Iggwilv made the mistake of placing too
        much trust in the hags of the Hourglass Coven, who served in her court as advisors. The hags waited patiently
        for the opportunity to overthrow Iggwilv. That day came when the League of Malevolence arrived at the palace.

        wizard named Ringlerun. When Kelek uncovered clues to Zybilna’s true identity, he hatched a foolish plan to
        blackmail her into bringing him the staff. Kelek was betrayed at the eleventh hour by his own companion, the
        warlock Skylla, who secretly swore loyalty to Baba Yaga, Iggwilv’s adoptive mother. When the League of
        Malevolence arrived at the palace, the Hourglass Coven ensured that Kelek’s rivals from Valor’s Call were close
        behind. The two factions clashed inside the palace.</p>

        <p>IGGWILV THE WITCH QUEEN</p>
        <p>Iggwilv has a long and storied history throughout the multiverse. This adventure presents the legendary
            figure in her current form. Her <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"

        <p><em><strong>Baba Yaga’s Daughter.</strong></em> Iggwilv’s path to greatness began when she was adopted by the
            mother of all witches, Baba Yaga, who named her Natasha. On the worlds of the Material Plane, she was better
            known as Tasha, the inventor of <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"

                laughter</a>. Tasha’s magic-fueled ambitions brought her into contact with demons and demon lords, which
            she subjugated and used against her enemies. Tasha became known on the world of Oerth as Iggwilv the Witch
            Queen, a peerless wizard and conqueror. It was she who wrote the <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"
                href="/magic-items/2407504-demonomicon-of-iggwilv"
                data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/2407504-tooltip">Demonomicon of Iggwilv</a>—the greatest of all
            treatises on the Abyss and its demonic inhabitants. (The book, which plays no part in this adventure, is
            described in <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe">Tasha’s Cauldron of
                Everything</a>.)</p>
        <p><em><strong>Iggwilv’s Transformation.</strong></em> Iggwilv learned several dark secrets while studying the
            Abyss, including the ability to summon demons and demonic spirits. But in her quest for absolute power, she
            made too many enemies and underestimated their determination to destroy her, so she fled to other worlds and
            across planes to escape the worst of them. She eventually took a page from her mother’s book and sequestered
            herself in the Feywild, where she assumed the guise of an archfey and carved out a spectacular domain for
            herself. Gradually, Iggwilv transformed into a Fey creature, though she outwardly appears human. Her
            disposition changed over time as well, as she became less interested in personal power and more interested
            in exploring her fey existence.</p>

            three doors that have been knocked from their hinges, leaving openings through which you can see adjoining
            rooms.</p>
        <p>Throughout the ballroom, royal courtiers stand motionless, their eyes fixed on a black iron cauldron atop a
            dais in the middle of the chamber. Dark vapors rise from the cauldron, and a huge, dragon-like monster is
            coiled around it. The dragon’s body twitches slightly, and its closed eyelids flutter as it dreams.</p>
        <p>Two figures are frozen, statue-like, off to one side of the cauldron: an imperious, middle-aged woman with
            long white hair and white robes, and a younger woman clad in armor and wearing a white cape. The older woman
            is reaching desperately toward the cauldron, while the armored woman at her side is grasping a fine-looking
            quarterstaff.</p>

        Zybilna treated the jabberwock like a pet, regularly inviting it into her palace to feed from her cauldron. It
        continues to visit the palace even now that Zybilna is frozen in time, has fed recently, and is sound asleep.
        Characters can move quietly about the room without waking it. Loud noises cause it to awaken, as do attacks made
        against it and any attempts to use or disturb the cauldron. Crafty characters who don’t want to engage the
        jabberwock in battle can try to lure it elsewhere, either by using themselves as bait or by playing music (see
        the “Beware the Jabberwock!” sidebar).</p>
    <aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="BewaretheJabberwock">
        <p>BEWARE THE JABBERWOCK!</p>
        <p>Overcoming the jabberwock in area P22 is one of the main challenges of this chapter and, indeed, the whole
            adventure. The characters are unlikely to survive a head-on fight with the creature, but there are things
            they can do to increase their chances of survival:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Free the great owl from the aviary (<a href="#P20Aviary">area P20</a>) and set it against the
                jabberwock. Characters toward whom the owl is indifferent can easily put the owl in a jabberwock-hunting
                mood if they have the means to speak with it. If the jabberwock and the owl ever make eye contact, the
                jabberwock flees the palace with the owl in pursuit.</li>
            <li>Bait the jabberwock into leaving the palace. The jabberwock will follow prey or the sound of music. Once
                lured outside, assuming it’s not set upon by the great owl immediately, the jabberwock goes hunting and
                does not return for 1d6 + 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Obtain <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/3895576-snicker-snack"
                    data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/3895576-tooltip">Snicker-Snack</a>, the vorpal sword in <a
                    href="#P50Vault">area P50</a>. The jabberwock is vulnerable to its slashing damage, and the sword’s
                attacks can neutralize the jabberwock’s Regeneration trait.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The jabberwock is friendly toward Zybilna and hostile toward everything else, though it thinks twice about
            attacking anything bigger than itself. Throwing food at the jabberwock might distract it long enough to
            allow characters to flee its presence without risk of pursuit. Befriending the jabberwock isn’t an option.

        Shon to remain at his post, and in exchange, Shon (and his spider) will use the library to research
        time-freezing magic, with the goal of helping the league break the spell on Ringlerun the wizard so that Kelek

        40 feet, and 50 feet, respectively. Each cage’s height is controlled by one of the levers on the far side of the
        narrow ledge. Normally, moving a lever up or down causes its cage to ascend or descend at a rate of 1 foot per
        second; at present, however, the mechanisms that raise and lower the cages are frozen in time, and until the
        time-freezing effect ends, nothing happens when any of the levers are moved.</p>

        a failed save, it is teleported into the gilded cage corresponding to that pixie, and any creature already
        occupying that cage teleports to the space vacated by the target. A pixie released from temporal stasis can use

        which points to an arrow that points toward a swan, whose beak points to a hippogriff pointing at an axe. By
        taking the first letters of these creatures and objects, the name NATASHA is spelled out. Reward any player who
        figures this out by having that player’s character whisper the name as if conjuring it from some half-forgotten

        Iggwilv and Natasha from the characters’ memories before continuing the conversation as if nothing had happened.
        Inform the players that this effect has occurred—the names Iggwilv and Natasha no longer mean anything to their
        characters, and their characters are unaware of what Zybilna has just done. As far as the characters are
        concerned, Zybilna is the archfey who rules Prismeer and has no other past identities. The effect is permanent

    <p data-content-chunk-id="60a3af3a-fb96-4131-8b2c-7fa3e735dfff">The surviving hags can sense when Zybilna is
        released from temporal stasis—or, rather, they can sense when their hold over Prismeer is lost. The instant
        Zybilna regains control of her domain, the hags use their <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
            href="/spells/2206-plane-shift" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2206-tooltip">plane shift</a> spells to flee to
        Gehenna, where they maintain a cramped tower guarded by yugoloth mercenaries. They don’t think that Zybilna is
        aware of the tower, but her spies learned about it some time ago. She reveals the tower’s location to characters
        who want to conclude their dealings with the hags or perhaps put an end to them. The tower in Gehenna is beyond
        the scope of this adventure; flesh out its occupants and defenses as you see fit if the characters decide to pay
        the hags a visit.</p>

        surviving hags, preferring to let them stew in exile. If all three hags are still alive, the coven stays
        together even though its members constantly blame one another for their failures. The hags are united by their
        fear of Zybilna’s wrath, and they live in torment, dreading the day when Zybilna seeks them out and inflicts
        punishment on them for their wickedness.</p>

        learn that Zybilna and Iggwilv are one and the same. They know Iggwilv only by her reputation as a villain, but
        they have allied with Zybilna against the League of Malevolence. That alliance persists, at least until the
        league is destroyed and its surviving members taken into custody. Zybilna offers to send Valor’s Call and their
        prisoners back to the Material Plane, after which Valor’s Call and Iggwilv go their separate ways.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6f370377-8729-422a-9e0a-420c92a23614">League members who are still at large in the palace
        try to flee as soon as the time-freezing magic on the palace ends, for they know Zybilna will not forgive them
        for their treachery. If the characters rescued Strongheart, the merciful knight sets out to track down and
        capture the remaining members of the league, whereas the other members of Valor’s Call would just as soon
        dispose of them. If you want to use the League of Malevolence in future adventures, allowing one or more of its
        members to escape means they can show up again later in your campaign. The league might also have other members
        whom the characters have yet to encounter.</p>

        of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change
        the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being
        attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with
        images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron
        and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In
        either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded
        handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can
        hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.</p>

        creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point
        of decrepitude. In this state, the creature’s speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to
        30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach
        the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
            href="/spells/2303-wish" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2303-tooltip">wish</a> spell or divine intervention can

        named Zybilna. The hags wormed their way into Iggwilv’s good graces, biding their time until they could wrest

        Bitter End, is the youngest member of the Hourglass Coven. People come to her to learn about their futures,
        which she spells out through grotesque theatrical pageants. As payment, she snatches away a portion of each
        client’s free will, preventing them from taking certain courses of action in their lives. Her petitioners often
        learn of a dreadful fate that awaits them but find themselves unable to prevent it due to the cursed terms of
        their deal.</p>

        extends to her own life; she has foreseen her own demise during a solar eclipse. In the depths of her castle, a
        lightning-powered device called the Orrery of Tragedies clicks and turns day and night, giving Endelyn glimpses
        of her terrible fate.</p>

        “theater curtain” veil. The outermost layers of her dress open to reveal a marionette theatre, and she
        manipulates her puppets using an arrangement of artificial hands that nestles in the folds of fabric. She

        Coven. Better known as Granny Nightshade, she offers her assistance to those who are haunted by regret. Her
        deals often result in cruel twists; for example, a petitioner who asks to be reunited with a lost love might be
        transformed into one of their loved one’s cherished items, such as a favorite bonnet.</p>

        and slows down as her mood sours. When she is furious, the key comes to a dead stop.</p>

        betray her allies as to help them. She talked Kelek into allowing her to serve as the primary liaison between
        the League of Malevolence and the Hourglass Coven, claiming her pact with Baba Yaga made her better suited for
        the role than anyone else.</p>

        turn on her one day and shared this information with the warlock. Skylla reacted to that news by distancing
        herself from the League of Malevolence, and now she works for Endelyn. Skylla is open to the idea of rejoining
        the league, but not while Kelek is in charge.</p>

        Unusually short of stature for someone of orcish heritage, he might pass for an ugly, beardless dwarf were it
        not for his rotting tusks and grayish pallor. The only thing he loves is money, and he wouldn’t hesitate to stab
        allies in the back if they came between him and the riches he covets.</p>

        was founded by Strongheart, a resolute human paladin committed to destroying evil wherever it rears its ugly
        head. Strongheart alone determines who can become a member of this prestigious group, which has more members
        than those described here. (The other members, who do not appear in this adventure, are busy elsewhere.)
        Strongheart is always on the lookout for courageous heroes who are willing to devote themselves to a good cause.
        Only good-aligned characters are allowed to join Valor’s Call.</p>

        between the bars of a cage, or the space between the feet of a bed and the floor. The rift disappears after a
        few seconds—enough time for the boggle to step, reach, or attack through it.</p>

            the boggle can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the
            boggle puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only the boggle

    <p data-content-chunk-id="435cda94-8d2d-450e-bd60-aad8bc076a5a">Brigganocks are frantic, mouse-sized creatures that
        live in mines. Whenever a mortal makes a nonmagical wish, perhaps while blowing out the candles on a birthday
        cake or tossing a coin down a well, an echo of that wish becomes lodged in a stone buried deep in the earth of
        the Feywild. Brigganocks seek out these wish stones, discarding the ones that contain wishes of ill intent and
        keeping those that hold good wishes. Brigganocks refine wish stones into gems and use them to decorate their
        architecture and crafts, or they trade them to other Fey for food and favors. A more powerful Fey creature can
        use a wish stone to scry on the maker of the wish, empower a supernatural charm, or provide the spark needed to
        create an animated object. Other uses are possible as well.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cefdf0f8-8ceb-4fb8-91b2-f11e13c125a5">A brigganock’s soul lives outside its body,
        manifesting as a bulb of pale light that floats alongside it and helps the brigganock see in the dark.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="939896f6-dfe3-4342-af73-18345cbd54ee">Brigganocks have minor spellcasting abilities that
        help them survive. They also have the ability to manipulate time, allowing them to accomplish hour-long tasks in
        a matter of seconds, though a brigganock must rest between these bursts of temporal acceleration.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2957ce42-e3db-43a0-9de9-3f873305540e">Brigganocks like to nibble on cheese, lettuce, and
        other soft foods. They eat quite a lot for creatures of their size and never turn down a good meal.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b3a88474-e74f-45ff-9fae-94c8e1c55521">Campestris are happy-go-lucky mushroom-like
        creatures with few cares or worries. They are captivated by music, though they can’t distinguish a well-played
        performance from a bad one. If anyone plays an instrument or sings in the campestris’ vicinity, the little
        creatures will happily sing along, each in an obnoxiously nasal falsetto, as they dance and caper around whoever
        is making the music.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="202216d4-8208-4dba-a70e-8254566975f4">Campestris can easily imitate lyrics and music.
        After a campestri has practiced a song or a piece of music three or four times, the creature remembers it
        forever.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="54a4c3d0-b20e-45bc-92aa-0a0b3bbf804f">Campestris vary widely in color, from white to tan
        to dark brown, but they always have red or purple caps and speckles. A campestri moves by manipulating the
        mycelium that grows out of the base of its stem and supports it. The mushroom creatures eat salty soil, filter
        out the salt, and excrete a slippery paste of purified soil (stripped of things nourishing to fungi, of course).
        Eating salt is also a defense mechanism, because it makes the campestris taste salty and thus unpleasant to most
        creatures, though bullywugs consider them a delicacy.</p>

                fey’s true name has been stricken from history, but the stories call him Dubh Catha (“Dark Crow” in
                Common), and other Fey refer to the house’s descendants as dubh sith—“darklings.” Darklings dwell in
                secluded caverns and chambers beneath the towns of other species. From such enclaves, they quietly ply

                darklings cover their entire bodies with clothing when exposure to light is a risk. The light darklings
                absorb over the course of their lives explodes outward when they die, incinerating the creatures and

    <p data-content-chunk-id="978f7a45-a5a3-4e93-820c-ecb64c4312fd">Harengons are rabbit-folk native to the Feywild,
        through they often migrate to the Material Plane. They love to travel on foot and rarely stay in one place for
        long.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="59f9edbd-fa58-4e37-b5aa-8f4a488862c4">Not all harengons are mean-spirited bullies like the
        ones presented here. Every harengon follows their own path through life, their disposition shaped in part by the
        company they keep. One harengon might travel to far lands, make friends along the way, delight in freedom and
        the open trail, and find inner peace. Another might become an adventurer with a strong heart and fervent dreams.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="044d773b-1f2f-42a4-9b52-6fb1c3583cb4">Harengon brigands are usually encountered in small
        bands lurking along trails and roadways, where they can easily spot and ambush their victims. They delight in
        extorting travelers for safe passage while rudely mocking them. These bullies are particularly antagonistic
        toward those who appear to be lost or in a hurry.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d4332bc0-be93-41f3-b83e-a028cdf4efc6">The best way to deal with harengon brigands is to
        outnumber them or give them a good kicking. They flee quickly when the tables are turned against them.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="96d5156e-9f77-49f2-b287-ce92570b1c60">Harengon snipers provide artillery support to gangs
        of harengon brigands. They hide atop bluffs, in the high branches of trees, and behind shelter, ready to pick
        off targets from a safe distance.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="224d6363-1273-4bc1-a297-9b8db47652b5">These snipers are so adept with their crossbows that
        their targets gain no benefit from less than total cover against ranged attacks the harengons make with these
        weapons. In addition, they can attack a target as far away as their weapons’ maximum range without needing to
        apply the usual penalty for attacking at long range. After a sniper makes an attack, the harengon can duck out
        of sight to make retaliation difficult, if not impossible.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f87c8afc-d336-43cc-b0b0-3f7923993260">A jabberwock is a solitary, temperamental predator
        that haunts pristine forests and ancient ruins. Accurate descriptions of jabberwocks are difficult to come by,
        because the rare survivors of an encounter with one retain only a confused impression of its parts and not a
        sense of the whole. Pieced-together accounts describe it as a sinewy, dragon-like creature that can walk on its
        hind legs as easily as it travels on all four. Its eyes can emit fiery beams.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="aa8da189-6c2a-4af3-ae17-a98b2c875473">Once a jabberwock has chosen its target, it
        concentrates its attacks on that target until the victim is killed (and devoured), until the jabberwock is
        killed, or until the target escapes using teleportation magic or other means.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c5931ef5-4148-441b-81b1-9c5c0f983d08">If a jabberwock is slain, another one appears 3d8
        years later, materializing within a thousand miles of where the old one perished. No immature jabberwock has
        ever been sighted, and the creature does not appear to age.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="eaf1fc3d-7487-4c34-9132-d47935d2a962">Korreds are secretive creatures that have strong
        ties to earth and stone. They prefer to keep their own company but occasionally consort with creatures of
        elemental earth such as <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17148-galeb-duhr"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17148-tooltip">galeb duhr</a>. A tribe of korreds gathers weekly to perform
        ceremonial dances, beating out rhythms on stone with their hooves and clubs. Korreds typically flee from other
        creatures but become aggressive when they feel insulted or are annoyed by the sounds of mining.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d7ccc2e9-fbb3-4579-8285-7e344d8678d3">No one knows the ways of stone and earth better than
        a korred. Korreds can seemingly smell veins of metal and gems. A korred on the surface can feel the rise and
        fall of bedrock under the earth and where caves are present, and underground it knows pathways through the stone
        for miles around. Secret doors set into stone are as obvious as windows to a korred.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="59f55dc8-7360-4e29-9243-64367a6bedfd">Korreds have hair all over their bodies, but the
        hair that grows on their heads is magical. When cut, it transforms into strands of whatever material was used to
        cut it. Korreds often use iron shears to cut off their hair, then weave the strands together to create iron
        ropes that they can manipulate or animate. Korreds take great pride in their hair and equally great offense at
        anyone who attempts to cut it without permission.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b863a725-6aa6-4662-927a-eacab5ca7967">A living doll is easily mistaken for an inanimate
        doll or a stuffed animal until it moves. Trapped within each living doll is a mean spirit that encourages those
        around it to behave badly toward others. The doll takes pleasure in tormenting the guilt-ridden and despondent,
        hastening their descent into depression or paranoia. Because it fears its own destruction, the doll rarely
        causes direct harm to others. When forced to defend itself, it debilitates opponents with its maniacal cackle
        and assaults the minds of its enemies by turning their worst fears against them.</p>

            data-content-chunk-id="3b1833c6-22c5-4ef8-a665-f8febd012f0f"></a>Quickling</h2>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c6c725fc-078d-4f67-9ebb-31c476107c0b">Racing faster than the eye can track, a quickling
        appears as little more than a blurry streak of color. Only when it stops running do its small, slender form and
        cold, cruel eyes become apparent.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b97374ca-5865-442f-860b-a854c03d5c0d">Quicklings owe their existence—and their plight—to
        the Queen of Air and Darkness, the dread ruler of the Gloaming Court. Once lazy, egotistical folk, the creatures
        that would become the quicklings were late in answering the queen’s summons one time too many. To hasten their
        pace and teach them to mind her will, the queen shrank their stature and sped up their internal clocks. The
        queen’s curse gave the quicklings their amazing speed but also accelerated their passage through life. No
        quickling lives longer than 15 years.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="26cb03ff-23bd-4f2d-8d67-cb035923de1e">The mortal realm is a ponderous place to a
        quickling’s eye: a hurricane creeps gradually across the sky, a torrent of rain drifts earthward like lazy
        snowflakes, and lightning crawls in a meandering path from cloud to cloud. The slow and boring world seems to be
        populated by torpid creatures whose deep, sonorous speech lacks meaning.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f8651781-b313-420b-93cf-685f082fc79e">To other creatures, a quickling seems blindingly
        fast, vanishing into an indistinct blur when it moves. Its cruel laughter is a burst of rapid staccato sounds,
        its speech a shrill squeal. Only when a quickling deliberately slows down, which it prefers not to do, can other
        beings properly see, hear, and comprehend it. Never truly at rest, a “stationary” quickling constantly paces and
        shifts in place, as though it can’t wait to be off again.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3db2496c-0ea4-4b02-9d5a-57f006f14274">Quicklings have a capricious nature and are always
        up to something. A quickling spends most of its time perpetrating acts of mischief on slower creatures. One
        rarely passes up an opportunity to tie a person’s bootlaces together, move the stool a creature is about to sit
        on, or unbuckle a saddle while no one is looking.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="65459a30-2214-4346-af97-247cc608cf44">Tricks of that sort are hardly the limit of their
        artful malice, however. They don’t commit outright murder, but quicklings can ruin lives in plenty of other
        ways, such as by stealing an important letter, swiping coins collected for the poor, or planting a stolen item
        in someone’s bag.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5ddae2f0-b838-40d1-a138-a59e801acd0a">A redcap is a homicidal creature born of blood lust.
        Redcaps, although small, have formidable strength, which they use to hunt and kill without reservation or
        regret.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="af9b57ca-fff4-4f57-8f74-5a13dd0bcc8e">In the Feywild, or wherever that plane touches the
        world at a fey crossing, if a sentient creature satisfies its intense desire for bloodshed, one or more redcaps
        might appear where the blood of a slain foe soaks the ground. At first, new redcaps look like tiny bloodstained
        mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that
        looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The
        creature has a pointed leather cap, trousers of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon.
        From the moment it awakens, a redcap cares only for murder and carnage, and it sets off to satisfy these
        cravings.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d7ef48de-2d2f-4e80-b20f-4d5ad2cb0365">To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap must
        soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with wet blood, and it
        knows instinctively that if the blood isn’t replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as
        if it had never been. A redcap’s desire to kill is rooted in its will to survive.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5950b9b7-85df-452e-86e8-9888c229af79">Redcaps don’t usually operate in groups, but in some
        circumstances they might be found in the employ of hags and evil mages.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3070d6c9-311b-4a7a-b589-f06680afd088">Also, some redcaps are psychically connected to the
        beings whose murderous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find and murder its
        creator. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the
        creation of several redcaps at the same site could attract an entire group to serve as cohorts.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bd09c9e2-d5d1-46d5-8460-dbb1a89ced99">In any case, if a redcap works with another being,
        the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap’s natural and necessary urge for
        blood risks becoming the redcap’s next target.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6ba5daad-49af-405c-b31e-165a4c784e70">Gleam and Glister are high elf twins, who until
        recently performed amazing acts of balance and agility at the Witchlight Carnival. Together, they are known as
        the Selenelion twins. (A selenelion is a celestial event during a lunar eclipse in which the sun and the
        eclipsed moon can be observed at the same time, either just before sunset or just after sunrise, when both
        bodies appear just above the horizon at nearly opposite points in the sky.)</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a60dfddd-4f59-4511-b49b-20734164f012">Gleam and Glister were born during such an event,
        and they are blessed with magical abilities tied to moonlight (Gleam) and sunlight (Glister), respectively. The
        twins are easily distinguished by the masks they wear; Gleam wears a crescent moon mask, and Glister wears a sun
        mask.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="39084614-a12e-4845-9aa8-576d7590ad17">Blessed by Corellon, the twins can each change their
        sex at the end of a long rest, though one twin rarely does so without the other doing likewise. The accompanying
        stat block uses “she” and “her” as each twin’s default pronouns.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a12a7f2f-fcdc-42a2-b310-b37c7364bf5c">The twins are as fond of one another as two siblings
        can be. Gleam is the introvert of the pair, while Glister is the extrovert. Both have friendly, agreeable
        demeanors. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/twbtw/roleplaying-cards/"

            <p>Zybilna’s butler appears as a lanky man clad in faded brown clothes. Thinnings longs to see Prismeer’s
                archfey freed from temporal stasis and her enemies fed their comeuppance. He helps anyone whose goals
                align with his own, but he abhors violence and shuns combat.</p>

                from lawful evil to chaotic good. Will’s time in the forests of Thither has imbued him with a

                has no shame with regard to who he is and what he looks like, and he has a knack for small talk,

                allows her emotions to run rampant and is more likely to find herself in the grip of happiness, anger,
                or melancholy. This is the price she pays to exert control over the Feywild and impose her will on the
