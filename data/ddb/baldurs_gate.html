                    their steps in Baldur’s Gate, where lives hold prices in copper and greed proves deadlier than
                    dragon fire. Baldur’s Gate has a reputation for being a rough place, where crime and opportunity
                    walk hand in hand, and where anything can be bought, sold, or seized at sword point. If something
                    can be given a price, it’s for sale somewhere in Baldur’s Gate. Drugs and poisons sit on shelves
                    alongside tinctures and remedies. Trade goods from Chult, mechanical wonders from Neverwinter, tomes
                    of magic from Calimshan, and the most believable counterfeits of each can all be found in the city’s
                    stalls.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="148c4c5e-c1af-4efb-a4c9-bb86b8625559">The Flaming Fist, a mercenary company
                    paid for by the city, protects residents without the barest hint of civil delicacy. The Watch, the
                    guardian force of the wealthy Upper City, exists only to serve the patriars — the city’s detached
                    upper class. Meanwhile, crime flourishes under the control of the Guild, which oversees almost every
                    organized criminal act, from dockside gambling rings to blackmail at patriar garden parties. Either
                    under the Guild’s auspices or in defiance of them, those who cut purses or throats make a decent
                    living in the city, their talents traded as briskly — and often just as openly — as those of any
                    other professional.</p>

                    Baldur’s Gate is not without its lights. Some residents earnestly seek to make the city a safer
                    place by banding together to make their own sort of imperfect but effective justice.</p>

                    community, Baldur’s Gate has undergone a dramatic transformation, becoming the hub of danger and
                    adventure it is today.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="3d28d593-dac8-4d5e-b54f-987d3155bbb8">Centuries ago, the hero Balduran spent
                    years questing in lands across the Sea of Swords and beyond. When finally he returned to his village
                    of Gray Harbor, he brought fantastic wealth with him, much of which he gifted to friends and family.
                    These boons greatly improved Gray Harbor’s fortunes, launching businesses, expanding its docks, and
                    seeing the creation of a defensive wall around the town. In honor of their heroic patron, the
                    citizens came to call one of their new wall’s passages Baldur’s Gate. Within a generation, though,
                    the gate became synonymous with the community, and the settlement known as Baldur’s Gate began
                    appearing on maps of the Sword Coast.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="aeeeb547-a02f-41d6-8ff2-7e7b509ed486">The city’s surprising growth attracted
                    all manner of people. Peasants affected by raiding and war, farmers rendered penniless by famine and
                    drought, pirates seeking a neutral port — all types saw a chance to put their mark on the rapidly
                    growing community.</p>
                <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="OrderinBaldursGate"

                <p data-content-chunk-id="15403443-f3c0-4f1d-b5dc-cfe898b74b30">As the city swelled, questions of law
                    and taxation arose. The community’s eldest families — largely those wealthy enough to afford homes
                    within the city walls — came to be known as patriars and grew wary of the influx of strangers
                    settling beyond their walls. The creation of various additional taxes on trade and travel led to
                    violence breaking out between the Upper City — behind the original walls of Gray Harbor — and the
                    Lower City, built on the slopes leading down to the Chionthar River. Patriar houses were ransacked,
                    family heirlooms were lost forever, and heirs were kidnapped, never to be seen again. Gold flowed
                    like blood as families and guilds hired mercenaries to protect them. Only the election of a new
                    group of rulers — known as the dukes and, collectively, as the Council of Four — put the matter to
                    rest. These elected rulers have been a part of the city’s governance ever since.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="a5278c01-285e-41c9-9335-4f80726954c3">Another pillar of order in Baldur’s Gate
                    formed when the adventurer Eltan, a noted warrior raised in the area, returned home from exploits
                    abroad. Seeing the chaos that had splintered his beloved city, Eltan united the city’s independent
                    mercenary companies under a single banner, that of the Flaming Fist. Eltan used the mercenaries to
                    quash what pockets of disorder he found, punishing lawbreakers for their crimes. Though plenty of
                    theft, blackmail, and assassination continued behind closed doors, the founding of the Flaming Fist
                    marked a new chapter in the city’s story.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="70f03009-b890-4036-bbff-d535953a939a">Over the years, Baldur’s Gate has
                    harbored countless evil schemes and conspiracies. Perhaps the most dastardly, though, was that
                    perpetrated by Bhaal, god of murder, who foresaw his own death during the Time of Troubles. While in
                    mortal form, Bhaal conceived multitudes of offspring, plotting to have them resurrect him. They
                    actively hunted and slew each other, with the survivors collecting ever more of Bhaal’s godly
                    essence.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="156d93b9-ff8b-4da5-a68f-76e5e9726547">Sarevok, a Bhaalspawn and member of the
                    Iron Throne merchants’ guild, sought to spark war with the nation of Amn and become the new Lord of
                    Murder. Another Bhaalspawn, aided by powerful allies, thwarted Sarevok’s plan and brought stability,
                    if not peace, to Baldur’s Gate once more. Yet, Bhaal and his faithful have menaced the city ever
                    since.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="303b3bd4-c0e3-4ea2-b5ec-49755b03c2a0">This gazetteer describes the independent
                    city of Baldur’s Gate as things are in 1492 DR.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="23585424-05fb-4f08-848a-c41a2279484d">The original wall ringing the Upper City
                    still stands, and a second defensive wall now rings the Lower City. The Outer City, a collection of
                    hastily made structures and shantytowns, runs along the River Chionthar.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="3f779b21-1866-4a00-a09f-7d26c5b0a0e9">While the Outer City might seem the most
                    lawless, every district of Baldur’s Gate has its own threats. In the Upper City, patriar families
                    and government officials jostle to secure their positions. Many are not above using private agents
                    to acquire blackmail material, sabotage public appearances, or even frame innocents to secure power.
                    The victims of these plots, and officials who want a fair and honest legal system, must resort to
                    hiring their own agents to unearth conspiracies, break out unfairly imprisoned citizens, and obtain
                    evidence the Flaming Fist cannot.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="29981918-4ac4-4067-9ef3-814534b180dd">The Upper City’s political intrigues and
                    the Outer City’s violence spills over into the Lower City, the city’s middle ground. Rampant crime,
                    class grudges, foreign threats, and economic pressures leave many Baldurians feeling trapped within
                    their own homes. Flaming Fist patrols react to threats with indiscriminate violence, doing little to
                    make citizens feel safer. As a result, in recent years many citizens have started banding together
                    in crews. These counter-gangs align along professional or neighborhood affiliations, doing their
                    best to protect their territories. While this has given some of the city’s people a way of feeling
                    more in control of their lives, it’s also increased the number of armed citizens on the streets.
                    Whether the Lower City is actually safer after the formation of crews remains an open question.</p>

                    against the city’s gates. Here crime and poverty are contrasted by wonders from afar and the riches
                    of cultures across Faerûn. The mix of wanderers and refugees remains in constant flux, with
                    communities forming and disbanding on a monthly basis. None can possibly keep track of all the
                    cultural conventions or the dangerous — sometimes outright evil — religious practices observed in
                    the Outer City. As a result, Baldur’s Gate has widely adopted a “do no harm” policy when it comes to
                    faiths and organizations operating in the city. Any group is welcome to operate openly so long as
                    the city’s important citizens aren’t harmed.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="ff3481b8-b05f-4ede-b100-4f4bfa9436b7">Beyond all its dangers, Baldur’s Gate is
                    an adventurer’s city, a place where a sword-for-hire can find a rich patron, join a secret guild,
                    stalk killers for a bounty, or come to the aid of desperate citizens. Good-hearted champions fight
                    against corruption and bring murderers to justice, while less moral mercenaries find a good price
                    for their services. The city offers opportunities as well as the most reliable and ruthless market
                    on the Sword Coast. Information, treasures, secrets, and souls can be bought or sold for the right
                    price.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="d07df175-f35e-43f1-95c6-387c8cd39376">As a great hero of Baldur’s Gate once
                    said, “Watch your step in the shadows. Watch your back in the light. Win a prize beyond your wildest
                    dreams or disappear into forgotten history. Every day your life is on the line. Every day you could
                    become a legend. Welcome to Baldur’s Gate.”</p>

                    <p>The Baldur’s Gate coat of arms represents the city’s role as a hub for river and ocean trade as
                        well as nodding toward its namesake, the explorer Balduran. The symbol originated as a pirate
                        emblem, though, and its components hold a double meaning today.</p>
                    <p>Originally, the alternating bands of water beneath the ship indicated the turbulent dangers of
                        the sea, but also the rich rewards it can bring. The crimson flags of the ship referenced the
                        brutal life of a pirate, blood spilled on the deck or in the water. The crisscrossing ropes and
                        canted sail symbolized the web of secrets and intrigue that mark a pirate captain’s life.</p>
                    <p>Today, some optimistic souls try to recast the seal, claiming its calm waters represent the
                        city’s desire to remain a peaceful power and the clear skies symbolize a prosperous future. But
                        those who know the city’s history see the cunning and violence underpinning the emblem. For
                        many, the contradictory interpretations make the city’s coat of arms all the more fitting.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="5b8eb2dd-ebbf-4d29-9ea7-f2a6315eb96d">Baldur’s Gate trades with the coastal
                    cities of Waterdeep and Neverwinter to the north while contending with the aggressive mercantile
                    nation of Amn to the south. Amn seeks to dominate trade on the Sea of Swords and views Baldur’s Gate
                    as a growing threat. Baldur’s Gate joined the Lords’ Alliance, a coalition of independent cities
                    that includes Neverwinter and Waterdeep, largely because of disputes with Amn. Should Amn decide to
                    attack Baldur’s Gate, the city can count on the other members of the Lords’ Alliance to come to its
                    defense. This arrangement infuriates Amn, which is not prepared to test the alliance’s resolve.</p>

                    and Cormyr view Baldur’s Gate as a lawless cesspool that might have to be dealt with someday. These
                    nations especially frown on the city’s broad religious tolerance.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="63aa71c1-3495-495f-8291-2b068d7a510b">To enter the great library of
                    Candlekeep, one must furnish the library’s monks with a book not already contained in the library’s
                    archives. Travelers on the way to Candlekeep often stop in Baldur’s Gate, anticipating that they can
                    find such a book in the city’s markets. As such, Baldur’s Gate does a small but bustling trade in
                    rare books. Several merchants have a known policy of buying valuable books without question, selling
                    them at a high markup. Travelers seeking a specific book also hire mercenaries or adventurers to
                    venture into dungeons or ruins and bring back the prize.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="ca3fc959-53a7-4171-9676-39b01f5999e4">If information can’t be found in the
                    whisper-markets of Baldur’s Gate, then Candlekeep becomes a logical next stop. Adventurers are
                    sometimes hired to guard a desperate traveler on the road south, or to guard the outrageously rare
                    tomes scholars might carry to gain admission. The Guild knows the signs of a traveler headed for
                    Candlekeep, and often dispatches robbers to steal books and resell them to the merchants of the
                    city.</p>

                        Avernus</a>, the holy city of Elturel — the capital of Elturgard — sat upriver on the Chionthar.
                    Whereas Baldur’s Gate is a cutthroat city policed by mercenaries, Elturel was a lawful city of pious
                    folk watched over by knights of Helm, Torm, Tyr, and Lathander. The two cities couldn’t be less
                    alike.</p>

                    seize too much territory in Elturgard’s eyes, Elturel has responded by imposing a heavy tax on
                    shipments headed downriver. This sort of economic brinkmanship coupled with radically different
                    religious viewpoints has created bad blood between the two cities, though neither city has been

                    ports from which ships depart for Chult, a peninsula far to the south. Port Nyanzaru, located on the
                    northern coast of Chult, enjoys a respectful and mutually beneficial trade relationship with
                    Baldur’s Gate, and both cities are united in their dislike for the nation of Amn.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="93b03269-b864-4649-b075-0764289ae7ba">Outside of Port Nyanzaru, Baldur’s Gate
                    maintains its own holdings in Chult. Fort Beluarian serves as a beachhead for the interests of the
                    city, the Flaming Fist, and numerous patriar families in Chult. This small military hub oversees
                    much of the exploration (and exploitation) in regions of Chult claimed by Baldur’s Gate. It also
                    serves as a departure point for smuggling the region’s treasures back the Sword Coast, as well as
                    other ventures the Baldurians would prefer the native Chultans don’t learn about. As a result,
                    rarities from the depths of Chult, seen nowhere else on the Sword Coast, regularly trickle into the
                    port and market stalls of Baldur’s Gate.</p>

                    composed of nearly fifty patriar members, makes recommendations on issues of law and governance.
                    Once the parliament comes to a majority decision on a matter, usually after much heated debate, it
                    presents its position to the Council of Four. Three dukes and one grand duke make up this ruling
                    council (see “<a href="#CouncilofFour"
                        data-content-chunk-id="0bca8b9c-cc65-4f38-9713-fbfcdcb5f985">Council of Four</a>,” below, for
                    more information). The council also votes on matters, and in the case of a tie, the grand duke’s
                    vote counts as two.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="932653cf-5e92-48d1-9b2b-62f9530a54e3">Common belief holds that many parliament
                    members, and possibly one or more of the dukes, can be bribed for their votes. Corrupt parliament
                    members don’t wish to be caught taking payments, usually not out of fear of legal reprisal, but of
                    being perceived as incompetent among their peers. The perception is that one who can’t be trusted to
                    receive something as simple as a bribe likely can’t be trusted to manipulate the city’s intricate
                    social web. Such leads to the common farce of officials buying cheap jewelry or fake art objects
                    with their bribe money (usually in the form of platinum coins or jewels) hidden inside.</p>

                    a fortress in the middle of the Upper City, and controls the Flaming Fist, the navy, the tax

                <p data-content-chunk-id="94918440-0641-4399-94a6-e11ae70a40cb">Ulder Ravengard is a fearless soldier
                    who rose up through the ranks of the Flaming Fist to become its supreme marshal. Ravengard used his
                    military position and influence to secure for himself a seat on the Council of Four. Following the
                    deaths of two council members amid a cloud of corruption and scandal, he persuaded the Parliament of
                    Peers to back his election to grand duke.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="efd82993-2103-48f3-89cf-62d42911e489">Upon ascending to the highest position
                    in the city government, Ravengard refused to relinquish command of the Flaming Fist, making him the
                    most powerful figure in the city by far. This decision has not endeared him to anyone, but Ravengard
                    could care less about his popularity. His only concerns are the stability and prosperity of Baldur’s
                    Gate, and he doesn’t trust any of the other dukes or anyone in the Parliament of Peers to put the
                    city’s interests before their own.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="70d270cf-a7b6-46ad-9b22-8af2b8b1890c">Ravengard rose to grand duke on a
                    platform largely backed by idealistic commoners and enemies of the other established dukes. While he
                    won election handily, Ravengard has struggled in performing his duties, finding his hands tied at
                    every turn by both overt and invisible bureaucracy. Despite this, he’s been a voice of reason and
                    common sense on the Council of Four — if not the egalitarianism some hoped. He’s also proven largely
                    resistant to scandal and corruption, though many of his fellow dukes and those in the Parliament of
                    Peers still regularly outmaneuver him politically. One of his only obvious pleasures remains the
                    surprise inspections he regularly visits upon the troops at <a href="#WyrmsRock"

                <p data-content-chunk-id="a52fce48-10ba-47bf-a1fb-14f58e2e9fe8">Ravengard was recently tricked into
                    attending a diplomatic summit in Elturel, unaware that his political enemies in Baldur’s Gate
                    orchestrated this meeting in a fiendish plot to remove him from power. In his absence, the Flaming
                    Fist is leaderless, the council rudderless.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="229a2fde-5be1-465b-8a3b-14ae3e7fa63f">Once a vigorous and formidable
                    politician, Duke Belynne Stelmane recently suffered a seizure that left her with a partially
                    paralyzed face and slowed speech. In truth, a mind flayer provoked the duke’s “seizure” when it took
                    mental possession of her. Now Stelmane wages a silent war against the mind flayer’s influence,
                    biding her time until she can find a way to signal for aid or regain her will. Not even Stelmane’s
                    aides are aware of her secret struggle, though they cover for her as best they can.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="a11e9179-18b7-464a-8f83-242f751f9fe9">Given her current situation, Duke

                <p data-content-chunk-id="9aa37ee1-b838-4de6-8f66-4d2a20aa0b32">Duke Dillard Portyr was once a respected
                    businessman, but after a string of sour deals, he pulled back from his investments. Now he uses his
                    time to enjoy the comforts that his wealth and title provide him. He lives alone in his manor,
                    having outlived his two wives and three sons, and trades correspondence with his niece, Liara
                    Portyr, who commands a Flaming Fist outpost on Chult known as Fort Beluarian.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="d710f7d8-faca-4790-9c8a-42c9c76cc952">Duke Portyr is conflict-averse and goes
                    out of his way to avoid stress. He shows well in social situations, but is easily manipulated in the
                    political arena. He is known for listening with concern, showing an earnest desire to help, making
                    promises to look into things, and then doing nothing. As a result, a great deal of the citizenry’s
                    scorn lies heaped upon Duke Portyr’s shoulders.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="19817b43-9d42-4024-8df8-1225b039f6ac">Duke Portyr expressed concern about
                    Ravengard’s diplomatic mission to Elturel, fearing what the Flaming Fist might do while Ravengard is
                    away. If his worst fears come true and the Flaming Fist can’t control itself, Duke Portyr plans to
                    write a letter to his niece, urging her to return to Baldur’s Gate and take command of the Flaming
                    Fist in Ravengard’s absence. It’s literally the least he can do.</p>

                    Duke Thalamra Vanthampur is the matriarch of the Vanthampur family. Born with nothing, she spent
                    years wallowing in obscurity, repairing and renovating the city’s ancient sewer system. One
                    promotion after another followed until she was named Master of Drains and Underways. By then, she
                    had been married three times and given birth to three sons. Her lifelong goal has been to lift
                    herself and her family out of the sewers and into high society.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="7b72580a-2c8e-41ba-8291-961ef09a29d8">Years of political dealing, blame
                    shuffling, and bribery paid off when Thalamra was elected to the Council of Four. Although she has
                    served on the council for the shortest amount of time, Duke Vanthampur is easily the most
                    politically savvy council member. She speaks little during meetings of the council, preferring to
                    further her political agenda through meetings in her private offices and at her family estate. When
                    she does choose to debate, she speaks with a strength beyond what it seems like her age should
                    allow, and is known for leveling insults that land unsettlingly close to (supposedly) hidden truths.

                    hew to common law. Murder, theft, assault, blackmail, and fraud all carry severe penalties.
                    Patriars, the wealthy, and the well-connected are given much more leniency than commoners. A noble
                    heir who steals from a shop might get away with a fine paid by a parent, whereas a commoner
                    committing the same crime may be jailed or publicly flogged.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="f68cfa75-e4ba-4820-9028-4ac5720c8571">Both the Watch and the Flaming Fist have
                    the right to dispense immediate justice, should they witness a crime in progress. In unclear
                    situations, or when a person of influence is involved, the accused is jailed until a trial can be
                    set. Patriars and other powerful individuals are usually placed under house arrest, except in dire
                    circumstances. Commoners await their trial in jail. On occasion, a vigilante or hired mercenary will
                    break an accused commoner out of prison in order to ensure the accused’s safety until the trial
                    date.</p>

                    disturbance, petty theft, or vandalism carry commensurate punishments. Time in the stocks, public
                    humiliation, or a fine are the usual judgments. Some patriar families consider petty crimes to be
                    worse than major ones — they are a sign that one can’t manage one’s baser instincts. Patriars have
                    been known to pay huge bribes or promise outsized favors to protect a rebellious heir from being
                    charged with a minor crime.</p>

                    citizens often must throw themselves on the mercy of the courts, or scrape together what coin they
                    can to hire an adventurer or mercenary to find evidence to support their plea.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="c7f677a8-0aaf-47eb-b628-9e6afbaef928">The citizens of Baldur’s Gate include
                    many races and ethnicities. Though prejudices can exist among certain residents, Baldur’s Gate as a
                    whole is a diverse and unprejudiced — if not welcoming — city.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="c260a89f-9a2b-4220-ad84-47930fbcabeb">Many of the patriar families of Baldur’s
                    Gate can trace their lineage back for generations, but a significant portion of Baldurians were not
                    born in the city. Most citizens began their lives in Tethyr, the North, the Western Heartlands, or
                    other communities along the Sword Coast. Baldurians born in Amn, the High Forest, and nations
                    bordering the Inner Sea are less common, but still present. Rarely, travelers from as far away as
                    Chult, Mulhorand, or Luiren decide to follow the flow of trade and settle in the city.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="e0e6a001-123e-4bf9-b3e6-511631095942">Baldur’s Gate can be a rough place for
                    ordinary folk. Among the twisting streets of the Lower City, commoners have significantly fewer
                    rights than patriars, with only the brusque mercenaries of the Flaming Fist to keep them safe. Even
                    worse off are the poor residents of the Outer City, many of whom aren’t recognized as citizens. With
                    the Flaming Fist too eager to punish criminal behavior by drubbing both accuser and accused, it’s
                    important that common folk have someone to watch their backs. That’s why the people of Baldur’s Gate
                    created crews — collections of like-minded folk who band together for mutual protection. Depending
                    on the crew, this protection can range from taking someone’s side in a tavern brawl or guarding each
                    other’s shops to price fixing or inter-crew loans.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="b07925f0-1423-47be-933d-d68e1b9e77c0">Crews were the first to institute the
                    common practice of <em>burl</em>. Under this system, anyone seeking shelter and safety — usually
                    those fleeing from the Flaming Fist or some other danger — can approach a house or shop and give
                    three sharp knocks followed by a heavier one. The residents are then obligated to take that person
                    in and hide them. This applies even to members of opposing crews, though anyone requesting sanctuary
                    from a crew other than their own incurs a debt, both personally and on behalf of their crew. Abusing
                    someone who’s granted burl is grounds for immediate expulsion from one’s crew, and such “drowners”
                    are universally shunned.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="4e09baf3-9adb-40dd-817e-cff91e55b953">The dozens of crews calling Baldur’s
                    Gate home are as different in attitude and approach as the city’s residents. For instance, everyone
                    in the Lower City knows that if you need cheap muscle, you hire members of the burly Porters’ Union
                    or Stonemasons’ Guild, and not even the Flaming Fist would willingly pick a fight with the
                    blood-spattered Butchers’ Block or the mercenaries and “security consultants” of the Bannerless
                    Legion. Other crews, such as the Scribes and Sages or the Honorable Order of Moneylenders, would
                    never dream of getting their hands dirty, while the Apothecary Alliance and Brethren of Barbers
                    don’t need to throw a punch to strike fear into rivals. From carpenters to grocers, the
                    Forgeworkers’ Lodge to the Wisewoman Weavers, nearly every profession offers some access to a crew.
                    And not just legal professions, either; the Revelers’ Union, made up of night-workers who sell
                    drugs, companionship, and other recreations, is one of the most powerful in the city, thanks to the
                    information it gathers from its clients.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="115ddf8e-b71a-4c35-8724-6a33f3ca16b8">Some crews are simply
                    neighborhood-based, their association based on territory rather than trade, such as the Right Pashas
                    of Little Calimshan, the Crossed of Wyrm’s Crossing, the Gravemakers of Tumbledown, or the
                    Bloomridge Dandies.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="f763a480-ae97-4182-b07b-b847ffa2715e">By far the most important crew to
                    travelers, however, is the Gateguides. Made up primarily of teenage lantern bearers, the Gateguides
                    earn a living hiring themselves out to newcomers to show them the ropes of the city, help make
                    connections with other crews, and offer some degree of collective protection.</p>
                <aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="NoteworthyLaws">
                    <p>Noteworthy Laws</p>
                    <p>Of the city’s nuanced and unreliably enforced laws, the following tend to be the most surprising
                        to newcomers.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Foreign Agents.</em></strong> While traders and visitors to Baldur’s Gate are always
                        welcome, spies and saboteurs are not. Legitimate foreign agents, such as ambassadors, are
                        required to report to the High Hall for an elaborate series of interviews and licenses. Visitors
                        technically should do the same, but the law is rarely mentioned at the city’s gates and even
                        more rarely enforced. What distinguishes a visitor and a foreign agent can be unclear, and if an
                        individual doesn’t have a license marking them as one or the other, any duke or peer can
                        unilaterally change a non-citizen’s status, effectively sentencing them to imprisonment or
                        worse.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Livestock Restriction.</em></strong> By tradition, Baldur’s Gate bans animals larger
                        than a peacock within the city walls. Visitors determined not to surrender their beloved pets
                        (or valuable animals they intend to sell) sometimes arrive at the city with large peacocks in
                        tow, to prove their furred companion meets the legal requirement. This has led to a burgeoning,
                        noisy, and particularly cutthroat peacock-breeding industry in the Outer City.</p>
                    <p>Most travelers pay to stable oversize animals, either in Outer City liveries or at ranches
                        outside the city. Some animals are simply surrendered at the gate, though, becoming property of
                        the Watch (in the Upper City) or the Flaming Fist (in the Lower City), or sold during monthly
                        auctions.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="4a565141-061e-47fa-a5ca-600614a4593b">Patriars are the elite upper class of
                    the city, a rank defined largely by money and lines of vague, increasingly inconsequential heritage.
                    Many nobles claim generations of lineage, dating to the earliest days of Baldur’s Gate. Their money
                    funds industries and lines political pockets, but their names allow them to wield influence
                    throughout the city.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="fda2f8a4-b981-4e98-af79-64b364d7ec5d">Some patriars are economically-minded
                    individuals who rise early and spend their days in meetings and negotiations. They fund expeditions
                    into dangerous locales and hire explorers to map uncharted territories. Other patriars manipulate
                    the city’s power players through diplomacy and intrigue. They spend their days flitting from theater
                    performances to private balls, while quietly making and breaking the alliances that underwrite the
                    city’s structures.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="4e1971ec-3ebf-435a-8081-cd3b0e7cf89f">Patriars live and work in the Upper
                    City. Their manor homes employ dozens of servants, along with contingents of personal guards. The
                    wall surrounding the Upper City as well as the constant presence of the Watch — which exclusively
                    patrols that district — goes far toward assuring their security. As a side effect, it also means
                    many patriars go months without engaging with the city’s common folk, their insulation leading to
                    the spread of divisive rumors.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="73713a4a-755e-4aee-a8e9-d2cda8110c24">Patriars know the danger of the other
                    districts, where their wealth is a lure and their names carry no weight. Patriars who have to travel
                    the Lower City always do so with guards, and still risk robbery or worse violence.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="e6dacc33-ceaa-4084-b664-9255e246e977">Many patriar families hire proxies to
                    carry out their business in the Lower City or Outer City. If circumstances force patriars to visit
                    the Outer City personally, they typically travel in disguise, paying adventurers or mercenaries to
                    protect them without drawing the attention of a uniformed personal guard.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="f1df2a9f-8645-407b-86d5-8889ad733b80">Among the common folk and criminal
                    element of the city, patriars have a reputation for callousness. Common wisdom holds that patriars
                    are out of touch with everyday life and value citizens’ lives cheaply. For some nobles, this
                    assessment holds true. These patriars are class-conscious dilettantes who spend their money on
                    frivolous bets, debauched entertainment, and risky business ventures. For this callous lot, the
                    common people are nothing more than fools to be bilked, clods undeserving of comfort and wealth due
                    to their lack of comfort and breeding.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="3d81ddc1-732e-4c94-8c54-477a2d69ffaf">For a few patriars, though, the
                    inequality of Baldur’s Gate is a serious concern. Blocked by a corrupt government and uncaring
                    peers, these civic-minded nobles use unorthodox channels to distribute aid. They quietly fund
                    vigilante action that protects the vulnerable groups. They stage robberies on their own property and
                    secretly send the “stolen goods” to sick houses and charities. These patriars know that to act
                    openly is to invite scorn from their peers, which may edge them out of alliances and deals that
                    could strengthen their standing. Worse, it makes them targets for corrupt elite who prefer the
                    city’s divisions as they are.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="fb3cedba-0415-4607-aa7c-20214456e703">Some good-hearted but naive patriars
                    have been known to venture into the Lower City and even the Outer City to volunteer with the
                    disadvantaged or share their wealth. Even in disguise, though, these nobles are usually quickly
                    identified and become targets of the Guild or other criminals. More than one patriar on a mission of
                    mercy has disappeared into the Lower City, never to be seen again.</p>

                    Gate is perfectly situated for its role as a commercial hub. Craftspeople, merchants, traders, and
                    smugglers all make a brisk living in the city, and many immigrants are drawn by the dream that

                    making their way north or south mean that Baldur’s Gate boasts one of the most expansive markets in
                    the west. Coin trumps morals in Baldur’s Gate, with profit being the ultimate good. As a result,
                    nearly anything can be bought and sold in the city’s shops, whether it be rare jewels, magic
                    weapons, secrets, alliances, or even murder. People visit the city seeking imports from Port
                    Nyanzaru, verdigris-covered treasures dredged from the sea, blackmail information on political
                    rivals, or custom-brewed poisons.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="50fe44bb-a37a-43f4-9fac-215f41afa0f6">Though the city has laws regarding the
                    sale of stolen property, smuggling, and contract killing, such crimes are rarely reported and even
                    more rarely enforced. Unless the complainant is a patriar or other powerful individual, law
                    enforcement lacks the time and interest to pursue those engaging in mutually beneficial
                    transactions. The unwritten law is do nothing that interferes with the city’s economy and make your
                    bargains in peace. Individuals who suffer due to morally questionable contracts must seek out
                    private means of obtaining justice.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="591d5f0c-bb66-456d-949d-5791e6714d5c">Craftspeople and merchants organize in
                    professional guilds and follow official charters. Unofficial guilds are technically illegal, but in
                    the Outer City, such informal guilds are common.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="6b27c074-b05a-4ea6-999d-0b96aff49567">Most professional guilds operate in the
                    Lower City, but prefer to provide their goods to the wealthy patriar families of the Upper City.
                    Commoners grumble that they can’t even buy from their own neighbors, with the choicest items and
                    freshest food traveling up the hill. A laborer might toil all day at a fishmonger’s shop, then be
                    forced to take their pay to the Outer City and buy yesterday’s catch from an unlicensed seller.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="ce13f8b5-95ea-4060-b141-e37db1d880b2">In many cases, guilds intersect with
                    crews. Such groups take an interest in their members beyond a professional level, working to assure
                    that they’re safe on the streets and at home so they can return to work the next morning. Those who
                    mistreat a guild member might find themselves ostracized by all members of that profession, or even
                    find themselves cornered by members of the guild’s associated crew, their most menacing tools of the
                    trade in hand.</p>

                    whatever deities they wish, so long as they refrain from violent acts and practices that disrupt
                    trade. While multiple temples rise within the city walls, hundreds of tiny shrines sit along the
                    twisted streets of the Outer City.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="dda296fe-71c4-4302-885d-bbef6d812120">In the city proper, worship centers
                    around a handful of well-known and generally respectable deities. Most established temples, with
                    clergy and daily rituals, are in the Upper City, which precludes commoners from worshiping after
                    dark, when only residents are allowed to remain in the Upper City. Since most commoners work during
                    the day, their faith usually becomes secondary in their lives. Ostentatious adherence to religious
                    rituals is seen as a privilege of the wealthy. Some Baldurians even think outwardly displaying one’s
                    faith is a sign of pretentiousness and insincerity.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="2f379ff4-bad6-4552-a5d6-4aede082d5bd">Bane (the Lord of Tyranny), Bhaal (the
                    Lord of Murder), and Myrkul (the Lord of Bones) make up the Dead Three. While these deities have
                    lost much of their power, their faiths still command respect and fear throughout Baldur’s Gate.
                    While open worship of the Dead Three is frowned upon in Baldur’s Gate, their worship is not illegal
                    — so long as worship remains within the laws. Every now and then, rumors surface that a powerful
                    political figure is a Bhaalspawn (see "<a href="#Bhaalspawn"

                    almost always prove to be smear campaigns with no basis in truth — though, in some cases, such

                    walls of the temple, clergy members are permitted to brew experimental potions and elixirs, build
                    and test mechanical constructs, and hire locals to participate in controlled experiments — all in

                    prayers to the Vigilant One are many. Members of the Watch and the Flaming Fist, mercenaries,
                    bodyguards, and the fearful pray for Helm’s protection at his shrine, the Watchful Shield, located
                    in the Upper City. Patriars who see themselves as protectors of the common folk pray to Helm for
                    guidance as well.</p>

                    self-styled “protectors of the innocent” leave Helm’s holy symbol on the bodies of dead criminals,

                    feel their existence is one of secret torment and suffering. The idea that pain has nobility to it —
                    that there can be a divine reason behind the trials that face Baldurians — comforts many.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="06eec10f-779b-4d30-b468-6103682992aa">Some patriars spread word of Ilmater’s
                    faith not out of devotion, but to control their lessers. If people believe their suffering is
                    worthy, they are less likely to demand safer conditions, higher pay, or more rights. In recent
                    memory, cryptic notes have appeared on the gates of patriar estates, warning that “those who falsely
                    champion the Crying God will find their own suffering multiplied.”</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="adfbbe15-9e4e-4c28-a6cd-e3242009ab86">Long ago, many nobles of Baldur’s Gate
                    worshiped Siamorphe. Legend tells that her temple was a wonder to behold, its nave decorated with
                    crests of the most powerful ruling families of the time. A secret vault contained signet rings,
                    family trees, and copies of important decrees, holding them in case of some calamity.</p>

                    beneath a patriar home or even a different temple. Urban treasure hunters, desperate politicians,

                    luck, hoping the goddess recognizes their boldness and daring. Evildoers who work outside the Guild

                    A great deal of illegal trade passes through the harbor in small crafts on moonless nights, and
                    smugglers — particularly of dangerous beasts and kidnapped souls — know to drop a few coins into the
                    water as they pass into the harbor to appease Umberlee.</p>

                    from the sea, she expresses her displeasure to the clergy by sending them omens, urging the priests
                    to advise the finder to return the plundered item to the depths at once — or else.</p>

                    Fearsome creatures hunt along cobbled streets, and the worship of evil deities continues to rise.

                    data-content-chunk-id="d38cf82d-7e6c-4363-ab26-81b1fe08bc9f"><a href="#TheGuild"
                        data-content-chunk-id="72a6331c-1b4b-4165-be4f-b7cbbad61901"></a>The Guild</h3>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="bbf7a586-5f27-47b2-a673-b17b7fe401f3">The organization known simply as the
                    Guild unites cutpurses, loan sharks, killers, thugs, con artists, grave robbers, cat burglars, and
                    every other type of criminal in the city. The Guild operates under the noses of the Watch and the
                    Flaming Fist by adroitly keeping its illicit activities quiet.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="52213847-dbff-4ce1-be5e-a4de512666fe">Each city neighborhood falls under
                    control of one or more kingpins, crime bosses who report to the head of the Guild. These kingpins
                    style themselves as elite criminals, often adopting memorable nicknames and distinctively decadent
                    dress. Scores of common criminals work beneath each kingpin, with the most competent and cutthroat
                    members rising to favored status.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="78e5a68b-0684-4bba-baa6-80c195339f1a">Some kingpins keep strictly to the
                    shadows, but others operate more openly. Particularly in the Outer City, citizens often know their
                    local kingpin. A kingpin might receive requests for help from citizens, asking for loans or dealing
                    with unauthorized crime, such as a thieving neighbor. A kingpin tracks these favors and debts,
                    calling them in when it suits them — often with interest.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="35a57c58-ed5a-48eb-aa7e-ee53a9d82fd7">Rivalries exist between kingpins, and
                    their territorial borders shift constantly. As long as these internal feuds don’t disrupt Guild
                    business or draw the attention of the authorities, no one interferes. Recent rumors claim that an
                    Outer City kingpin known as Straightstick is calling in all his favors to make a move on a Lower
                    City turf. Crossing the wall is riskier than the average power play, and those in the know predict
                    the coming conflict to be a bloody one.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="68c817ba-bb6a-452f-97b2-28a2e6cdfed2">Guild operations in the Outer City
                    center on smuggling and gambling. Some violent crime and theft occur, but for the most part, Outer
                    City residents are too poor to draw the attention of the Guild. Travelers and visitors do fall
                    victim to pickpocketing, muggings, and assault, though. As the Flaming Fist rarely comes to the
                    district, the Guild has long operated with impunity. In recent years, though, the interference of
                    vigilantes and hired adventurers has been on the rise.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="dcdaea28-33bf-49ac-8308-d78dc90870b9">The Lower City serves as the heart of
                    the Guild’s operations. The locals here have enough money to make burglary and protection schemes
                    worthwhile, and the Flaming Fist is spread too thin to address every instance of petty crime. The
                    Guild’s operations widen to numerous commercial ventures, such as gambling dens, animal fights,
                    races, and brawling tournaments. Their traffickers also maintain routes into other districts, and
                    guide individuals and illicit trade through them for a fee. Those who oppose the Guild — typically
                    by going to the Flaming Fist — invite retaliation upon themselves and their neighbors. This makes
                    most folk afraid to report crimes and pressures their neighbors to keep quiet as well.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="76eeb109-6159-448b-9e3a-f1a95e384ff8">In the Upper City, the Guild engages in
                    burglary, extortion, blackmail, and confidence games. Patriars might even hire Guild members to gain
                    (or plant) information about their rivals, involving the Guild in Upper City politics.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="aa2301c0-1678-4c23-a365-f07834b804cf">Only the most talented criminals dare to
                    burgle patriar estates, but the lower ranks of a kingpin’s operation often work as pickpockets or
                    try to con residents of the district. Here, the Watch zealously monitors for Guild activities and
                    targets anyone threatening the peace. Kingpins can often come to an agreement with the Watch,
                    though, offering bribes so that Watch officers look the other way. Every month, the kingpin makes
                    their payment to the Watch and selects a new safe word. Guild members caught by the Watch utter the
                    safe word to avoid arrest. Rival kingpins and unaffiliated criminals looking to work in the Upper
                    City pay well for the month’s safe word, though any member of the Guild found selling the
                    information faces harsh punishment.</p>

                        Keene</a>, disdains flashy garb and illusion magic. She appears to the world as she is: an
                    unassuming woman of middling age and build. Her forgettable looks have proven her greatest asset as
                    a thief, as her victims have trouble recognizing her even when they meet her again face-to-face.
                    Keene’s leadership over the years earned her a reputation of thoughtful pragmatism. When necessary,
                    she seeks revenge for offenses against the Guild — provided doing so is profitable. Her methods are
                    vicious when necessary, and she is as feared as she is respected.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="fce97442-5150-4de3-9dbb-29dc67161ceb">Keene has become increasingly intolerant
                    of the populous tide turning against her organization. While the occasional rabble-rouser has always
                    impeded criminal business, the rise of organized crews and vigilantes is interfering with Guild
                    operations. After a carefully coordinated attack on a patriar’s estate fell to pieces when a
                    vigilante clumsily alerted the estate guards, Keene declared open season on do-gooders of all
                    stripes.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="188a6f08-3e9a-4935-b13a-5b7a8fd05ddb">The plots of patriars and the schemes of
                    Guild operatives fill the gossip and whispers of Baldur’s Gate. Yet, throughout the city, no names
                    are as synonymous with dastardly acts as those of Dead Three. The demigods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul
                    walk among mortals, personally seeking followers to their cause. More than once, it’s rumored, the
                    trio has even trod the streets of Baldur’s Gate.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="824c6e3b-df74-4081-b686-f63fb51f4417">Nefarious patriars whisper prayers to
                    Bane when they seek to gain power through coercion, intimidation, and forceful exaction of the law.
                    Gang leaders, evil mercenaries, and others who rely on fear and control, also pay homage to Bane.
                    Those who want to evoke dominance and ruthlessness favor wearing black gloves — a nod to Bane’s holy
                    symbol.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="3ea4d610-2299-45fb-9c44-4979ae7b166b">Myrkul claims a following among those
                    who wish to learn from or command the dead. Those who plunder tombs for lost knowledge, grim
                    entrepreneurs who see business sense in undead servants, even pragmatic necromancers seeking to
                    conjure secrets from the wealthy dead of Cliffside Cemetery all whisper prayers to Myrkul. Of the
                    Dead Three, Myrkul’s base of power is the smallest. Residents of Baldur’s Gate rarely fear death by
                    old age — a grim fact of living in such a dangerous city. As a result, few desperate elders seek the
                    blessing of the Lord of Bones. Those who do, though, tend to be both cagey and wealthy, which means
                    that although Myrkul’s worshipers are small in number, their resources have hidden depths.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="7d2f7b42-881e-442b-b8e0-b1f5d37480d5">Since the time when the Bhaalspawn
                    Sarevok plotted to start a war between Baldur’s Gate and Amn as a path to claiming Bhaal’s power,
                    awareness of the Lord of Murder’s children has grown. Baldur’s Gate maintains a grim draw for
                    Bhaalspawn, whether due to some foul influence in the city itself, or merely because of Sarevok’s
                    lingering reputation.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="e73c69cb-dcc4-4392-b5bc-7b5439dd14db">At the same time, worship of Bhaal
                    proves darkly popular in Baldur’s Gate. Few openly admit to worshiping the Lord of Murder, but there
                    is an unspoken assumption that anyone who benefits from violent death has some respect for Bhaal.
                    Assassination and murder underpin many of the plots in the city, from the business of highly-paid
                    killers on patriar payrolls to slayings of opportunity committed by Outer City fanatics. Such
                    bloodthirsty faithful rarely gather in numbers, but they typically mark themselves by carving a
                    fresh gouge on their thumbs — spilling their blood in Bhaal’s name while creating a subtle mark
                    identifying that identifies them among allies. Despite the Lord of Murder’s decentralized worship,
                    some believe a temple to Bhaal exists near or under the city, possibly in an ancient chamber beneath
                    the sewers or carved into Dusthawk Hill. Rumor holds that eleven red crystals on the wall of the
                    temple grow brighter with every murder committed, gathering power for either Bhaal or one of his
                    future chosen. Some claim that Bhaal himself regularly visits the temple, his presence contributing
                    to the city’s high murder rate.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="d65a2d12-501f-4509-8b0c-4576818d9c51">While the Dead Three occupy a prominent
                    place in Baldurians’ fears, their faiths currently have only the shallowest roots in the city.
                    Followers of the Dead Three have done more to incite dread than faith. As a result, their numbers
                    remain relatively small. Their sinister reputations outstrip their actual influence, though, with
                    gossip spreading quickly whenever the deities’ ominous symbols appear in graffiti or the Flaming
                    Fist cracks down on overzealous fanatics. Despite public fears and resistance from law enforcement,
                    the cults of the Dead Three persist, causing many to darkly wonder why the servants of Bane, Bhaal,
                    and Myrkul hold such interest in Baldur’s Gate.</p>
                <aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="ProminentGuildKingpins">
                    <p>Prominent Guild Kingpins</p>
                    <p>All Guild operations are overseen by kingpins, a handful of which are described below.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Goblin Behnie.</em></strong> Most are surprised to find Goblin Behnie looks nothing
                        like his name or monstrous reputation suggest, the Bloomridge kingpin being a tall,
                        polished-looking gentleman in his early thirties. The name comes from his ferocious ego, wild
                        rages, and a propensity for biting off the fingers of those who disappoint him. Behind his
                        viciousness, though, Goblin Behnie has a keen eye, making him and his forgers the city’s best
                        source of illicit Watch tokens (for passage into the Upper City), visitor licenses, and docking
                        permits.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Straightstick.</em></strong> The kingpin of the Twin Songs Faithless runs one of the
                        city’s best smuggling operations, slipping goods into the city along the Chionthar River and
                        over Dusthawk Hill. The seventy-year-old claims to have been attacked by the infamous (and
                        doubtfully real) Ol’ Cholms, a giant snapping turtle rumored to sleep at the bottom of Gray
                        Harbor. To prove his story, Straightstick uses a splinted old ferry pole as a crutch. Recently,
                        the kingpin has grown bitter about his position, believing he deserves a territory within
                        Baldur’s Gate proper. He’s planning an attack on Brampton, the destination of much of his
                        smuggling and the territory of his ex-wife, Diamond Urchin.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>The Whiskey Lady.</em></strong> Few know that the last true heir of the Raddle
                        patriar family died several years ago. Despite this, “Dowager Raddle” continues to throw lavish
                        social events at her estate, though she never personally attends. Instead, her supposed relative
                        welcomes guests, engaging them with sharp wit, hard liquor, political gossip, and political
                        opportunities of “gray” legality. No one seem to know their host’s name, though — a faux pas
                        none would ever admit. As a result, the Manorborn neighborhood’s politically active Guild
                        kingpin is known only as the Whiskey Lady.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="64f479b6-25d7-4373-b9f3-b48817c0cfab">Blackmail and theft pay well, but murder
                    is the preferred tool of the ambitious. Murder silences witnesses, disposes of enemies, and clears
                    the path to power. Assassins never lack for work in Baldur’s Gate.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="d54e27b5-b8ed-4c11-95e0-b33125fa8f75">In the Outer City, murder is practically
                    a way of life. With neither the Watch nor the Flaming Fist to look after residents, criminals run
                    free in the sprawling district. Criminals use murder to keep order among their ranks and remove
                    threats to their organization. So-called “snuff streets” hold the bodies of the dead, dumped by
                    their murderers in piles along the lane. The most desperate of Outer City residents prowl the snuff
                    streets, hoping to find a missed copper piece or a salvageable boot to pawn. They strip the teeth
                    from bodies, cut off hair that might fetch a coin, and sometimes — it is rumored — slice flesh from
                    the corpses to stave off starvation. Recent reports of ghoul activity in the Outer City likely have
                    their origins in these snuff streets.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="5810e6f6-6a71-459c-8ae8-9fc635942c76">In the Lower City, murder is less common
                    but remains a threat. Long-time residents know to travel in groups after dark. Those looking to earn
                    a few coins sometimes linger outside of taverns, hiring out as escorts for drunken patrons. Revelers
                    can stay as late as they wish and still get home safely, provided they hire someone trustworthy to
                    guard their trip home.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="a79851d0-c5b5-4774-9d56-094c88f6eef4">Most murders in the Lower City have
                    reasons behind them. The merchant found with his throat cut and pockets emptied, the husband
                    murdered so his wife can marry her young mistress, the tyrannical shop owner stabbed by a desperate
                    underling — residents understand these crimes. What frightens people are the senseless murders. The
                    man found ripped to pieces with his pockets still full of gold, the woman slaughtered so viciously
                    that her grieving husband is sent to the asylum, the shop owner who suddenly strikes down his
                    faithful clerk — these are the crimes that lead to panic and wild rumors.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="5fa02e6c-82e3-4754-b5be-86477dde5a75">Some commoners claim that something
                    about the city itself sparks violence in its citizens. A popular theory is that the spirits of the
                    vicious pirates that once sailed the harbors still influence the city. Another is that the spirit of
                    the long-executed serial murderer Alhasval Drenz, the Whitkeep Whistler, still stalks the city,
                    possessing innocents to continue her unmatched killing spree. <a class="sourcebook"

                <p data-content-chunk-id="db37cbd4-7cbc-4875-89e0-55954418e33c">It’s unclear whether the rise of Bhaal’s
                    faith in Baldur’s Gate stems from the frequency of murders, or if the murders spring from the
                    worship of Bhaal. The Flaming Fist suspects a group of Bhaal worshipers behind a spate of recent
                    similar murders, the victims stabbed to death and their own blood dribbled like a crown around their
                    heads. The Fist’s investigations have not yet resulted in an arrest, but officers suspect the
                    murderers to be commoners with seemingly unremarkable lives covering their true, bloodthirsty
                    natures.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="73da93ab-06ef-4773-bee9-9b7074a7fa86">In the Upper City, murder brings
                    results. Muggings and crimes of opportunity are rare here. The Watch keeps Upper City residents safe
                    from criminals and riffraff. The biggest threat to patriars are other patriars.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="7e8571df-08b4-47a6-8217-251af234b4f4">Bribery and blackmail can secure votes
                    or sway an allegiance temporarily, but murder permanently changes the makeup of the Parliament of
                    Peers. Several elite assassins exclusively take on political targets. The Watch puts little effort
                    into tracking down expert assassins, knowing that arresting one means possibly exposing a whole
                    cadre of powerful patriars. The wrath that would fall on the Watch isn’t worth putting one assassin
                    in the cells.</p>

                    Regardless of what district one might be visiting, certain features are impossible to ignore, like
                    the wash of Gray Harbor, the shadows of Dusthawk Hill, or the gates that contribute to the city’s

                        data-content-chunk-id="73484771-6886-4744-8b13-1af31befe93b"></a>The Gates</h3>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="664a13a5-9567-4705-8e5d-a34b736db322">Nine gates separate the districts of
                    Baldur’s Gate, providing the only points of entry to pass from the Upper City to the Lower City, or
                    from the walled city proper to the Outer City and the wider world beyond. Baldurians, particularly
                    if they do not wish to reveal a crew or family affiliation to a potentially hostile audience, often
                    describe themselves by the nearest gate to their homes. Terms like “Gondgater” and “Dragongater” are
                    widely understood as neighborhood identities, and are also understood as a way of eliding more
                    troublesome connections.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="d6083eae-eb2d-4786-a8d1-a7173c3363ed">The Watch guards gates leading to the
                    Upper City, while the Flaming Fist oversees the rest. Guards assigned to Baldur’s Gate and Black
                    Dragon Gate stay at sharp attention and seldom accept bribes. Those assigned to the smaller and more
                    secluded gates, however, can be less attentive, particularly when distracted by jingling coins.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="91767d85-1ece-4026-a7d9-04ddbe26cfc7">Anyone entering the city must pay a
                    nominal entry toll of 5 cp. While this is a small sum, it ensures that the truly destitute remain
                    outside, consigned to the slums of the Outer City. Beggars and refugees crowd at the fringes of
                    these slums, typically around Black Dragon Gate and Basilisk Gate, pleading for money to pay the
                    toll and hoping that the guards won’t drive them off for annoying more prosperous travelers.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="06dba6b9-2e60-4733-b110-95cbb106e251">When the city is not under lockdown,
                    merchants pour through the external gates from morning till night, while peddlers, delivery
                    carriers, and servants move in equally swift streams through the inner gates. Toll collectors work
                    quickly but methodically to inspect incoming and outgoing trade goods, ensuring that commerce flows
                    smoothly and the city gets its share at every turn.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="06ae575a-cb9a-4bca-bfc6-75b265e895ba">The city gates are closed at night. At
                    dusk, the Watch evicts anyone from the Upper City who is not a patriar, bearing a patriar’s livery
                    or permission letter, or carrying a Watch-issued token. The enforcement of this rule is one of the
                    means by which the Upper City reinforces its snobbery over the other districts. More than one Lower
                    City merchant visiting an Upper City restaurant or theater near sundown has been embarrassed by a
                    Watch member’s loud, public caution that the gates are about to close. While being seen hurrying
                    toward the gates is an obvious embarrassment, being caught and escorted out would be far more
                    bruising — both to one’s ego and body.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="fdd585b0-6baa-41fe-9ef5-9f4a2dc4c168">The nightly closing of the gates
                    ostensibly keeps the patriars safe. Closing off the Upper City pushes street crime into poorer
                    neighborhoods, or out of the city altogether. In the Upper City, patriars can walk down alleys with
                    relatively little fear, but beyond its well-lit streets and tightly watched gates, the other
                    districts become much more dangerous after dark.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="fc999008-4271-49d4-b6fe-383e75a14e30">One of the largest and deepest harbors
                    on Faerûn’s western coast, Gray Harbor is also one of the busiest. The city’s independence and
                    general laissez-faire attitude toward the types of goods and people flowing through its port — so
                    long as the government gets its cut — means that the harbor throngs with both honest captains
                    conducting forthright trade and pirate crews looking to fence their wares. Plenty of sailors also
                    make their homes nearby in the Lower City.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="a122f7b7-dd84-4398-9c36-acb7f182c534">The harbor’s most immediately striking
                    feature is its machinery, with dozens of enormous cranes and countless powered scoops and cargo
                    carts dramatically accelerating the loading and unloading process. Though designed by the Church of
                    Gond, these marvels are run by the Harborhands, the most powerful crew in the city thanks to the
                    dockworkers’ ability to shut off the city’s economic lifeblood with a strike. Managing the whole
                    affair is Harbormaster Darus Kelinoth, a lawful neutral male human <a

                    who runs the port’s operations and taxation from a small, heavily fortified brick building set well
                    apart from other structures.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="d0d4e1cd-0750-42c4-b425-c8584d9af5f9">The port itself is a tangle of piers,
                    floating docks, and anchorages, from the massive Freighter’s Finger pier catering to the heaviest
                    barges to the more ordinary slips at Northtree or Commonsdock. Not actually attached to shore, the
                    chaotic Flotilla is the city’s cheapest long-term moorage option, where boats are welcome to raft
                    together around common anchor buoys, and where some houseboats haven’t moved in generations. A
                    special division of the Flaming Fist called the Gray Wavers patrols the harbor, yet it’s no secret
                    that the more expensive docks are safer than the budget options. Sailors and even whole ships have
                    been known to go missing in Gray Harbor, and while some assume such disappearances are the result of
                    local shore-based pirates, others speak of Ol’ Cholms, a mysterious sea beast capable of dragging
                    ships down to the river’s lightless bottom.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="25b28320-d618-4705-ae3f-dadff86ecf38">East of the city, high above the
                    scattered slums and cut-rate inns that stretch along the trade road, rises the steep yellow granite
                    of Dusthawk Hill. This cliff-skirted hill is one of the last known refuges of the Chionthar dusthawk
                    (use the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16920-hawk"
                        data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16920-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">hawk</a>
                    statistics), a once-common raptor whose numbers precipitously declined over the last century as
                    regional turmoil and the ever-spreading slums outside Baldur’s Gate consumed its habitat.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="ae4b2165-a33f-47af-abdc-4d23eded1d4c">Local legend holds that the dusthawk was
                    Balduran’s favorite hunting bird, and that the Chionthar population is descended from his own
                    personal hunting hawks. When the dukes of Baldur’s Gate realized that the dusthawk was on the verge
                    of extinction, they declared the hill, which included both the hawks’ cliffside nests and their
                    hunting grounds, to be off limits to unlicensed hunters. Despite the fences and cliffs that cordon
                    off most of the hill, trespassers remain common, the demand for dusthawk hunting birds having
                    exploded among the wealthy.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="c6138fe9-761e-4075-a6c1-5c726ff670ba">Many in the Outer City resent the hill
                    being turned into private land. Several camps and slums were cleared as a result, their dwellers
                    losing everything. The homeless resent the patriars for being willing to spend money giving hawks a
                    home, but not them. Others resent the Flaming Fist guards who keep them from trapping on the hill.
                    Stringy rabbits and scrawny quail made poor meals, but they were meals, and now many hunters have
                    none.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="92f380b6-e348-4ffe-90f5-9c503adf3e71">Rumors hold that werewolves lair in the
                    sea caves under Dusthawk Hill, pretending to be ordinary smugglers — or ordinary animals — while
                    plotting against the city. Whenever a grisly murder captures Baldurians’ imaginations, someone is
                    always quick to claim that it must be one of the Dusthawk werewolves who did the deed.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="eba44111-698f-4b9b-83f3-9cafc2bbd8ba">The Upper City, home to the patriar
                    aristocracy of Baldur’s Gate, is a place of beauty and splendor, where magnificent public sculptures
                    stand alongside historic manors, upscale theaters and boutiques, and tiny stone-walled gardens
                    tucked among the streets like hidden jewels. Flowers bloom along the tree-lined streets, ushering
                    away any stray miasma that escapes from the less fortunate quarters below. Silks and velvets, gold
                    braid and mink, water-clear diamonds and luminous pearls: these are common sights in the Upper City,
                    and hardly glimpsed elsewhere except as cheap imitations.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="3f9ccfae-ff98-4f4c-9b99-cefc0e8bb5f5">Everything in the Upper City speaks of
                    privilege and wealth. Magical lights illuminate the clean-swept streets, some bearing enchantments
                    that hold back the river fog. Most of the city’s major temples are located in this district,
                    flagrant evidence of how the faiths value the city’s wealthy elite over congregants with shallower
                    pockets. The finest wine shops, ateliers, and jewelers are all in the Upper City, where the Watch’s
                    nightly ritual of expelling all non-residents reinforces their air of luxurious exclusivity. Those
                    without either Watch-issued tokens or a patriars’ vouchsafe must leave at nightfall, without
                    exception.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="5201a440-ed4c-4e32-a034-a3858e8f3c1d">Residents of the Upper City feel great
                    pressure to maintain outward appearances, and will keep their estate’s facade finely maintained even
                    at the cost of pawning everything within. Admitting to poverty in this district is admitting to
                    shameful failure.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="a38e2caf-7b88-4535-961d-c8c526ef79f3">The patriars’ unabashed snobbery fosters
                    deep resentment among denizens of the Lower City and Outer City, who can see the good life enjoyed
                    before their eyes but are excluded from all but the smallest tastes. The Watch is merciless about
                    turning beggars and malcontents away from the gates, where an erratically enforced entry toll for
                    non-residents and those without Watch tokens or escorts effectively bars the poor from setting foot
                    within this district. A patriar caught outside the Upper City after dark, therefore, is at high risk
                    of robbery, beating, or worse.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="01af771f-1601-4cdb-b77b-a6a1517512fe">The Old Wall, built at Balduran’s behest
                    centuries ago, surrounds the Upper City. Six gates pierce it, channeling the district’s visitors and
                    commerce. Entering the Upper City requires either being a patriar, having a patriar’s letter or
                    livery, showing a Watch token issued to the Upper City’s residents or licensed to its few inns for
                    guest use, or paying an entry toll. Tokens and tolls are only accepted at Citadel Gate, Baldur’s
                    Gate, and the Black Dragon Gate, since the other gates are reserved for the exclusive use of
                    patriars, their servants, and their guests.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="091c70ec-24f9-4999-88a0-b574b3ef4369"><strong>Black Dragon Gate.</strong>
                    Named for the dragon’s head that a victorious knight once hung upon its arch, the Black Dragon Gate
                    faces the road heading north toward distant Waterdeep. The original dragon’s head is long gone, but
                    a stone replacement snarls above the gate’s arch. Local legend claims that the stone head will
                    magically spew acid at attackers if the city should ever fall under siege.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="7c22038a-e5a2-4169-9668-f2cbe5e9b257"><strong>Citadel Gate.</strong> The only
                    entrance to the Watch’s fortress, Citadel Gate nestles into the Upper City’s landward wall. The
                    Watch maintains a small cavalry, nominally for defense and crowd control, but primarily for parades,
                    honor escorts, and other ceremonial functions. Because of this, the Citadel maintains the only
                    stable within the city walls.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="8b5992b1-f3fa-4731-8872-3f2ffd78006a"><strong>Patriar Gates.</strong> The four
                    gates known collectively as the patriar gates — Gond Gate, Heap Gate, Manor Gate, and Sea Gate — are
                    smaller and are generally not accessible by the general public. They were built after the
                    construction of the Lower City walls and were intended to offer patriars convenient access from
                    their homes to their business concerns and back. Privately funded by the patriars, and thus serving
                    as a display of their personal success, these gates are more ornate and tightly guarded than the
                    public gates. Officially, none may use them without bearing a patriar’s livery or letter of
                    permission, although rumors persist that Guild kingpins and veteran servants among several patriar
                    staffs know exactly which guards to bend. Regardless, the visible double standard imposed at these
                    gates is a constant gall to Lower City residents forced to take longer routes through the public
                    gates because they cannot use the ones in their own neighborhoods.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="e77dbcd5-bc0a-4cfe-b82f-6bc8c4b1c742">While most outsiders see only rampant
                    luxury among the Upper City’s streets, the district’s residents perceive a wide spectrum of style
                    and status. Wealth and taste as much as location serve to divide the Upper City into a variety of
                    distinct neighborhoods.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="92ba1732-12de-4f3d-ba1c-17d888886b82"><strong>Citadel Streets.</strong> The
                    northern part of the Upper City is dominated by the Watch Citadel, where the Watch conducts
                    training, maintains its barracks and stable, and keeps a few jail cells. Beyond the Citadel, this
                    neighborhood includes many shops and the comparatively modest, though still grand, houses that
                    belong to the few non-patriar residents of the Upper City.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="e75d9417-9d98-4803-8136-867eadfadc7a"><strong>Manorborn.</strong> The most
                    palatial residences lie on the Upper City’s west side. Most of the Parliament of Peers live here, as
                    do the old, proud families who trace their lineages back to Balduran’s day. Climbing gardens,
                    fountained courtyards, and private orchards adorn many of these elegant homes.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="cfb5af04-8842-466c-9b1c-8807e97533ad"><strong>Temples.</strong> Grand
                    cathedrals and shrines shape the skyline in this central neighborhood, with Gond’s High House of
                    Wonders foremost among them. Priests in ceremonial finery and congregants dressed for the public eye
                    are a common sight in this part of the city. Humbler petitioners are rare, though some come doggedly
                    day after day, paying the tolls for hope each time.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="4663bf5c-e027-47d5-bcee-a3a344fefb5e"><strong>The Wide.</strong> The primary
                    market and largest civic space in Baldur’s Gate is the Wide, where sellers set up their stalls and
                    put out their wares each day at dawn. Street music and noisy performances are forbidden, and every
                    night the sellers who are not Upper City residents must pack up and leave. Bustling by day, the Wide
                    is desolate at night, except on holidays and when hosting grand celebrations.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="40d7f62c-2c0c-4d12-80f1-b399d0654963">The original wall built during
                    Balduran’s day, which encloses the Upper City and separates it from the Lower City, occupies an
                    outsize place in the city’s history and imagination. As the original relic of the city’s first
                    borders — and, more importantly for daily life, the physical embodiment of the division between
                    patriars and ordinary citizens — the Old Wall is a symbol for much that Baldurians both admire and
                    resent about their city.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="b339bc72-f721-4a5a-9c1a-0dc8fa039fdc">Most of the Old Wall was rebuilt
                    following revolts early in the city’s history, then reinforced during every major period of tumult
                    that troubled Baldur’s Gate afterward. Each push for renewal saw a conflict between Gondan engineers
                    advocating for new building techniques and materials, and patriars and preservationists striving to
                    protect the original architecture. Meanwhile, smugglers and Guild agents bribed building crews,
                    altered blueprints, and otherwise put their fingers in the plans at every turn to steer
                    reinforcement efforts away from their own secret passageways or induce builders to make new ones.
                </p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="d0cadeb8-2fbc-4197-a8fb-fb0c32b49ae4">After centuries of such unreliable
                    maintenance, the Old Wall stands proud and strong, but only outwardly so. In truth, the barrier is
                    riddled with numerous secret holes through — or, more often, underneath — its stones. Knowledge of
                    such secret passages’ locations is jealously guarded, and the hidden ways are used only sparingly,
                    for the risk of discovery is too great to use them routinely. Nevertheless, if the Old Wall were
                    ever to be seriously tested, its defenders might find it far less impenetrable than it seems.</p>

                    <p>Green Lights in the Fog</p>
                    <p>Baldur’s Gate has a couple interesting features not mentioned elsewhere in this gazetteer.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Fog.</em></strong> One of the reasons why pirates find Gray Harbor attractive is the
                        thick fog that shrouds the river, the docks, and most of the Lower City. The persistent fog
                        makes it easy to conduct illicit business or commit a murder without anyone catching sight of
                        the “interaction” through a spyglass. The fog sometimes creeps into the Upper City as well, but
                        here it’s much too thin to veil crimes.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Green Lights.</em></strong> In Baldur’s Gate, lit lanterns fitted with panes of green
                        glass are hung outside of permanent establishments to indicate that they’re open for business.
                        On foggy nights, these lanterns cast the city’s lively taverns, dance halls, and fest halls in
                        eerie green light.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="f36cabd7-1f08-4506-8fbc-158e1a7f2faa">The great houses of the patriars are the
                    wellspring of their pride and the center of high society. A manor stands as proof that the family
                    held anchor in Baldur’s Gate when the Old Wall was raised, and that its line has remained prosperous
                    and unbroken since. Even on the rare occasion that a patriar manor changes hands entirely, the new
                    owner generally goes to great lengths to prove — or fabricate — some connection, however tenuous, to
                    the previous holder’s line.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="914f96c8-651e-4a7e-a9a4-c9ba6d01e090">Most patriar manors are townhomes rather
                    than free-standing mansions, for the Upper City has always been constrained by its walls, and even
                    the wealthiest families are limited to narrow footprints. In general, patriar manors have only small

                <p data-content-chunk-id="75a3ebea-7116-4d4e-ab14-8495c6a0343d">Because of the manors’ storied pasts and
                    small spaces, most manors are crowded with heirlooms and treasures accumulated across generations.
                    Occasionally, however, a manor’s grand facade hides destitution. Estates are expensive to maintain,
                    and dynasties are prone to decline. Although no patriar would ever openly admit to lacking money,
                    quite a few are hunting marriages with wealthy outsiders who might bring an influx of capital and
                    ambition to their moribund lines.</p>

                    Bormul House is an elegant three-story townhouse of yellow granite and slate with cream-colored
                    roses climbing its garden walls. Last spring, a distant uncle came for a holiday visit, bringing a
                    large load of baggage. The house servants acted strangely during his visit, though the Bormuls
                    attributed this to a bout of shellfish poisoning that afflicted many households that spring. Days
                    later, the uncle departed, leaving some of his curios behind. The Bormuls, lacking space to store
                    these unwanted things in the manor, moved them to the family crypt beneath the house. There they lie
                    now, largely forgotten.</p>

                    likes to extend invitations to hopeful social climbers from other districts, intending to trap them
                    at her parties. Lacking Watch tokens, Nysene’s guests face a night in the Citadel’s cells or worse
                    if they’re caught in the Upper City after dark. They therefore have little choice but to let her and
                    her friends make cruel sport of them until they can escape at daybreak. As yet, none of Nysene’s
                    playthings have suffered any real harm, but her games grow ever bolder and more vicious, and it’s
                    only a matter of time until someone is seriously hurt.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="fce02c03-d62d-475b-bcbd-4953472a8736">While Nysene’s siblings — Dolandre,
                    Rusorra, and Trenteller — view this behavior as embarrassing and unworthy of her station, they also
                    don’t care enough to stop her, since the victims are social inferiors whose welfare isn’t worth
                    interrupting their own revels. It’s also likely that her siblings are in denial about the true
                    extent of their sister’s sadism. Some of the city’s evil faiths have begun to take notice of
                    Nysene’s games, however, with Bane’s faith seeing a talent worth cultivating in Eomane House.</p>

                    quasi-religious museum for the magnificent inventions wrought in Gond’s name. Unlike the similarly
                    named High House of Wonders, which serves as both temple and workshop housing working prototypes not
                    yet ready for public view, the Hall of Wonders is meant to showcase Gond’s perfected inspirations.
                    It holds marvels ranging from lockboxes cleverly disguised as ordinary furniture to unparalleled
                    wonders such as a steam-operated mechanical orchestra, a steam “dragon” powering a heavy engine for
                    moving immense weights, and elaborate orreries and nautical tools. Small cards posted beneath each

                    treasure vault, guarded by clockwork monsters, lies beneath the Hall of Wonders. These tales are
                    true: beneath the grand altar in the Hall of Wonders is a complex pressure-plate system that opens a
                    secret passageway leading beneath the temple. One can follow this path to a series of safe rooms
                    secured by mechanical devices. Some safe rooms hold treasures of the faith, while others are rented
                    to wealthy individuals who wish to keep their prizes under the highest possible security.</p>

                    mixture of well-heeled but unpretentious patriars, traveling nobles, famed bards, and socially
                    ambitious Lower City residents hoping to rub shoulders with the elite. The inn is unfussy, but
                    conducts its service with flawless technique and the finest ingredients: it serves roast chicken
                    rather than peacocks or partridges, and the fish never have that distinctive Gray Harbor film.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="ff4e79e9-4860-4062-bd1d-0ada1dbac4eb">The establishment consists of two
                    buildings joined as a single enterprise. The Helm is a rooming house with an entryway shadowed by an
                    immense iron helm that supposedly belonged to a fire giant. The Cloak, slightly smaller, is signaled
                    by the bright flutter of a Sunite cloak draped over its porch. Both buildings are decorated with
                    adventuring trophies both exotic and mundane, including a bronze-horned marble unicorn bust in the
                    Helm’s common room. Its horn, which patrons often rub for good luck, is as shiny as the day it was
                    made.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="7a5960ed-e883-4608-9e40-fb2af226788d">The Helm and Cloak has long attracted
                    idealistic sons and daughters from patriar families. For generations, these young romantics, taking
                    the god Lurue as their inspiration, have called themselves the Knights of the Unicorn. Over time,
                    what began as a light-hearted lark became a real force for good in the world, and several of the
                    early knights achieved renown for their heroics. Today, the Knights of the Unicorn continue to call
                    the Helm and Cloak their informal headquarters. The establishment is even run by two retired
                    members, Vedren and Halesta (neutral good human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"

                    The couple’s presence shapes the inn’s clientele significantly, and the unicorn bust in the Helm’s
                    common room honors their origins in this place.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="89467fda-1a20-41ff-b59d-c11aad9573c1">The High Hall is the center of almost
                    all governmental activity in Baldur’s Gate. The Parliament of Peers and the Council of Four meet
                    here, and each of the four dukes has a sumptuous office and discreetly appointed meeting rooms.
                    Criminal trials, tax counts, and professional guild meetings also take place in the High Hall.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="9b660802-3156-4ac1-8569-4f69e5dc9a7f">Most criminal trials are presided over
                    by a proxy judge appointed by one of the four dukes, and most are resolved as a simple
                    administrative matter that proceeds from arraignment to sentencing within minutes. Unless an
                    impartial witness or evidence of questionable circumstances is brought to the court’s attention, the
                    word of a Flaming Fist or Watch officer suffices to convict, and the judge has only to stamp a seal
                    on the paperwork that the guards have already prepared. This results in a certain degree of
                    corruption, naturally, which is compounded by the proxy judge’s near-absolute discretion in deciding
                    whether to accept a conviction or exonerate a suspect. Bribery and influence-peddling run rife
                    through the courts, where honest judges are rare and widely feared.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="d3dc9bfe-fc34-4f8a-8175-51c2589e552c">In addition to hosting trials, the High
                    Hall holds libraries containing all local laws and ordinances, summaries of judicial decisions and
                    trial outcomes, deed records, guild charters, census tallies, and family genealogies for all the
                    noble houses and sufficiently important commoners. The records go back to the city’s founding,
                    encompassing centuries of meticulously maintained documents. The libraries don’t share a common
                    index, and sorting through their overlapping and idiosyncratically organized holdings can be
                    confusing, so most people opt to pay one of the resident librarians to locate what they need.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="71378eab-074b-4e7b-b176-af3dd4bf2168">Finally, the ground floor of the High
                    Hall’s easternmost wing contains a museum to the history of Baldur’s Gate and a mausoleum for its
                    many dukes and heroes. Statues of ancient notables, including Balduran himself, loom over caskets
                    containing their dusty bones — or, in Balduran’s case, a glass casket containing all that lingers
                    from the city’s vanished founder: the age-cracked remnants of his cloak, longsword, shield, and
                    favorite spyglass.</p>

                    observances — which most of Tymora’s faithful only attend on major holidays — the primary purpose of
                    the temple is to accept requests, and large donations, from petitioners seeking the temple’s
                    intercession. For countless reasons, Baldurians are reluctant to trust the Watch, the Flaming Fist,
                    or the Guild. When they find it necessary to seek aid from an influential organization, such people
                    often turn to Lady Luck for help. The Lady’s Hall is there to hear their pleas, and to accept their
                    offerings in exchange. While such intercession often takes the form of blessings, magical or
                    otherwise, clergy moved by a tale of exceptional injustice might be swayed to petition the church
                    elders to intercede. Such happens rarely, the church being unwilling to jeopardize its standing by
                    pitting itself against every specific injustice laid at its doorstep. Yet, members of the clergy
                    often anonymously reach out to the adventurers that congregate near their temple, sponsoring small

                    red brick in a cylindrical, pagoda-style structure, Ramazith’s Tower is considered a unique landmark
                    by some and a regrettable eyesore by others. It was built nearly a century ago by the eccentric
                    wizard Ramazith, a sailor from faraway Durpar who acquired a vast knowledge of the deeps — and
                    equally vast wealth. Ramazith had not been known as either an exceptional mariner or an exceptional
                    arcanist before he came into enough money to build his tower, and the source of his success remains
                    a mystery.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="153b99ba-0ee1-4369-affe-c8c00f1b6552">Not long after the tower was completed,
                    Ramazith died under suspicious circumstances. Some say he met his end after an ill-fated dalliance
                    with a nymph, but rumors have always persisted that his death was linked to his unlikely ascent. One
                    version holds that the nymph exacted revenge for some terrible crime Ramazith committed against her
                    people to gain his power, while another rumor suggests his soul was itself the price of his bargain.
                    Whatever the truth, Ramazith’s tower stood empty for decades before it was acquired a few years ago
                    by Lorroakan, a young and short-tempered mage known for having expensive tastes and a perpetual
                    shortage of funds. Lorroakan hails from the city of Athkatla to the south, and local gossip holds
                    that he’s a disgraced Cowled Wizard who may even be a fugitive from the powerful House Selemchant in
                    Amn.</p>

                    that suggests his mastery of magic is not extensive. This, in turn, might explain why he has not
                    reopened the tower’s upper floors, confining his own activities to the first and a small portion of
                    the second floor.</p>

                    Ramazith’s secret may have brought him to an untimely end, and that Lorroakan is himself no more
                    skilled — and perhaps significantly less so — than the tower’s previous master does not seem to
                    concern him.</p>

                    have trained with Yvandre for at least five years and have won her approval with their skill. As
                    Yvandre is a hard teacher, this is an impressive feat, and her students are justly proud. She hopes
                    that they’ll spread her name throughout the region and win acclaim for the school. In the meantime,
                    she continues to enroll young students, keeping those with promise and weeding out the rest. Some of

                    with iron-barred gates and rusty but functional locks, connect one cobbled chamber to the next. Some
                    tunnels ascend to street-level buildings, while others open through grates and sewer covers to the
                    streets themselves. At least two dozen ways into and out of the Undercellar exist, although only a

                    gang of masked toughs who call themselves the Cellarers to enforce order. This near-total absence of
                    the law makes the Undercellar a popular place of business for unsavory characters who would never
                    risk being caught in the Upper City otherwise. Their “indulgence rooms” offer gambling, intoxicants,
                    and pit fights between animals — such as giant sewer rats pitted against dog-sized spiders. Most
                    ordinary citizens who venture into the Undercellar for a taste of danger keep to these areas.</p>

                    Guild-approved secure rooms in the Undercellar, from which they deal in weapons, illicit disguises,
                    counterfeit Watch tokens, rare poisons, and other contraband. Access to these dealers requires Guild

                    through false walls in wine cellars and basements throughout the district. Some of the walls are

                    knives and bottles with deadly accuracy at unruly guests. It’s taken as an article of faith that he

                    buildings. A wide reflecting pool rests in a deep basin under its roof, which is built with
                    exceptional acoustics so that a speaker’s words project clearly and effortlessly across the
                    assembled audience. This has made the shrine a popular place for weddings, dedication ceremonies,

                    disciplines Watch soldiers accused of misdeeds — accusations that he takes very seriously and does
                    his best to investigate. High Constable Havanack is known to have no tolerance for misconduct in his
                    ranks, but he is only one person, and much escapes his notice.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="878b823e-882c-41a5-b26e-7738304bdb6a">From the Citadel, the Watch runs regular
                    patrols through the Upper City and staffs the Old Wall, day and night. Many Watch officers are
                    patriars themselves, hailing from families with a long and proud tradition of service to Baldur’s
                    Gate. As most live in the Upper City, members of the Watch are familiar with the city’s patriars and
                    possess a well-developed ability to spot pretenders. Many Watch members interact with citizens from
                    the other districts only at the gates, and then usually under tense and stressful circumstances that
                    foster jaundiced views.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="625edba3-3128-4329-88ba-ac7c56189330">Because few of its members have ever
                    lived outside their privileged walls, the Watch tends to be blind to the day-to-day hardships of
                    life outside the Upper City. Watch soldiers can be suspicious if not outright contemptuous of those
                    whose lower-class mannerisms mark them as “of poor breeding.” While most officers attempt to enforce
                    a code of civility toward all Baldurians, a current of antipathy toward the poor runs deep through
                    the Watch, though it more often manifests as condescension than outright hostility. Absent unusual
                    circumstances, the Watch always gives the benefit of the doubt to a patriar or Upper City resident,
                    and never takes an Outer City denizen’s word over anyone else’s.</p>

                    storm its gates. Although the God of Guardians and his faithful carry out their duties impartially
                    and without concern for the city’s politics, this role has nevertheless earned them considerable
                    resentment in the Outer City.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="58af7c52-e289-4381-94b4-0b8764448b26">Helm’s clerics provide healing to any

                    donation for those who suffer grievous wounds in the course of defending other. This leads to all
                    manner of unlikely stories being told at the Watchful Shield’s gates, explaining how roughed-up

                    most prominent civic space and public market. Every morning sees an influx of vendors setting up
                    their stalls and taking deliveries from a small army of porters. Every sunset, vendors cart their
                    unsold wares back out, or pay exorbitantly expensive warehouse storage fees.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="94c505e3-bb0e-4dfb-94da-0af7649dedef">In the hours between, the Wide hosts a

                    fish, furs, perfumes, and every other luxury good to be found across the continent and beyond.
                    Despite its crowds, the Wide is well regulated, the Watch keeping a sharp eye out for pickpockets.
                    Street musicians are forbidden on pain of heavy fines and expulsion from the market, so the Wide
                    proves more subdued than the chaotic markets of the Outer City. Quiet performers, such as puppeteers

                    corruption is legendary in Baldur’s Gate, but few merchants see any alternative to greasing his
                    palms, particularly as the profits from a good day’s trade vastly outweigh the losses.</p>

                    Ranger, a statue of a powerful warrior in plate mail wearing a cheerful grin and cradling a hamster
                    in his hands. Recently, though, the statue was revealed to be the Rashemi hero, Minsc, and his
                    “miniature giant space hamster” companion, Boo, trapped under the effects of petrifying magic. When
                    the magic was dispelled, it freed the heroes to walk the world once more but robbed the Wide of a
                    bit of its charm. The merchants complained loudly, and a replacement statue of Minsc and Boo was
                    promptly commissioned and set atop the pedestal where the actual heroes stood for years.</p>

                    neighborhoods plays home to the common folk of Baldur’s Gate. The Lower City is a chaotic tangle of
                    conjoined, slate-roofed buildings, its narrow cobblestone thoroughfares spanned by bridges and
                    buttresses designed to keep overflowing tenements from tumbling into the streets. As cramped and
                    noisy as the Lower City can be during the day, bustling with business from a thousand shops, the
                    district turns eerily quiet at night. Though lit by street lamps and traversed by hired lantern
                    bearers, the darkened streets are far from safe, and those citizens not running taverns or other
                    late-night establishments tend to lock their doors and bar their colorful window shutters as the
                    river’s dense fog rolls in.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="182a1908-9220-44fc-9dee-955b323453d2">Nearly everyone in the Lower City is
                    engaged in some sort of trade. Crime of all sorts is rampant, from petty smuggling to outright
                    robbery and murder. Though the city government tries to curtail this by paying the Flaming Fist to
                    patrol the streets, the mercenaries sometimes seem more like an occupying army than a true police
                    force, better suited to indiscriminate head-cracking than delicate investigation. As such, while
                    most residents are happy to shout for the Fist when beset by obvious criminals, they also band
                    together into local crews to better watch each other’s backs and settle more subtle scores. In such
                    an environment, laws are often treated as suggestions, and while most residents are just ordinary
                    folks trying to get by, there’s truth to the old adage that everyone in Baldur’s Gate has a secret
                    to keep.</p>

                    pass through the gates connecting with the Outer City, using any gate comes with a 5 cp entry toll
                    and erratic investigation of cargo and suspicious individuals.</p>

                    Basilisk Gate, Eastway is the city’s primary gateway to the Outer City and the world beyond,
                    catering to travelers with its profusion of inns, porters, and caravan supplies, as well as to Outer
                    City residents looking for reasonably priced Lower City luxuries. The flow of travelers and
                    strangers through this neighborhood makes it one of the most dangerous parts of the city, as
                    criminals prey on those unfamiliar with the city and without local ties to avenge them.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="ba162c7c-e3ee-4cea-98e6-3e1ca2c57616"><strong>Heapside.</strong> A solidly
                    middle-class neighborhood, Heapside has its share of shops but tends to be more residential,
                    catering to the city’s workforce with ancient but reasonably priced homes and only a moderate
                    likelihood of being stabbed in the street.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="0416a8d0-f459-40ca-9b07-86fab8772932"><strong>Seatower.</strong> Everything in
                    this neighborhood revolves around the <a href="#SeatowerofBalduran"

                    armorers and weaponsmiths in the city can be found here, along with residences for Fist mercenaries
                    and their families. Dance halls, fighting dens, taverns, and other delights jockey for position near
                    the fortress’s causeway, hoping to be the first place a carousing mercenary stumbles into, and each
                    Flaming Fist payday sees the neighborhood swell into the most boisterous corner of the city as
                    soldiers celebrate with riotous good cheer and flagrant street brawls.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="2b874c6c-1cbd-4b9d-aa25-ef9fe26269aa"><strong>The Steeps.</strong> As the most
                    direct route from the harbor to the Upper City via Baldur’s Gate, the Steeps has a natural advantage
                    in securing business from wealthy travelers, and many of the city’s most successful merchants
                    maintain lucrative storefronts along its dramatically steep thoroughfares. This also makes it the
                    Lower City neighborhood most likely to be visited by patriars, and thus the Steeps sees more than
                    its fair share of patrols by the Flaming Fist.</p>
                <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CrewTerritories"
                    data-content-chunk-id="c28685f8-f533-4590-ab7b-72a852c1fd63"><a href="#CrewTerritories"
                        data-content-chunk-id="1a5c86bf-9d87-4379-bb75-e9ce19f774c0"></a>Crew Territories</h3>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="94d74a2d-a393-4deb-a4ca-6bababe6e6b1">The fact that city’s numerous crews can
                    be based on both geographical and professional communities means that their territories often
                    overlap or stretch beyond the borders of any particular neighborhood. The Harborhands, for instance,
                    can be found across the Lower City wherever a neighborhood touches the water, but would rarely try
                    to flex its claim outside of the actual docks and piers. More common is the situation of groups like
                    the Greengrocers’ Guild or the Brethren of Barbers, who operate out of all corners of the city and
                    therefore claim no physical territory at all, banding together only in the interests of their trade.
                    For many such crews, there’s often no need for a formal meeting place — they meet whenever and
                    wherever necessary, in shop stockrooms or around kitchen tables, and have little interest in banners
                    and sigils.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="e47154f4-4042-4776-9a7e-4424260f5223">Still, there’s no denying that certain
                    crews dominate certain corners of the city. Sometimes this is the result of a community forming its
                    own crew in a direct attempt to control and protect its neighborhood. Such is the case with the
                    Bloomridge Dandies, wealthy merchant scions who loudly proclaim that the Flaming Fist isn’t doing
                    enough to protect their neighborhood, and who relish the opportunity to display their bravery by
                    patrolling neighborhood taverns wearing expensive swords and purple armbands. More often, physical
                    territory is the result of a citywide crew having a natural local nexus, such as the Porters’ Union
                    and the Butchers’ Block tending to dominate Eastway, as their members congregate near the Basilisk
                    Gate for easy access to the stockyards and incoming caravans.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="0ec07ee5-ac7f-411e-ab94-b6cba39ef3a1">Unless there’s active conflict between
                    two crews, most members are content to work with members of other crews, and see little point in
                    staking out physical turf. After all, a neighborhood needs many different professions to thrive —
                    carpenters and cooks, grocers and apothecaries — and the fact that siblings and spouses often belong
                    to different crews helps keep inter-crew conflict to a minimum.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="1ae0039b-e4b3-4616-ae4f-964d628654f4">Patronized by all levels of society,
                    Baldur’s Mouth is the city’s primary news service and gossip rag. Utilizing a small army of lantern
                    bearers, the Mouth spreads news both by selling broadsheets on street corners and by shouting
                    summaries of top stories at passersby. From the slums of the Outer City to the finest manor house
                    sitting rooms, the Mouth is where Baldurians go to be informed, incited, and pleasantly scandalized.
                    While some of the news — such as word of new laws passed by the Council of Four or official election
                    results — is handed down directly by the government, most comes from freelance journalists, and
                    official pronouncements often sit side by side with scathing editorials or unflattering political
                    cartoons of those same officials.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="9e444bbd-7983-4a02-884e-6bdd1d0cbb5e">Ettvard Needle, a chaotic good male
                    human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner"
                        data-tooltip-href="//www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16829-tooltip?disable-webm=1&amp;disable-webm=1">commoner</a>,
                    runs the operation from a surprisingly modest converted warehouse in Heapside. The son of an
                    established Lower City tailor, he had always rankled at the way Lower City residents were treated by
                    haughty patriars, and started Baldur’s Mouth as a way to empower the city’s poor via what he saw as
                    the greatest weapon of social change: information. In the beginning, he simply paid local lantern
                    bearers to shout his stories of upper-crust injustices, but as enthusiasm for the practice built and
                    more people began bringing him information, he began writing the stories down for his distributors —
                    teaching many of them to read in the process — and then selling the notes directly. Today, Needle
                    prints his broadsheets by the cartload, aided by mechanical scribes purchased from the Hall of
                    Wonders and funded by advertisements from merchants across the city.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="f7ab63f6-30e5-4d97-992f-37b0fa443906">Though beholden to advertisers and
                    tacitly sanctioned by the city government, the Mouth has never lost its populist bent. Needle
                    carefully ensures that the paper is useful enough to the government that it’s never in their
                    interest to shut it down, yet devotes the rest of the paper to news the government might prefer
                    hushed up, from aristocratic scandal and evidence of corruption to straight talk about various
                    threats to the city, always with a healthy dose of anti-elite rhetoric. His editorials have a
                    particular soft spot for his friend Rilsa Rael, the Guild kingpin of Little Calimshan. While Needle
                    loathes the Guild, he sees in Rilsa’s egalitarian tendencies the potential for a hero of the people,
                    and naively hopes she’ll transform the Guild from a predatory criminal organization into a community
                    police force serving the city’s downtrodden.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="01dc98d1-8439-43cc-89cb-39b4a93e9ea3">Baldur’s Mouth is a prime source of
                    opportunity for adventurers in the city, as Needle is always looking to hire daring “investigative
                    reporters” willing to investigate rumors of strange happenings or procure proof of corruption by the
                    city’s elite. Even just reading the broadsheet can present adventure opportunities via
                    advertisements recruiting mercenaries, half-substantiated reports of monster attacks ignored by the
                    Flaming Fist, and more. And of course, should adventurers succeed or fail in some high-profile
                    venture, they might just find caricatures of themselves and stories of their exploits in the Mouth’s
                    latest edition.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="ad8073bf-0290-432d-afd8-834f5bd7a6d2">This comfortable inn was named for its
                    original sign, an enchanted wooden shield. Painted black, the circular shield displayed an image of
                    a curved silver saber gripped by a pale, slender arm. An enchantment on the shield caused
                    glimmering, starlike motes of light to sparkle along the saber’s blade. The former innkeeper of the
                    Blade and Stars, a chaotic neutral half-orc <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"

                    named Aurayaun, used to insist that the illusory effect was the shield’s only magic, and that it did
                    exactly what she intended it to do: draw in business.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="467ccbde-d820-4219-bb3e-ba8ef85e9a86">Still, it appears that there’s more to
                    the shield’s story, for recently both Aurayaun and the shield disappeared. Since then, Aurayaun’s
                    worried wife Lupin, a chaotic good female human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"
                        href="/monsters/16829-commoner"

                    has been running the inn and loudly expressing her belief that the disappearance is the result of
                    foul play. What kind of foul play, she has no idea.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="7a16fe19-56b1-450b-ba17-f3b946c20e55">While Aurayaun was quiet about her past,
                    she had no enemies that Lupin knew about. Lupin furiously rejects the Flaming Fist’s conclusion that
                    her wife simply abandoned her. A local vagrant claims to have seen Aurayaun climb up and remove the
                    sign-shield late on the night she went missing, then vanish into an alley with a cloaked figure.
                    Since then, though, Lupin has received parcels containing pieces of the shattered shield, each
                    bearing a tiny constellation upon it. Lupin is convinced it’s a map, but to where, and whether that
                    destination is terrestrial or the heavens she doesn’t know. She’s willing to pay to find out,
                    though.</p>

                    the Blushing Mermaid is known as the best tavern and inn in Baldur’s Gate for those looking to get
                    their teeth kicked in, or to kick in someone else’s. Always one spilled drink away from a brawl, the
                    bar is the sort of place most don’t visit unless they’re well-armed or with a lot of friends —
                    preferably both. The place takes its name from the life-sized wooden mermaid hanging above the
                    incongruous reception desk, a dozen blackened and withered hands nailed to its body — souvenirs left
                    by those who refused to pay their bill.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="155f0024-f573-433b-92dd-7ab8fc5d0666">Beyond the combination lobby and common
                    room, the Blushing Mermaid is a confusing maze of wings and oddly interconnected floors, hiding
                    dozens of small and shabby rooms and at least four levels of cellars. Few people bother to sleep at
                    the Mermaid, due in part to its operators’ loud pronouncement that they aren’t responsible for any
                    losses, including those of life and limb. Instead, its plethora of back rooms and antechambers act
                    as de facto offices for the menagerie of shady characters who spend their days drinking here.
                    Ostensibly retired sailors, the bar’s regulars are in fact contacts for a variety of unsavory
                    organizations, from smugglers and bandits to fences and drug dealers. Some work for the Guild,
                    others for operations all along the Sword Coast. Those looking to do business with the Gate’s
                    underworld find that a handful of silver in the Mermaid can open doors, but the wrong word can find

                    in the alley out back. While the Mermaid’s criminal aspects are an open secret, the place is well
                    connected enough that the Flaming Fist traditionally leaves it alone.</p>

                    moon elves of the Candulhallow family have managed the city’s small fleet of corpse carts. Though
                    family members rarely push carts themselves anymore, their terse agents are a constant sight around
                    the city, picking up the dead and using hand-drawn wagons to haul their shrouded loads to the Shrine
                    of the Suffering or outlying cemeteries, funded by city stipends and tips from grieving loved ones.

                    quietly rich off a variety of death-related scams. Chief among these is a secret smuggling
                    arrangement with Nine-Fingers Keene to conceal contraband in corpses’ funeral wrappings, which the
                    guards and toll collectors never check. Even less savory is the harvesting and sale of corpses or
                    their parts for the city’s cultists and necromancers. Chief among these latter customers is the
                    family matriarch, Leylenna Candulhallow, a neutral evil female moon elf <a

                    corpses and weighted coffins. Should any of the family’s misdealing come to light, it would
                    doubtlessly shock the city to the core and potentially force Leylenna to reveal the elaborate
                    necromantic masterpiece — an evolution of both art and life — that she’s been slowly patching
                    together for months in her basement.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="74701214-f90e-4948-be12-5bc6dfc17527">Shilvin quickly capitalized on the

                    “dinosaur-deterring” equipment worked as she’d marketed. Eventually the local government got
                    involved after several overly ambitious patriar scions vanished on ventures hastily outfitted by
                    Eastway Expeditions. Now Shilvin can sell her modest selection of goods and any jungle-related gear
                    only after a ten-day waiting period, helping to ensure that fewer citizens rush off to Chult
                    unprepared. To make up for the resulting loss of business, Shilvin has made connections with several
                    trading (and piratical) ventures in regular need of crew. Eastway Expeditions has since gained a
                    low-key reputation for helping people get out of the city fast, so long as they don’t care overly

                    troubled. Recently, someone managed to break into the upper workshop while he was sleeping and steal
                    four kegs of <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/254340-smokepowder"

                    In their place, he found a drawing of a phoenix. Avery is terrified of what the thieves might do
                    with the powder — he’s all too aware that someone with that much <a

                    could blow up a portion of the High Hall, Wyrm’s Rock, or any number of other fortifications. Yet as
                    horrifying as he finds those possibilities, he seems more concerned about himself: <a

                    security is his responsibility, and he can’t tell the city government about the theft without
                    getting punished for negligence. Yet if he keeps quiet and the thieves use the powder, he’ll
                    obviously be implicated. The only solution is to hire someone discreet and trustworthy to track down

                    in matching clients with mercenaries. They also hire members to teach classes in the building’s
                    open-air atrium while other members lounge on the overlooking balconies. At any given time, there’s

                <p data-content-chunk-id="bc1ab25e-f067-4854-91ee-454fd0572987">Generations ago, an outbreak of
                    extremely contagious dancing croup — a deadly plague that caused those afflicted to cough themselves
                    to death even as their limbs thrashed uncontrollably — caused many Baldurians to rethink their
                    approach to medicine. Requiring individual victims to seek out healing from their respective
                    clergies accelerated the disease’s spread as the infected traveled to different houses of worship
                    throughout the city, overwhelming the facilities at each. In the aftermath, the Lower City decided
                    to consolidate. While patriars might still be able to afford house calls and personal priests and
                    physicians, commoners funded the building of a single large facility where everyone could come for
                    treatment. Eager to no longer have every worship service interrupted by contagious congregants,
                    several of the city’s temples were only too happy to provide clerics to work in the facility. Of
                    course, coin still determines one’s quality of care, the clerics rarely work for free, and those
                    without sufficient funds generally end up in the ominously stained basement with the
                    chirurgeons-in-training — but at least those in need know where they can go for help. Chronically
                    understaffed, especially in those wards catering to poor Outer City residents, the hospital has
                    constant security problems, from angry patients to spontaneously arising undead, unethical or
                    experimental treatments by priests of non-good faiths, or excessive withdrawals from the stores of
                    painkilling narcotics.</p>

                    provides, leaving all weapons and other possessions with her. Merilyn’s reputation, and that of her
                    highly capable attendants, is formidable enough that even rival crews or businesses engaged in the
                    tensest of negotiations never violate the house’s rule against violence.</p>

                    discretion also makes the bathhouse the prime venue for paid companionship in the Lower City. Many
                    of the most sought-after courtesans meet their patrons in the Hissing Stones’ steamy private rooms,
                    trusting to Merilyn’s silence and the house’s reputation for business meetings to deflect the
                    suspicion of jealous spouses or gossipy wags. Unlike Merilyn, the Reveler’s Union — the
                    city-spanning crew of night-workers — isn’t averse to selling secrets teased from the bathhouse’s
                    clients, and those looking to purchase such information need only whisper in the right ear here.
                    Though this dichotomy keeps Merilyn herself from officially joining the Union, the crew uses the
                    location as its de facto headquarters, regularly renting out and conducting meetings in its vast

                    named Torimesh arrived home in the city after decades of adventuring abroad and purchased this small
                    portion of the hillside. Too steep to build on, the area had long been an illegal junkyard, with
                    locals standing atop a rocky promontory and dumping their refuse over the edge of the embankment.
                    Instead of clearing the debris away, Torimesh used magic to nurture the local plants, causing a
                    forest of green to grow up over the garbage, rusting away debris and creating soft lawns and
                    thickets shot through with small recesses and tunnels where the old refuse had piled high. This
                    revamped space he dedicated as a public park, arguing that the poor need to feel nature’s touch just
                    as much as rich patriars with their manicured gardens. Torimesh himself lives in a tiny hut backed
                    against the jutting outcropping still known as Dumper’s Rock.</p>

                    Drawing Tree. Planted by Torimesh and grown to full-size in a matter of days, the tree is of a
                    species no one can identify, and Torimesh steadfastly refuses to say anything about its origins, yet
                    everyone knows its power. When properly entreated by Torimesh, the tree’s red bark cracks and curls
                    like parchment. Pulling it carefully away reveals a prophetic scene rendered in bloody sap. These
                    arboreal visions of the future are often cryptic, yet inevitably come to pass. As much as the city’s
                    elite would love to harness this power, anyone else attempting to peel the tree’s bark or force a
                    prophecy reveals only bark and sends Torimesh into a near-murderous rage. For his part, the druid
                    refuses to work for money, peeling off prophecies only according to the unspoken whims of the tree,
                    or in exchange for bizarre and dangerous favors.</p>

                    teahouse. Many were shocked by the growth of such a sophisticated establishment among the port’s
                    lowbrow customers, but no one can deny the addictive nature of the half-elf proprietor’s special
                    blend. Jopalin includes sable moonflower leaves in his tea, creating a subtle, slow-building

                    shuffled in through an entrance in the building next door to avoid suspicion, where a group of thugs
                    presides over several dozen filthy cots, collecting Jopalin’s fees and dispensing his moonflower

                    Bloomridge, this mansion appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the night, taking over a
                    previously vacant lot. Fully staffed with close-lipped servants, the imposing manse hosted a few
                    lavish parties for the Lower City elite, presided over by an eccentric and brooding human wizard
                    named Mandorcai. And then, just as suddenly as he had arrived, Mandorcai shut the manor’s doors and
                    vanished from public life. Curious locals who peered through the windows reported a completely empty
                    manor, its furniture looking as though it hadn’t been touched in years. Yet soon thereafter,
                    individuals around the city began to receive invitations to visit, written in silver on black paper
                    folded into pentagons.</p>

                    requested appointments never emerged. After a handful of such disappearances, a Flaming Fist squad
                    smashed its way into the building. Only two of its members emerged, babbling about shifting rooms
                    and blood-soaked abattoirs filled with writhing hooks and chains. With no laborers willing to tear
                    the place down, the Council of Four boarded up the doors but left the mansion standing. For decades
                    now, no one has been observed going in or out. Whether the little black invitations that still
                    occasionally appear on citizens’ doorsteps are genuine or harmless pranks remains anyone’s guess.

                    stands on a rocky islet in the harbor, its sheer walls erupting from the stone in such a way as to
                    grant invaders from the sea few footholds. From the fortress’s five stout towers, specially made
                    Gondan trebuchets stand ready to hurl stones three times the distance of an ordinary siege weapon,
                    giving the fortress command of not just the entire harbor but the opposite bank of the river as
                    well. Any invading ships not intimidated by such death from above would also have to contend with
                    the massive chain running from the Seatower to pilings under the easternmost wharf in Brampton. A
                    capstan in the tower can raise the chain, stretching it across the harbor mouth and keeping anything
                    larger than a rowboat from entering or leaving. As for land-based attacks, the 400-foot-long
                    causeway connecting the Seatower’s islet to the shore needs no gates or drawbridges, as any
                    attackers foolish enough to charge along its length would be easy marks for the wall’s archers.</p>

                    along with trophies from campaigns abroad, a priceless library of war-related texts, and more.
                    Rumors also speak of the Fist’s treasury, kept in a lead-lined vault somewhere beneath the Officers’
                    Tower and surrounded by yards of solid stone, the secret doors leading to its vaults hidden by

                    Seatower also serves as the local prison of Baldur’s Gate. Three levels of dungeons extend beneath
                    it, the lower two below sea level and integrating part of a naturally occurring cavern system. This
                    both keeps the prison secure and pacifies prisoners, as any who act out know that they can always be
                    moved from the dry cells to the dank lower levels. Particularly problematic inmates end up in the
                    Swimming Hole — a flooded and lightless shaft where prisoners must constantly tread water or risk
                    drowning, while also fending off the blind, biting shrimp that dwell there. Though long-term
                    incarceration is rare in the city, there are always a few inmates rotting in these cells, ranging
                    from petty criminals to political prisoners locked away on trumped-up charges.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="84633c22-dfb0-4b5c-bdfb-989ad52e5d2e">Characters who run seriously afoul of
                    the law in Baldur’s Gate might wind up in the Seatower. While the Fist treats the prison as
                    something of an afterthought, any trying to break in or out of the dungeons still have their work
                    cut out for them. Only the upper cells have windows, and anyone trying to break through the walls of
                    the lower cells risks catastrophic flooding. Sentries are constantly on alert for ships drawing
                    suspiciously near the island, and no one is allowed through the fortress’s gate without a reason and

                    Soldiers are often assigned to “cell duty” as a temporary punishment — while this generally means

                    there by stories of the structure’s original builder, a smuggler who turned the place into a warren
                    of secret passages, hidden rooms, false walls, and concealed entrances, most of which have now been

                    rose to prominence as the Council of Four’s wizard, doing regular favors for the council to further
                    his own plots. Though rarely home, he boards four alchemist lackeys in the building, along with
                    several guards, using the secret passages to cover their comings and goings. Their only job is to
                    uncover and map out as many of the building’s secrets as possible — one of the histories Skoond read
                    suggested that the building’s original architect had died while smuggling a rare magical tome,

                    traditionally dumped its sewage downstream and let the river carry its problems elsewhere. As the
                    city grew, however, this began to dangerously pollute the river, leading a coalition of druids and
                    patriars to construct the Sewer Keep.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="bb3c236c-ffca-4781-ab69-c1c21537e199">A series of three towers built into the
                    walls at the western end of the Seatower neighborhood, the facility was intended to treat the sewage
                    just before it enters the river, using vast enclosed holding tanks of magically augmented plants to
                    purify the effluent. Though the facility was a marvel of magical ecological engineering, the public
                    proved singularly unwilling to care about their waste, and funding quickly collapsed. Since then,
                    the Keep has been a shadow of its intended glory, struggling to keep the worst of Baldur’s Gate from
                    the waterway.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="48a9dd33-a2b6-4372-af4d-6e7cc14fdf94">Shortly after Balduran disappeared for
                    the final time, this statue appeared on the cliffs of Tumbledown. Twice the size of the actual man,
                    the statue bears an uncanny likeness to Balduran, squinting west over city and river. While its
                    sudden arrival created something of a stir, most assumed it was simply a tribute to the great man —
                    until one morning several months later when passersby noticed that one of the statue’s hands had
                    risen to shade its eyes. Scholars immediately began studying the statue, learning that at sunrise on
                    the first day of each new year, the statue flickers, changing its position in an eyeblink. Though it
                    always looks west, the precise line of its gaze can change by up to thirty degrees, and it may peer
                    through a spyglass, stand with hands on hips, point with an open hand, and so on.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="e97edcc9-035a-4e7e-a7ff-6c18484607d5">For centuries, the predominant theory
                    was that Balduran still lived somewhere far to the west, and the statue tracked his movements. Yet a
                    generation ago, a knight of Oghma vowed to follow the line of the statue’s gaze as far as necessary
                    to learn the truth. His journey was shorter than expected. In a wood just a few miles west of the
                    city, he came upon a cylindrical stone building, its open doorway revealing stairs leading down into
                    the forest floor. Atop the building, a smaller statue of Balduran stared back the way he had come.
                    Prevented from entering by a pattern of magical lights he couldn’t identify, the knight raced back
                    to the city to gather additional scholars — yet when he returned, the structure was gone. Since
                    then, the forested structure — which popular stories now refer to as Balduran’s Tomb — has been
                    discovered three more times in the same fashion, each time in a different location, yet so far no
                    one has been able to enter.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="3afc885e-0574-4695-9e2e-d7b08ec04b30">The value of land and sheer population
                    density in Baldur’s Gate means only the wealthiest patriars can afford to bury their dead within the
                    city, interring them in catacombs beneath the city’s temples or in family crypts on their own
                    grounds. For everyone else, there’s the ignoble Shrine of the Suffering or the scattering of
                    cemeteries outside the city. The largest of the latter is Cliffside Cemetery, located in the
                    Tumbledown neighborhood and employing many local residents as gravediggers, stonemasons, morticians,
                    and professional mourners.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="413c0150-7941-44da-80a8-0692a275ea98">Long ago, the graveyard was an empty
                    estate owned by the mercantile Szarr family, with only a few family crypts near the cliffs. When a
                    business rival murdered the entire family in their beds, no one was eager to move into their former
                    manor, and the city decided to turn the estate into a single massive graveyard that acts as the
                    primary repository for the city’s dead.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="c879ec36-a61b-425b-9b46-b4dfecc2e1cd">The graveyard itself is a maze of crypts
                    and monuments, its organization nearly impossible for outsiders to discern as the multi-chamber
                    ossuaries of rich merchants and pirate lords loom over the simple plaques and rotting wooden holy
                    symbols of the poor. Natural cavern systems have been expanded and shored up to create extensive
                    crypts, yet over generations maps have been lost or poorly updated, and it’s not uncommon for a
                    gravedigger to find themselves striking the wood of a coffin where no coffin should be, or tumbling
                    through into a forgotten stretch of tunnel. Rampant grave robbery by brigands and
                    necromancy-obsessed followers of Myrkul only increases the chaos, as bodies get exhumed and reburied
                    wherever it’s convenient. Most significantly, a major landslide decades ago dropped a large portion
                    of the cemetery’s cliff into the river below, causing the remaining bone-houses and markers to shift
                    and lean, while also exposing numerous crypts and tomb-tunnels to the air, prompting a fresh rush of
                    grave robbing. Though Baldurians rarely bury their dead with valuables anymore, and many of the
                    easier pickings have been taken, it’s common wisdom that some of the greatest treasures of past
                    centuries still lie entombed with their heroes, their headstones wiped anonymously clean by wind and
                    rain.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="fca243a5-fc09-4dfd-8fd1-1665dde3a940">Watching over all of this is the
                    powerful Gravemakers crew. Far more than simply caretakers and laborers, the Gravemakers guard the
                    dead — and Tumbledown — from threats. With so much death concentrated in one spot, undead are a
                    constant problem. Skeletons and revenants regularly claw spontaneously out of their graves, while
                    ghouls and ghasts burrow into crypts and catacombs, drawn by the scent of decaying flesh. Wights
                    hide in their tombs by day, while ghosts and wraiths terrorize unsuspecting mortals. Putting down
                    such threats before they can prey on citizens is the Gravemakers’ primary job, and though rightfully
                    proud of their prowess, their leader Leone Wen, a lawful good female human <a

                    moldering halls reputedly still infested by the ghosts of the murdered Szarrs — though stories
                    remain split as to whether the ghosts prey on the Gravemakers or aid them in their duty.</p>

                    circumstances she offers free room and board in her facility is something of a mystery, but as of
                    yet, none have discovered any sinister angle to her work. In fact, Mother Aramina has been known to
                    hire empathic intermediaries to help extricate the needful from destructive conditions. Despite its
                    charity, though, the Church of Last Hope is not universally loved. The Faithless, the

                    non-priests in their midst, ripe targets for protection schemes, kidnappings, and all manner of
                    other plots. Currently none of the Church’s patients have been endangered, but Mother Aramina is
                    cautiously looking for more permanent security solutions.</p>

                <p data-content-chunk-id="f13b8622-b12c-4abb-a7ad-2178155feaad">Generations ago, a fleet of Calishite
                    refugees fleeing war in the south came sailing into Gray Harbor. Rather than opening their doors to
                    the foreigners, the people of Baldur’s Gate quickly hustled them out of the city, forcing them out
                    the Basilisk Gate in the middle of the night and taxing them for the privilege. Desperate and weary,
                    the refugees finally found succor in a caravansary run by a fellow Calishite in the Outer City.
                    There they used what little wealth they’d been able to bring with them to construct a new home — a
                    traditional Calishite settlement that would be precisely as friendly to Baldur’s Gate as the
                    Baldurians had been to them.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="f516905c-cf74-4fe3-85b3-2fb51478e031">Though much time has passed since that
                    ignominious beginning, tensions remain high between Little Calimshan and the rest of the city,
                    particularly with regard to those Baldurians living in the city proper. Unlike most of the Outer
                    City, where neighborhoods blend into each other and no one can quite say where one ends and another
                    begins, Little Calimshan is sharply defined by brick-and-plaster walls, 15 feet tall, 5 feet thick,
                    and topped with minarets in the classic Calishite style. These walls don’t simply surround the
                    neighborhood, either. Little Calimshan is built like a traditional Calishite city in miniature, with
                    its interior divided into multiple drudachs (neighborhoods). Each drudach is walled off and
                    inhabited by a particular extended family or clan, with its own religious site, inn or tavern,
                    marketplace, and places of industry such as smithies, armories, tanneries, or mills. While such an
                    abundance of walls might make Little Calimshan seem fractious and standoffish, in fact the opposite
                    is true: the thick wall walks act as elevated streets, with locals able to look out over the layout
                    from above and easily pick a path to their intended destination.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="61649edf-dda4-4d9e-9d6e-17b6e16ac758">Second only to the Wide in the chaos and
                    liveliness of its markets, Little Calimshan opens its gates to outsiders for just a few hours each
                    day. Inside its warren of bazaars, local merchants have a near-monopoly on many southern imports,
                    from silks and fine blades of Calishite steel to tomes of rare magical lore, thanks to exclusive
                    trade agreements with various caravans. As soon as mid-afternoon arrives, however, shoppers are
                    shuffled back out the arched gates, and the only non-Calishites still allowed within the
                    neighborhood are those who’ve married into a Little Calimshan family or otherwise earned the sacred
                    trust of a drudach’s residents. While many residents of Little Calimshan venture into the larger
                    city for business or pleasure, not even the Flaming Fist is able to force its way into the
                    neighborhood-turned-fortress after hours except in the direst circumstances, and each drudach is
                    instead patrolled by a militia of young unmarried warriors (<a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"

                    unified face to the rest of the city, it has all the problems of any settlement. Income inequality
                    is made all the more obvious by density, with paupers living literally side-by-side with wealthy
                    genie-binders. Older isolationists clash with young folk eager for more interaction with the wider
                    city. Yet by far the largest issue is the gang war currently ravaging Little Calimshan. Seeing the
                    Guild as fundamentally an outsider organization, a Calishite gang called the Right Pashas seeks to
                    oust Guild agents from Little Calimshan’s underworld. The Guild’s popular kingpin, <a

                    locations is the Calim Jewel Emporium, widely regarded as the best jeweler in the city — and the
                    best place to fence stolen gems, as it’s also the local Guild headquarters. In addition to hosting
                    regular public forums in her shop, Rael tacitly oversees the Garden of Whispers, a maze of
                    wood-and-paper screens where people from across the city can buy and sell secrets with Guild agents
                    and each other, speaking through the barriers so as to maintain anonymity. Also popular are schools
                    like the Lamp of Learning and the Verdashir Academy, which train spellcasters and warriors in the
                    styles of their ancestral homeland, allowing only the most talented outsiders to access their
                    archives or join in their lessons. And, of course, every patriar in the city has visited the famous
                    Oasis Theater, home of the city’s most daring — and sometimes dangerous — productions.</p>

                    small theaters and cabarets, but none can hold a candle to the epic spectacle of the Oasis. Theater
                    owner and director Jonas Goodnight, a chaotic neutral male human <a

                    puts on shows even more outrageous than his magnificently crafted outfits. Productions involve
                    everything from live monsters to powerful illusion magic, while also showcasing the most talented
                    performers in the city. Actors and musicians perform their songs and monologues from atop flaming
                    trapezes or human towers, while acrobats shock the audience with physical feats bordering on the
                    supernatural.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="6c07b9fc-d375-4405-8c49-21d48bfd44a1">Even lowbrow theatergoers unable to
                    decipher Goodnight’s artistic genius can appreciate his flagrant breaking of taboos, with risqué
                    burlesque and satirical scripts mocking everyone from the dukes to Nine-Fingers Keene herself. The
                    fact that these performances sometimes go terribly awry, with monsters breaking loose or a broken
                    piece of equipment sending a performer plummeting into the crowd, only adds to the excitement, and
                    patriars and common folk alike vie for seats at the theater’s afternoon-only performances. Ticket
                    prices are decided capriciously and on the spot by Goodnight, varying wildly between any given
                    individual.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="43106400-f42e-480e-955b-2db3f4480760">While Goodnight is always looking for
                    new performers, at the moment he needs more than just a talented bard or contortionist. The cost of
                    putting on his outrageous shows has landed him deep in debt, and his compulsive need to roast every
                    potential patron or ally in the city hasn’t helped matters. With the Guild ready to step in and
                    assume ownership if he doesn’t start repaying his loans, he needs to either turn to outright crime
                    or put on a show more amazing than anything he’s done before. He’s got an idea, but to pull it off,
                    he’ll need an experienced adventuring party willing to play the stars in the world’s first
                    live-audience adventure.</p>

                    Hill rises along the Chionthar River, eddies captured by outcroppings have bored into the stone,
                    carving a maze of meandering tunnels and draining into subterranean aquifers. Though hardly
                    diverting enough water to impact the river’s flow, the web of submerged chambers has become a source
                    of mystery and legend for locals.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="06fbd7cc-d09a-402c-99c0-fa9a7e093889">While most of the tunnels are submerged,
                    changes in river height over time mean that some of the tunnels and caverns are dry or only
                    half-flooded for long stretches, making them favored hideouts for fugitives, smugglers, aquatic
                    predators, and particularly adventurous trysting lovers. Though rumors whisper that some tunnels
                    lead directly under Baldur’s Gate, to date all mapped caverns are accessible only from the river,
                    and even just climbing into a tunnel mouth or steering a boat inside can be deadly as the current
                    attempts to smash vessels against the cliffs. Stories of ancient treasure in the flooded caverns are
                    only enhanced by stories of Ol’ Cholms, a river monster, prowling the tunnels. Many would-be fortune
                    hunters have been disappointed to discover dry tunnels containing nothing more than crude graffiti,
                    empty wine bottles, and flocks of bloodthirsty <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"

                    dangerous, the Whitkeep Hostel is a spark of light and levity. Built by a wealthy caravan operator
                    who lost their fortune to monster attacks, this white-walled manor house was quickly overtaken by
                    squatters, and has now spent most of a century as an all-gnome artist’s commune. Though only gnomes
                    are invited to rent one of the rambling manor’s thirty-seven studio apartments, Baldurians of all
                    races are welcome to socialize at the place’s infamous surrealist parties or attend its concerts and
                    offbeat art happenings. As such, the hostel has become the central gathering point for the city’s
                    radicals and revolutionaries, as well as many artists and dreamers.</p>

                    Rumors spread by Prole herself suggest that they’ve almost completed a magical invention that will
                    “finally strip away the bonds of capital and free the people to flourish,” but security around the
                    project has been unusually tight, keeping even many members of the commune in the dark. While most
                    people assume this is merely some strange new critique of the city’s patriars, both the Guild and
                    the Flaming Fist would dearly love to infiltrate the revolutionaries’ project and make sure it
                    doesn’t pose a threat to the status quo.</p>

                    enormous bridges, each spanning half the Chionthar River and meeting at Wyrm’s Rock, a tall, rocky
                    islet in the center. While the Flaming Fist maintains a fortress on the island to tax travelers
                    along the Coast Way and control city access in times of trouble, the bridges themselves are fair
                    game for squatters. Ramshackle wooden tenements, taverns, and shops crowd both sides of the arched
                    stone spans, leaning out over the narrow road between them. Even more cling to the sides of the
                    bridges, anchored to each other or cantilevered over the water. The tendency of these latter
                    structures to occasionally drop into the rushing river, pulling their neighbors down with them, is
                    not enough to deter residents who hope to be the first to sell to travelers on their way into the
                    city, or the last to pick their pockets on the way out.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="79a07067-1df4-4f0a-9a79-c373eb2aed4d">Even among members of the Outer City,
                    residents of Wyrm’s Crossing have a reputation as rakes and riffraff, and the neighborhood
                    specializes in seedy dive bars and gambling halls where belligerent drunks can be ejected directly
                    out over the river. At the same time, it also has a large and tight-knit strongheart halfling
                    community, whose low-ceilinged tenements and lighter weight are perfect for the neighborhood’s
                    precarious architectural style.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="c80330af-bd61-4067-834d-aa59e2ae2961">While the Crossing is renowned for
                    cheats and criminals, the residents stick together, and a local crew called the Crossers ensures
                    that all predatory practices are applied primarily to travelers, and never to fellow
                    bridge-dwellers. For those who consistently refuse to play well with their neighbors, the answer is
                    often Sweetjen’s Spices, a precarious bridge-side shop whose halfling proprietor quietly sells some
                    of the most potent drugs and untraceable poisons in the city.</p>

                    center of the river on an algae-slick islet, its sheer walls nearly impossible to scale. Built by
                    the Flaming Fist on a rock once said to have housed a bronze dragon, the fortress is the first
                    checkpoint at which Baldur’s Gate taxes northbound travelers. Anyone seeking to cross the river via
                    the fortress’s two massive bridges must pay the 5 cp toll and pass through the fortress via a long
                    central tunnel riddled with arrow slits and murder holes. Between twenty-five and fifty Flaming Fist
                    soldiers staff the checkpoint, which operates only during the day. After dark, the drawbridges on
                    either side of the keep are raised, halting all traffic and forcing latecomers to take shelter at
                    one of the many bridge-top inns in Wyrm’s Crossing until morning.</p>
                <p data-content-chunk-id="64f181b8-c54e-45d2-9911-9d25576c9f0b">The fortress has four levels: the bridge
                    level, taken up by the gauntlet tunnel and offices devoted to traffic management; a second-story
                    armory full of oil, javelins, and everything the soldiers need to withstand a siege; a third story
                    for soldier’s quarters; and a high-ceilinged dungeon level below the bridges to hold temporary
                    prisoners and the fortress’s supply of small boats (should the garrison need to sally through
                    heavily fortified river-level gates). Soldiers stationed in the fortress tend to fall into two
                    categories: those disappointed at being stuck on toll-collection duty so far from the city, and
                    those overjoyed at easy work and a chance to carouse in Wyrm’s Crossing, with the latter ensuring
                    that the Fist doesn’t patrol their neighboring bridges too heavily.</p>

                    you, the DM. Once players have decided on their characters’ backgrounds, review the material here.
                    Some backgrounds have at least one new variant feature that ties the background to a group in
                    Baldur’s Gate, provided to give characters an additional connection to the city. Characters may
                    choose to replace the standard feature of their background with one of these variant features. Each
                    background also includes a bonus feature that marks a character as a native of Baldur’s Gate who’s
                    familiar with the city — both its streets and its scars. These additional features are referred to
                    as “Baldur’s Gate features.” While a character’s background features are broadly useful, the effects
                    of a Baldur’s Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur’s Gate — though, at the
                    DM’s discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur’s Gate.
                    These location-based features do not replace other features; a character gains them merely for being
                    familiar with Baldur’s Gate. If a background presents multiple Baldur’s Gate features, you gain all
                    the features associated with that background, or as many of them as you wish to take.</p>

                    a crime or sin that might force a party together or underlie their deeds. Once players have sorted
                    out their individual backgrounds, give them the opportunity to choose a dark secret. This secret
                    might have exciting or ominous ramifications as the party’s adventures unfold.</p>

                    neighborhood — but new ones arrive constantly, carried by travelers and proselytizers from far-flung
                    lands. A character with this background might aspire to greater things, not for themselves, but for
                    their faith.</p>

                    that faith openly congregates and the neighborhoods those faithful typically inhabit. While this
                    isn’t remarkable for most of the city’s larger faiths, keeping track of the hundreds of religions
                    newcomers bring with them is no mean feat.</p>

                    even the snootiest family heads of your authenticity. You’re skilled at posing as the long-lost heir
                    to some imaginary or extinguished patriar lineage.</p>

                    Baldur’s Gate. You might be able to bluff others through with you, or even convince members of the
                    Watch that you’re a patriar. However, any true test of your authenticity is likely to reveal your
                    deception.</p>

                            when it can plausibly be claimed as an act of personal revenge. Others join up with crews
                            for protection, or with the Guild itself. A few former Guild members have been cast out of
                            the organization due to incompetence or after offending a more powerful member, and now

                            Guild. This operative will hear you out and, at their discretion, take your information or
                            request up their chain of command. These meetings almost always occur in shady venues.</p>

                    disguises their identity. Roll on the Faceless Persona table to determine your persona, or work with
                    the DM to create a persona that’s unique to your character and suits the tone of your game.</p>

                    world know you as your persona. Those who seek to learn more about you—your weaknesses, your
                    origins, your purpose—find themselves stymied by your disguise. Upon donning a disguise and behaving
                    as your persona, you are unidentifiable as your true self. By removing your disguise and revealing
                    your true face, you are no longer identifiable as your persona. This allows you to change
                    appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or
                    serve as convenient camouflage. However, should someone realize the connection between your persona
                    and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness.</p>

                    persona — the hero or extraordinary person they are every day. That’s all a facade, though, or a
                    part of them expressed to an extreme. To define a persona, feel free to choose characteristics from
                    other backgrounds, particularly folk hero, hermit, or noble. For the person behind the persona, the
                    one who truly strives to be faceless, consider a distinct set of faceless characteristics. As a
                    result, those with this background have two sets of characteristics, one for their persona, and one
                    for their faceless selves.</p>

                    the Upper City, where they host grand galas and flaunt cosmopolitan fashions, but are walled off
                    from the poverty and squalor of the less fortunate districts and their neighborhoods. Although they
                    might visit prosperous Bloomridge to try a fashionable restaurant or boutique, or watch a spectacle
                    at the Oasis Theater, the patriars have little reason to venture into the dirtier, more dangerous
                    parts of the city. If they do, it is generally as thrill-seeking tourists or enclosed by a retinue
                    of armed guards, not as friends or neighbors. As a result, many patriars are at once acutely attuned
                    to the nuances of royal courts half a continent away and shockingly ignorant of what life is like
                    for the poor outside their own doorsteps.</p>

                    over others’ without question, and any corruption among guards or government officials tends to work

                    If you serve in the Flaming Fist, once every ten days, you must report to the Seatower of Balduran
                    for training, and you’re required to take a regular shift patrolling either the Lower City or the
                    Outer City. In return, you have access to the Flaming Fist’s fortresses and a direct line of
                    communication with Flaming Fist officers and other soldiers. You can also pass through the city’s
                    gates without question — although you can’t bring guests into the Upper City as a member of the
                    Watch might. Additionally, you’re always welcome at the Three Old Kegs, where the Three Old Toads

                    In return, you have access to the Citadel and a direct line of communication with Watch officers and
                    officials. Your word carries considerable weight in the High Hall, and most establishments in the
                    Citadel Streets neighborhood are happy to give you and your friends free meals. Additionally, you
                    can escort people into the Upper City without question, regardless of whether they are patriars or
                    have Watch tokens. Outside the Upper City, however, most people regard you with suspicion, and you
                    generally get a chilly reception while in uniform.</p>

                    might turn a blind eye to a crime, or who might have criminal connections. You can also use this
