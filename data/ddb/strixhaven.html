<p data-content-chunk-id="e3dd4141-cc12-4fdb-a133-7510f7d59487">A magical world boasts many places where students can study magic and many sages who take eager learners under their wings. But being accepted to Strixhaven University is a special honor, the dream of many young students. Strixhaven is a place of enlightenment and learning, and both its graduates and its delegates are typically welcomed and respected wherever they go.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2782cd3a-d79c-4176-b9dd-d17371d0b85b">Founded seven centuries ago by five ancient dragons, Strixhaven is the premier institution of magical learning, drawing promising young mages from all over. Each equipped with its own campus and faculty, Strixhaven’s five colleges—summarized in the Colleges of Strixhaven table—cover a vast array of academic and magical specialties.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ea0c7ca2-d8b2-42f4-ba0e-4c0631f2a234">As a Strixhaven student, you start with a well-rounded education in a rigorous first-year program. In your second year, you choose your preferred specialty at one of the five colleges. You can also partake in a vibrant campus life, with plenty of clubs and other activities.

<p data-content-chunk-id="91deb253-3f45-464a-b758-1fda2e45f3b9">This book is your guide to life at Strixhaven in Dungeons &amp; Dragons—an introduction to the university, a guide to creating student characters there, a campaign, and a collection of friends and foes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cd0a7cd8-6f83-4e85-becb-c41f1cc9c31b"><strong><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/life-at-strixhaven/" title="Chapter 1">Chapter 1</a></strong> gives an overview of life and study at Strixhaven. It introduces the main features of the central campus and each of the five colleges.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91fbd9fb-e912-4839-aa78-b376305fd93e"><strong><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/character-options/" title="Chapter 2">Chapter 2</a></strong> is your guide to creating a student character. It introduces the owlin race and five backgrounds—one for each college—as well as a collection of feats, spells, and magic items.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9ffe45d7-8246-4dfd-9e08-2b8f693021f6"><strong>Chapters 3–6</strong> provide a campaign meant to advance characters from 1st to 10th level as they progress through their magical studies. Each chapter covers a year’s worth of adventure, so characters begin <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/school-is-in-session/" title="chapter 3" data-content-chunk-id="bf208f30-01fd-4105-978a-d14786bab969">chapter 3</a> as 1st-level characters and first-year students and begin <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/a-reckoning-in-ruins/" title="chapter 6" data-content-chunk-id="230d7310-e803-48d9-b0b8-7fde7ff8bdee">chapter 6</a> at the start of their fourth year of studies (at around 8th level). Chapter 3 includes an overview of the adventures and the overall campaign arc as well as special rules for aspects of campus life: exams, relationships, extracurriculars, and jobs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fe09b55a-d95a-48b6-a52a-8e2208fa6ffa"><strong><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes/" title="Chapter 7">Chapter 7</a></strong> is a collection of stat blocks for students, faculty, and various creatures on and around the Strixhaven campus. Whether student adventurers get caught up in a duel with their rivals or face a dreaded <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160312-mage-hunter" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160312-tooltip">mage hunter</a>, the stat blocks in this chapter give you the information you need to resolve the situation.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Orientation" data-content-chunk-id="d7d8bf7c-584c-4219-bac0-614d1bad4828"><a href="#Orientation" data-content-chunk-id="e25f4266-504c-458d-abc1-0aa98fa013af"></a>Orientation</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cfa35d25-7eb2-4a9a-9a74-be4700b8c806">The following subsections present three important facts to keep in mind as you explore these pages and prepare to play or run the book’s campaign.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="StrixhavenIsaUniversity" data-content-chunk-id="41597885-f8d1-473f-a3f4-525d5d31eb30"><a href="#StrixhavenIsaUniversity" data-content-chunk-id="6bc6c33c-384e-446a-97ee-39e841d0ccc6"></a>Strixhaven Is a University</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="feda291f-410e-4de1-afb7-c0fe54105fc7">This book’s campaign assumes that the player characters are students at Strixhaven University. Even as they get caught up in the adventures, the characters have to continue going to class, doing homework, and studying for exams. Optional rules in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/school-is-in-session#Exams" title="chapter 3" data-content-chunk-id="f7ee8913-69f2-454c-9c0e-5c74ddb05e9e">chapter 3</a> reinforce the importance of study in the adventures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="23d1d388-d8eb-4572-ba8b-bd8640741df7">The characters are also subject to the authority of the university’s faculty and staff members. Circumstances will at times cause player characters to defy faculty authority—and even deans—during their adventures, and the threat of detention or even expulsion might hang over their head.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="32f7b92c-b326-4b3f-bf38-72af63eb26e1">Finally, student characters are part of a school community. They live in university housing, eat in dining halls, and spend the majority of their time on campus. They eat, sleep, study, socialize, and adventure as part of a community of students, faculty, and staff. The school is like a town, where a relatively small cast of characters can play significant roles over the course of the campaign.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ItsanAcademyofMages" data-content-chunk-id="cbdc6491-72d3-45da-b1d7-d59a70d2a099"><a href="#ItsanAcademyofMages" data-content-chunk-id="e80f0a35-4cec-4163-ae0a-e14f51dfd956"></a>It’s an Academy of Mages</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6b2780ca-2ba9-41cf-82a3-0a9bc57c2546">Study at Strixhaven isn’t about learning to be a wizard but about learning to be a historian, an artist, an orator, a scientist, or some other profession—while using magic to enhance one’s studies. The university’s understanding of magic is expansive. Characters of any class can study at Strixhaven, whether they’re full-fledged spellcasters like wizards, clerics, and druids; they manage a spell or two thanks to a subclass or feat; or they manifest magical abilities that aren’t even spells. (For example, a barbarian who follows the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/subclasses/path-of-the-ancestral-guardian" title="Path of the Ancestral Guardian" data-content-chunk-id="f04e0590-2361-4ce1-a584-90123c107a22">Path of the Ancestral Guardian</a>, described in <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte" title="Xanathar’s Guide to Everything" data-content-chunk-id="9ea2cba0-cdc4-4fea-b99c-ee34c3e7d046">Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</a>, can excel in studying history at Lorehold College by virtue of their connection to an ancestral spirit.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8a9a0025-19ae-4b87-92c7-3fa4dc715a22">Magic is everywhere on campus. The campus culture encourages finding magical solutions to the most mundane problems, and if characters need access to a spell they can’t cast, they have a strong chance of finding someone who can cast it.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ItsCosmopolitan" data-content-chunk-id="7d9301a2-bd47-4079-88fc-9d5a4a6331e9"><a href="#ItsCosmopolitan" data-content-chunk-id="fc061270-e386-4881-b1ef-fced58fa256d"></a>It’s Cosmopolitan</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5035828a-3e04-4879-81b1-43a870ed4ff8">Strixhaven draws students and faculty from across the world and from other realms in the multiverse. The university’s students and faculty are united by a desire to learn and include humans, elves, dwarves, owlin (described in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/character-options#Owlin" title="chapter 2" data-content-chunk-id="6eec8cf1-dfce-4575-b245-55cae1c31c26">chapter 2</a>), orcs, trolls, vampires, and studious folk of many other origins.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="693a47f9-1b6f-48ec-a67f-7fd9f936b13d">In practical terms, for player characters, you can use the rules found in any D&amp;D book to select a character’s race, if the DM approves. For nonplayer characters, you’re as likely to meet a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17192-pixie" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17192-tooltip">pixie</a>, a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16849-dryad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16849-tooltip">dryad</a>, a giant, a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17037-treant" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17037-tooltip">treant</a>, or another fantastical creature on campus as you are to meet a Humanoid. The faculty members mentioned in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/life-at-strixhaven/" title="chapter 1" data-content-chunk-id="30ed7e9d-f2f6-4721-af52-85dafed458f1">chapter 1</a> include genasi, tritons, and even a bipedal brown bear.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6fa6c8c0-6bc8-4f41-a58a-3aa35e95c163">To the faculty and students of Strixhaven, it is unremarkable to meet someone who hails from a far-off land, since almost everyone on campus is from somewhere else. Strixhaven has a place for anyone who is dedicated to magic-enhanced study.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="StrixhavensWorld" data-content-chunk-id="49b3f72a-b9c8-4969-af8f-5dfec0b27e2b"><a href="#StrixhavensWorld" data-content-chunk-id="e6315682-9673-4354-8f3b-a800b041384f"></a>Strixhaven’s World</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6cd7d830-869e-4e2a-91b7-f96ad7dc4fd3">Strixhaven bills itself as “the premier institution of magical learning in the world,” but the question that raises for your campaign is this—which world?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5bae5e94-411b-4dad-a1ea-951429172686">In the multiverse of the Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Game, Strixhaven is located on a world called Arcavios, which (according to legend) formed from the collision or merging of two other worlds. It is situated in the northeastern portion of a continent called Orrithia, also known as the Vastlands, which is populated by a tremendous variety of peoples.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="68212c49-89e8-4eb1-9b64-caf5d80041a4">For the purposes of D&amp;D, though, you can place Strixhaven wherever it best fits the needs of your campaign. It could be in a world of your own creation, in a published D&amp;D setting (such as the Forgotten Realms or Eberron), in the planar cosmopolis of Sigil, or in an interplanar nexus that allows it to draw students from across the Material Plane or the entire multiverse.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="010363cc-c9bb-41fa-8ec4-aa80a84a5c6b">Whatever world you decide to place Strixhaven in, three elements of the wider world of Arcavios might have some impact on adventures in the school.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SnarlsandStarArches" data-content-chunk-id="ac87a5fa-0b65-4cf7-a336-ae7344b9187b"><a href="#SnarlsandStarArches" data-content-chunk-id="262987e8-a372-4c6d-a0c7-494a3af3dc3c"></a>Snarls and Star Arches</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e1d8851a-eaf1-4422-a31a-6a61c1f1145b">As described in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" title="Player’s Handbook" data-content-chunk-id="e5c23401-9b0b-49b6-8a40-51ee27584e6c">Player’s Handbook</a>, magic suffuses all existence in the worlds of D&amp;D. In the Forgotten Realms, scholars describe the fabric of magic as a Weave that allows spellcasters to interact with the world’s underlying magical reality. In Arcavios, that fabric is knotted and tangled in some locations, creating a phenomenon called snarls. At these places, spells can be amplified or distorted in unpredictable ways. This phenomenon matters for Strixhaven because a luminous snarl is situated at the very heart of campus, located in the Hall of Oracles in the university’s monumental library, the Biblioplex.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6caaeea4-e47f-4de6-bf81-f08b47c0d6c3">Similarly, gravity-defying arch shapes appear throughout the world of Arcavios and, in particular, tower over the Biblioplex. These star arches are made from spokes of natural materials that float in an arch shape, with a precise inner curve and a rough and irregular outer arch. They can stand straight or lie at an angle, and they can be small or enormous, whole or broken, grown over or mysteriously clean. Their irregular spokes evoke the radiating lines of a shining star.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8035c9a3-7dca-4456-b9ba-387a538af81d">The star arches are a mystery left over from the birth of the world. In most cases, the arches simply float inexplicably—silent, immovable, and inert. But many people report seeing an arch appear to them at a critical juncture in their lives, helping them understand a lesson or answer a burning question in their mind. Some scholars believe each arch marks a place of great magic, such as the site of a great mage’s birth or the location of a time-lost spell. Other folk believe these arches are connected with the archaics in some way (see “<a href="#ArchaicsandtheOracle" title="Archaics and the Oracle" data-content-chunk-id="e8668195-54a4-41b2-8394-fba8cf0a39ec">Archaics and the Oracle</a>” below). Some students have even seen an arch come to life with magic in an archaic’s presence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="58e775ec-e365-47b5-94a9-0123fa6a8d1e">Both snarls and star arches are subjects of magical research for students and faculty at Strixhaven, who also study wild and dead magic zones, floating earth motes, and other weird locales.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FounderDragons" data-content-chunk-id="05e98386-ca09-49d3-ba21-e4d45ce2f631"><a href="#FounderDragons" data-content-chunk-id="90b6bf3c-cc15-49ee-ac85-073fda3abf22"></a>Founder Dragons</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b5ae8820-ef03-42ca-a043-2615e36bf7b2">Strixhaven University was founded by five ancient dragons who, according to legend, hatched from the magical energy of the newborn world of Arcavios. These Founder Dragons were among the first to master magic, and they realized that only through disciplined study would magic be safe in the hands of other peoples. They founded Strixhaven to facilitate that study and established the five colleges based on the magic that each dragon mastered, as summarized in the Founder Dragons table.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36fa2144-8e81-479d-be9e-ecf70c2d600b">To this day, the Founder Dragons roam the world. They no longer associate directly with Strixhaven, preferring to let the deans of the colleges speak in their stead. The dragons’ knowledge is vast, but their tempers can prove short. Mages seek them out only to learn the most elusive secrets. The dragons’ stat blocks are presented in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes/" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="daafe3c9-b1bc-45ac-b39b-11175ac324e6">chapter 7</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="989d1323-cd34-4d1b-a24b-a106fb5eb7fd">The <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160314-oracle-of-strixhaven" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160314-tooltip">Oracle of Strixhaven</a> is the wisest and most accomplished mage in the world of Arcavios, selected by the Founder Dragons. The Oracle’s lifelong task is to ensure that magic is used to help people and not twisted to evil ends. To be the Oracle, one must understand fundamental truths about the nature of magic, know and wield hundreds of spells, and possess impeccable judgment and virtue.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6ca594b3-bdf8-4437-9ca2-d9cdd319a8ac">Mysteriously linked to the Oracle, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160296-archaic" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160296-tooltip">archaics</a> are wise, giant, long-lived beings with an innate talent for magic. They can be seen striding through the wilds, exploring sources of magic with their many arms or contemplating existence through their “eye,” which functions as a magical focus of some kind. Scholars seek out archaics for their vast knowledge of history and magic, but archaics tend to communicate in obscure allusions and cryptic metaphors.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd02789f-4d18-4188-b5ac-42dd596c9c2f">Few know that archaics’ existence is linked to a time-warping phenomenon involving the Oracle. When an Oracle dies, their mind and spirit is swept off to the distant past, drawn backward through time toward the intense magical power that brought the world into being. Splinters of that Oracle’s soul and its fragmented memories coalesce into a creature—a newborn archaic. Every archaic alive today was born at the dawn of time from the mind of someone who has lived and died (or who will one day live and die) as an Oracle. Archaics speak in cryptic allegories not only to tease and test the eager minds of young mages, but also to cleverly sidestep time paradoxes.</p>

<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MagicalStudy" data-content-chunk-id="49c6d8a0-e77f-4531-bfd7-2c12127c69fe"><a href="#MagicalStudy" data-content-chunk-id="0314efc0-42a1-447c-9a29-1d8e5605b9c9"></a>Magical Study</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9fac1147-27a0-4d81-a944-25595ff4674b">The fundamental work of Strixhaven University is the application of magic to academic study. Students and faculty aren’t limited to magical topics alone; they pursue studies in every facet of existence—magical or otherwise—applying magic to whatever they study. At Strixhaven, historians call the spirits of the dead to aid their lessons about the past, and arcano-biologists use necromancy to pull at life and coax out death when teaching about the natural world. Simultaneously, mage-artists sculpt elemental energy to create animate art, and arcane symbologists teach students how to recognize and understand the magical glyphs they encounter.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PrinciplesandPolarities" data-content-chunk-id="e0295e7f-f725-4524-b3aa-d13f4caf6b5c"><a href="#PrinciplesandPolarities" data-content-chunk-id="498bf652-3fb1-4a45-8e40-b3104451791f"></a>Principles and Polarities</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b1adca12-f16b-4f6a-8170-1b9b1c7f3802">The colleges and curriculum at Strixhaven are organized around the idea of philosophical principles joined in concordant opposition. Each school embraces the paradoxical unity of two polar principles: life and death, order and chaos, reason and emotion, and so on. The five Founder Dragons are thought to embody the coexistence of these principles, while the ten deans of the colleges stand for the individual principles distinguished from their opposites.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6a5b242e-817e-4177-98eb-096356cf1b0e">A student’s course of learning at Strixhaven involves exploring the tension between these opposing principles, which typically involves late-night arguments in residence halls and study rooms. The university’s teaching philosophy is built on the idea that exploring opposites leads to an understanding of a greater whole. Most people believe that only a being with the wisdom (and long life) of the Founder Dragons or the archaics can truly master both halves of a school’s dichotomy, but a mage must learn at least the rudiments of those halves. A Strixhaven graduate is expected to leave the university prepared to argue the fundamental issues of their school’s philosophies.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Faculty" data-content-chunk-id="cad591cc-aefd-42de-8b95-47db3a181cb6"><a href="#Faculty" data-content-chunk-id="b0cdb7cc-e8b1-4dce-bd18-124d0148ee70"></a>Faculty</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6b801b07-2d4f-44df-bc1a-308cd8b4d1b1">The faculty members of Strixhaven are mages and scholars—experts in their various fields and in the use of magic to enhance their studies. They are dedicated to their research and to educating generations of mage-students who follow in their footsteps. Some faculty members value research more than teaching, while others make education their highest priority. But all find some balance between the two.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Instructors" data-content-chunk-id="bdd6c66b-dc31-404b-9ff6-5fd1246d3ef5"><a href="#Instructors" data-content-chunk-id="dd76ca94-e756-4c5d-af63-b3901d01a6a9"></a>Instructors</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ae7a8a5f-8740-454c-a301-22529b9272c0">Strixhaven’s faculty begin their careers as instructors, focusing primarily on teaching classes and crafting curriculum, while the school administration evaluates their performance. At the end of a provisional period, which can last from one to several years, an instructor is elevated to the rank of professor or let go.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Professors" data-content-chunk-id="d045af4b-52dd-44e6-aa28-20d59ae32c86"><a href="#Professors" data-content-chunk-id="f2e57ae7-9091-4a3b-a27c-7433af370db6"></a>Professors</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7f14ae43-97ab-4955-848b-25bc8720887d">Professors who have distinguished themselves over the course of a long career—typically at least twenty years—hope to be recognized with the title of esteemed professor. This honor is bestowed in recognition of groundbreaking research as well as exceptional teaching.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a9c7ad18-1001-41a7-913a-8f0811a45da9">Upon retiring, a professor receives the title of mage emeritus. Mages emeriti are held in high esteem and welcomed to campus as guest lecturers.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Students" data-content-chunk-id="28aeaf75-6f4a-4da6-9607-11474074d86b"><a href="#Students" data-content-chunk-id="15da49ac-0b91-47df-b97f-6002bf6f0c6c"></a>Students</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="03f8e855-b1b5-4448-be63-9d80dc4ed9d3">Students at Strixhaven spend their first year in a course of general studies, which lays the foundation for the more specialized work to follow. During this year, they wear a uniform of black, white, and gray. They’re encouraged to study broadly so that they become acquainted with a wide range of disciplines.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f4f5a931-45fc-4c51-b381-bf872503c40c">First-year students live in dormitories located on the central campus and often form close friendships there that last throughout their educational careers, even when members of tight-knit groups of friends join different colleges in their second year. A few students continue to live on central campus after choosing a college, particularly if they pursue extensive studies in multiple colleges or work as resident advisers to first-year students. But most students move to dormitories located on their chosen college’s campus in their second year.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ChoosingaCollege" data-content-chunk-id="f1922b45-4568-4380-974a-e30484d1fa88"><a href="#ChoosingaCollege" data-content-chunk-id="75eabcf3-b9e8-4270-bc9d-a5db54f68bfd"></a>Choosing a College</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="041020e3-8481-4f6b-9475-75c5ca545f14">Before starting their second year of studies, students choose one of the five colleges—<a href="#LoreholdCollege" title="Lorehold" data-content-chunk-id="ab8646a0-feb2-4f84-b130-dbb458923050">Lorehold</a>, <a href="#PrismariCollege" title="Prismari" data-content-chunk-id="a147afcb-d27b-4382-97e9-6ad2b01892f5">Prismari</a>, <a href="#QuandrixCollege" title="Quandrix" data-content-chunk-id="381fc289-eaa7-42cc-a97c-575707ea04da">Quandrix</a>, <a href="#SilverquillCollege" title="Silverquill" data-content-chunk-id="2570f262-e0d1-497f-9ba5-91805843cc28">Silverquill</a>, or <a href="#WitherbloomCollege" title="Witherbloom" data-content-chunk-id="8d32be62-788c-48fa-84b2-fe667419a246">Witherbloom</a>—to be their academic home for the remainder of their education. From this point, students wear uniforms featuring the colors of their college, though these outfits aren’t as unvarying as the first-year garb.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="123d5ae9-418c-4a25-b982-f4d06eb534a3"><em><strong>Two Counselors.</strong></em> Upon choosing a college, a student is assigned two professors to serve as counselors to help the student plan a course of studies. The two deans of the college assign these two counselors, who represent the poles of the college’s philosophical opposition. By design, the two counselors tend to offer conflicting advice, forcing the student to navigate opposing principles. For example, a student pursuing historical studies in Lorehold College might have one counselor who focuses on the unpredictable, war-filled chaos of historical reality and another who dwells on the idea of an orderly progression toward an ideal. The former might encourage the student to choose courses based on gut feeling, to delve into the military aspects of an issue, and to supplement their academic studies with some practical martial training. The other counselor, meanwhile, might offer several ordered, rational proposals for course selection, focus on the political and human aspects of historical issues, and place less emphasis on martial prowess. The student must then navigate this conflicting advice and chart their own course.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1d92b766-5e27-44d0-9bc9-61cbcfafc79d"><em><strong>Course of Study.</strong></em> Some students, having chosen a college, spend virtually all their remaining school years on that campus and study with those professors, diving into their preferred area of study and related fields. Other students take as many as a third of their classes in other colleges, continuing the breadth of their first-year education and looking for places where the perspectives of other disciplines can bring new insight to their studies. Both approaches are encouraged at the university.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="AfterStrixhaven" data-content-chunk-id="86c680a0-8c09-4e13-9692-41d67d0e529e"><a href="#AfterStrixhaven" data-content-chunk-id="1db5d44f-8f88-42f0-87b2-c80287e10992"></a>After Strixhaven</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2689b6eb-9830-4145-a2fb-f19181dc47a4">A student’s course of study at Strixhaven lasts at least four years but allows for advanced study for several years beyond that time frame. Most students eventually graduate, though, and they walk a variety of paths after leaving the university. Many return to whatever home they came from, putting what they have learned to use in their communities. Some mages travel the multiverse in search of ever-greater magic, continuing their research in some form beyond the confines of an academic program. A few alumni return to Strixhaven, sooner or later, as instructors themselves, and a small, select number join the Dragonsguard, an elite force of mages who work with the Founder Dragons.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Administration" data-content-chunk-id="b2c1f5b2-c18c-4d3f-bb78-3b89e1eceadc"><a href="#Administration" data-content-chunk-id="c0097b2c-7fd6-41fe-a0c8-3b0ea1cf9be7"></a>Administration</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e0a71981-e3f6-4422-b77a-3e72e1c33876">The day-to-day functioning of Strixhaven relies on hundreds of laborers, clerks, coaches, administrators, and others. These personnel include folk like Mavinda Sharpbeak, the kindly owlin guidance counselor who takes first-year students under her wing, and Gyome, the troll chef of Witherbloom College. In addition to legions of people who devote their lives to the university’s operations, numerous automatons and artificial life-forms—various kinds of Constructs—serve in various roles, including campus guides and library assistants.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ba7f3539-b4e5-4320-a9ef-d215b564423c">All these operations are managed by an administration overseen by the ten deans, two in each college. Each dean is an esteemed professor who embraces one side of their school’s philosophical dichotomy. The deans, like the professors who serve as counselors to students, view it as their role to disagree with each other and guide the college by way of their arguments. Furthermore, rivalries among the deans only exacerbate this combative attitude.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f5049577-81ed-4133-b17b-2f4acd852bcf">When the argumentative deans fail to chart a coherent course for Strixhaven, the Founder Dragons are occasionally forced to intervene. They don’t step in directly, but a director known as the Voice of the Founders—currently an imposing man named Taiva—speaks on the dragons’ behalf.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Mascots" data-content-chunk-id="2b7e42d4-e3c9-4a97-aa58-316cd1aa8098"><a href="#Mascots" data-content-chunk-id="0daf9b77-d84c-4fce-bc62-ee6c5a63172c"></a>Mascots</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d72e052e-f9f8-48e0-a53e-0ded0076863e">Each of Strixhaven’s five colleges has a mascot—a small creature associated with the magic of the school and often found wandering their respective campuses. Witherbloom’s mascots, pests, are naturally found in the world around the campus. The other colleges’ mascots are brought into being through magic. The Strixhaven Mascots table lists the mascots by college. Each of these mascots is detailed in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes/" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="1cf86066-4c4f-455e-8122-e6e8cdd43210">chapter 7</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="88e97f58-a807-45ac-b005-df73c14c4467">The five kinds of mascots act as companions for students and faculty, sometimes serving as willing subjects for experiments or demonstrations, and occasionally even helping out in a duel or a more serious combat situation. Most notably, mascots are also playing pieces of sorts in the Strixhaven sport of Mage Tower, described in more detail in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/hunt-for-mage-tower/" title="chapter 4" data-content-chunk-id="d566bfd9-2577-4c52-99b0-862a8d6e99f5">chapter 4</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d18819d0-87ca-4f19-9541-327b88eb8b0e">Strixhaven occupies hundreds of acres, spread out over six campuses. Each of the university’s five colleges has its own campus, and the central campus, home to the Biblioplex and Strixhaven Stadium, serves as a hub for university life. See the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/campus-map/" title="appendix" data-content-chunk-id="81a76e96-9a83-4d95-8bfe-37e35c18a82e">appendix</a> or the poster map for a view of the entire university.</p>
<a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-center" href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/sacoc/zBbqVwSoOPBn2DCM/01-013.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title=""><img src="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/sacoc/zBbqVwSoOPBn2DCM/01-013.png" class="ddb-lightbox-inner" style="width: 275px;" alt=""></a>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b313845d-3158-42db-9920-0281f7ba1e6e">Well-maintained roads connect the six campuses, and walking from one to another can take a half-hour or more. Regular shuttles—large carriages drawn by horselike automata—run on an hourly schedule between a station near the Biblioplex and each of the satellite campuses, making the journey in about 15 minutes. In addition, each campus has multiple permanent teleportation circles, which faculty and more advanced students can use when they require instantaneous travel, and several magical portals exist as well. These portals can be unpredictable: they aren’t necessarily open all the time, they don’t always lead to the same places, and some require complicated conditions or keys to open.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="329d9459-9e4a-4dd4-aa4b-7af49b4eca80">The central campus—shown on map 1.1—is the heart of Strixhaven. Its extensive grounds include residence halls for first-year students, dining halls, administration buildings, classrooms and laboratories (mostly used for first-year classes and interdisciplinary studies), and space for social gatherings.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f0c9e28c-3619-45aa-8208-c28820490373">Two of the sites on map 1.1 are described elsewhere in the book: Aerojaunt Field (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/party-at-the-rose-stage#Map42aerojauntfield" title="chapter 4" data-content-chunk-id="74bedb18-5714-4584-a3c3-705059042e2b">chapter 4</a>) and Captain Dapplewing’s Manor (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/work-hard-play-harder#Map34captaindapplewingsmanor" title="chapter 3" data-content-chunk-id="02b50e7b-fae8-4152-863d-26d9b9ca9aea">chapter 3</a>).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="60c111ce-6e9c-46ec-8c74-a334ee000341">The center of Strixhaven is the Biblioplex, the university’s main library. At the heart of the library is a snarl, a tangle in the fabric of magic, that glows like a miniature sun in the grand Hall of Oracles. A star arch called the Dawnbow curves across the sky above the library, marking its location as a center of mystic learning.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="35767e01-41a1-42e2-812e-c18b16ebdac9">Arches welcome inquisitive minds into the library. Inside, almost every surface from the floor to the high ceiling is jammed with stacks of books. The interior of the Biblioplex is vast, with long hallways, archive chambers tall enough to have their own weather, and even pools and moat-passages crossable only by boat.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91ba91b4-dbec-40aa-8f87-4c0860c38f80">Five lines of beacon-towers radiate from the Biblioplex like enormous spokes. These Torches of Enlightenment stretch out to the five college campuses and beyond, more than a hundred miles into the surrounding countryside. They burn perpetually with magical flame, symbolizing the path toward learning and an escape from ignorance.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ArchwayCommons" data-content-chunk-id="a16a974b-aa6e-4a03-a9f6-70c9627f5e15"><a href="#ArchwayCommons" data-content-chunk-id="b1351771-4062-4045-b019-0c0f227d731a"></a>Archway Commons</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="af31e8ab-1e44-40e2-888e-4d137402eb7b">Just south of the Biblioplex, a star arch curves overhead like a smaller echo of the Dawnbow, and a lush park, Archway Commons, marks the site. More familiarly called the Commons, the park is a favorite spot for students—especially first-years—to gather in fair weather or to wander through on dates. Some of the university’s clubs also use the park to host social gatherings and games, including live-action roleplaying games and casual sports.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FirejoltCaf" data-content-chunk-id="89a9b177-62f0-422d-9232-d826c18486df"><a href="#FirejoltCaf" data-content-chunk-id="69940771-262c-44a3-910a-81200ece4e66"></a>Firejolt Café</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="74857820-dbf5-40a4-aeb0-3570b31c342f">At the edge of Archway Commons and just outside the Biblioplex stands the cozy Firejolt Café, where students cram both information and caffeine into themselves before exams. The café’s name comes from its trademark beverage, which the manager, an elf mage named Ellina, brews with her fire magic. The Firejolt has a reputation as a hangout for first-year students, but older students from all five colleges can be seen inside at all hours.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BowsEndTavern" data-content-chunk-id="6238eeb2-51b7-490e-816c-032ce49f64d5"><a href="#BowsEndTavern" data-content-chunk-id="8778f12e-7bac-4c4a-bf50-23f8cdb27b3c"></a>Bow’s End Tavern</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4a4f2df0-4faf-4a55-a6fa-afdd147dac92">At the western end of the Dawnbow, where it meets the ground, stands a smaller university landmark: Bow’s End Tavern, which serves as a hangout for older students. Most patrons come for the live music, deliciously greasy food, and various potions and beverages. Others come to settle their differences in wild duels in the lot behind the tavern. The tavern’s manager is a kind but strict orc named Tulk “the Bulk” Tusktooth.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e0b51f6e-deb1-4949-bd8e-73771f1c917b">Lorehold is the College of Archaeomancy—a term that describes the exploration of ancient things through magic. Its mages explore the past by poring over archaeological sites, calling forth magical energy from old tomes, and summoning the spirits of long-dead historical figures. Lorehold mages travel far and wide across the world, gathering relics of bygone ages and learning dead languages to unpack the secrets of history.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="be51d46b-1ad5-42ab-8b91-41870e648d57">Lorehold College is devoted to the study of history, broadly understood to include the various aspects of culture, behavior, and social relationships that shape historical events. Its studies include various subdivisions of history (military history, social history, cultural history), archaeology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, religion, and economics. It overlaps with Prismari College in the field of art history, with some students splitting their studies between the two colleges. Lorehold mages use their magic to unearth secrets and share illumination.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9d9a75da-6d86-40c8-9643-cbbb986f6edd">Lorehold’s two deans carry the titles Dean of Order and Dean of Chaos, as order versus chaos encapsulates the fundamental conflict at the heart of Lorehold’s philosophy. This conflict revolves around the forces that underlie and drive history. Is the course of time driving toward a well-ordered ideal state or slowly devolving into chaos? Are deep patterns hidden in historical texts, or is time a series of coincidence and happenstance?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4c2b4320-73d8-448f-8c5b-048b39033043">The perspective of order emphasizes the structures that pull people together—law, religion, economics, education, social class, and so on—and how those structures drive historical events. Order focuses on systemic changes and the actions of people collectively.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="26d7949d-4000-4055-ab08-7961797ef8b7">The perspective of chaos, by contrast, emphasizes individual actions, personal bonds of families and friends, and the disruptive force of lone, passionate people in history. Scholars of chaos gravitate toward reckless discovery and the spirit of adventure in their research of the past—the essence and emotion of history over precision or procedure.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2bba3304-62bb-4252-90fc-8a9f74798808">Augusta Tullus (lawful neutral human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160311-lorehold-professor-of-order" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160311-tooltip">Lorehold professor of order</a>) is the current Dean of Order. A professor of spirit studies, she has been called the college’s most talented pastraiser. She can conjure entire legions of ghostly apparitions to reenact historical events for her lectures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="50adf567-a630-4d3b-92c9-80aee4689046">Augusta believes that history repeats itself as an orderly progression toward an ideal. In her view, the mistakes of the past can inform the choices of the present, creating a world of peace and order. She plays things by the book and frowns on students who embark on Dean Plargg’s dangerous field trips.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b4b121f3-6c7f-4576-9ff6-04fbecd018b9">Characters have ample opportunity to meet Dean Tullus in the adventure presented in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/the-magisters-masquerade/" title="chapter 5" data-content-chunk-id="d3c7670d-636c-442a-884e-970f20786848">chapter 5</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="552c1587-bb8a-4d78-8015-45c4c790abff">Plargg (chaotic good orc <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160310-lorehold-professor-of-chaos" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160310-tooltip">Lorehold professor of chaos</a>) is the current Dean of Chaos. Specializing in military history, Plargg is known for his perfect recall of historical stories, as well as his potent scroll magic. Blind himself, he invented a form of magical embossing called heat lettering, which provides a tactile way to read texts.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd3e7d89-f8b7-4dab-a902-a110e3e40c44">Plargg believes that history is full of unpredictable, war-filled chaos and that his students must be ready for anything. He teaches that no rewards come without risk, and his excursions typically end with students heading to the infirmary. He pays little attention to Dean Tullus’s work, usually dismissing her attempts to find order in chaos as foolhardy.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HofriGhostforge" data-content-chunk-id="c86a58e9-cdeb-4d94-b6c0-921dd60ac631"><a href="#HofriGhostforge" data-content-chunk-id="e0124879-448f-4804-b5c5-d0c79bf29bb6"></a>Hofri Ghostforge</h4>

A diligent student, he quickly mastered the technical skills of art, but his magic left something to be desired. After talking with the school’s counselor, Mavinda, Hofri decided to try his luck with Lorehold. It turned out he had a natural talent for Lorehold’s spirit magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6ed571dc-921b-4b01-a18f-a98e677fdbab">His time at Prismari was hardly wasted, however. Combining his artistic skill with his keen spiritual sense, Hofri could visualize a spirit’s mortal appearance and construct a viable statue form for them to inhabit. No one in Lorehold’s history had previously created a spirit statue from scratch, and Hofri was offered a professorial position after graduation, which he happily accepted.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="OsgirtheReconstructor" data-content-chunk-id="d94e3c98-820c-4d7c-8c25-572559f082bd"><a href="#OsgirtheReconstructor" data-content-chunk-id="9233c318-0ee4-44f3-96f3-f2a10068f6e6"></a>Osgir, the Reconstructor</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6f8b49d9-3128-40e6-af95-74138b4dba9b">Even by Lorehold standards, Osgir (neutral <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17024-stone-giant" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17024-tooltip">stone giant</a>) is obsessed with relics of the past. A professor of order, he treasures every connection to old civilizations, whether it’s a magnificent jeweled crown or an old shovel. As a student, he constantly spent time in detention for hoarding the best finds from Lorehold dig sites in his room; he lost count of how many times he was sternly told, “History belongs to us all!”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="54a0905a-05db-498f-84a7-1e92d1a57652">So, naturally, he mastered the magical art of duplicative restoration. Not only can he perfectly recreate an ancient object or device from the smallest scrap, but he can also produce a second, identical version for his personal collection. He displays something different every week in his Lorehold office, from a mighty sword of demon-slaying to a delicate elven music box.</p>
<aside class="rules-text" id="GolwandatheBloodspiller">
<p>GOLWANDA THE BLOODSPILLER</p>
<p>“Have you met Golwanda yet?” is a question that older Lorehold students love to ask second-year students, new to the college. Sooner or later, one professor or another summons this spirit of a notorious stone giant warmonger, ostensibly as a cautionary tale about the dire fate that befalls a society that loses control of its aggressive impulses. Golwanda plays her role with relish, doing her best to strike terror into the students with her bloodcurdling screams and howls of rage.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ece6daca-acbb-446c-8ef9-23ecd2a35f10">The Lorehold campus—shown on map 1.2—is situated northwest of the central campus in a region of stark vertical relief. Rugged mesas and steep hills rise from a wide plain, and a great chasm holds the excavated ruins of an ancient settlement. Several star arches encircle rocky peaks and outcroppings, testifying to the powerful magical energy in the vicinity—energy once harnessed by the ancients who used to inhabit this area.</p>

Ruins and upgraded halls together are now used for research, classwork, and housing. Precarious bridges link one neighborhood of Pillardrop to another, often directly passing the enormous stone faces of old statues. Every Lorehold class has a story of some careless student making a misstep on one of these bridges or in some particularly crumbling section of the ruins, sometimes with disastrous consequences—and sometimes finding deliverance when a spirit statue appears from nowhere to catch the hapless student before they suffer serious harm.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="03e510ad-5ab0-4f41-af03-26c89c7d1a44">Prismari, the College of Elemental Arts, is devoted to the study and practice of art intertwined with magic. The mage-students of Prismari wield magic in spectacles of creativity: masterpieces of showy, over-the-top magic. They use elemental magic to express who they are and how they see the world, often combining different types of energy—fire, water, air, earth, lightning, heat, cold—in powerful expressions of conflict and harmony.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="509ca45f-091d-4efe-a2ac-2e8b1c33f9eb">Prismari College is dedicated to the arts. Its scholars view art as the fundamental form of self-expression and magic as a tool, a medium, and an inspiration. Prismari studies focus on visual arts (including architecture, painting, and sculpture) and performing arts (such as dance, music, and theater). The curriculum overlaps with Lorehold in the field of art history and with Silverquill in the literary arts, and some students divide their time between Prismari and one of those other schools to pursue these interdisciplinary fields. Prismari mages use magic to weave the elements into their creations; they might juxtapose fire alongside paint, ceramics, or fabric, or they might choreograph elaborate works that unite a dancer’s movements with gusts and eddies of air.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PerfectionandExpression" data-content-chunk-id="89e83640-e900-496b-b312-55046d549cd7"><a href="#PerfectionandExpression" data-content-chunk-id="e7ae6758-f148-4336-9e7f-4e37d77eddb9"></a>Perfection and Expression</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8822bf18-a761-4d5e-8d54-e5ca9222f187">Prismari’s two deans carry the titles Dean of Perfection and Dean of Expression, and they often express the fundamental conflict of their philosophy as perfection versus expression—or, sometimes, as intellect versus emotion. What is the purpose of art? Is it to make people think things or make people feel things? Is it supposed to be carefully thought out or raw and spontaneous? Is mastery of art a matter of honing precise techniques to a point of perfection or of perfectly expressing a raw emotional state? Does art aspire to express universal truths or intensely personal ones?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e711aa3-c235-4474-a378-b9c79b5aba34">The perspective of perfection focuses on technique, analysis, theory, aesthetics, and universal principles. It embraces intellect over emotion, strives to be thought-provoking and reflective, and aspires to mastery. Its mages tend to use elemental forces of cold, water, and wind.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="28ea06f3-061b-41c7-b78f-9acba8a0f459">The perspective of expression instead emphasizes the portrayal of personal emotional truths. Its mages value improvisation, innovation, and rule-breaking, and they often favor elemental magic using fire, lightning, and earth.</p>
<aside class="rules-text compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="OctaviatheLivingThesis">
<p>OCTAVIA, THE LIVING THESIS</p>
<p>Crafted as a graduate’s final project many years ago, Octavia (a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17051-water-elemental" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17051-tooltip">water elemental</a> that looks like an enormous octopus) took up residence on campus and never left.

<p data-content-chunk-id="97e63bfe-3f0b-4028-8bb1-8a221d6068e3">Uvilda Mistcoiler (neutral good genasi <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160321-prismari-professor-of-perfection" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160321-tooltip">Prismari professor of perfection</a>) is the current Dean of Perfection. A master of artistic technique, Uvilda trains with a range of elements whenever she isn’t focused on her teaching. She is known for giving students profoundly insightful feedback, which she tailors to each individual. After a review, she often offers a small piece of advice that alters the student’s point of view and work forever—for the better.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6572500e-bab9-4a2a-84b9-e5fd37bf087d">Uvilda believes that good art comes from the head. To her, carefully measured strokes and deliberate object placement make the difference between fully realized art and a total mess. If Dean Nassari interrupts her careful work with bombastic expressions one more time, Uvilda is prepared to enroll in Quandrix to learn how to shrink Nassari.</p>

Nazzari always want to see art that is bigger, more radical in concept, and more emotionally powerful. For their final project as a mage-student, Nassari famously “turned in” an earthquake, which almost destroyed three campus buildings. The piece received a standing ovation from the mage-student body—and a grumpy thumbs down from the campus construction golems.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="29369120-c0b6-4790-ba78-762e6192b8be">Nassari believes that true expression comes from the heart. They encourage their students to treat the entire world as a canvas on which to spread emotion and excitement. Nassari takes little heed of Dean Mistcoiler’s quiet masterpieces and often feigns forgetfulness about Dean Mistcoiler’s very existence.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b10e8cb8-3eba-43c8-b67f-cd99e3b6f4b6">In addition to being an accomplished elementalist, Veyran (chaotic good genasi <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160321-prismari-professor-of-perfection" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160321-tooltip">Prismari professor of perfection</a>) serves as a mentor to many Prismari pledgemages. She advocates enthusiastically for the importance of both passion and disciplined technique in any artistic pursuit.

(In truth, though he did possess prodigious talent, they were also growing tired of their house being randomly struck by lightning or engulfed in cyclones whenever he practiced.) Even as he flourished as both mage and musician, he discovered a new aptitude: conducting.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f5fdf83d-922e-4ca2-ad42-c23ba92174d0">In addition to teaching, he serves as Grand Maestro of Strixhaven’s Orchestra of the Arcane, an elite extracurricular activity for top Prismari students.

<p data-content-chunk-id="12b23695-6997-420e-b2be-275a38d24859">The center of the Prismari campus is Conjurot Hall, a towering structure with a glassed-in observation area at the top. Constantly changing strands of elemental energy encircle the structure. Artist-mages can see for miles from Conjurot’s main turret, and the view has inspired many artistic creations.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="OpusWalk" data-content-chunk-id="eea10fd6-187f-4653-8b03-bcf8d928cd2f"><a href="#OpusWalk" data-content-chunk-id="b7c30ca3-d92c-4368-9b55-b8112c6c8d91"></a>Opus Walk</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ae46d0f-cecf-4d63-9a65-bc3c3e1512ac">Hundreds of Prismari creations are displayed along a path that winds through the central campus buildings, giving the path its name: Opus Walk. Some famous pieces of magical art have been displayed along Opus Walk for centuries, while other transient bursts of creativity last only a few moments.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5df366fa-9b06-4803-ac43-b0e33cdac46f">At the outskirts of the Prismari campus, the abandoned creations of thousands of past artist-mages have coalesced over the years into the notorious region of Furygale. Roped off by magical wards and warning signs, Furygale is several acres of ever-changing magical energy, gales of ice and wind and fire, and elementals gone rogue. While dangerous, it also provides a source of wild inspiration, and it remains a popular spot for students who want to duel without being interrupted by faculty.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="QuandrixCollege" data-content-chunk-id="11881750-fbbf-4d79-b400-235095f10100"><a href="#QuandrixCollege" data-content-chunk-id="b5f60123-82a0-4c8a-b46c-283cf47c6c9e"></a>Quandrix College</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0cb39a76-b974-4a55-aafc-131a3011646b">Quandrix is the College of Numeromancy—a term that encompasses the study of patterns, fractals, and symmetries to wield power over the fundamental mathematics of nature. Quandrix mages can summon creatures made of fractals or turn abstract theories into towering, spiraling patterns. They love to expand and multiply; they can increase their knowledge or size by bending numbers. They dwell in the overlap between the theoretical and the natural—from the fabric of their robes to the nature of their spells, they make use of repeated elements, clever symmetries, and surprising geometry to express the complex truths they study.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="66f6d1d1-c678-4591-b88b-fb44a88e67bc">The studies undertaken within Quandrix College include mathematics, physics, logic, statistics, metaphysics, and various fields of theoretical magic. Students from the other colleges occasionally delve into Quandrix courses to bolster the theoretical underpinnings of their studies, and Quandrix’s studies of nature and Witherbloom’s explorations of practical biology have some significant overlap.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SubstanceandTheory" data-content-chunk-id="248048aa-6b6f-44bd-9f77-1ddcb589ce5a"><a href="#SubstanceandTheory" data-content-chunk-id="21a7e88c-9e4e-4399-a506-c531c139196c"></a>Substance and Theory</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c19d31ff-b923-4493-84a8-392bf7eb423d">Quandrix’s two deans carry the titles Dean of Substance and Dean of Theory, reflecting the philosophical division within the college. Is mathematics a natural force that exists in the universe independent of the constructs of intelligent minds, or is it a theoretical framework created by those who study it? Is the work of the scholar to discover what is or to define what could be?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9ca3358e-9c91-4224-8045-2fa86a0bb842">The perspective of substance emphasizes physical reality. In this view, math is embodied in the natural forces of the multiverse, waiting to be discovered by those with the intellectual fortitude to delve into those secrets. Quandrix mages who embrace this view use magic to bring numerical concepts to life, creating or altering physical reality out of mathematical possibility.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a4bbe5db-d6ca-48a4-a0fb-fb892b981f86">The perspective of theory focuses on the abstract realms of conjecture and possibility. Its scholars view math as a lens through which a mind can understand the cosmos, not something that exists independently in the world. Mages who embrace this perspective use their spells to weave illusions and manipulate the fabric of magic itself.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3b5ee44f-d696-44db-9369-87056a4e9b5c">Kianne believes in using mathematics to better understand nature.

He is known for the unnerving habit of fully rotating his head around to address his students, while still rapidly chalking up complex theorems and equations on a chalkboard.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ebe4f929-ad9f-46aa-b9bb-41deb65286e6">Imbraham wants nothing more than to crack the mysteries of the world through dauntingly complex theories. He offers his students standing bounties on any of his unsolved equations.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0936c4f9-d306-4815-b9d5-7ed96fb5c14a">The Quandrix campus—shown on map 1.4—is situated in a coastal area to the northeast of the central campus, surrounded by lush woodland and abundant rivers and streams.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="74052283-49df-478c-8231-6b94b0378c4a">The central hall of Quandrix campus lies at the end of a geometric series of walkways, terminating at ascending ramps to the towering building. Inside, Torus Hall’s architecture is mapped to an ever-changing three-dimensional grid, which slowly evolves. Some Quandrix faculty members insist that mage-students shouldn’t linger too long inside the hall, lest its geometry eventually turn itself inside out while students are still within it.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheArithmodrome" data-content-chunk-id="2c117775-c8af-4b5b-be25-88e39c8365aa"><a href="#TheArithmodrome" data-content-chunk-id="1779b2e9-fcae-41bb-9332-396190f8cbdc"></a>The Arithmodrome</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="027e4ec9-7709-4b47-b775-2fb406a5a4b5">The Quandrix campus is alive with dynamic sculptures made of water behaving in odd ways: cube-shaped fountains, arching aqueducts that flow through the air, towers of solid-seeming water. One water structure holds a secret: a mysterious inner expanse called the Arithmodrome. From the outside, the Arithmodrome looks like a large cube of water, ten feet on each side. The inside is an apparently boundless theory-space that suspends the rules of reality. Mages use this space to explore theoretical numerical possibilities.</p>
<aside class="rules-text" id="EsixFractalBloom">
<p>ESIX, FRACTAL BLOOM</p>
<p>Tasked with devising an infinite equation, a group of Quandrix students accidentally created Esix, a living theorem obsessed with infinity. Over the years, a few professors have tried to deactivate it, but all their formulas somehow end up dividing by zero and fizzling out. Esix never seems to register these would-be threats, as it remains consumed by its own calculations.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0643e39d-db90-48e7-9f52-0408ccc9f87c">The Cultivarium is an eye-popping, sun-drenched garden of spiraling, cyclical plants and fractalized animals. Quandrix faculty members have repeatedly taught growth spells in this part of campus, and over the centuries, the area has come to intensify any growth magic cast within it.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SilverquillCollege" data-content-chunk-id="6e0a7044-3719-4e5e-88c5-8c533e26ef8d"><a href="#SilverquillCollege" data-content-chunk-id="4f56c033-f3a9-40c7-b449-c25415c7a7ad"></a>Silverquill College</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aacac5e7-3200-4ab3-8750-007e35dac0bf">Silverquill is the College of Eloquence, and its mages—stylish, intimidating, and driven—are masters of the magic of words. They create spells from spoken-word battle poetry or magical manifestations of the written word, scribing patterns of runic ink in the air. These mages make for natural leaders, fiercely competitive, with a piercing wit and a never-second-place attitude.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="19e05e1b-c3ec-4abc-8a21-83432c5d094d">The curriculum of Silverquill College revolves around words, encompassing literature (including fiction, essays, drama, and poetry), languages, linguistics, oratory, rhetoric, and dramatic performance. Students from other colleges often take Silverquill courses to improve their communication skills, learning to speak and write more effectively about their primary field of study. Silverquill and Prismari see overlap in the area of performing arts, with Silverquill emphasizing verbal performance and Prismari focusing more on dance and other forms of movement.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RadianceandShadow" data-content-chunk-id="b8d0063d-a466-4bc2-944a-7238d2ae7cfb"><a href="#RadianceandShadow" data-content-chunk-id="0f3aa020-265a-4f2c-b883-12a70009d99c"></a>Radiance and Shadow</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d0c9976-0664-444f-9935-3f9f2003b7fa">The two deans of Silverquill are called the Dean of Radiance and the Dean of Shadow, highlighting the college’s use of metaphor in describing its philosophical differences. The metaphor of radiance and shadow takes concrete form in Silverquill magic, as students learn to manifest brilliant light or inky darkness with their spells. The fundamental argument among Silverquill’s scholars centers on the purpose of communication. Is it to help others or further a personal agenda? Does literature selflessly better society or selfishly advance one’s own goals?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aae607af-0f53-436e-8331-325bbeb4e74a">The college’s perspective of radiance envisions language as sunlight emanating from the speaker or writer to illuminate others and make the world a brighter place. Mages who embrace this view use their language skills—and their magic—to uplift and empower others, to shine light on the evils of society, and to inspire the best in those around them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1d00c72a-8d34-42d6-a77a-39d1e558174e">The college’s perspective of shadow focuses on the power of language to stab, to expose stinging truths, and to obfuscate secrets. The magic of shadow mages often manifests as bolts or blades of darkness or blotches of flowing ink, and its effects range from a sting of shame to an assault on the target’s life energy.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d9224270-90ed-4a60-a077-a20a08a2052f">Dean Shaile Talonrook (lawful good owlin <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160332-silverquill-professor-of-radiance" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160332-tooltip">Silverquill professor of radiance</a>) is a perennially optimistic orator. A master of literature, she often quotes obscure passages from famous texts. Her soul-filling advice and educated references have been known to make people literally glow.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a3060a1d-4aa8-48be-a919-28d5a43e9cd8">Shaile believes that all people have the potential for good and wishes to teach her students how to make the world a better place. She and Dean Lu often clash over Silverquill’s curriculum, but the balance found between them is far more eloquent than even their words can describe.</p>

Scant with praise and quick with a cutting remark, Dean Lu has seen many mage-students scrub out of Strixhaven and has nothing good to say about those who can’t hack it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="60443db6-c691-4c14-a166-5f1a1d88a336">A cynic, Embrose believes that most people are in it for themselves. He demands his students learn how to use language-based magic to “get what they deserve.” While he often argues with Dean Talonrook, he holds a deep (if begrudging) respect for the owlin.</p>

If she wants you to do something, you won’t just do it—you’ll be sure it was your idea all along. Her students and colleagues alike hang on her every word, and in front of a crowd, she’s a powerhouse of charisma, enhancing her speeches with elegant swirls of ink magic. Though she’s an elite mage who can easily hold her own in a fight, Breena prefers to defeat her foes with words alone.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7ea60e21-34e9-4ffc-8671-54153f8663cd">An Oriq agent once trapped and attempted to recruit her, threatening her students’ lives if she didn’t comply. Within an hour, she convinced him to free her, abandon his wicked ways, and seek wisdom from the archaics.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5eaaa914-0d8b-4c99-a9f4-9e8009ba32c7">The Rose Stage is a rotating circular platform on the Silverquill campus. It has a backdrop of roses made of magical ink (tributes left by spectators of past performances), which creates excellent acoustics. Mage-students meet at the Rose Stage to practice performances, spar, or engage in honor duels. Faculty members often observe performances at the Rose Stage, coaching the students in their magical and rhetorical displays.</p>

Students can avail themselves of the preparation space called the Gray Room (actually a chain of rooms), which has hair and makeup salons, voice rehearsal booths, mirrored rehearsal spaces, and spa facilities. The back of the Dramarium has a special sensory deprivation chamber for mage-students who want complete silence in which to meditate.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="659ed069-a871-4e36-a845-ec7ddf7e5ced">At Witherbloom, the College of Essence Studies, mages draw power from the opposing forces of life and death. These mages brew their spells from natural components and the essence of living creatures, using that power to heal or harm the living or to raise or entreat the dead. They can cause entire forests to blossom out of nowhere or call down old curses that scourge flesh from bone. Some Witherbloom mages defend ecosystems from pollution, while others revel in the power of corruption. They’re at home riding zombie crocodiles down a languid river, picking herbs for a potion to treat a disease, brooding over a chorus of swamp frogs, or summoning fearsome avatars of nature.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8689b4c3-97c8-4efc-9f27-87bc1ef4af7b">The curriculum of Witherbloom College focuses on various sciences, revolving around the life sciences. Biology, ecology, botany, chemistry, and related sciences combine with the study and manipulation of the magical energy of the Positive Plane and the Negative Plane, the primal forces of life and death. Witherbloom’s curriculum shares some overlap with Quandrix’s analysis of the mathematical patterns in nature.</p>

These titles are a somewhat abstract way of framing the core division in the college’s philosophy: is growth or decay the driving force in nature?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c03cfe4c-fb03-4fa9-81d8-a76f2fd95026">The philosophy of the root (growth) focuses on life and its irrepressible drive to thrive. This view celebrates the diversity and adaptability of life-forms, from the tiniest cells to the most complex networks of living things. The growth philosophy asserts that the urge to survive and reproduce is the most essential principle in the cosmos. Mages who adopt this view wield positive energy and practice healing magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="778872c5-9c56-4897-9653-cf9629e0c164">The philosophy of the vein (decay) focuses on the inevitability of death and decay. Its traditional name comes from the prominence of vampires within the college, whose conceptions of draining life through the vein have long proven an important counterweight to the growth philosophy of Witherbloom. The decay philosophy sees life energy as a resource to be consumed, rather than a good to be nourished for its own sake. Mages who adopt this view wield negative energy and practice necromancy.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c9199981-0408-431b-a688-60af37348510">Dean Lissette (neutral good human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160341-witherbloom-professor-of-growth" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160341-tooltip">Witherbloom professor of growth</a>) is a world-class healer and herbalist; it’s even said she once cured the Lorehold founder dragon of a secret illness. Lisette’s classes lean more toward demonstration and hands-on experience than lectures. When Lisette speaks, her words are soft and full of colorful metaphors.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="82955f5a-7c9c-4766-902d-1561a205c0ba">Lisette believes in preserving nature and life, and she instills in her students a respect for all living things. While Dean Valentin’s exploitation of living creatures disgusts her, she also knows she can use the results of his cruelty to help future lives.</p>

Valentin is a kind of sangromancer—he receives visions from the blood he consumes, which he uses to learn things about a creature or place. He has no qualms about exploiting the bayou’s creatures for personal gain.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="90d12c8e-57cd-4d0f-b7cb-95ea55a486df">Valentin’s classes focus on dissection and decay. He and Dean Lisette often clash over his cavalier treatment of animals, but that hasn’t stopped her from using his discoveries for her research.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b3d8544a-0411-4699-b9fd-9ca604763b82">No one knows how old Willowdusk (neutral good <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17037-treant" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17037-tooltip">treant</a>) really is. This professor of growth claims to be older than Strixhaven itself, and although many suspect that she exaggerates, no one else who has lived long enough to refute her cares to do so. Many years ago, a group of rebellious students got lost in Detention Bog and took shelter in what turned out to be Willowdusk’s roots. She protected them from a pack of hungry groffs and shepherded them back to Widdershins Hall, offering a lecture on proper herb-gathering practices during the journey.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="66a67981-c1c3-4274-87c0-2f8cb85c6f03">Her lessons proved so effective that she was asked to stay as a professor. She loves passing on her knowledge of medicinal herbs, pest mascot cultivation, and dissection techniques to generations of new students, and she almost always has a pot of tea brewing.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CreatureType" data-content-chunk-id="1bdca0c1-1cbd-45ab-bd9a-fc09d05fa6d3"><a href="#CreatureType" data-content-chunk-id="076d6666-8601-4adc-ba46-c903084c5a26"></a>Creature Type</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="97f649b7-937a-4085-94c1-392b64089093">Every creature in D&amp;D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters, including owlin, are of the Humanoid type. Creature types don’t have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the text of the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2056-tooltip">cure wounds</a> spell specifies that the spell doesn’t work on a creature that has the Construct type.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3a7e2c75-12cc-4d1b-b9cc-9b353e0fe769">The typical life span of a player character in D&amp;D is about a century, assuming the character doesn’t meet a violent end on an adventure.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HeightandWeight" data-content-chunk-id="29350b95-0bf1-4cf7-b16e-0791e31ba207"><a href="#HeightandWeight" data-content-chunk-id="fd4ad39a-137f-4b12-a3bb-cba64d32e748"></a>Height and Weight</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bd15cc88-3699-4459-9279-1be168c76c57">Player characters, including owlin, typically fall into the same ranges of height and weight that humans have in our world. If you’d like to determine your character’s height or weight randomly, consult the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/personality-and-background#RandomHeightandWeightTable" title="Random Height and Weight" data-content-chunk-id="2d24994e-791c-485f-a8c8-f66e884b669c">Random Height and Weight</a> table in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" title="Player’s Handbook" data-content-chunk-id="b9436373-30fa-4fa6-9322-60f65293c8af">Player’s Handbook</a>, and choose the row in the table that best represents the build you imagine for your character.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e48b2597-8dca-4cb9-93cf-c29bb5cce2ab">Distant kin of giant owls from the Feywild, owlin come in many shapes and sizes, from petite and fluffy to wide-winged and majestic. Owlin have arms and legs like other Humanoids, as well as wings that extend from their back and shoulders.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4bdb8712-d883-4b6d-a3c2-bafe8098f026">Like owls, owlin are graced with feathers that make no sound when they move or fly, making it easy for them to sneak up on you in the library.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="005ce2c3-3115-48b4-ac4e-f1f6695ad2ea">Your owlin character might be nocturnal. Or perhaps your character is simply prone to rise later, embodying the common nickname of night owl.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="44c5856e-b2ae-4163-9ac0-031fed74b922"><em><strong>Flight.</strong></em> Thanks to your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can’t use this flying speed if you’re wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da737921-0fab-44f2-8fea-15a860e66ca2"><em><strong>Silent Feathers.</strong></em> You have proficiency in the <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/5-tooltip">Stealth</a> skill.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cfa3658e-e843-4658-a6a3-10a1a8c11114">At Strixhaven, students choose their colleges at the start of their second year. But even during a character’s first year, you make college-related decisions for your character, such as a background choice. From the start, your character is making decisions that will lead to their eventual college choice.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b2b4d7a8-9c1d-4309-89b5-8318bf81280c"><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/life-at-strixhaven" title="Chapter 1" data-content-chunk-id="886faedb-4174-4d94-b144-899e80afc2e9">Chapter 1</a> describes each of the colleges.

<p>A STRIXHAVEN PARTY</p>
<p>If you’re starting a Strixhaven campaign with the introductory adventure in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/campus-kerfuffle/" title="chapter 3">chapter 3</a>, that adventure gives all the advice you need to bring a party of characters together. The adventure assumes that the characters are first-year students who are participating in orientation activities together.</p>
<p>If you start the campaign at higher level, using one of the adventures in later chapters of this book (or an adventure of your DM’s creation), give some thought to what has brought your characters together as a group. The easiest explanation is that you met as first-year students, perhaps living in the same residence hall or taking the same classes, or united by a common extracurricular interest.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that your characters are just meeting for the first time. The events of the adventure might throw you together more or less at random. You could all be taking the same class, you might be working the same campus job, or you could be introduced by mutual friends.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2524387b-ca82-4e84-b33d-ce2b493deb5f">If you do choose one of these backgrounds, you can assume that your life to this point has been consumed by the education that has made enrolling at Strixhaven possible for you, and you might not have much experience of the world beyond that preparatory work. You’re ready to excel as a student—and that, in turn, will prepare you to excel at whatever path comes after graduation.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9d7eacdb-bbc9-4656-8c40-6ea5b73d55d2">Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. You might wield your Prismari spells with dynamic, gestural movement—as much dance as somatic component. Even a blast of fire in your hands is a sculpted work of art; elemental forces make grand designs as you hurl spells. These forces might linger on your body or in your clothes as decorative elements after your spells are dissipated, as sparks dance in your hair and your touch leaves tracings of frost on whatever you touch.</p>

<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="InteriorMaps" data-content-chunk-id="070d3cc8-aa0d-41b3-b0be-8a688cbf02f7"><a href="#InteriorMaps" data-content-chunk-id="62291dfa-5b28-4f7c-87f1-64fd3fd1e7de"></a>Interior Maps</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="62562054-fb08-4ca3-9d64-08e452c5073a">Maps in the book primarily depict areas for the characters to explore or areas where combat is likely to occur. These maps are designed to be easily reproduced on graph paper, a wet-erase mat, or some other surface to help the players visualize locations and devise combat strategies. You can alter a map’s features as you see fit.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="68544c60-ecb1-46b8-9aab-383a3032c7f6">On interior maps, an arrow on a slope or staircase points in the ascending direction. When elevation numbers appear on a map, a plus sign indicates a rise of the indicated number of feet, while a minus sign indicates a depression.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PosterMap" data-content-chunk-id="dcdc4852-c97d-4bef-aa54-80fe2b94fbcb"><a href="#PosterMap" data-content-chunk-id="8463a0f2-56ee-45f8-a285-e6c355ee9d8b"></a>Poster Map</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a2e812ed-9fbc-440a-9001-e042710b3509">The poster map is meant to be shared with the players. One side shows the Strixhaven University campus, with a focus on the central campus and the five surrounding colleges. The other side of the poster shows detailed maps of key campus locations, some of which the characters visit in multiple adventures.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ThePassageofTime" data-content-chunk-id="dfd0f3cb-8a38-41d8-8f12-586cd5c0f58a"><a href="#ThePassageofTime" data-content-chunk-id="fdbfcc2f-ab1c-4bf7-afba-5aa05f7ec766"></a>The Passage of Time</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7602e129-4f47-489a-a672-eb2f1a5f79ac">Each adventure in this book takes place over the course of an academic year, which is no longer than a calendar year. The adventures include events, but those events aren’t the entire extent of the characters’ experience on campus that year. Unless explicitly stated, assume that anywhere from a few days to a few weeks passes between the events of an adventure. You can decide how quickly the year passes and work with your players to decide what else they get up to. You can conduct roleplaying scenes with the characters’ fellow students, taking into account their Friends, Rivals, and Beloveds. You might also narratively describe developments in their courses to help the academic year feel varied and robust.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cf31a588-1f14-42f1-87a4-0885bbd784a9">Finally, as the characters are completing tasks together for their courses or hanging out with their fellow students, consider challenging them with random monster encounters that crop up on campus. These encounters might be truly random, or they could be unexpected side-effects of the more significant events unfolding in the adventure. Each chapter includes a table tailored for that adventure.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cdc96e0d-4d6c-4e93-aa5b-825645cf4632">The sections on the following pages give special rules for certain aspects of university life. Players can use the sheet below to keep track of the effects of those rules on their characters. Each player should have a copy to use during the course of the adventures. The tracking sheet includes the following parts:</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e18f4b5c-ea6d-4825-8386-d85bac3a650d"><strong>Relationships.</strong> The player notes here the names of each student NPC with whom their character has a Relationship. The player should track how many Relationship Points their character has with each NPC; whether that NPC is a Friend, a Rival, or a Beloved; whether that NPC confers Beloved Inspiration; and that NPC’s Bond Boon or Bond Bane, whichever is applicable.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6166f678-5d08-47fb-84da-3247309c4649"><strong>Report Cards.</strong> This section includes places to track the results of each Exam.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c548dfe6-1eaa-4bec-aada-01c7c51360a6"><strong>Extracurriculars.</strong> The player notes the Extracurriculars in which their character is participating. The player should also note each Extracurricular’s NPC member. Remind players that while their character participates in an Extracurricular, they gain a positive or negative Relationship Point with its associated student NPC.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ea6f0ae-9373-4651-811a-6e6f8c26d74f"><strong>Job.</strong> The player should note their character’s job, if any. Remind the player that while their character holds a job, the character gains a positive or negative Relationship Point with its associated student coworker, whom they should also note on this sheet.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6455dca2-7f74-4b97-9b28-879f1cf74f6d"><strong>Student Dice.</strong> The player should track the Student Dice their character has from passing Exams and from Extracurriculars. They should also note the skills their character can expend the Student Dice on. They should check the “d4” box whenever they gain a Student Die, and they should erase the check mark when they expend the die.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2b2fd62d-c0d5-41d1-8849-003067635a54">Extracurriculars—the campus clubs and societies students can join—are a key part of student life at Strixhaven. Using the rules that follow, characters can join Extracurriculars to add flavor to the book’s adventures, gain minor rules benefits, and perhaps more easily befriend—or irritate—their classmates.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="JoininganExtracurricular" data-content-chunk-id="8817d365-6f9c-4ae5-97d3-bcc6d3bae3b7"><a href="#JoininganExtracurricular" data-content-chunk-id="64eb0928-0e30-4e02-8a50-fef40c47d335"></a>Joining an Extracurricular</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="258ea9f1-9530-49b7-84ca-fefcddd7f165">At any point during the book’s adventures, a character can gain the benefit of two of the Extracurriculars noted below, as described later in this section. If a student character also works on campus using the Job rules, the character can benefit from only one Extracurricular.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8bcc15db-c81d-4113-8c4f-7368c06fc959">Characters can gain the benefit from a new Extracurricular only by joining it at the start of an academic year, which corresponds to the beginning of a new adventure. Typically, joining an Extracurricular in between academic years isn’t eventful. Players should note the changes on their tracking sheet.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="021d8068-7fd3-4ff9-9aac-8d89e0150c54">While a student participates in an Extracurricular, they gain a Student Die and a Relationship Point, as explained below.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2eca544c-d243-4678-b2df-e6a67d9f7a16">Each character gains one Student Die for each Extracurricular they are participating in. A Student Die is a d4 the player can roll and add to an ability check that the character makes, provided the check uses one of the skills listed in the Extracurricular’s description. The player can wait until after rolling the d20 before rolling the Student Die, but must do so before you say whether the check succeeds or fails. No more than one Student Die can be rolled per check. After rolling a Student Die, a player can’t roll it again until the character finishes a long rest.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e813a520-8e7c-40c2-9207-7af55bc97981">While a student participates in an Extracurricular, the student gains either a positive or a negative Relationship Point (the player’s choice) with one student NPC who is also a member of the Extracurricular (see the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships/" title="Relationship rules" data-content-chunk-id="b2ff87a8-248d-4183-b139-83914d0cb22f">Relationship rules</a> later in this chapter).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7ce8c727-cf63-4f14-983e-94c488b734ca">Characters can quit an Extracurricular at any time, updating their tracking sheet accordingly. When a student quits an Extracurricular, they immediately lose its benefits. If a character quits during an adventure, you might want to roleplay the situation, since NPCs are likely to take an interest in why the student is leaving.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1c15c8e5-38ef-496f-a90c-6c749bc6a6fa">The characters’ years at Strixhaven are covered by each of this book’s adventures, which focus on the notable and even shocking events that take place at the university. Even though the characters’ studies include the trappings of academic life—attending lectures, participating in labs, reading textbooks—those everyday academic activities mostly take place in the background. The exam rules presented here are thus designed to help the players keep their characters’ studies part of the game.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="UsingTheseRules" data-content-chunk-id="69d93313-9e78-4808-96af-c3684507b229"><a href="#UsingTheseRules" data-content-chunk-id="8b55b54c-32f9-4c5b-98d8-54c1c092e989"></a>Using These Rules</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6a87495-6156-4c4f-8b3e-e46531fdb9f4">Each of the book’s adventures includes Exams. Though each character might be a member of a different college at Strixhaven, the adventures assume that the characters take at least one general education or interdisciplinary course together each year. It is this course that the Exam rules represent.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dc318544-8ec6-4b45-91f9-e75ca9af761b">Each Exam encounter has a Studying phase followed by a Testing phase. In general, a character can approach Studying in any way they desire, with that phase then culminating in a single ability check of their choice. In contrast, Testing requires ability checks using specific skills.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37f8a959-6482-4e31-a882-7eaad8eeaf95">In each phase, resolve the outcome of one character’s ability checks before moving on to another character. (If any characters are studying together, however, resolve their ability checks at the same time. See below for more information.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="28e80486-72f3-41f6-9149-dd1d13ebfde3">Don’t forget to have each player mark the results of an Exam on their tracking sheet!</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6fed7d1b-040d-4474-a140-a3640da6e0ad">The Studying phase of an Exam represents the characters brushing up on their coursework, prompting sparks of insight when faced with difficult questions, or using mnemonics or other memorization techniques to absorb academic material.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a9128d5d-4ffd-439d-8a7a-e583277a7020">During the Studying phase, each character must succeed on an ability check against a DC noted in the encounter. They can use any ability and skill they wish when making this check, but they can make it only once.</p>

This tutoring can be narrated through roleplaying, or you might simply inform the player of this result.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="67041438-de8e-4664-b6bd-d961e6d7c634">A student who must attend tutoring can’t take part in any Extracurriculars or Jobs until they achieve at least a passed Exam during one of that academic year’s Exam encounters.

The player can wait until after rolling the d20 before rolling the Student Die, but must do so before you say whether the check succeeds or fails. No more than one Student Die can be rolled per check. After rolling a Student Die, a player can’t roll it again until the character finishes a long rest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da1d4c5c-0b89-4c3d-8fc4-f39d851883c5">Players should note any Student Dice they gain and the skills those dice can apply to on their tracking sheet.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="88fcfb34-5b9e-4b82-b5a0-742791fbba94">These rules provide characters with benefits—or drawbacks!—based on their social endeavors, infusing their interactions with other students with rules weight, and making this integral part of student life a more significant part of the game.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fce713bf-abe9-4093-b609-aa2cd2f56e6a">If some players want to use these rules and other players don’t, using these rules only for some characters, or not using them at all, doesn’t unbalance these adventures. Similarly, if you are uncomfortable engaging with the roleplaying encounters these rules describe, we recommend you don’t use them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="95cbcdda-2fee-4e16-9146-4c71d985ffb8">If any players exhibit trepidation, err on the side of caution and don’t use these rules for some or all of the characters.

<p data-content-chunk-id="108f13fc-1351-4471-aaa7-2cd57853e6d0">When a character interacts with a student NPC, that character’s player decides which of the following categories they wish their response to fall under:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e636ae87-468b-4e4b-8d2b-2f7c044a3f0e"><strong>Friendly Response.</strong> A friendly response earns 1 Relationship Point. A friendly response is positive; it might take the form of showing warmth or providing affirmation and camaraderie, as the encounter dictates.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="96e39c51-ed93-4435-a6b1-eb709d27bbfd"><strong>Rivalrous Response.</strong> A rivalrous response earns −1 Relationship Point. A rivalrous response is negative, and might take the form of being rude to the NPC, antagonizing the NPC, or taking similar unkind actions.</p>

NPCs noted as second-year students are always a year ahead of the characters. During “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/a-reckoning-in-ruins/" title="A Reckoning in Ruins" data-content-chunk-id="bb579f92-fbd1-4550-bfa8-bfd82cde168b">A Reckoning in Ruins</a>” in chapter 6, student NPCs who were in higher years when the characters started at Strixhaven are still around on campus as continuing students or recent alumni.</p>

They aren’t intended to wade into combat—or even venture off campus—when the characters embark on adventures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="35ca37b4-481a-4d8f-a997-94a209062bb6">In general, avoid putting these student NPCs in danger with the characters. In situations when you need stat blocks for these NPCs, use the stat block indicated for them in the Student NPC Stat Blocks table, where the stat blocks depend on the student’s year during the current adventure. These stat blocks can be found in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes/" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="ca2ab918-5adf-4ba8-bfb1-e6c6863d47fb">chapter 7</a>, and in the table, “[College]” refers to the name of the NPC’s college: Lorehold, Prismari, Quandrix, Silverquill, or Witherbloom.</p>

Aurora was born a dhampir (a partial vampire), which she’s taken as a cosmic sign that she is meant for greatness.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2eb08674-caa2-461e-804b-cfd57fcd853f">An accomplished musician on several instruments, Aurora is often found at Bow’s End Tavern performing beautiful dirges on the hurdy-gurdy for the assembled patrons. Aurora is also a member of the Strixhaven Show Band Association, though she believes the music they play lacks the raw emotion of her original compositions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37d7e955-cb8d-4ff0-9dea-4ecdc436370c">She works as a groundskeeper at the Strixhaven Stadium, where she takes great pleasure in using magic to blight undesirable vegetation on the field.</p>

They are often found poring over ancient texts detailing battles, seeking to better understand the tactical decisions that result in victory and defeat. Rampart is happy to discuss their knowledge with fellow members of the Dragonsguard Historical Society, often doing so late into the night.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="27b4ff19-1aee-4b10-b9c2-2da2fcdf3969">Rampart’s opponents at the Dragonchess Club find themselves outmatched time and again by the loxodon’s technique, though Rampart is a gracious winner. They attend all their classes clad in gilded, centuries-old plate armor, with an immense and similarly decorated sword strapped to their back. Rampart explains that doing so better simulates the battlefield conditions they study.</p>

He is a passionate member of the Live-Action Roleplaying Guild and loves playing out all sorts of fantastical adventures. He always roleplays archers, entirely because he’s recently spent a lot of money on a prop-bow and can’t afford anything else. He is also a member of the university’s Distinguished Society of Fine Artists, where he uses magic to sculpt beautiful statuary of complex fractal patterns. The fact that he is self-taught makes the quality of his work that much more impressive.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d0546bc-258d-4e24-8ba2-d41ef44e12d8">Cadoras does have some strange eating habits; he sometimes eats an entire jar of pickled onions in a single sitting and then drinks the vinegar.</p>

He is over seven feet tall, yet he continuously stoops, as if trying to occupy as little space as possible. Several activities and clubs that involve feats of strength and size continuously try to recruit him—to no avail. Drazhomir prefers spending his time in the Biblioplex, where he works as a book clerk, assisting students in finding required texts and shelving returns. He moves silently through the stacks, and he has given more than one student a scare when they’ve turned around to suddenly find him there.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="86b1e1ca-aff7-4a60-9b2c-fb7783fc0079">Drazhomir’s greatest love is poetry.

Learning business acumen is just as important to Grayson as his classes, so he has joined the Future Entrepreneurs of Strixhaven. Grayson makes a point to know as much about everyone as possible, gathering information until he finds the best circumstance to use it. Having learned to pick locks, he often accesses places where he’s unauthorized, searching for secrets.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3534e3f9-3224-49ec-8d69-4fd8c4f0ad89">Grayson has become a writer for the <em>Strixhaven Star</em>, where he’s responsible for the gossip column.

When not training or competing (or occasionally studying), Greta spends her time in Bow’s End Tavern carousing. As beer isn’t free, she helps out at Strixhaven Stadium, setting up and putting away heavy equipment. Most people would begrudge the hard labor, but Greta happily does it, reasoning that she is being paid to work out.</p>

She is a delightful presence and doesn’t ignore social obligations so much as get distracted easily. Larine is a member of the Intramural Water-Dancing Club, where she performs underwater balletic movements effortlessly. Despite her swimming ability, her tendency to lose focus means learning group choreography takes her more time and effort. Larine has a natural affinity with animals, especially aquatic species, and she’s working on a solo synchronized swimming routine that replaces the other students with a shoal of fish. Rehearsals aren’t going well. As an employee of the Strixhaven Performing Arts Society, Larine is a ticket taker, a job she’s recently switched to as a result of struggling to give correct change while working at the box office.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2b0f231e-5fc0-472a-96b8-588b4fe04f18">Towering over most students, Melwythorne strikes an imposing figure, especially given the branches that grow from his head like antlers. Calm in demeanor, he’s often confused by the people rushing around him, as their haste won’t lengthen their brief lifespans. Melwythorne had never been away from his grove before coming to Strixhaven and has found the transition to university life difficult. However, since he joined the Intramural Silkball Club, this close-knit surrogate family has helped him deal with his homesickness.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2a9c4ea7-97bf-4ebe-be3e-b685f14c43c3">He is also a member of the Student-Mages of Faith. He enjoys helping his fellow students celebrate their high holidays and discussing theology and spirituality. For him, the natural world and all living beings form a vast consciousness across all planes of existence, transcending the power and reach of any one deity.</p>

Her fascination with language extends to spells and verbal components. After graduation, she plans to conduct research on the variance of language in spells and how one might tweak verbal components that the greater magical community considers immutable.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91c140e4-6ff2-4f52-8b84-7801114a28c2">Mina’s love of language and nuance has led her to join the <em>Strixhaven Star</em> as an investigative journalist. Here, she reveals truth, corrects misconceptions, and combats injustice. She has also taken a job as a server at Firejolt Café, which not only provides some cash but also puts her in a position to overhear snippets of conversation that might provide leads for her journalistic investigations.</p>

This has led her to gain employment within the university’s dormitories, where she acts as a resident assistant. Nora offers confidential support to any student and is especially passionate about counseling other transgender students. She thoughtfully handles concerns ranging from students’ homesickness to matters that require her to act as an advocate for another student.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ac8c1e7-7bb2-4cb6-a833-a7fdba35e24d">Nora is a passionate member of the Distinguished Society of Fine Artists. As such, she spends hours on the potter’s wheel throwing clay. Despite her enthusiasm, her technical skill is lacking. Her tutors, in attempts to be encouraging, often describe Nora’s work as rustic or naive. Undeterred, Nora continues to produce terrible mug after terrible mug, which she gives as gifts to her friends.</p>

He believes one should either do something correctly or not at all. Quentillius is a member of the university’s Playactors Drama Guild, where his dedication to what he calls “the craft” is absolute. He looks down on other actors who are slow to memorize lines or who miss cues. Backstage crew members fare better, as Quentillius regards them as crucial and often brings them and the director flowers or notes of thanks. While Quentillius is a powerful presence on stage—especially in romantic roles—critics have called his performances histrionic. To better perform his future roles in ancient plays, Quentillius has joined the Dead Languages Society. He plans to perform his roles in the plays’ original languages, regardless of whether the rest of the production is translated.</p>

Or a teacher. Or a student. Or any other member of the university staff. Rosie speaks quickly and with so much energy that it often takes a moment to recover from a conversation with her. She moves far faster than one would expect; it’s unclear whether this is due to magic, a gnomish technological contraption, or just the laws of physics bending to Rosie’s force of personality.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be9a98af-5842-475f-8e3f-14e18f4e1b8a">Rosie referees silkball and takes fair play very seriously. Woe betide any participant who feels the wrath of her whistle. Rosie is also an enthusiastic participant in Strixhaven’s Live-Action Roleplaying Guild. She insists on roleplaying only “monsters” and delights in chasing down participants to “eat” them. Many a participant has heard giggling approaching them at high speed before their character’s death.</p>

A measured performer with gravitas beyond her years, Rubina is a valued member of the Playactors Drama Guild who can handle weightier roles that more melodramatic actors can’t. This has caused friction within the guild as members vie for parts. Rubina’s stage presence extends to delivering presentations in class. When she orates, one can almost imagine a hardened general marshaling her bloodied and exhausted troops for a final push against a far superior foe.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2e2104df-46dc-4c96-99f0-2acce05af1b5">Rubina is part of the Strixhaven Show Band Association and has moved from playing to conducting.

Shuvadri, on the other hand, exhibits an air of absolute serenity. Anything that might frustrate or delight another student, whether it’s a poor test score or success at a competition, elicits little outward response from Shuvadri. A deep thinker, Shuvadri is rarely surprised by such an outcome, and she enjoys being a centering presence for her peers.</p>

An excellent judge of character, she doesn’t associate with those she deems mean-spirited. Her exacting judgment has led her to join the Dragonchess Club, and while she is still honing her skill at the game itself, she compensates by reading her opponent instead of the board. Many a foe has struggled to sit in silence as she gives them her full attention, probing for weaknesses, the pieces seemingly incidental.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fb7222db-52b1-4cbd-a8f6-cf6113cd7130">Surprising to some, Tilana has also joined the Intramural Silkball Club.

As such, Zanther is launched into the air in elaborate cheering routines, much to the crowd’s delight.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6628788-494c-4b73-b738-f1e350ab15bb">Zanther has also joined the Intramural Gymnastics Club. Here he completes at rhythmic gymnastics in both ribbon as well as hoop. To further test himself and impress the judges, Zanther conducts his routines to a vast array of different musical styles and arrangements. When traveling around campus between classes, he shouts random affirmations of school spirit to everyone at large. Despite his peppy nature, Zanther is genuinely encouraging and in no way acts superior. If anything, he seems somewhat oblivious to his own popularity at Strixhaven.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="32aed7f2-bf33-4955-8311-21c33be9ad1d">The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom’s faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm’s effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8b772895-7e9a-4525-9eb7-318341344424">Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor’s waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by Murgaxor Grenshel, the villain the characters ultimately confront in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/confronting-murgaxor/" title="chapter 6" data-content-chunk-id="432b1808-ec97-44c9-bbd0-479185e233b5">chapter 6</a>. Murgaxor intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.</p>

Students, employees, and staff members often use this lounge to relax between shifts in the student store (<a href="#B5StudentStore" title="area B5" data-content-chunk-id="19df8346-893b-4ba1-97cb-d59a5a371b96">area B5</a>), the Biblioplex café (<a href="#B6BiblioplexCafe" title="area B6" data-content-chunk-id="40a0d795-84bf-45cf-b749-e9eb2efb6b23">area B6</a>), or elsewhere in the library. Each table holds piles of magazines, newsletters, flyers, and nonmagical scrolls from around campus. A character who examines these materials finds recruitment flyers from 1d3 Extracurriculars. They also find “Help Wanted” ads for the Jobs at the Biblioplex. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/school-is-in-session#Extracurriculars" title="Extracurriculars" data-content-chunk-id="226b6745-4977-4811-bd4a-6a10c6892c10">Extracurriculars</a> and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/school-is-in-session#Jobs" title="Jobs" data-content-chunk-id="991803d8-ff7d-48e4-b685-077c8fa96c3a">Jobs</a> are detailed earlier in the chapter.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fa7c6dd2-d793-4fcc-954c-5ec50071a975">This area typically holds 21 (6d6) students, all of them studying, eating, chatting, or even sleeping. Many enjoy food and drinks from the café (<a href="#B6BiblioplexCafe" title="area B6" data-content-chunk-id="9986e396-a404-43f3-a025-12aa3d327936">area B6</a>).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e2c94bec-cd60-4388-bb4c-d19665c259ba">Three faculty-appointed reference librarians work at each of these circular desks (use any of the professor stat blocks found in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes/" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="024efee7-487e-45f8-bd4c-8ec23da5586c">chapter 7</a> if needed).

<p data-content-chunk-id="26f9ab66-e993-4342-9a06-6749ad2fec55">This small shop is stocked with books, equipment, and gear useful as academic supplies. The store’s manager is Groff Lundquist (neutral good human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoner</a>), a friendly Strixhaven staff member known for his ability to fashionably mix and match items of university apparel. Students can buy hats, scarves, tunics, robes, gloves, and other apparel embroidered with the Strixhaven star or with the sigil of any of Strixhaven’s colleges. Costs range from 5 cp to 5 gp or more, at your discretion.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="34475897-737b-464d-a90d-5b1dc115706a">Once a character chooses a college at the start of second year, they receive a set of college robes, a knit hat, a scarf, a tunic, and gloves free of charge. (This set normally costs 5 gp.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4af390f5-277d-4980-bfb7-78bec0242d46">In addition to nonmagical gear and clothing, the store also contains the magic items from the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/character-options#MagicItems" title="Magic Items" data-content-chunk-id="da4979af-6f78-4668-a8a6-86d1e9903338">Magic Items</a>” section of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/character-options" title="chapter 2" data-content-chunk-id="6eb8304e-a890-4d83-9ab1-2b70718a7e35">chapter 2</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5deb0d78-98af-4525-80e7-e4104c0e352c">One wall of this area is covered with a mural made from a living tree’s roots, which move occasionally and make the entire place feel alive. The ceiling is covered in painted leaves, which change colors depending on the season thanks to a permanent illusion effect. The magic also prompts painted squirrels to run up and down the mural’s roots, and painted birds to chirp among the leaves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="57245088-f4a3-4dcc-9192-27cd9e0dae9f">Up to ten students are typically present here during the day. Ordinarily, three more students work here, but during orientation, the café’s manager, Aisla Fitzbottom (chaotic good gnome <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoner</a>), is working alone. She is charmingly perky and has a mind like a steel trap when it comes to recognizing students. However, her organizational skills are somewhat lackadaisical.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b9fbce47-bd6a-4289-9908-80c924024184">The café always serves coffee and tea, which costs 1 cp per cup. The sandwich of the day varies. Roll below to determine which sandwich is available on any given day in the café.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5e2a952e-ea6f-4928-9fcd-f0dff832aa68">Each of these halls hosts interdisciplinary lectures for Strixhaven students. The seats magically grow or shrink to comfortably accommodate students of any size or body type. The halls’ acoustics are magically enhanced to amplify the professor’s lecture and minimize the disruption of side conversations. While a class is in session, each hall holds a professor and up to thirty students.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c107ab81-eb99-49d6-b628-a3a03c38130c">These open study areas feature simple wooden tables and chairs. During the day, up to thirty students can typically be found here.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="824455e0-43fc-4e7b-b379-603ab3e4c6c2">If the characters pass by the western study area before orientation, members of the Live-Action Roleplaying Guild are pulling costumes and props from a half dozen old trunks. The guild is preparing for an event later on the Biblioplex’s lawn: a game they call Beholders versus Behirs. Rosie Wuzfeddlims (chaotic good gnome <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160303-first-year-student" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160303-tooltip">first-year student</a>; see the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships#RosimyffenbipRosieWuzfeddlims" title="Fellow Students" data-content-chunk-id="4eb3c4b3-cbbd-4bd3-bd0f-417ddfb0c550">Fellow Students</a>” section) is directing students as they cobble together beholder and behir costumes, as well as visual effects made from sheets, blankets, wooden frames, tin plates, and illusion magic. (This preparation erupts into chaos during “<a href="#ThatTrunkHasTeeth" title="That Trunk Has Teeth!" data-content-chunk-id="ef957f52-69d4-46cd-8d36-2f034341da36">That Trunk Has Teeth!</a>” later in this chapter.)</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a1728a2e-78b3-4f1d-9bbc-619ae4e5cb56">In these quiet areas, students sit on the grass and study among lush foliage. Sometime last year, three <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16791-awakened-shrub" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16791-tooltip">awakened shrubs</a> wandered in here and settled in each garden, and the university has welcomed them to stay.

<p data-content-chunk-id="63377afd-ddaa-4e67-ace1-2a358d23c61d">Members of the Fantastical Horticulture Club often relax in this area and hold meetings here from time to time.

<p data-content-chunk-id="63878965-03da-41df-9c3c-99cabd4adda1">Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves fill the center and the east end of the library’s first floor, with the denser east stacks under a magic effect that shifts them when students approach, creating space to stand single-file between them. These books are mostly introductory texts, and first-year students are often directed here by their instructors. In each of these areas, two <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160300-cogwork-archivist" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160300-tooltip">cogwork archivists</a> (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes#CogworkArchivist" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="daa14645-ec91-4ed3-ab8e-52e596d2210b">chapter 7</a>) busily shelve returned or misfiled books.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="688268cf-77ec-4780-b020-014fc2780b93">This hallowed hall is filled with statues of the university’s past Oracles. At the center of the hall, a pulsing ball of magical energy—the Strixhaven Snarl—fills the area with bright light.

<p data-content-chunk-id="2a8a8901-9a9c-45ef-b57c-9fb8a181a62a">This crisp-looking room features white walls and columns that stretch from floor to ceiling. Displayed on or within these are art pieces representative of various media. Students from Prismari College typically tend this space, and three <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160319-prismari-pledgemage" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160319-tooltip">Prismari pledgemages</a> (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes#PrismariPledgemage" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="870c35fb-fb06-4a6f-8268-fcbe47edcc47">chapter 7</a>) can be found here most days, either cleaning the gallery or studying the techniques used in the displayed pieces.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ac84fbfd-4ad0-484e-a62b-53456355fca6">The Distinguished Society of Fine Artists often meets and holds discussions here.

<p data-content-chunk-id="90659e32-9a82-4ec6-8db3-ddef03a64337">This impressive stage is used for lectures, for assemblies, and as a gathering place in case of emergencies. Magic steps lead up to the stage from the floor of the library. Members of the Playactors Drama Guild often use this stage to meet and rehearse when the Rose Stage on Silverquill’s campus is unavailable.

<p data-content-chunk-id="0d98037c-2a96-4318-9783-f24b60b142d7">This room is filled with tables and chairs and is available to any student organization registered with Strixhaven for use as a meeting place, rehearsal facility, or crafting site, or for other approved purposes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0392fe3c-515b-4978-97c3-d61406034729">If the characters explore this area before or after orientation, it is set up to promote Extracurriculars, the rules of which appear earlier in the chapter. The tables are covered with flyers from the Dead Languages Society, the Dragonchess Club, the Dragonsguard Historical Society, Future Entrepreneurs of Strixhaven, the Intramural Gymnastics Club, the Intramural Silkball Club, the Intramural Water-Dancing Club, the Mage Tower Cheer Squad, the Strixhaven Iron-Lifters Society, the Strixhaven Show Band Association, the <em>Strixhaven Star</em>, and Student-Mages of Faith, and are staffed by the students listed in “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/school-is-in-session#Extracurriculars" title="Extracurriculars" data-content-chunk-id="66b0e58d-e251-4284-85d0-2fe814d71843">Extracurriculars</a>” as being associated with them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0c2d0fe6-056e-46a8-afa4-a58f1437706c">Filled with wooden tables and benches, this room has a flag displaying the Strixhaven star symbol hanging on its back wall. Here, a student council publicly debates Strixhaven policies that most affect the student body. The leaders of the school’s Extracurriculars come to the council to conduct matters of business, and the council usually meets on the first day of every month. Outside those meeting days, the room is used for other official university business or stands empty.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="88bcd64b-a806-4655-892a-68ded5b367bf">Rooms on the Biblioplex’s second floor can be accessed only with keys held by faculty members, or that the reference librarians in <a href="#B4InformationDesk" title="area B4" data-content-chunk-id="777023b7-9082-4e04-aa9c-363b8e8e703c">area B4</a> grant students on a case-by-case basis. Typically, students don’t receive keys to these stacks until they’re studying for their final thesis during their fourth year at Strixhaven.

The magical statue reads aloud the contents of most books placed in front of it if a character makes that request verbally or mentally. (The magic of the statue can assess text such as verbal curses that present a danger if read aloud, and the statue ignores requests to read such text.)</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="096f51ef-ecdd-47ee-afdc-9577991ed6d4">When the characters wander through the gallery, they see a portrait of several older alumni wearing Prismari College robes. If a character examines the portrait, they find a plaque that reads: “At Strixhaven we were all inspired.” Below the plaque is a small lever. If a character uses an action to pull the lever, a box pops out of the wall containing a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4239824-strixhaven-pennant" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4239824-tooltip">Strixhaven pennant</a> (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/character-options#StrixhavenPennant" title="chapter 2" data-content-chunk-id="2d8f6329-2a19-4236-8cd7-bdb6473ecc24">chapter 2</a>) for each character in the party.

<p data-content-chunk-id="5a6b225c-0a8d-466e-8ac6-30fd07d0f2dd">When the characters enter a book garden, they see a lush arboretum. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check reveals that three of the shrubs are not ordinary greenery, but are instead <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16791-awakened-shrub" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16791-tooltip">awakened shrubs</a>, each with a glistening crown of leaves.

<p data-content-chunk-id="0d5ddf32-f213-4ebc-87b5-af0a4145171b">When the characters reach the amphitheater, they see an impressively lavish stage, with the curtains drawn back as if to reveal performers on the opening night of a major production. If a character recites, sings, hums, belches, or otherwise emits any line or tune while standing on the stage, bright floodlights snap on around the stage’s perimeter—a number of lights equal to the number of characters in the group. Approaching any of the lights reveals a recess in which lies a <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/57-lantern-hooded" data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/57-tooltip">hooded lantern</a> filled with oil.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="495709fd-1a83-4646-8dbf-451045dcd329">Firejolt Café is the most popular place at Strixhaven to grab tea or coffee, chat with friends, or study among the hustle and bustle of a typical day on campus. The café’s interior is clean and well lit, and its walls are decorated with fun, cartoonish scenes animated by permanent illusion magic. Well-known scenes include a jovial frog in a wizard’s hat stirring a cauldron, a dancing trio of lightning bolts with grinning faces, and a raven wearing a cravat and sipping daintily from a cup of coffee held in one wing.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="23d40a38-4dfd-4e26-81d2-dc56006a68c5">The café has the following features:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eb9909de-471a-477b-bc54-ca86384a038d"><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The café’s ceilings are 20 feet high.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="792530e1-6f06-4e10-b6a0-9bec1dc40c1c"><strong>Doors.</strong> At night, the exterior doors to the café are closed, locked, and sealed with an <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2003-arcane-lock" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2003-tooltip">arcane lock</a> spell. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools opens the lock (DC 35 while the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2003-arcane-lock" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2003-tooltip">arcane lock</a> is in effect). Only certain faculty members and Ellina Tanglewood, the café’s manager (see <a href="#F3BaristaStation" title="area F3" data-content-chunk-id="51fac4bc-12e2-4a6c-82b9-731033cccda4">area F3</a>), know the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2003-arcane-lock" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2003-tooltip">arcane lock</a>’s password.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e6b99c1d-914d-4595-bcde-240855c53fca"><strong>Magic Steps.</strong> The steps marking the edge of each tier of the study area are enchanted to move and reshape themselves for full accessibility.

<p data-content-chunk-id="202fa909-7c76-488c-9624-a16d8c3629bf">These long benches sit atop two raised tiers with magic steps between them, affording easy access to the seating area below. Some thirty students are typically here during the day, studying quietly.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="F2SeatingArea" data-content-chunk-id="f30d2744-53a0-49cb-874e-235406650706"><a href="#F2SeatingArea" data-content-chunk-id="2e9b54a6-be36-498e-adad-233a66db0304"></a>F2. Seating Area</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8a7e008a-47da-441c-9403-3c51dc332991">This area is usually more crowded than the café’s study tables. At least fifty students sit sociably in groups, chatting and having tea and coffee. The open spaces in the north part of this area are typically filled with students waiting to join the queue at the barista station or scouting for a good place to sit.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="F3BaristaStation" data-content-chunk-id="8959cd64-e397-4f68-aeba-fccddd8d1ee8"><a href="#F3BaristaStation" data-content-chunk-id="c72af79c-f647-408a-aa08-2a2dad68a4cb"></a>F3. Barista Station</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="27d60a58-76a3-45d4-b6ef-c6bfbf8c9623">This bustling service counter is the demesne of Ellina Tanglewood (chaotic good elf <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16947-mage" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16947-tooltip">mage</a>), the Strixhaven employee who manages the café and serves as its chief barista. Ellina typically works alongside five older student employees, one from each college, though she sometimes hires younger students who express interest in working for her (see the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/school-is-in-session#Jobs" title="Jobs" data-content-chunk-id="bc19464a-7dd9-4df2-80b2-0a55a5f51d42">Jobs</a>” section earlier in the chapter).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="80bb9f41-cb6f-4156-b3de-4a56486574df">The front counter of the barista station is a whirl of chaos while Ellina and the other employees deal with the orders of dozens of students and faculty members. The back of the station is calmer, and includes a small break area for employees as well as shelves for personal belongings and café supplies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7318a8e4-2bf0-4731-88a8-04f9392846d1">The café strictly sells coffee and tea, but Ellina and the other talented baristas can make nearly any form of those drinks on request. A relatively common coffee or tea costs 1 cp, while a more complicated order might cost 2 cp. The café’s signature firejolt latte costs 10 gp; it confers resistance to fire for 1 minute after drinking it, and it can be brewed only by Ellina using her fire magic.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="F4Newsstand" data-content-chunk-id="b5f5ec43-9a85-4f55-9b48-228c17b73b3e"><a href="#F4Newsstand" data-content-chunk-id="b6388001-b8c4-460e-ab25-b89127b479f2"></a>F4. Newsstand</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e624a597-c670-46c4-ae85-2b5d657a6144">This small store inside Firejolt Café sells magazines, knickknacks, posters, stickers, and other decorative and leisure items. The subjects of the magazines are all magic themed, with titles ranging from <em>Mages Monthly</em> to <em>Potions! Potions! Potions!</em> to <em>Spells and Caster</em>. Staff members at the barista station take turns working the newsstand, which sometimes closes when the café is particularly busy. Most items here cost 1 cp, though higher-end items might be available at your discretion.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="F5FiresideLounge" data-content-chunk-id="adefbca6-431c-4d11-aac7-5799d286cb22"><a href="#F5FiresideLounge" data-content-chunk-id="d50f2d6c-3c17-4f4f-8c7d-8b5c6bd05a9c"></a>F5. Fireside Lounge</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cdcb6895-6743-4222-8559-bc6691763f81">Much more comfortable than the café’s other seating areas, this lounge is filled with sofas and armchairs where students can relax away from the hubbub. Fireplaces in the northern corners are lit by <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2048-continual-flame" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2048-tooltip">continual flame</a> spells. Some twenty students are typically found here, using the tables to study quietly.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="F6QuietRoom" data-content-chunk-id="cbae0250-34e5-4203-a0dd-3fee77d4717c"><a href="#F6QuietRoom" data-content-chunk-id="204dcaa3-a9cd-4470-b243-11430e961802"></a>F6. Quiet Room</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="85400732-17fd-4b03-9d8f-99cb73dfb4d2">As with the fireside lounge, these rooms are quieter than the café’s main seating areas. However, with large tables and more functional chairs, they’re more oriented toward studying and completing classwork. Up to ten students are typically found in each of these rooms, engaged in quiet study.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="AGreatFrogRace" data-content-chunk-id="286bd106-eaa0-4d0e-842c-abd6e95939a5"><a href="#AGreatFrogRace" data-content-chunk-id="24e1d4f4-c4bc-4123-b5a0-433146631e15"></a>A Great Frog Race</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ae2e92fb-a876-4256-b073-f71fb0366a0d">Characters following the student who invited them to the frog race are led to the fireside lounge (area F5) of Firejolt Café. As in the scene above, the student speaking in this scene should be a student the characters have interacted with. Read or paraphrase the following, altering the text to incorporate the student’s name or other details:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>The air buzzes with excitement—and the smell of coffee—as you make your way toward the back of Firejolt Café and duck into the lounge to witness the scene.</p>
<p>Hidden from the view of the barista station, the lounge’s central table has been pushed toward the wall and its chairs haphazardly tossed out of the way. In the middle of the room hop four unusual frogs. Each is glowing in vibrant colors—red, blue, violet, and orange—and has been outfitted with a tiny costume. One wears a makeshift cape, another has suspenders, a third wears a stylish bow tie, and the fourth has a top hat perched jauntily on its head.</p>
<p>Someone has used chalk to mark lanes on the floor, and multiple students are trying to corral the frogs into a starting position.</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4dfd3b4c-8fdc-446d-aeb5-911ff3c4394f">A student notices the characters and shouts, “You’re just in time! Want to race these frogs with us?”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a0b12ced-cebc-4c81-bdd4-961aa2a70a94">The amphibians in the lounge are four <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16866-frog" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16866-tooltip">frogs</a> that students found outside the café and smuggled inside. The frogs’ glowing colors appear to be the result of some magic the students haven’t been able to source. The costumes—and the frog race that is afoot!—were the students’ ideas. For the race, a single student will “coach” each frog toward the finish. The winning coach will receive bragging rights—as well as a purse of donations from the crowd that totals 30 gp.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ParticipatingintheRace" data-content-chunk-id="eeed93a1-d695-40ca-8e7f-66cd5d3c00eb"><a href="#ParticipatingintheRace" data-content-chunk-id="d29549b2-7a49-4634-a32b-def2bd789d15"></a>Participating in the Race</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eebb8fdf-6b02-4ac3-ace8-a8f4a5e12b21">A character can participate in the fun in one of the following ways:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ecc2564c-66de-4898-a6dc-fa84e0b5ed8b"><strong>Race a Frog.</strong> A character might coach one of the frogs, encouraging it toward the finish line with words, gestures, and other antics. The character can urge their frog to victory with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/11-tooltip">Animal Handling</a>) check. Encourage a player to really sell this scene by naming their frog and coming up with ways to inspire it. If one of the characters succeeds on this Wisdom check, that character’s frog wins the race. (If more than one character succeeds, it’s a tie, and those characters split the 30 gp prize.) If no characters win the race, roll a d4 to randomly determine which frog wins.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3ee6850c-f3f6-4c7d-99cd-8515bad9000c"><strong>Cheer a Coach.</strong> A character might shout encouragement to one of the coaches. If the encouraged coach is another player character, that character gains advantage on their Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/11-tooltip">Animal Handling</a>) check to coach the frog. If the coach is an NPC, any characters racing a frog receive disadvantage on their check.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3e268f3e-4705-44d3-bbba-85123cdf5346"><strong>Heckle a Coach.</strong> A character might taunt one of the coaches. If the heckled coach is another player character, that character has disadvantage on their Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/11-tooltip">Animal Handling</a>) check to coach the frog. If the coach is an NPC, that student’s frog automatically loses the race.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="309cec5d-11f2-46b3-a025-f23f3e71def8">At the race, characters might mingle with other students. If there are students the characters wish to earn Relationship Points with, treat this as a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships#UsingTheseRules" title="Relationship encounter" data-content-chunk-id="65e02ecf-46c4-4bad-8d8c-f5d88a3c5df2">Relationship encounter</a>.

<p data-content-chunk-id="f05e954f-0597-4d87-a5b4-2725ce0a4ddc">After the race ends, the four frogs start belching strangely, and their eyes turn red. As the characters and the other students look on, the frogs suddenly grow into four <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16884-giant-frog" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16884-tooltip">giant frogs</a>, shredding their makeshift costumes and furiously lashing out at the crowd!</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="16e388e7-062d-4f39-9476-9791b932d867">The other students scatter, and it’s up to the characters to subdue the giant frogs. Luckily for any character who has grown attached to a frog, any frog reduced to 0 hit points becomes docile, and its eyes return to normal. Alternatively, a character can use an action to coax a frog into shaking off the malady affecting it with a DC 15 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/11-tooltip">Animal Handling</a>) check. On a success, a frog becomes docile again and stops attacking. After 1 minute, each docile frog reverts back to normal size and appearance.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="83306c90-ab45-4ca3-9b7c-45254ff97df1">If all the characters fall <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a>, café manager Ellina Tanglewood (chaotic good elf <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16947-mage" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16947-tooltip">mage</a>) rushes onto the scene and subdues the frogs. She has two <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/71-potion-of-healing" data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/71-tooltip">potions of healing</a> behind the barista station and can administer them as needed if anyone gets hurt.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1f406a1c-7d30-4eb6-986e-846ba815205d">Once the frogs are no longer threats, a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check reveals that the frogs belched out a strange, black oily substance just before they grew in size and attacked. It appears to be the same substance found on the trunk during orientation; indeed, Murgaxor coaxed the frogs to ingest some of the corrupted eldritch balm to cause their transformation. Any character who notices the oily substance also can tell that it smells slightly sweet, which likely encouraged the frogs to ingest it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3a73436d-7b1d-4095-b516-7e9e9e5e6dd6">The characters are enrolled together in the course Magical Physiologies, which is held in a lecture hall in the Biblioplex (one of the areas marked <a href="#B7LectureHall" title="B7" data-content-chunk-id="14847d3e-b4ac-4309-b284-29138ada47b8">B7</a> on <a href="#Map31thebiblioplex" title="map 3.1" data-content-chunk-id="f0222ef4-9d90-4b9d-9225-025ba325bbd3">map 3.1</a>). The course covers the anatomy, abilities, and dispositions of monsters commonly encountered while adventuring. Students read popular accounts related to Aberrations, Monstrosities, and Oozes, as well as studying how best to either avoid a fight with such creatures or battle them and emerge triumphant. The class’s professor is Verelda Lang (chaotic neutral <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16849-dryad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16849-tooltip">dryad</a> professor from Witherbloom College), a respected arcano-biologist who teaches Quandrix College courses in addition to her Witherbloom College and general education offerings.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d1a5670-d1d8-45b6-bdbd-bf2d8900537b">This course’s first Exam takes place a short while after the events of the “A Great Frog Race” section and sees students tested on their knowledge of the creatures known as slaadi.

<p data-content-chunk-id="37d0ac7f-fe9c-41fc-b333-f8b100103531">Once you’ve asked each player how their character is approaching the Studying phase, resolve that phase by having each character who studies make a DC 12 ability check.

<p>ALL ABOUT SLAADI</p>
<p>To give this Exam more flavor, describe some of the facts the characters are trying to memorize, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slaadi are Aberrations known for their regenerative abilities and magic resistance.</li>
<li>All slaadi are dangerous and unpredictable, but <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17116-red-slaad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17116-tooltip">red slaadi</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17112-blue-slaad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17112-tooltip">blue slaadi</a> are the least powerful and don’t cast spells.</li>
<li><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17116-red-slaad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17116-tooltip">Red slaadi</a> can use a gland under one of their claws to implant an egg into a Humanoid. The egg eventually becomes a tadpole that bursts from the host’s body and transforms into a full-grown <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17112-blue-slaad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17112-tooltip">blue slaad</a>, or a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17115-green-slaad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17115-tooltip">green slaad</a> if the host could cast spells of 3rd level or higher.</li>

<li>A <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17115-green-slaad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17115-tooltip">green slaad</a> usually wields a staff and can hurl both <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2102-fireball" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2102-tooltip">fireballs</a> and magical flames at its foes.</li>
<li><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17113-death-slaad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17113-tooltip">Death slaadi</a> are rumored to have a stench so bad it can be deadly.

<li>Inexperienced scholars and adventurers sometimes assume that “slaad” is a misspelling or mispronunciation. Calling these creatures “salads” is frowned upon.</li>

<p>As students mill around the central campus, whoops of excitement fill the air. It’s 6:00 p.m., and Bow’s End Tavern is open! On the tavern’s patio, three student mages with brightly colored hair begin to sing a jaunty tune and pluck at dulcimers as a crowd heads in that direction.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f77a7f8e-7b05-4f9a-a00d-7e705245e756">Bow’s End Tavern is Strixhaven’s most popular late-night hangout. It opens at 6:00 p.m. and closes at 11:00 p.m. on class nights and 2:00 a.m. on weekends.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e6b4f8b9-e984-4788-bc64-ed825a8b703c">The tavern is a squat but comfortable-looking building, its gleaming wooden exterior carved in overlapping Strixhaven star motifs. The interior is dim and cozy (if loud), featuring rich mahogany floors and well-worn furniture of oak and black leather. Live musical acts often set up on the tavern’s patio, including performing groups made up of students, faculty, and staff alike.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="76d87174-9a66-433e-8961-a09ca2d08f9c">The tavern has the following features:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aef95f69-434c-400f-9655-0ec658e0c729"><strong>Lighting.</strong> The magical lights inside the tavern are muted, but creatures can still see normally in all areas.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dcddd0eb-743d-44b5-98f7-2a250b0c4bb9"><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The tavern’s ceilings are 20 feet high.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="32495630-f220-497a-ac90-bdbce397de7c"><strong>Doors.</strong> After closing, all exterior doors to the patio and tavern are closed, locked, and sealed with an <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2003-arcane-lock" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2003-tooltip">arcane lock</a> spell.

<p data-content-chunk-id="048c97ec-8c6f-41c5-bc76-95258fcd1a13">This outdoor seating area is fenced off and is open to tavern customers and noncustomers alike. The patio doors and the front doors leading into the building are closed except when the tavern is open.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eed776e7-127d-4ac7-b9c3-d1d78b64f4da">Up to thirty-five students can typically be found here during opening hours, eating and chatting. Additionally, at least two older student employees work in this area as servers.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="E2MainDiningRoom" data-content-chunk-id="f81145de-0a97-40ff-aabc-c131fb34818c"><a href="#E2MainDiningRoom" data-content-chunk-id="92bbcfc5-a637-4516-b6a0-4ca7e085dd4f"></a>E2. Main Dining Room</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d0ff3536-40c8-43bc-988a-c9d735078141">The most crowded area of the tavern is filled with students. At opening hour, the tavern’s seating is arranged neatly, as shown on the map. In short order, though, student patrons shift the tables and chairs to accommodate the hangouts, tavern games, and other shenanigans happening in this area.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="64e52ca0-8ee8-47a5-8ed3-b686b5e05f2c">Anywhere from fifty to seventy students are typically found here, eating, drinking, and socializing. Additionally, at least four older student employees work in this area as servers.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="89b4c01a-3425-4cca-ac55-b1a7b626d8fc">The server’s station stands at the center of Bow’s End Tavern, where up to four older student employees make drinks for the tavern’s patrons and pass orders for food to the kitchen.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="14d30c92-5e15-4658-bc4e-79f9ad3e325e">The food on offer at the tavern includes caster’s stew—a hearty bowl of venison, gravy, and root vegetables, served with mashed potatoes and thick-cut toast. Curtie’s Special is named for Chef Curtie Axechucker (see <a href="#E6Kitchen" title="area E6" data-content-chunk-id="355bde34-8bc2-480b-b71a-f86e4c8b947b">area E6</a>) and rotates between dishes she calls “garden surprise,” “magister’s delight,” “macaroni and sausages,” and “rat ratatouille.” No one knows the ingredients used in these dishes, though servers always ask patrons about possible allergies. The table below lists the tavern’s menu and prices.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="153b3875-5e2a-4270-beaf-bea26e248e83">The bar surrounding the servers’ station serves a variety of drinks. This area is often rowdy, so student employee Javenesh Stoutclaw (neutral good owlin <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160308-lorehold-apprentice" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160308-tooltip">Lorehold apprentice</a>; see the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships#JaveneshStoutclaw" title="Fellow Students" data-content-chunk-id="083fee6b-3bc2-41a0-af28-b8f09be07617">Fellow Students</a>” section) remains watchful. From thirty-five to forty-five students are typically found at the bar.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="463fd357-830a-4fc5-b491-3480e8efe121">The tavern’s manager also keeps an eye on this area. Tulk “The Bulk” Tusktooth (lawful good orc <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16903-gladiator" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16903-tooltip">gladiator</a>) is a Strixhaven employee with a kind demeanor but no tolerance for misbehavior. Tulk’s nickname comes from his imposing physical presence at a burly, muscle-bound height of nearly seven feet—though his warm smile gleams as brightly as his signature golden earring. He is a good friend to Javenesh Stoutclaw, and anyone who puts the owlin in danger must answer to Tulk.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="48cc6144-8572-46e2-95ae-0725e9f2d029">The quietest part of the tavern, this seating area is the place students go to escape the noise of the main dining room. From ten to twenty students are usually found in this area, relaxing or engaged in conversation. Additionally, at least one older student employee can be found working here as a server.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="E5BackExit" data-content-chunk-id="7a212843-bc8a-48d2-a00b-dcc0293aa72b"><a href="#E5BackExit" data-content-chunk-id="d7eaca3c-497d-4b8b-b297-8f48a397decb"></a>E5. Back Exit</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="68dc1235-77e3-449f-90d5-9edf00b3c8af">These areas afford access to the small stalls that serve as privies for the tavern and each feature a door that leads to the tavern’s back lot. These exits are marked “Staff Only” but aren’t locked during operating hours, acting as loading areas for receiving supplies throughout the night.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="E6Kitchen" data-content-chunk-id="b14b27cc-f116-4ab7-9526-69ff0147f6d6"><a href="#E6Kitchen" data-content-chunk-id="acffac2b-bc49-45c2-8f1d-323c47237d61"></a>E6. Kitchen</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="04812efe-594b-45d4-8644-a1c94c56187f">The tavern’s food orders are prepared in this large kitchen, overseen by Curtie Axechucker (chaotic neutral dwarf <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoner</a>), a Strixhaven employee and beloved personality on campus. Chef Curtie views cooking as an art, and she teaches the four students who work for her to cook using hunches and passion instead of precision or science.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e1dcd228-2d68-4e78-842c-7eca98147ffe">Curtie lives by her teachings (and is said to augment her culinary creations with a little bit of magic), so that no two dishes she or her apprentices cook are ever the same. The chef’s signature cries of “Make it spicy!” and “It needs more love!” frequently echo from the kitchen into the overflow seating area. The chef hires all student cooks, so characters who wish to work in the kitchen must approach her directly.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f8e169c0-9260-44df-841b-8ee0e87545f1">The most prominent features in the kitchen are the cooking cauldrons along the north wall, which are always bubbling with strange and wonderful concoctions. A small break room is set in the northwest corner of the kitchen, while a pantry takes up much of the east wall.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="WizardGizzard" data-content-chunk-id="9f55f9ef-da50-4a0f-b68c-bbbc1cf0aee4"><a href="#WizardGizzard" data-content-chunk-id="c6b60249-bcef-4f68-9707-28bc8198d6de"></a>Wizard Gizzard!</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be528735-c7cc-4817-bf2e-431ce177fa5c">Characters following the student who invited them to play Wizard Gizzard are led to the main dining room (<a href="#E2MainDiningRoom" title="area E2" data-content-chunk-id="d58301f1-2419-4904-a814-6a687138bf75">area E2</a>) of Bow’s End Tavern. Read or paraphrase the following:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>Along one side of the tavern’s main dining room, the tables and chairs have been shifted to create a large, rectangular open space. On the south side of this space, a single table stands flush against the wall. On it are a few strange-looking boxes with funnels protruding from them at an angle. Twenty feet opposite the table, a small bucket rests on the floor.</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="38e25cc1-6b94-4ecb-8dc0-edb3824059d3">The devices on the table are called wizard gizzards. Instructors use them to help student-mages practice their aim with magical rays. When a character strikes the top of a wizard gizzard, it shoots a sphere made of magic out of its attached funnel. The sphere dissipates whenever it touches anything—a ray, a creature, or a hard surface, for example.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb159268-4947-4bb4-8dc4-b21ea0f65fe6">These minor magic items have a short life span, and as they age, they begin to emit loud clucking noises when they shoot their spheres. Students joke that the spheres begin to look like gizzards, hence their name. Every term, students collect cast-off wizard gizzards that have grown too unpredictable for classroom use and then use the wizard gizzards in the game of the same name. This night at Bow’s End Tavern is the first such event of the term, and enthusiasm is running high.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8ff0228d-fd2d-4b07-b57b-e5d78ec31aa9">In this scene, the characters have the opportunity to play a game of Wizard Gizzard for a prize. A character can participate in the fun in one of the following ways:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1f5b633a-e10b-4b37-b373-ae83ff73a581"><strong>Play the Game.</strong> The rules are simple: lob a sphere from the wizard gizzard and have the sphere land inside the bucket on the floor. The game takes 1 minute to play, and the character who lands the most spheres in the bucket during that minute wins the game. To determine how many spheres a character lands in the bucket, have the character make a Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check and divide the total by 3 (round down). If two or more characters land the same number of spheres in the bucket, have those characters repeat the check during a tiebreaker round. Continue to run tiebreaker rounds until one character wins.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="808d0b88-3306-48a9-8f52-6fe50ca656c4"><strong>Encourage a Participant.</strong> If a character shouts encouragement to a participant, that participant has advantage on their Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cd176914-c8d0-4709-8a6f-451c6eef72ed"><strong>Heckle a Participant.</strong> If a character jeers at a participant, that participant has disadvantage on their Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6d1bdb0b-f188-4192-bfb5-229554b7d599">After setting the scene and explaining the rules, reveal that a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/2965260-gray-bag-of-tricks" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/2965260-tooltip">bag of tricks (gray)</a> will be awarded to the winner of the next game. The bag belongs to Javenesh Stoutclaw (see the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships#JaveneshStoutclaw" title="Fellow Students" data-content-chunk-id="104a0769-5e4e-4ce6-a079-fef4d64f4378">Fellow Students</a>” section), a second-year Lorehold College student and the tavern’s assistant manager. Javenesh doesn’t need the bag and is entertained by watching first-year students compete to win. He also secretly hopes that sponsoring the game might win him more friends on campus.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c80c4c21-0ee7-4b2f-8d28-975f07a767bd">Before and after the game, characters might mingle with other students.

<p data-content-chunk-id="048fd570-1da5-4099-9044-70c356dc0c4d">Even as the game of Wizard Gizzard ends and a winner is declared, Bow’s End Tavern erupts into pandemonium. Read or paraphrase the following:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>Panicked shouting erupts from the tavern’s kitchen. Chef Curtie, her braided hair flapping wildly, emerges at a run, shouting and waving her arms.</p>
<p>“The steam! It’s too spicy!” she cries. “It’s trying to kill us! Someone, please help!”</p>
<p>The tavern is so busy that most of its patrons don’t immediately notice Curtie’s panic. Tulk Tusktooth does, but he’s momentarily overwhelmed by those students in the overflow seating who have noticed—and who are trying to get away from the kitchen as fast as they can. You have a clear path to the kitchen door—and Curtie needs help!</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4b41d739-3481-432c-8707-4e62a73fba6d">When the characters enter <a href="#E6Kitchen" title="area E6" data-content-chunk-id="e0f5449e-2831-46d0-83b5-eed28a0e718d">area E6</a>, they find the kitchen’s student cooks <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a> on the floor, while four <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17022-steam-mephit" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17022-tooltip">steam mephits</a> fly around the cauldrons. As in the previous scenes, one of the cooks can be another student the characters have interacted with, filling in for an absent cook for the evening.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="96e97eee-6205-450e-b9ae-670fabb0030d">The hostile mephits attack as soon as the characters appear, but they aren’t the only threat in the kitchen. Horrid masses of summoned skittering bugs suddenly pour out of bags and boxes of ingredients in the food prep areas, just as other students storm into the kitchen behind the characters. While the characters take on the more dangerous mephits, describe their friends and fellow students working in the background alongside them to help clear the bugs out of the kitchen. As soon as the mephits are dispatched, the magic flaring up in the kitchen fades.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b4db00a1-10ad-40b7-be94-3b57b252c5b5">If all the characters fall <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a> during the fight, Tulk shows up at the start of the next round and dispatches the mephits. Tulk has two <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/71-potion-of-healing" data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/71-tooltip">potions of healing</a> stored behind the servers’ station, and he offers them to any injured characters. If the discussion turns to what happened, Tulk explains that sometimes Curtie’s culinary experiments go awry, so such chaos in the kitchen isn’t unheard of. For her part, Curtie insists that the mephits were not part of any new recipe test, and that they came out of nowhere.</p>

If the characters ask either Tulk Tusktooth or Curtie Axechucker about the substance, both suspect that one of the many magic unguents used on campus might have gotten corrupted. They have no way of knowing that Murgaxor’s corrupted eldritch balm is the unguent in question and no idea what else might be affected.</p>

<p>ALL ABOUT OWLBEARS</p>
<p>To give this Exam more flavor, describe some of the facts the characters are trying to memorize, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16975-owlbear" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16975-tooltip">Owlbears</a> are aggressive and often ill-tempered carnivores. They are known to attack without provocation.</li>
<li>Owlbears most often live in caves or ruins. The bones of their prey serve as their beds and playgrounds.</li>
<li>Owlbears attack with their razor-sharp beaks and claws.</li>
<li>Many scholars believe a kooky wizard created the first owlbear in a breeding experiment gone awry. However, some elves claim owlbears have always existed in the Feywild.</li>
<li>Although they aren’t naturally drawn to cupcakes and muffins, these foods are known to quell an owlbear’s foul temper. Arcano-biologists believe they quell the creatures’ rumbling acid reflux.</li>
<li>Owlbears respond best to training that mimics exactly what their trainer wishes them to do. Crawling on one’s hands and knees is often the best way to teach an owlbear to be a mount, for example.</li>
<li>An owlbear’s screech sounds vaguely similar to the cry of an enormous owl with terrible indigestion. Owls don’t suffer from indigestion, though, making this a sure sign that an owlbear is nearby.</li>

The manor dates to the earliest days of Strixhaven, when the owlin mage and military veteran Captain Raymous Dapplewing held faculty appointments in both Lorehold and Silverquill Colleges. Wanting a quiet place to retire in the evenings—and to host lavish dinner-parties-turned-colloquiums—the professor used his significant military pension to build this manor house on campus.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fe6746af-51a5-49e5-a239-3353eff872b4">Upon his death, Captain Dapplewing bequeathed the manor to the university, which honored his legacy by giving the house his name and keeping most of its original furnishings in pristine condition. The house’s upper-floor libraries were converted into offices for esteemed dual-college faculty members, and those faculty members meet here with students on academic matters during the day. In the evenings, the manor is the site of dinner parties and elegant cocktail hours for those faculty members, their most promising students, and visiting alumni.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2bae4327-22e1-4600-a8d6-94d1521c7eba">Since no one permanently lives in Captain Dapplewing’s Manor, the building is closed and locked from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. Because it holds many valuable antiques and volumes of sensitive research, security measures are in place in the manor, as described below.</p>
<aside class="rules-text" id="TheJigIsUp">
<p>THE JIG IS UP!</p>
<p>If the characters alert security to their unauthorized presence at the manor, they are caught when the professors arrive. The professors force the characters to return to their dormitories, but the characters are free to undertake this mission another night. If they’re caught more than once, the characters must attend special behavioral classes that prevent them from participating in any Extracurriculars or Jobs for the rest of the academic year. The characters immediately lose any benefits from these activities.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8516bfa7-908b-4dd2-a48d-9e1076fc7fab">Once the characters are ready to go, allow them to approach the house in any way they see fit. The easiest way to access the manor is through its locked front doors (area C1), although characters could easily try to access the manor via one of the decks at the back (areas C10 and C11).</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CaptainDapplewingsManorFeatures" data-content-chunk-id="9f2f1dbf-9234-451f-bd38-ece1770d5d40"><a href="#CaptainDapplewingsManorFeatures" data-content-chunk-id="88789bf3-1a37-449d-b35f-ace720750735"></a>Captain Dapplewing’s Manor Features</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="12ea87ca-3ef6-4b4e-b03e-dae816f0b6e3">The manor has the following features:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8df2eaab-8433-4085-80c0-187165246414"><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The ceilings throughout the manor are 20 feet high.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37138ef4-2136-4bd1-b3e1-ff9df0fc790d"><strong>Doors.</strong> The manor’s outside doors (in <a href="#C1Veranda" title="areas C1" data-content-chunk-id="baaa3cbf-7e8a-464b-94c4-01e7da1e795b">areas C1</a>, <a href="#C10GrandDeck" title="C10" data-content-chunk-id="625f3ce1-a44b-45b3-8680-d90360bade34">C10</a>, and <a href="#C11SideDeck" title="C11" data-content-chunk-id="53283bf5-8b34-401e-a860-4e89581e9309">C11</a>) are locked. A character can pick a lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. Anyone can easily break the glass doors, but doing so summons security (see below). The inside doors are unlocked unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d57b7b2-f083-4439-927c-2851ac6981ad"><strong>Lighting.</strong> By night, the interior of the manor is in darkness.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7246862a-c620-4460-bad2-76825a06b8a7"><strong>Magic Stairs.</strong> Stairs and steps in the manor are enchanted to move and reshape themselves for full accessibility.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="61607eed-e48d-4b39-859e-a1128cc51186"><strong>Transport Circles.</strong> A runic circle is painted on the floor near each staircase in the manor, as well as at the top and bottom of the steps leading inside the building in area C1. These circles are permanent, customized teleportation circles. Anyone can move onto a circle and mentally focus on the floor to which they wish to travel. (The circle leading to the attic is in the manor’s hidden staircase, which must be found first.) When a character is teleported from a circle near a staircase, they arrive on the destination floor on the runic circle nearest the corresponding staircase. The circle outside the main entrance automatically transports characters directly in front of the manor’s front doors.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef7fdfb1-a65b-4f40-8a28-e83a0cae9772"><strong>Security.</strong> If an outside door is smashed or the characters engage in noticeable vandalism, a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160332-silverquill-professor-of-radiance" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160332-tooltip">Silverquill professor of radiance</a> and a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160324-quandrix-professor-of-substance" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160324-tooltip">Quandrix professor of substance</a> (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes/" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="73ebc9a5-4b95-4856-8ff4-f666d83ef051">chapter 7</a> for both) arrive at the manor in 1d4 rounds. Both are serving as campus security for the night and deal with the characters as noted in the sidebar “<a href="#TheJigIsUp" title="The Jig Is Up!" data-content-chunk-id="750df941-2fb9-4753-80e8-557054bf0a71">The Jig Is Up!</a>”</p>
<aside class="rules-text" id="JustaLittleVandalism">
<p>JUST A LITTLE VANDALISM?</p>
<p>If the characters are on their best behavior, avoiding combat and trying not to break anything, they should be able to have fun in this event without worrying about lasting damage to the manor. All the Constructs here (including the Earl and the dragon heads plaque) have a self-restoring quality that allows them to repair damage taken during a skirmish. But if characters egregiously smash open doors or engage in property damage, impose repercussions even if their mission to retrieve Sassy Sally Jane is successful.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ba3e9aff-c562-4e50-9f48-91847f876175">Normally a place where people socialize while they wait for dinner, this space is occupied at night by a clockwork butler nicknamed the Earl, which paces back and forth.

<p data-content-chunk-id="7225f88b-14fb-47d6-a921-2df1dc74aef6">The piano is functional and magical. If a character tries to play it, the piano plays an entire jaunty, military-style march.

<p data-content-chunk-id="7e37090c-569a-4dd3-b078-78cc5aff7bd4">Once Captain Dapplewing’s study, this large office is often used for sensitive discussions among faculty members. The decor has stayed the same since Captain Dapplewing’s time.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="042fc1ee-1b2f-4552-ad54-9591fe942bbe">On the northern wall, a plaque holds the heads of a black and a red dragon, each clearly constructed from metallic crafting supplies. This device is a strange magic curiosity that was once a favorite of the captain’s and that faculty members using the office know to avoid. The plaque animates both heads to attack any character who moves within 5 feet of it.</p>

On initiative count 20, the black dragon head exhales a glob of acid while the red dragon exhales a fiery missile, each targeting one creature the head can see (+6 to hit). A creature hit by either attack takes 6 (1d8 + 2) damage of the appropriate type (acid or fire).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="48f865a3-8aae-46a6-99ef-d44ff9942f77">Each head has a speed of 0, AC 16, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Their ability scores are as follows: Strength 6, Dexterity 14, Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1.</p>

The inscription “V. Lang” inside the band hints that the ring belongs to Verelda Lang, the characters’ Magical Physiologies professor. If they bring the lost ring to her, she is effusive in her thanks—and then offers it to the characters as a gift, trying to conceal her pride at their accomplishments.</p>

<p>This spacious lounge is decorated to an arcano-bio­logist’s tastes. Paintings of strange magic creatures line the walls, as do mounted collections of insects and reptiles.

All the students can easily steal back to their dormitories without getting caught. The characters’ peers are true to their word and pay for the characters’ lunches for a month. Further, the characters can keep Sassy Sally Jane. (However, obvious use of the doll around faculty members results in Sassy Sally Jane being confiscated again!)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9f62dd17-3053-44b8-b503-f777e7d56c25">If all the characters are reduced to 0 hit points inside the manor, they spend the night <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a> and are found by members of the faculty in the morning. The characters are taken to the infirmary in their respective dorms, then formally chastised and made to attend special behavioral courses that prevent them from participating in any Extracurriculars or Jobs for the rest of this academic year. All the characters immediately lose any benefits from these activities.</p>

<li>Bones and carrion mixed with trash are often a strong sign that an otyugh is present, as it waits for carrion to ferment before eating it.</li>
<li>Shiny treasures glinting from piles of refuse might indicate an otyugh’s presence, as these Aberrations hoard treasures from their victims.</li>
<li>No matter how disgusting it might be, trash doesn’t belch. If you ever hear a pile of trash belch, there’s an otyugh in there.</li>
<li>Some spellcasters use otyughs as guardians, both to protect their underground lairs and to dispose of their enemies.</li>
<li>Characters with evil designs who wish to congregate far from prying eyes often operate underground, knowing that the authorities avoid stench- and trash-filled undercrofts and sewers. In such foul locations, otyughs make excellent sidekicks.</li>

See <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes/" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="d93a8e23-9baa-4dea-a7cf-96105ac2ae7e">chapter 7</a> for stat blocks for <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160303-first-year-student" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160303-tooltip">first-year students</a>, and for apprentices, pledgemages, and professors from the different colleges.</p>

<p>SETTING UP SEDGEMOOR</p>
<p>The characters will have heard about Sedgemoor during their first year at Strixhaven, but they have likely had no reason to explore the bayou surrounding the Witherbloom College campus. That changes when Verelda Lang (the characters’ Magical Physiologies professor) assigns them to collect material components in Sedgemoor for her spells. Set up this assignment in the course of preparing for this event, so that the characters have the task already in mind when they learn of the connections between Sedgemoor and the strange magic plaguing the campus.</p>

All descriptions assume the characters are present in daylight hours during the Rose Stage Festival. At night, the area is devoid of students and the doors to the annex building are locked.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7da2efdf-8bb1-40b8-baf2-a6f2ead7978e">This area contains rows of benches, magically treated to resist the elements, and with low-sloping ramps set between them. During the festival, some fifty students can be found in this area, sitting, chatting, and watching the performances.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="R2OrchestraPit" data-content-chunk-id="69211ab7-4f08-4ffa-91f2-f969c192fd71"><a href="#R2OrchestraPit" data-content-chunk-id="522ff7d5-c154-4226-a7e1-4290a226b07a"></a>R2. Orchestra Pit</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ffffd452-333a-4740-aea8-4f72e7fb5d5f">This sunken area is reserved for the student or professional musicians who accompany musical productions or provide ambient music for other stage shows. During the festival, members of the Strixhaven Show Band Association hand out kazoos from this spot to any spectators who wish to accompany the improvised performances.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="R3MainStage" data-content-chunk-id="98051779-90df-42d2-89e7-a6c238cd9412"><a href="#R3MainStage" data-content-chunk-id="4d56af6b-391f-489b-b006-c651c1332625"></a>R3. Main Stage</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b63155dc-1af0-413c-aa27-c759669c5cec">This impressively large oval stage has ample room for performers, props, and other set pieces. A wide set of magic steps rises 5 feet to the stage; sections of it are enchanted to move and reshape themselves for full accessibility. Pillars to the east and west of the stage are used by production groups to rig backdrops and other set pieces.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="95dbb36c-f3d7-4fa9-8543-1b8f5ceef78a">All improvisational acting during the festival must take place on the stage. Members of the Playactors Drama Guild are set up to the south of the stage, handing out random character prompts. (See the “<a href="#RoseStageFestival" title="Rose Stage Festival" data-content-chunk-id="2fae6a35-7518-42da-99f0-70dcaeed07e0">Rose Stage Festival</a>” section for more information.)</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f9c2a724-25e4-45fc-a65a-c06062cc9d63">When regular plays are being performed at the Rose Stage, these doors open up to an area where student performers wait for their cues before discreetly ascending to the main stage. During the festival, this area is empty.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eeb159db-31f4-474e-a4d0-010012759a00">Although the doors are locked at night, any character who is a member of the Playactors Drama Guild has a key that opens the doors, or a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0f581bcd-9d79-4dda-8c83-68bbdc0adde2">Normally used for performers to dress, apply makeup, and make other preparations before a show, this area is empty during the festival.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e4bdfe8b-000b-4f73-a4f9-bf3924bc2468">These short hallways connect the main areas of the annex building to its two storage rooms.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="R7StageStorageArea" data-content-chunk-id="1fa65d36-4fcd-457d-a9a5-c3c7d8b73219"><a href="#R7StageStorageArea" data-content-chunk-id="f32f0bf9-8875-44dd-894e-eb2bcbb5c1bb"></a>R7. Stage Storage Area</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0c5d4e39-1b28-4e37-842f-b96b70ab3339">These areas hold props, equipment, and supplies used for the Rose Stage’s productions. Most of what’s here is marked “Property of the Playactors Drama Guild,” though a few items and boxes are unmarked.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da721e77-b5aa-47a6-876e-396511a9398f"><em><strong>Treasure.</strong></em> A thorough search and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check reveals several valuable items in each storage area.

<p data-content-chunk-id="9823c0ee-8b6d-4102-a059-a3d3e0a1a928">Characters following the student who got their attention can make their way to the Rose Stage for the festival, where another student catches their attention. This person should also be a student the characters have interacted with previously. Read or paraphrase the following, altering the text to incorporate the student’s name or other details:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>Cheers, jeers, and the buzzing of kazoos ring out as you draw near the Rose Stage on Silverquill College’s campus. On the main stage, several students playact histrionically. One wears a flamboyant noble’s costume, another wears a felt dragon’s head, and a third wears a court jester’s pantaloons. The audience roars with laughter as the scene plays out.</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b48fb335-df3c-4aac-9ee4-09f92390e112">A familiar smiling figure approaches the characters. Brandishing a kazoo and laughing, the student says:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>“You here to act? Or maybe just to watch? Or maybe you’re the musical talent? Either way, this is going to be great! I can’t wait to see what you try!”</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3b323854-dcdc-4e91-8a7c-27f32d59343f">The Rose Stage Festival is an improvisational performance that the Playactors Drama Guild puts together every year, and everyone on campus is invited to participate. The goal is to create as much hilarity and fun as possible, and the antics of some festivals are talked about on campus for years.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheShow" data-content-chunk-id="a48e6783-0018-4aa9-a550-3608f912535e"><a href="#TheShow" data-content-chunk-id="98312f88-7c93-4b32-913f-8fc3b1e94610"></a>The Show</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e0185527-1d52-4f9c-84e9-06acb895c208">Members of the Playactors Drama Guild hand out lists of random character prompts to anyone who wants to try acting. Anyone who wishes to play a character on stage chooses a prompt, dons a few costume elements from the trunks of costumes provided by the Playactors Drama Guild, and lines up on the east end of the main stage (<a href="" title="area R3" data-content-chunk-id="749cf9b9-dcb8-4a95-9db3-d51706f3342f">area R3</a>). There, Quentillius Antiphiun Melentor III (neutral human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160303-first-year-student" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160303-tooltip">first-year student</a>; see the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships#QuentilliusAntiphiunMelentorIII" title="Fellow Students" data-content-chunk-id="ef8ea412-b1c7-42fe-9a18-109e07a401ef">Fellow Students</a>” section) instructs a waiting participant to “tag in” to the ongoing performance and “tag out” someone currently on stage. Quentillius keeps the transitions narratively clean, while members of the crowd cheer, jeer, and shout ideas to the improvising actors. Other participants work the random props, set pieces, and sound effects the Playactors Drama Guild has strewn about the stage area to augment the improvised events.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c7697585-3853-43ea-8528-a6f60bf9527e">Members of the crowd might play kazoos to musically accompany the drama on stage. A number of members of the Strixhaven Show Band Association are handing out kazoos from the orchestra pit (<a href="#R2OrchestraPit" title="area R2" data-content-chunk-id="c78cc647-6c03-428b-ab4f-bf6866bd20ba">area R2</a>), including student conductor Rubina Larkingdale (lawful neutral human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160303-first-year-student" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160303-tooltip">first-year student</a>; see the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships#RubinaLarkingdale" title="Fellow Students" data-content-chunk-id="81c8355c-c1e7-436b-b367-b870c1f874e2">Fellow Students</a>” section).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a626b0fa-559a-40ca-b72b-853bbd5cd349">The festival’s improvised play continues until all volunteer performers have exhausted their prompts. More frequently, however, a faculty member needs to shut down the festival, which becomes increasingly rowdy later into the night.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4c888be8-1561-4d04-8be8-79f64119e9e5">The following subsections detail the ways in which the characters can join the fun.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="PerformonStage" data-content-chunk-id="4c329a3e-7a70-48e6-b185-e7b0aa251e65"><a href="#PerformonStage" data-content-chunk-id="e7bcf482-db64-4ff4-865c-151284a378bb"></a>Perform on Stage</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08d14a9b-0078-4d1f-aefb-d4403756d53a">A character who wants to perform chooses a character prompt and whatever costume pieces catch their eye and then heads to the east side of the stage (<a href="#R3MainStage" title="area R3" data-content-chunk-id="2dc6b84d-6b73-4da7-be31-07f5ee858ebd">area R3</a>). After waiting a short while, Quentillius signals a break in the action so that the new performer can take the stage. The player character can act out their improv character in the performance any way they like. Raising the creativity beyond just acting to incorporate singing, rapping, or dancing is encouraged! No matter what approach the player takes to their character’s performance, impressing the crowd also requires a successful DC 13 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/18-tooltip">Performance</a>) check. (If another ability check or skill feels applicable to an unconventional performance, feel free to let the character make that check instead.) A successful ability check results in the crowd’s cheering and whistling, while a failed check results in boos and jeers. Further, the character whose Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/18-tooltip">Performance</a>) check is highest earns a valuable reward from an appreciative professor after this event ends; see “<a href="#AProfessorsAppreciation" title="A Professor’s Appreciation" data-content-chunk-id="a5ac7ea3-b7da-4338-8f18-c6c0e88e367b">A Professor’s Appreciation</a>.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bc6d421e-9791-47c9-a61c-c16d61c7b334">To increase the level of the challenge—and the fun—you might have interested players roll their characters’ prompts randomly on the Festival Character Prompts table.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fa87134e-4481-464c-9149-ce1645942154">A character who doesn’t want to perform can handle props from the ends of the stage. When Quentillius cues them, the character can bring one of the many prepared stage props to the performers, move a set piece around the stage, or improvise sound effects to augment the improvised play. This might include carrying wooden cutouts of painted waves during a nautical scene, rolling fake monsters near the actors when danger threatens and impersonating the monsters’ snarls, handing dueling actors improbable “weapons,” or the like. Responding to the cues in a way that complements the action on stage requires a successful DC 13 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="86895f56-715d-4760-b6d6-578ec0699837">When a character handles props, allow them to choose the props they like most from the Festival Props table or have them roll on that table. These props are scattered around the outer stage.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="89b8f785-47ec-4f82-977e-e3df1d292116">The owlbear prop turns into an actual attacking <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16975-owlbear" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16975-tooltip">owlbear</a>. Assume the owlbear is on whichever side of the stage is closest to the most characters. The player characters must jump into action quickly to defend the other students. When they do, if a character made a successful ability check during the Rose Stage Festival, they have advantage on their first attack against the owlbear.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="66d190d1-d1cf-4748-9964-60ff26e871e2">Once the characters have participated in the Rose Stage Festival and dispatched the owlbear threat, if she’s not already on the scene, Professor Totsky approaches the characters and applauds them. She thanks them for dispatching the threat, and she compliments any character who made a successful ability check during the performance. A lover of theater who is immaculately dressed, the professor tells the characters that she recently commissioned a new cloak; she offers the cloak she’s wearing in appreciation of the character whose Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/18-tooltip">Performance</a>) check to perform on stage was highest.

<p data-content-chunk-id="c030e867-7816-4b15-9198-bca419e9e858">Once the threat is ended, the characters can examine the owlbear to learn more about this incident. If they do, they find the same oily substance they might have found on the trunk during orientation, seen belched out by the frogs before the Firejolt Café race, or spotted on the cauldrons in Bow’s End Tavern.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="852bd2fa-0713-4db7-9b5f-49ef44b97dc5">If she hasn’t already entered the scene, Professor Totsky arrives while the characters examine the substance. She initially shrugs it off as irrelevant, given that its magic has already faded. But if the characters explain everything they’ve seen at the past year’s strange events to reveal the unseen connections between those events, Professor Totsky realizes what’s going on.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b1e8cf6-4420-4279-86b9-f068436be61f">She explains eldritch balm to the characters and says she believes it’s likely that the Sedgemoor waters used to brew the latest batch of eldritch balm were corrupted in some way. She doesn’t necessarily suspect foul play but mentions that, in the past, students have been caught practicing forbidden magic in the more remote parts of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses Witherbloom College’s campus. Such sinister magic might be responsible for the balm’s corruption, but a random surge of wild magic is an equally likely explanation in her mind. In any case, this corruption must have caused objects treated with the eldritch balm and creatures that came into contact with it to take on temporary—and dangerous—magical properties.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b505ee2f-3263-4580-9af7-be89f6444eab">Professor Totsky gives the characters a <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/50-holy-water-flask" data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/50-tooltip">flask of holy water</a> and explains that pouring it into the underwater spring whose waters are used to create eldritch balm will settle the waters and prevent further corruption. She describes the location of the spring (<a href="#S7UnderwaterSpring" title="area S7" data-content-chunk-id="caf997c6-f253-4499-9cbc-1e79549ee770">area S7</a> on <a href="#Map36sedgemoor" title="map 3.6" data-content-chunk-id="2e1171c8-09a5-4a9c-9e2f-07f8fee9e76a">map 3.6</a>) to help the characters find it. She urges the characters to take on this task so she can immediately track down the rest of the contaminated balm and remove it from objects on campus.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9fa4ff23-5a55-4b62-b3ac-f045d754b4ba">The day after the incident at the Rose Stage Festival, the characters are scheduled to collect spell components from Sedgemoor and bring those samples back to Professor Lang, who teaches their Magical Physiologies course. This gives them a convenient opportunity to investigate that area on behalf of Professor Totsky.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="51928e13-dc17-433c-a04a-d5c7a1f4a66e">The characters know that they must pour the flask of holy water given to them by Professor Totsky into an underwater spring somewhere in area S7. Doing so should prevent future flare-ups of the wild magic that tainted the eldritch balm behind all the strange campus mishaps. In addition, they can find Murgaxor’s journal, which points to a spellcaster’s troublesome meddling, in <a href="#S7UnderwaterSpring" title="area S7" data-content-chunk-id="d5d31b95-3a40-4bad-9965-c45c63d62e75">area S7</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9d41786a-da5a-4e0e-86bc-6bfe22923517">The journal belonged to the evil <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160313-murgaxor" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160313-tooltip">Murgaxor</a>; it slipped out of his pocket while he practiced the corrupting magic that caused this academic year’s mishaps. The journal notes that Murgaxor’s last step in this scheme involved the Rose Stage Festival, so it’s clear he has no more immediate plans to threaten campus. However, this isn’t the end of his villainy—the true extent becomes clear in later adventures.</p>

<li data-content-chunk-id="125b78ea-42ea-4013-813e-e28fbf3f3d7b">When the game begins, the two mascots are placed on high towers at opposite ends of the field of play.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a9fc70f5-d246-4929-9a8c-e5eb08f4f840">Each team tries to steal the opposing mascot and transport it back to the tower at their end of the field. Doing so scores one point.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="87856abf-dad1-436c-86da-3be2a921eb8a">The game occurs in three phases of 20 minutes each.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="de39d728-5f3f-49b2-b5f9-f37fec7343ba">The team that scores the most points by the end of the third phase wins the game.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="caea91eb-401e-4a8f-95e3-6d07d9060cc2">Once the characters decide to form one of the two Mage Tower teams for the Battle of Strixhaven, they must register the team with Professor Mavinda Sharpbeak (campus counselor and owlin <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160332-silverquill-professor-of-radiance" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160332-tooltip">Silverquill professor of radiance</a>; see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes#SilverquillProfessorofRadiance" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="82584a43-4cbe-47a4-9d05-20b02a16e41e">chapter 7</a>). Their team includes all the characters; the characters might recruit student NPCs to join their team, although filling their roster up to five participants isn’t required. The opposing team has an equal number of participants. Multiple teams may register for the tournament; the faculty choose two to compete in the Battle of Strixhaven. The characters’ team is chosen to compete along with a team that consists of their Rivals and other NPCs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f90108d0-b4eb-4704-a388-991c903d6cc0">More information about the Battle of Strixhaven and the opposing team is provided later in this adventure. The Mage Tower game isn’t until the end of the academic year, but preparing for it plays a key role in this adventure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d25e9790-e697-4a59-88ec-41ec1991555e">If you wish, roleplay the scene in which the characters register their team with Professor Sharpbeak. The owlin counselor can be found in the Biblioplex near the Hall of Oracles. There, she’s helping direct new first-year students to vital places on campus. For a description and map of the Biblioplex (<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/campus-kerfuffle#Map31thebiblioplex" title="map 3.1" data-content-chunk-id="059d4942-2198-4577-815d-5fcd4e5223df">map 3.1</a>), see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/campus-kerfuffle" title="chapter 3" data-content-chunk-id="4eefb4e9-0133-4bba-95e6-8429771551fd">chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c8693de7-6178-424e-9c12-091ccf45da27">If characters don’t immediately leap at the chance to form a Mage Tower team for the Battle of Strixhaven, emphasize that every peer they speak with wants to see them participate. In addition to social rewards, the characters learn that participating in the Battle of Strixhaven earns them a permanent commendation on their student record, as well as a monetary prize of half of their tuition for this academic year waived. Effectively, this means each character receives 400 gp if their team wins.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3351a1bc-e548-4b64-8c2b-802deacd2b3b">She says the following in a confiding voice:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>“It’s fortunate that you’ve found me now. This Mage Tower game is my event to organize, but everything is already going wrong.</p>
<p>“You see, I need to tag the college mascots on campus—those little magical creatures that roam the grounds. We use them as mascots for our Mage Tower games. If the deans find out that some of the mascots aren’t cataloged, my reputation will be ruined!</p>
<p>“Before classes began, I corralled the mascots on an island in Sedgemoor. But before I finished cataloging them, a half-dozen escaped and vanished. This morning, I heard students chattering about mascots causing a commotion on the outer grounds of Wiltroot Hall.”</p>

<p>“Each of them must be tagged with these bands. But I can’t do it myself. With the start of classes, I’m buried under work.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen how you handle yourselves, and I’m impressed with your skills. Could you head to Wiltroot Hall on Witherbloom’s campus and discreetly slip these bands onto every mascot you find? I’d be grateful. What’s more, I’d owe you a favor. What do you say?”</p>

If the characters discuss finding a mascot to represent their team, Professor Sharpbeak assures them that any mascot they find at Wiltroot Hall could serve as their team mascot. If the characters don’t ask about mascots now, you can prompt them to choose a mascot later in the academic year, when the game approaches. Mascots don’t confer benefits in the game, although Mage Tower participants are often sentimental about their mascots.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="206889ee-abc0-4630-a280-996473042338">As he grows more proficient in his ability to siphon creatures’ energy to power his magic, Murgaxor is practicing lesser forms of the magic that will eventually culminate in his destructive ritual in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/a-reckoning-in-ruins/" title="chapter 6" data-content-chunk-id="d083df44-cea3-4068-8896-1209e995df76">chapter 6</a>.

The walkways are two feet above the swamp. Hopping over the guard rail into the bog or clearings below, or pulling oneself up onto a walkway from the ground below, requires an action but no ability check.</p>

Over the course of the term, students learn how to tell scribbles and doodles from magically imbued symbols, and they study popular accounts of adventurers who’ve come across magic-based writing in their travels. They also learn about common spells that incorporate writing and symbology in their casting.

<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>You hear the party before you see it. Laughter, whooping, and shouting waft from the stage as a chaotic scene comes into sight.</p>
<p>On the main Rose Stage, a dozen students playfully dart away from several pests while other mascots watch nearby. The scurrying students hold goopy substances in their hands that look like honey mixed with mushroom pieces. Off to the side, more students stand, laughing and holding curious-looking wands.</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd846b05-3c3b-48d3-9217-67b8d2d79c73">A student shouts through uncontrollable giggling:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>“Gross! Look at those goofs, covered in pest bait! I don’t know what’s in it, but the pests love it. We’ll give them their snacks—we were just waiting on you. We knew you’d want in on this mascot-stacking contest! The other mascots want to play, too!”</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e8efafa3-217e-4b67-b1b6-6d36f0fe4066">Once the characters arrive on the scene, the students with the pest bait feed the pests. Twenty mascots occupy the stage, with each campus represented: two <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160297-art-elemental-mascot" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160297-tooltip">art elementals</a> from Prismari, two <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160304-fractal-mascot" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160304-tooltip">fractals</a> from Quandrix, two <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160307-inkling-mascot" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160307-tooltip">inklings</a> from Silverquill, four <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160334-spirit-statue-mascot" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160334-tooltip">spirit statues</a> from Lorehold, and ten <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160317-pest-mascot" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160317-tooltip">pests</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9304e48b-7cd8-4356-86ec-ba2a444acaab">The bait the students concocted for the pests is made from sugary syrup mixed with mushrooms taken from Witherbloom’s campus. The students recently discovered it’s a harmless snack that keeps pests docile, allowing anyone to play with the normally flighty mascots.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb07e4e0-f929-41d7-9050-e2fde59152b6">The students standing beside the stage hold wands that are ordinary spellcasting focuses imbued with a limited telekinesis-like effect. When pointed at a mascot within 5 feet, a wand magically lifts the mascot, places it atop another adjacent mascot, and stabilizes the stacked mascots. The mascots might still topple over afterward, but the wands allow the students to stack the mascots without having to physically manipulate them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9c3ce061-b407-4afe-94c4-8191611ce6b8">In this game, the other mascots jovially participate in the stacking contest. The spirit statues offer to serve as each stack’s base. The art elementals, fractals, and inklings gleefully wait to be piled on the stacks while the pests snack away, oblivious to the game.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0eb64d27-1b5c-45c1-9811-7ac06e5c19de">As noted above, each mascot-stacking team has two members, each of whom uses a wand.

<p data-content-chunk-id="88b2898f-0ca5-4a9e-ad01-8753b5633553">When the characters are ready to begin practice, read or paraphrase the following:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>Before you is a carefully maintained dirt field. In the center, an elongated hexagon etched in glowing, magical chalk outlines a series of ramps built into the dirt.</p>
<p>Dugouts face each other on opposite sides of the field. North of the dugouts are bleachers, and south of the dugouts are some outbuildings. Right now, the most prominent feature is a gnome dressed in black-and-white striped shorts and a matching tunic. A knapsack hangs at her side, and a large whistle dangles from her neck. Rosie Wuzfeddlims, one of Strixhaven’s student referees, is ready for some serious game time.</p>
<p>“Friends!” she shouts. “Stupendous timing! Oh, this is going to be great!”</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c979e79f-4d82-4480-9696-b4ea6171ae47">Aerojaunt Field was once the university’s primary sports field. Now, years after the construction of Strixhaven Stadium, the field sees far less use. Its official purpose is as a dedicated practice field for Strixhaven’s high-profile student teams, whose official matches take place in newer facilities elsewhere on campus.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="736861f3-01d8-4e6f-b6d0-c9510fd9f12c">However, less competitive teams hold their matches on this field, most notably the Intramural Silkball Club. The elevated ramps used in silkball matches were permanently built into Aerojaunt Field, whose name evokes a popular silkball move that involves using magic to hop through the air.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7f1508b8-59e6-441e-9bcc-604d92f07d48">When the characters are ready to start practice, Rosie retrieves two bright blue wooden dummy mascots from <a href="#A2SoutheasternOutbuilding" title="area A2" data-content-chunk-id="7aaf3707-6acb-4f8b-8a33-ee32431d847a">area A2</a>. She explains that the characters need to split into two teams for the purposes of scrimmaging; if there is an odd number of characters, Rosie joins in as a participant.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="702c1207-903e-4f0c-afe7-f8b0e9ad9b57">Once the teams are determined, Rosie assigns each team one of the blue dummy mascots.

Then she escorts the characters to the center of the ramp elevated to 20 feet (see <a href="#Map42aerojauntfield" title="map 4.2" data-content-chunk-id="a5adfc99-e681-4aef-be28-947dce92d981">map 4.2</a>). She explains that the scrimmage will take place over three phases that each last twenty minutes; when she gives the signal, the teams should dash toward the opposing team’s mascot, grab it, and try to bring it back to their own team’s end of the field to score a point. Participants can use magic or physical means to steal their opponents’ mascot and defend their own, but they can’t damage any participants, the mascots, the audience, or the facility.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4f2d2bbf-45a8-4cb0-8945-6fb8cbd9cc5b"><em><strong>Using Magic.</strong></em> Instead of making an ability check, a character can cast a spell. The level of the spell determines the benefit:</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="12f86d6a-e0c4-4030-90f4-245d9837e6c3"><strong>3rd Level or Higher.</strong> If a character casts a spell of 3rd level or higher, it counts as a successful ability check for the purpose of determining the winner.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b6f09edc-4b61-427a-a501-c2eae667d68c">Ask the player to describe which spell the character casts and how it helps their team during play.

<p>Behind the tavern, several groups of students cluster around an empty pool, laughing and waving improvised skates made from wooden planks with wheels affixed to the bottom.

<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>“We were hoping you’d turn up! See these skates? On their own, pretty difficult to use, right? But check out this training wand from spellcasting class. Someone figured out that a skater can use the wand to help pull off the sweetest tricks. What better way to try it out than a contest?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1f9c669b-32ed-44c2-bb4e-6ead1e2e403e">The wand the student is wielding is one of several scattered throughout the crowd. These wands are ordinary spellcasting foci imbued with minor magical effects. Strixhaven’s instructors use them to help students practice their wand-wielding skills. These wands can create minor effects such as little puffs of smoke or crackles of energy, but clever spellcasters can use the wands while skating to perform minor jumps and acrobatic tricks on skates.</p>

Each character who wants to participate must strap on the rudimentary skates that their peers cobbled together. At least one participant in the skate-off is a student NPC, and you should roll their checks.

The librarians confirm that the book is located in the Scriptoria Collections, but they’re unsure exactly how it was cataloged, so the characters need to track it down. If the characters ask the librarians or anyone else about strange chitinous creatures (if you’re running this as a standalone) or the magical signature they’ve found all over campus (if you’re running this as a campaign), no one knows anything about either subject.</p>

The great elven scholar and Strixhaven alumnus Arick Quenthorne donated the collection’s initial materials. He went on to become a powerful director at Strixhaven.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a4f0ee6a-18af-47d5-afb0-90f494963e90">Director Quenthorne was a leading occult scholar who specialized in studying the esoteric power inherent in physical objects, especially written words and symbols. Later in his career, Quenthorne shifted his interest to the evolution of magical creatures, especially those associated with spellcasters, so the records contain a dazzling assortment of information.</p>

Any character who spends at least 10 minutes studying this tome learns that during his time as an administrator, Director Quenthorne discovered creatures lurking off campus called mage hunters. The tome provides sketches of chitinous plates matching those the characters found.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="794b7c99-9213-451e-b4d2-821637d22aff">The tome states that pairs of mage hunters break with their allies to hunt specific individuals who catch their attention.

Director Quenthorne wrote about a student who practiced bizarre magic while attending Strixhaven during Quenthorne’s tenure as an administrator 200 years ago. This student used magic to siphon energy and life from creatures. The tome describes the strange magic’s lingering aura, which is identical to the magic the characters have observed.

<p data-content-chunk-id="67e3c2f2-eb1f-4446-ba9e-a17fa9a89547">There are two stadium locker rooms: one at the north end of the field and another at the south end. The characters are assigned to the southernmost locker room, while their opponents are assigned the northernmost one. Lockers line each room, as do racks of uniforms and field equipment.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1bfffaf2-0a48-4ca6-af2f-f955d50e67f7">Before the game, both teams and their mascots are expected to stay in their respective locker rooms. They must wait until they’re called onto the field before they can level sarcastic comments at members of the opposing team. Feel free to roleplay this situation as appropriate.

<p data-content-chunk-id="cfb285a3-750f-4d73-b4dc-15a9fa4e76ff">When it’s time for the game to begin, the magically enhanced voice of Professor Sharpbeak overwhelms all conversation, even flooding into the locker rooms.</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>“Students and teachers. Staff and friends. Welcome to the Battle of Strixhaven! Today, two teams of Strixhaven’s finest will battle for the right to call themselves champions. They’ve practiced and you’ve waited—now, let the game begin!”</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f3124f9d-be37-43f4-8b5f-c6dff0fccc1a">Once the announcement ends, the teams are required to move from the locker rooms onto the main field. When both teams meet Professor Sharpbeak at the center of the field, Professor Sharpbeak snags the characters’ mascot, flies it to the southern end of the field, and places it there. She then flies the opposing team’s mascot to the field’s north end.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d310b4e-91d0-4fd6-9c97-87a42fee6d90">Returning to the center of the field, she reminds the teams that magic is allowed, but harming other participants, the mascots, the audience, and the facility is not. After a breathless pause, she then blows her whistle. The game is on!</p>

Before the big dance, though, they’ll clash with rivals, pick the perfect masquerade outfit, and help prepare for one of the most glamorous nights of their lives. During this time, an influential faculty member begins to act strangely, and a menacing shadow falls over all of Strixhaven.</p>

<li>The orb has an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 16, as well as hearing and <a class="tooltip-hover sense-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision" data-tooltip-href="/senses/2-tooltip">darkvision</a> out to a range of 30 feet.</li>
<li>The orb can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature touching it.</li>
<li>At any time during your turn, the orb can cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2269-suggestion" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2269-tooltip">suggestion</a> spell (save DC 17), targeting you or one other creature that touched the orb within the last 24 hours. This isn’t a power of the orb that you control.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> Any Humanoid you touch while holding the orb must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. Each creature cursed by the orb bears an echo of Murgaxor’s hateful thoughts, and that creature suffers from headaches that are persistent but not debilitating until the curse ends. On your turn, the orb can use an action to produce one of the following effects, targeting one or more creatures it has cursed:</p>
<p><strong>Unconsciousness.</strong> The cursed creature falls <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a> for 1 hour. The creature is roused if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.</p>
<p><strong>Visions of Terror.</strong> The cursed creature sees terrifying visions, causing it to view all creatures that aren’t also cursed as dangerous monsters for 10 minutes. The cursed creature must use its action each round to make one attack against the nearest non-cursed creature. If the cursed creature has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random. This effect ends if the cursed creature is <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/7-tooltip">incapacitated</a>.</p>
<p>After either of these effects ends, the affected creature is no longer cursed. The curse can also be removed from a creature with a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2229-tooltip">remove curse</a> spell or similar magic. All cases of the curse end if <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4239820-murgaxors-orb" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4239820-tooltip">Murgaxor’s orb</a> is destroyed.</p>
<p><em><strong>Magical Signature.</strong></em> As a side effect of the orb’s curse, the spell <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2065-detect-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2065-tooltip">detect magic</a> reveals an aura of enchantment surrounding creatures bearing the curse. This aura is distinctive, but in a way <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2065-detect-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2065-tooltip">detect magic</a> offers no further details about.</p>
<p><em><strong>Destroying the Orb.</strong></em> <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4239820-murgaxors-orb" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4239820-tooltip">Murgaxor’s orb</a> has AC 18; 20 hit points; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to all other types of damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the orb shatters.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="802ae21f-d12b-45f5-be55-12b6b5678638">The founding masters of Strixhaven University sought ways to mitigate the clashes common among students of different magical colleges. Magister Kollema of Lorehold College recognized that shared experiences and culture created more unity than merely attending the same classes. In light of this, he proposed the first Magister’s Masquerade, which would rely on students from all five colleges to prepare every aspect of the event and would require students to attend in costume, divesting themselves of any college loyalty. The first event was a grand success, and since then the Magister’s Masquerade has been an annual tradition at Strixhaven. It’s a night of magic and mystery that highlights what students can accomplish together and allows them to see one another in a different light.</p>

When the characters arrive at Bow’s End, read or paraphrase the following text:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>A crowd of boisterous third-year students fills Bow’s End Tavern, abuzz with conversations about the Magister’s Masquerade and dream outfits for the event. Among the crowds of chatting friends and mingling students are decorated tables; one is surrounded by the masquerade’s student organizers, and the others are covered in outlandish snacks. A wave of shouts rises from the back of the tavern, where high-energy games are underway.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="256ff1d4-c0ef-4973-99eb-3199b108e59b">Besides students, several faculty members also attend the reception.

Characters recognize her as the professor of their Advanced Arcane History course. If approached, the dean proves pleasant and professional.

<p data-content-chunk-id="0186d442-b227-4807-9542-e538491c2818">Choose one of the following grudges as the reason for the challenge:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01b298dd-ad73-4e95-bbe2-8ba0a0ac14a1"><strong>Dangerous.</strong> The Rival accuses the characters of causing the dangerous events that have occurred over the past two years. They can’t prove it, but they want to punish the characters anyway.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1cea89d8-c20f-4f40-8f89-b928d8091061"><strong>Love Polygon.</strong> The Rival blames a character for a relationship disappointment.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7be75398-6566-4cd9-acca-eac19626c1b7"><strong>Mage Tower Affront.</strong> The characters beat the Rival at Mage Tower in chapter 4, or the characters’ efforts caused the Rival to lose a bet.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f7894ea8-f471-4051-b867-6cc43571bac1"><strong>So Special.</strong> The Rival just can’t stand the characters. Now’s the time to take them down a notch.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="20ba40e6-31a7-4c7a-883e-12695f723784">The opposing students challenge the characters to meet the following midnight at the Furygale Repository on the Prismari College campus. The repository is a dumping ground for magical experiments and dangerous spell reagents. It’s empty at night and out of the way, so the duel isn’t likely to be discovered or disturbed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="357b7a44-b75b-410c-8ae9-bb61f844d172">In the characters don’t want to participate in this challenge, the Rival tries to compel the character to participate. This could include any of the following coercions:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="79476478-79fa-4b0e-b4aa-2997c4ab1ae8">
<li data-content-chunk-id="608880fb-4872-44f9-8651-0090e6c914d3">Offering the characters something they desire or important information if they win</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="f22db087-5666-4c9b-a48c-128db2e92a58">Stealing a magic item or personal heirloom from a character’s lodgings</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="2e1ef96d-0905-47ef-a56e-c92091918d3c">Revealing embarrassing information, perhaps to the whole school, an instructor, or a Beloved</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="64a9d167-b9cd-4129-aedf-5e950695b5d5">Fabricating blackmail material that implicates a character in past dangerous events</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01379574-1e3d-4eea-8db9-2d337d05dd59">If one or more characters accept the challenge, the “<a href="#FateatFurygale" title="Fate at Furygale" data-content-chunk-id="c3148559-79a3-483c-841e-6f5bca949bd3">Fate at Furygale</a>” encounter occurs at midnight of the following night. Allow characters to spend the intervening time as they please, likely with their first day of studies or other responsibilities. A character who spends time seeking information about Furygale easily learns the details in the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/life-at-strixhaven#Furygale" title="Furygale" data-content-chunk-id="fc9bd677-e2c0-42aa-b6c3-e41511d0a6a7">Furygale</a>” section of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/life-at-strixhaven" title="chapter 1" data-content-chunk-id="949f76c4-f1ea-4c0e-9316-4dc8e7aff47a">chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b85f1754-b9ed-4968-a0d4-b789a9bb92ec">The characters can arrive at the Furygale Repository whenever they please and find it empty—no one is using the storage site this early in the academic year. The students who challenged the characters arrive at midnight.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="429ffda1-cedd-44f9-b34d-5496d644ac1b">If the characters refuse even in the face of the Rival’s coercion, the Rival leaves. The next day, the characters learn that the Rival has taken more extreme actions—potentially involving one of the characters’ Friends or Beloveds—to force the characters to come to Furygale.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b22a35c5-46db-44db-87bb-7decc266fdfc">The Furygale Repository, on the Prismari campus, is a storage facility where magical experiments are disposed of. Magic woven into the structure makes the interior a zone of wild magic. Over time, these unpredictable magical forces break down the failed or ill-conceived student projects disposed of within. Because of its air of danger and relative isolation, the Furygale Repository is a popular spot for Strixhaven students who want to meet without being observed by university staff.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5f43b0ed-477d-4d7d-9a12-9a8878aef603">When the characters arrive at the Furygale Repository, they find a warehouse-like structure with walls that slowly change shape and color, as if melting and reforming. Floating warning signs around it read, “Danger: Elemental Forces.” A cavernous opening in the south wall provides access to the interior. When the characters enter, read or paraphrase the following text:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>The space within the Furygale Repository is a vast, open area filled with discarded magical creations. Elemental forces infuse the structure’s walls and numerous alcoves, the surfaces of which slowly shift, glowing with discordant lights that shimmer, clash, consume one another, and then glow anew.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="660f7f9f-de2b-4ce7-9ee0-7a18b6a351d1"><strong>Ceilings and Walls.</strong> The walls and ceilings are as hard and durable as stone. The structure’s ceiling rises 20 feet above the floor.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="737038f0-ec6b-4c84-954c-cd28110138f0"><strong>Illumination.</strong> The repository’s scintillating walls shed bright light out to a range of 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e5b85565-11f4-43de-9d85-6897dc424a33"><strong>Magic Protections.</strong> The repository is designed to break down magic without damaging creatures. See “<a href="#DuelsintheRepository" title="Duels in the Repository" data-content-chunk-id="524cb54d-69b3-4c31-a2af-dc7527b5d036">Duels in the Repository</a>” for details on the site’s protective magic. The site’s magic restores hit points to creatures within the structure, whether they’re dueling or not. After taking damage in the repository, a creature still in the building is healed to full hit points after not taking damage for 1 minute.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="398d6ee8-c974-4fdd-95c1-6a585a2ef918"><strong>Wild Magic.</strong> Once per turn, when a creature expends a spell slot to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, an additional effect might occur.

<p data-content-chunk-id="c3c2336f-8da9-430d-92d0-626716e6210d">If the heroes arrive at the Furygale Repository before the challenge, they have the opportunity to explore the site and potentially discover some of the structure’s secrets.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0aef4e80-51e1-4c16-9be7-f4c8045ae135"><em><strong>Animate Statues.</strong></em> The symbols that look like circles inscribed with stars represent statues of knights designed with flourishes evocative of the four elements. The statues have partially melted from longterm exposure to the Furygale Repository’s magic, but they have also gained magical mobility and limited sapience; use the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17159-helmed-horror" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17159-tooltip">helmed horror</a> stat block to represent them. Each statue protects the site from intruders, animating and attacking any suspicious creature that comes within 10 feet of it. A statue fights until it is destroyed or its opponents leave the Furygale Repository.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eea62cc3-5ffb-4768-afce-649c03edb2e5"><em><strong>Duelist Marks.</strong></em> Ten X marks mar the floor. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check knows that these marks serve as stations for student duelists, and the scars between them were made by violent magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d2a034ce-e01e-4a0a-872a-9c7530ba91db"><em><strong>Secret Storage Chambers.</strong></em> Two secret doors are located in the northern wall of the structure. Finding either door requires a successful DC 14 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check. The chamber behind each secret door contains various leaking jars and boxes of used alchemical reagents. A character who spends 5 minutes searching either room and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check discovers two <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/71-potion-of-healing" data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/71-tooltip">potions of healing</a> and a packet containing <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4625-dust-of-sneezing-and-choking" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4625-tooltip">dust of sneezing and choking</a> (the contents of both rooms are the same).</p>

<li data-content-chunk-id="9baa56ec-3077-4f43-9b93-173ec29fa550">Only two students duel at a time.</li>

<li data-content-chunk-id="9d721123-45d7-46da-ba57-87d219d4b545">A duel is over when one duelist surrenders or is <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/7-tooltip">incapacitated</a>.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a4f425d6-288e-49bf-b3a8-8fe3270f5957">A duelist may not kill another duelist.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ba8dd794-0e32-4b02-98ae-b16fa1e57390">Any duelist who breaks these rules loses the duel. If a duelist kills an opponent, the killer, if discovered, is expelled from the university and forced to pay for <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2224-raise-dead" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2224-tooltip">raise dead</a> to be cast on the dead duelist.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a0b5e59a-f1d5-4b1e-8fac-01c46f6f0f92">As mentioned in the “Magic Protections” portion of the “<a href="#FurygaleRepositoryFeatures" title="Furygale Repository Features" data-content-chunk-id="bba97d61-9e6b-44d0-baba-e51a94559955">Furygale Repository Features</a>” section, creatures that take damage in this area are healed by Furygale’s magic.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="02d9cb9d-4c55-4eca-974f-a4f975390630">If the characters go to the repository early, their opponents arrive at midnight. If the characters arrive on time, their opponents are already there waiting at the duelist marks in the center of the structure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="97dbf3ad-b821-4531-9693-98a65413eaf1">Once both parties meet and banter, one-on-one duels commence following the rules outlined in the “<a href="#DuelsintheRepository" title="Duels in the Repository" data-content-chunk-id="14384d26-4a66-4b12-93c9-c48cfbca2ddf">Duels in the Repository</a>” section. The Rivals use the pledgemage stat blocks appropriate for their colleges (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="913b4e76-0b7e-4a5d-b655-f9bb08e1813f">chapter 7</a>). All their actions are considered permissible magic for the purposes of dueling.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="293041de-8c59-4c86-960b-610dfe25aafa">Run as many one-on-one duels as the characters want to participate in.

<p data-content-chunk-id="fae4f53a-c521-4e70-bec4-9bc3eec2f131">At the conclusion of the duels but before the characters leave the Furygale Repository, one of their opponents collapses. A moment later, another opponent falls. In seconds, all the opponents but one have collapsed. Although there’s no way for the characters to know this yet, the collapsed opponents have been rendered <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a> by the curse from <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4239820-murgaxors-orb" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4239820-tooltip">Murgaxor’s orb</a> (detailed at the start of the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/the-magisters-masquerade#MurgaxorsOrb" title="adventure" data-content-chunk-id="0e629274-23e4-43b8-a792-cef0db1f66c6">adventure</a>). Dean Tullus spread the curse to several students during the recent reception, and Murgaxor is now testing his magic’s power.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9b48c3d6-5bce-4059-8479-d4da512f58e8">The one remaining opponent reacts as follows:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>“What… what are you doing?” your opponent stammers, panicking as their friends sprawl across the floor. “Cut it out, cheaters! You can’t do this!”</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="723505d7-0f82-4079-b475-9515882425ed">The last opponent standing blames the characters for what has happened and attacks. On their first turn, the opponent casts a spell. This proves to be a terrible mistake, as the wild magic of the Furygale Repository surges, summoning an <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16971-oni" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16971-tooltip">oni</a>. The oni appears near the entrance to the repository and does as it pleases. Without hesitating, it moves to attack the closest conscious student. After inadvertantly summoning the oni, the opponent tries to flee, leaving the characters to fight the oni by themselves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="570ba9ef-9d37-4689-858d-85e4e406a1e6">In the course of the ensuing battle, a character can try to convince the opponent that the characters weren’t responsible for rendering the other students <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a>, doing so with a successful DC 16 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check. On a success, the opponent believes, albeit grudgingly, that the characters aren’t to blame for what happened.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ae273cd3-2c32-4aa3-8708-9b02fb94daf5">During an early Advanced Arcane History course that all the characters are attending, Dean Tullus displays a relic she discovered during a recent expedition. Read or paraphrase the following text to describe part of her lecture:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>“A historian interrogates the stories we tell ourselves about the past, learning how true they are—or otherwise,” lectures Dean Tullus. “Only by understanding the truth of the past might we learn lessons applicable to our magic in the present. Take this, for example.” The professor reveals a translucent orb. Within it a coil of green mist endlessly knots around itself. “I unearthed this in the Fortress Badlands during my most recent expedition. Its creator and use remain uncertain. But by investigating the reason for its creation, we stand to learn more about those who made it and how their lessons might teach us more about our own magic.”</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a4bc51d8-6dd6-4f5c-9d9a-fe98e2506034">Dean Tullus eagerly takes questions on her lecture or the relic she exhibits, but she doesn’t know much about it yet. She suspects it was used as a magical focus by an ancient wizard she has yet to identify. A character who subtly casts <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2065-detect-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2065-tooltip">detect magic</a> in class learns the object exudes an aura of enchantment.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fbbf7a29-6deb-43f8-8a67-0ddfafb2376b">The class ends with a reminder that the first Exam is only a few days away and that it will test students on their knowledge of historical relics and the relics’ use in magic.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f5f29c4d-6aa6-4d68-b53d-d33d4925391e">The day before the Exam, the characters can study the course material. A character can use any ability check and skill during the Studying phase.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bfeaae5c-dbee-4c36-a7de-b12550c306a9">Once you’ve asked each player how their character is approaching the Studying phase, resolve that phase by having each character who studies make a DC 17 ability check.

<p data-content-chunk-id="20eafc2f-b9be-430c-a8b7-ffdad455e9e5">Although the Magister’s Masquerade takes place late in the Strixhaven academic year, it occupies a significant place in the mind of many third-year students. To help students decide what to wear, the administration announces a theme for the masquerade and hosts a fashion show early in the year.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="586c1ea6-cb56-4f02-89a3-a68a1554dcdb">The theme announcement and fashion show take place in the weeks following the Advanced Arcane History Exam.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="bdd52a1b-3ae4-4c58-84a1-5e2df012e2ac">This year, the Strixhaven faculty has chosen to honor the school’s storied history in the theme for the Magister’s Masquerade.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da9563e9-37e1-43eb-bf5a-9a471efc8ca9">During one of her Advanced Arcane History classes, Dean Tullus explains that the theme for the masquerade is “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/a-starlit-night/" title="A Starlit Evening" data-content-chunk-id="8b795f14-2572-4c98-b5c2-1d2a18239912">A Starlit Evening</a>.” Just as the light from stars is visible for thousands of years, so too does the professor want to see the students’ attire shine with the same wondrous history. She then offers extra credit in her course to students who show her costume designs evocative of some aspect of Strixhaven’s history ahead of the ball.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HistoricalResearch" data-content-chunk-id="8263c7c1-f4f4-40ff-a0bc-42fb7811d4d1"><a href="#HistoricalResearch" data-content-chunk-id="6472183f-cb75-4d24-b9b1-e010543ac6a0"></a>Historical Research</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b27e63b2-1c4b-4d61-b241-80c6f3e2e0c9">To meet Dean Tullus’s demand for historical authenticity, a character must research Strixhaven fashion through the centuries. This requires spending 6 hours studying at the Biblioplex and succeeding on a DC 14 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/7-tooltip">History</a>) check. Characters who exceed DC 18 on this check also learn the information in the “Records Gap” section.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3b77856a-795e-4925-b2b0-eac7a686d174">After successfully conducting their research, a character can show their notes to Dean Tullus and receive extra credit on their second Advanced Arcane History Exam, as noted in the “<a href="#CostumeDesigns" title="Exam Results" data-content-chunk-id="00ea6df8-b42d-4f25-b2f6-269b4d9f2caf">Exam Results</a>” section for that Exam.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3e72b428-7444-4c21-8d98-3e9588940506">A character who excels at their fashion research notices a gap in the Biblioplex’s records approximately 200 years ago. All information about that year’s masquerade is missing. If a character pursues the missing information, cross-checking other university records reveals an unusually high number of student deaths that same year. While Strixhaven experiences the occasional rare fatality among the student body, that year dozens of students perished. No available record notes how the students died. Characters who, in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/dangerous-knowledge#QuenthornesHistory" title="chapter 4" data-content-chunk-id="40bb181a-2851-4333-b893-5cb4566e7f87">chapter 4</a>, learned about the student expelled for practicing forbidden magic realize that these deaths occurred in the same year that student was expelled. Beyond this, no other information on the topic is currently available.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dba97991-0748-42e1-99f5-31bbdecc50d6">If the characters mention the records gap to one or more faculty members, it sparks very little interest, since the missing records are so old. These faculty members have neither the time nor the recollection to shed light on the mystery.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e4915635-d2a5-4ed1-a6a0-0a3f9f57adcb">As part of the preparations for the Magister’s Masquerade, many Strixhaven students participate in a fashion show on the Silverquill College campus at the Rose Stage (detailed in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/all-the-worlds-a-stage#TheRoseStage" title="chapter 3" data-content-chunk-id="0b77b44a-ca2d-4b3f-9108-5c25e18d26a1">chapter 3</a>). During this event, student and alumni designers present fashions meant to inspire masquerade attendees and help them prepare for the ball. After the show, some of the outfits are auctioned off to help fund the masquerade. Characters might learn about the event by hearing about it from other students or spotting flyers posted around campus.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7af02894-8ea0-4e90-8989-44e62cf39ffd">Events related to the fashion show play out over the course of several weeks. Characters might decide to design their own fashions, model designs at the show, or sell their works at the auction. Other students might get involved in the fashion show as well, coaxing characters into the event.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="15dd5e57-9eb4-4a96-8496-d898dcea1e83">Let the players know the ways in which their characters can participate in the fashion show, and allow them to do so as much as they’re interested, building toward the event at a date you set. These activities can happen in the background as characters focus on other goals or as the events in the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/dressing-for-success#PartyPreparations" title="Party Preparations" data-content-chunk-id="e9bb77da-619d-4046-846a-de6d4221f008">Party Preparations</a>” section take place.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cd9d30ac-ba58-47ae-a0a2-6ad71e7b1ad2"><em><strong>Creating an Outfit.</strong></em> To create an outfit, a character must describe the look they’re after, spend 24 hours crafting the outfit, then make a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using leatherworker’s tools, weaver’s tools, or similarly appropriate artisan’s tools. If the check fails, no wearable outfit is produced. If the character is successful, the character creates an outfit that is accepted into the show. Note the total of this check, which will help determine the outfit’s value at the fashion auction later.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="52602217-467c-41c2-bad5-b443fef5d905">If a character is Friends with Zanther Bowen or Aurora Luna Wynterstarr (see the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships#FellowStudents" title="Fellow Students" data-content-chunk-id="b73b91c8-552c-4d89-9182-48ba9fcf2f5c">Fellow Students</a>” section in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships/" title="chapter 3" data-content-chunk-id="cbb99743-af6a-484b-b387-e75f045bff44">chapter 3</a>), these students eagerly help the character with the outfit, providing advantage on the Dexterity check.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cd46f498-9717-4a5d-9c47-4d1f07b96798">Besides the characters, numerous students and Strixhaven alumni participate in the fashion show, and all the outfits on the Fashion at Auction table are modeled.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6897806f-2ba8-4d3d-98de-bb306a4294b2">Following the fashion show, designers can auction their work to help fund the Magister’s Masquerade. The auction takes place at the Rose Stage immediately following the fashion show. Dozens of students attend the show and the auction, including all the students in the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships#FellowStudents" title="Fellow Students" data-content-chunk-id="75782d72-ac70-4a65-a1c7-f793444d470c">Fellow Students</a>” section in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/relationships/" title="chapter 3" data-content-chunk-id="d0746887-f7da-4239-801c-02be3f19d344">chapter 3</a>. Three of these students—Urzmaktok Grojsh, Rubina Larkingdale, and Melwythorne—submitted designs and auction them off.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4ed14224-320d-40db-9bfa-d6a3a75081b7"><em><strong>Determining a Design’s Value.</strong></em> To determine how much a character’s outfit sells for at auction, add the number the designer recorded when creating the outfit and the number the model recorded when modeling the outfit (if any). Look up this total in the Check Total column of the Fashion Auction table to determine the outfit’s value, along with some comparable outfits also being sold at the auction.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="beddc942-8ba2-40fc-a7d8-44b80e31f4e6"><em><strong>Buying Fashions.</strong></em> A character can bid on a design being auctioned off, ultimately winning it for the price listed in the Value column of the Fashion at Auction table. If you want to play out the bidding, the opening bid for each design is half of its value. Other students might bid against characters, driving up the outfit’s value to its listed price. If you want to make bidding particularly intense, a rival bidder might drive up an outfit’s price to 50 percent more than its listed value before relenting.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="34829d35-c7ad-49b1-9f72-8afcadaf97a7">The Magister’s Masquerade is such a Strixhaven institution that an entire section of the Biblioplex’s archives is devoted to it. Along with records about the event, these archives serve as storage for masquerade supplies needed annually. The characters are among those students the masquerade organizing committee tasks with retrieving the hundreds of storage boxes conveying them to Kollema Hall. Ten other students (apprentices from all five colleges; see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes/" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="138e2d73-3f4a-41f3-82d0-323fec1f7715">chapter 7</a> for their stat blocks) are sent along with the characters.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e1991f57-2f0a-4706-a690-3651b0b0edeb">Finding all the supplies related to the Magister’s Masquerade, moving them out of the archives, and then transporting them to Kollema Hall should take the characters and their group 6 hours to complete. That assumes everyone in the group helps the entire time and someone arranges for transportation of the supplies. If one or more characters refuse to help or slip away for part of the time, add 1 hour to the task’s duration. If the characters don’t arrange transportation in advance, the task stalls until they make arrangements.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="55c422ff-3e84-4451-8b1b-29c286d27873"><em><strong>Masquerade Research.</strong></em> The records in the Biblioplex archives weren’t available to the characters when they were doing their historical research earlier in the academic year (see “<a href="#RecordsGap" title="Records Gap" data-content-chunk-id="8fe6162c-c516-45cb-8035-ae3b3ad70146">Records Gap</a>” earlier in the chapter). A character who ignores their manual labor duties for an hour and investigates the archive records can make a DC 14 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/7-tooltip">History</a>) check. If they succeed, they discover a firsthand report from 200 years ago involving a mysterious illness striking campus. Dozens of students fell victim to it, experiencing fatigue and headaches; many of them died, wasting away in a matter of days despite all efforts to cure them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f6a80959-78d6-4315-b18a-207141132c89">The characters’ second Exam in Advanced Arcane History takes place a short while after they complete the errands in preparation for the masquerade. It tests students’ knowledge of famous magical relics and the history behind their creation and use. However, this test is unusual because the characters’ professor, Dean Tullus, doesn’t show up to administer it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e45f9a3d-bb63-476f-8acb-3b155791eae0">The day before the Exam, the characters can study the course material. A character can use any ability check and skill during the Studying phase.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bdf5d072-3549-41bc-8123-2851d5226e3c">Once you’ve asked each player how their character is approaching the Studying phase, resolve that phase by having each character who studies make a DC 18 ability check. Make sure players keep track of their characters’ rerolls and apply them during the Testing phase.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TestingPhase1" data-content-chunk-id="dc09c3c4-68cf-4d04-a197-d1d97324e49d"><a href="#TestingPhase1" data-content-chunk-id="9ec61ca0-8460-4514-b513-debe71e75109"></a>Testing Phase</h3>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b0e9fdc2-3e68-4c44-ae8f-af27eceae8e2"><strong>History of Magical Devices.</strong> Writing short essays about the origins of different magical devices requires a successful DC 18 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3353f1af-6e55-4851-af90-44f5698ec8b4">Have each player note their character’s Exam results—how many Student Dice they gained and what skills they used during the test—on their copies of the tracking sheet.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d68f5616-ca74-4d5d-b69f-01f226074a8f">Due to Dean Tullus’s absence and the lax attention of the teaching assistant administering the test, cheating on this Exam is a relatively easy matter; the DCs of the two checks is only 12.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1d08df2e-04ff-4b6e-93a8-10316327c669">After the Exam, a character who seeks to learn what happened to Dean Tullus can make a DC 14 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check. If the check succeeds, the character learns that Dean Tullus just didn’t show up for class, offering no explanation to her teaching assistants. Apparently, the normally fastidious dean was in her office at Archaeo Memorial Hall the whole time.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Suspicions" data-content-chunk-id="379ff480-ce23-4363-8eee-d8b93896f990"><a href="#Suspicions" data-content-chunk-id="71164bbb-6198-4f9f-981f-90926900f683"></a>Suspicions</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d83cd5b9-1369-4108-bf60-360901e7aae8">After Dean Tullus’s unexpected absence, characters might suspect that there’s something off about the dean. A character who spends a day investigating Dean Tullus further and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check learns one of the rumors on the Dean Tullus Rumors table.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b8fe1a30-284b-435d-9631-a951e768a8fd">Even if the characters choose not to investigate the dean, have some of these rumors come to the characters’ attention to increase their suspicion. Characters who bring their misgivings to other faculty members are dismissed, as most professors are inured to students grousing about their teachers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="97dc31d1-c2dd-431d-979f-1adc9312ee3d">Should the characters try to investigate Dean Tullus’s office, there’s rarely a time she or other faculty aren’t working in the Deans’ Wing of Archaeo Memorial Hall. However, everyone knows the dean will be attending the Magister’s Masquerade. It might serve as a perfect chance to slip into her office while she’s otherwise occupied.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e9179d4e-e4b8-4459-917a-54b69e4653ac">Ultimately, fuel the characters’ suspicions, but they shouldn’t have a chance to act until the night of the Magister’s Masquerade.</p>

<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>The hum of conversation, awkward laughter, and the sound of shuffling feet meet you as you approach the Rose Stage on Silverquill’s campus. Upon the polished stage mill dozens of students, waiting nervously or trying out their best approximations of dance moves.</p>

As soon as the characters arrive, a familiar student approaches one of them and points out a large, graceful, blue-skinned individual amid the crowd. “I think that’s Nivall!” the student says, urging the characters to follow. “They’re the greatest dancer ever to graduate from Strixhaven. Come on—I bet they’ll teach us amazing moves!”</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="91ca2615-286a-4c95-8b25-5c1ce1fd0d70">After the dance lessons, characters have time to focus on classes or other activities, but the date of the Magister’s Masquerade is getting close. A week before the ball, each character receives a request from the masquerade organizing committee. They’re asked to collaborate with other students to help prepare Kollema Hall for the masquerade. Unknown to the characters, though, Murgaxor uses this gathering to test his curse on a larger, more dangerous scale.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e576cdaf-7aa4-4538-9082-2a24f2454478">The following sections detail the parts of Kollema Hall where students set up for the Magister’s Masquerade, along with several incidents that plague their work.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="KollemaHallFeatures" data-content-chunk-id="23279c96-db47-453e-90ec-ad1461a06b12"><a href="#KollemaHallFeatures" data-content-chunk-id="19e1de5e-2a18-40a4-9536-af0e917ffd2f"></a>Kollema Hall Features</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="09cf8050-5237-4764-aa73-630b310ea080">Kollema Hall is a historic structure dedicated to the respected Strixhaven professor, Magister Kollema—an innovator in the magical study of history. After his death, the university renamed this hall in his honor and built an enormous statue of him at its center. Details about the hall are summarized here:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e798edd6-34a4-46a2-b330-f5aa7212b8d0"><strong>Ceilings.</strong> The center of the hall rises 200 feet above the floor to a domed ceiling. The ceiling above each balcony is 20 feet high.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4ab71be4-710f-450d-8aa1-b0213817f0fc"><strong>Doors.</strong> At night, all exterior doors to the hall are locked and sealed with <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2003-arcane-lock" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2003-tooltip">arcane lock</a> spells. Only Lorehold College faculty members, including Dean Tullus, know the password to bypass these spells. Opening a lock requires thieves’ tools and a successful DC 25 Dexterity check (DC 35 while the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2003-arcane-lock" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2003-tooltip">arcane lock</a> spell is active).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3540a61c-1bbe-4c2f-b5ce-e34645b10517"><strong>Illumination.</strong> Light from the domed skylight and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2048-continual-flame" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2048-tooltip">continual flame</a> spells cast on hanging lanterns provide bright illumination throughout the hall.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1e12e0be-09ef-4e02-a108-b286025a605d"><strong>Magic Steps.</strong> All steps, including the hall’s grand staircase, shift up or down like escalators, or flatten out completely before raising or lowering like lifts to accommodate larger creatures and mobility devices, depending on users’ needs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f5113b2e-a11e-42a4-bcd1-1b9fb8765935"><strong>Transport Glyphs.</strong> Runic glyphs (marked as starbursts on map 5.2) are etched on the floor near the hall’s main staircase. Any creature that stands on a glyph and says “up” or “down” is teleported to the transport glyph one floor higher or lower in the hall (depending on the direction spoken), along with anything the creature is wearing or carrying. If the destination glyph is occupied or the command doesn’t make sense (such as saying “down” while on the hall’s lowest floor), the transport glyph doesn’t function.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="KollemaHallLocations" data-content-chunk-id="0275628d-5f4d-413e-af89-5b6087777bf4"><a href="#KollemaHallLocations" data-content-chunk-id="c67b82b0-657c-4886-8a6b-04d12563f649"></a>Kollema Hall Locations</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="51b5c2b1-9edb-4f23-bd6c-28150695937d">The following locations are keyed to map 5.2. This map depicts only the building’s first floor, part of its symmetrical second floor, and the infirmary on its third floor. The full building consists of ten floors, but these locations are the most relevant to the characters’ activities.</p>

However, this magic has somehow activated early, causing a student the characters know to levitate unexpectedly, stranding them 50 feet in the air, out of reach of any solid objects. The student can’t move from their position while out of reach, but if they come in contact with an anchored object, they can move along it as if climbing. The student levitates for 5 minutes before the magic ends and they fall.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7f7ea9bc-2327-46cd-b83d-6a882a0d456a">Someone shouts a warning as a box of heavy decorations drops from a balcony several floors up. A random character must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="05520e68-cb81-489f-8fa5-777fec2d8929">If no character is in a place where something could fall on them, choose a character and let them notice the box about to fall on a student on the first floor. The character has an instant to try to mitigate the danger—perhaps by casting a spell or using a class feature. If they can’t, the box hits the student and deals damage as described above.</p>

When this happens, increase the number of sick students in the “Waking Nightmares” section by one.

<p data-content-chunk-id="1c94ad80-05e1-4ad8-890e-4f4d14fb6205">As the work of preparing Kollema Hall winds down, six students complain about headaches and go to the infirmary.

These students should be a mix of students the characters know and don’t know.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dfa94aa5-9cb0-4096-a587-9be18ed5759a">If a character goes to the infirmary with the sick students, Professor DeSantos is concerned by the sudden influx of patients but can’t find anything wrong with them. She insists they rest in the sickroom until they feel better.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7650bad2-d4c5-4f83-b38a-87e0ae428269">Ten minutes later, these six students—along with any others who came to the infirmary during the “Sick Leave” event—are back on their feet, though something is clearly wrong. The afflicted students are all suffering from the Visions of Terror effect of <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4239820-murgaxors-orb" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4239820-tooltip">Murgaxor’s orb</a>.

<p data-content-chunk-id="c80085fc-d191-48cc-8c59-d590fff12a55">Any characters in the infirmary are among the first people the delirious students turn against.

Soon after, the panicking students rush onto the second floor and seek to escape, attacking anyone who comes close, while yelling things like “Stay back, monster!” and “Help, they’re trying to kill me!” The resulting scene descends into chaos as the other students either try to help or scatter in terror.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d046fbff-817c-49ac-ab8e-5d4a569a5d7e">A character can use an action to try to calm a delirious student, doing so with a successful DC 14 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check. A character who is a Friend or Beloved of the delirious student has advantage on the check. If the check fails, the student continues to panic. If the check succeeds, the student becomes docile and returns to normal after 10 minutes; the same thing happens if the student is <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/7-tooltip">incapacitated</a>. Sick students who escape from Kollema Hall rampage across campus for 10 minutes before being taken into custody by university staff.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4a93bde9-c213-41c5-90cb-9442188bd185">After this incident, most of the afflicted students are too scared to attend the Magister’s Masquerade.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3ddc24ab-4f0e-4ce4-be86-d086b048b20c">A character who investigates what led to the students’ mysterious behavior can make a DC 14 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check. A successful check reveals that the sick students all recently visited <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/work-hard-play-harder#BowsEndTavern1" title="Bow’s End Tavern" data-content-chunk-id="5df0ce04-d47d-4c42-9298-1038ef594d9d">Bow’s End Tavern</a>—they met for breakfast before the day’s work started.

<p data-content-chunk-id="74f95844-d1a0-44dc-9547-9ef2b9b70561">A character who visits Bow’s End Tavern can ask around about the students. None of the staff remembers anything remarkable, but one of the tavern’s chefs, Curtie Axechucker, was working when the students originally came in. She’s also there when the characters come to investigate.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9b6450b4-e0c5-4f12-9a6e-352cc01b5c9b">Regardless of the characters’ line of questioning, the anxious Chef Curtie (chaotic neutral dwarf <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoner</a>) jumps to the conclusion that her food might have sickened the students. A character must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/17-tooltip">Intimidation</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check to get useful information out of Curtie, as she works herself into a flustered state. For each successful check, Curtie offers one of the following pieces of information:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="3e87c734-dfe2-4fd4-815e-3c8757ed8b8c">
<li data-content-chunk-id="8d62df65-4fa1-48a7-a080-367692c43714">She was the only chef on duty when the students in question came in.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="f41fc981-8bdb-4714-a846-923656053eb2">The morning meal was nothing remarkable, with waffles drizzled in Sedgemoor mushroom syrup being popular.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="e46f4974-ba46-4efd-86e1-ee6087b9a5d2">Student pranksters have tried to slip psychoactive ingredients into meals in years past.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="62aca67d-78bc-4cb5-90de-50f47d161174">Dean Tullus was at the tavern and spoke with the students. The dean seemed uncharacteristically friendly, chatting and shaking hands as they parted.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3012ea72-31a3-45b3-b4fb-b5a531fed233">Curtie couldn’t hear what the dean said to the students and doesn’t remember anything useful beyond this. She begs the characters not to spread rumors about the tavern until it’s clear what happened.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cd90ca28-9a98-4162-a7b7-67b0220363d6">If the characters wish to ask Dean Tullus about why she was at Bow’s End Tavern, meeting with her immediately proves impossible, as the professor is busy with her classes and personal research. However, a teaching assistant can make an appointment for the characters to talk to the dean during her office hours three days after the chaos at Kollema Hall. This meeting takes place in Tullus’s office in the Deans’ Wing of Archaeo Memorial Hall.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="971f64f6-f0de-494c-9be3-d2052366d6f1">Should the characters meet with Dean Tullus, they find her polite but cold. She admits she was at the tavern, but only to ensure preparations for the Magister’s Masquerade were on track. She remembers seeing some of her students at the tavern but doesn’t remember what they spoke about. She claims to be cordial with all her students. Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check suspect Tullus isn’t being entirely truthful, but aren’t sure what about. Those who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check also notice the green orb the dean showcased during class occupying a prominent space behind her desk.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2413350d-8d10-4d1a-a01f-307d3d824840">If the characters persist in their questioning, Dean Tullus brushes off any implication of impropriety and mentions that the Strixhaven administration is making its own investigation into the events at Kollema Hall—one that will scrutinize everyone who was there. She ends the meeting by telling the characters to focus on studying for their upcoming exams.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="43fae92c-87ac-4e63-884d-73df48d6df93">The Magister’s Masquerade starts at dusk. Once characters have completed their preparations (or time has run out), they should head to Kollema Hall. As they arrive at Kollema Hall and step inside, read or paraphrase the following text:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>Kollema Hall has been transformed. Music, color, and laughter fill the airy space as masked and impeccably dressed students and faculty mingle. Beyond a check-in stand attended by student hosts, tables are arranged with whimsical ice sculptures and ornate refreshments. A band plays energetic music near the demonstration stage, which has been turned into a dance floor. Above it all, banners depicting Strixhaven heroes hang amid drifting lanterns glowing with soft light.</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1eea90ad-8d35-403d-83e3-5f8a8eea63bd">Students don’t need to present their invitations to gain admittance to the masquerade, but they are expected to check in. All third-year students and their guests are admitted to the ball, so long as they’re wearing appropriate attire. If a student arrives without adequate attire, a helpful student working the desk takes them to a room upstairs with a wardrobe full of musty costumes from past Prismari theatrical events. The character can use these costumes to assemble an outfit, albeit an atrocious one.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="088a3fd1-aeeb-4219-b5d5-128cf9b9a9f8"><strong>Crowded.</strong> During the masquerade, the first and second floors of the hall are crowded with people. These floors are <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain" data-tooltip-href="/rules/86-tooltip">difficult terrain</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0401da3c-6950-4dec-89f2-9debcb43a40a"><strong>Distracting.</strong> The hall is filled with music and activity.

Between the events, allow opportunities for characters to socialize. Moments to mingle or dance can serve as the culmination of some Relationships or as turning points for others. Linger on opportunities to socialize as long as you and the players please, and adjust Relationship Points as necessary.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b9ca56fe-9283-4ade-a46a-48bde68a318f">When the characters arrive, they have time to socialize, take in other students’ costumes, and meet up with acquaintances they recognize. While characters easily recognize each other, nearly everyone at the masquerade is wearing a magical disguise. Correctly guessing another student’s identity requires a successful DC 13 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check, regardless of whether the student wears a mundane or magical costume. A character has advantage on checks made to recognize any students they have a Relationship with.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d6b204c7-fe23-416f-a993-4a42242d8075">Some characters might look for Dean Tullus during the masquerade, but they don’t immediately see her. Anyone they ask about her believes the dean is present, but no one can readily point her out.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c2a1e3f8-1a63-49d3-ba0d-aaf046b3d49f">During this initial period (and later in the event), mages using the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2288-unseen-servant" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2288-tooltip">unseen servant</a> spell circulate trays of food and drink throughout the hall.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e8820173-23ea-4a2a-af30-033750a7d7c4">Once all the characters have arrived and had a chance to mingle, Dean Tullus welcomes the attendees to the annual Magister’s Masquerade. Read the following text to begin this event:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>The music falls silent and a spotlight shines upon a second-floor balcony as Dean Tullus approaches the railing. The dean is unmasked and resplendent in a gown made of golden scrolls. Magic amplifies her voice, carrying it throughout the hall.</p>
<p>“Students, faculty, honored guests of Strixhaven: welcome to the Magister’s Masquerade! I know many of you have been looking forward to this night as much as I have, and I promise it will be a night to remember!”</p>
<p>She gestures toward the massive statue in the hall’s center. “Centuries ago, wise Kollema established this masquerade as a Strixhaven tradition to bring students of all our colleges together, to show the potential of our university’s mission, and to create a night of magic. Tonight, we are honored by the presence of his spirit and wisdom once again, for history lives here at Strixhaven, and nothing is ever truly forgotten.</p>
<p>“Now, you’ve all been promised a starlit night, so one and all, come dance among the stars!”</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f6c1f641-a47e-4c96-b34d-470641a70291">With Dean Tullus’s final words, the tube-like devices placed during the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/dressing-for-success#PreparingtheHall" title="Preparing the Hall" data-content-chunk-id="f17cf0a8-1967-4f22-940c-ee55d1eb0cfe">Preparing the Hall</a>” event fire, scattering multicolored lights to the heights of the hall. These insubstantial magical motes hang in the air, shedding a gentle starry light.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="78b8d4a8-ef2d-4ef4-b2f0-c4bd0011775c"><em><strong>Misfire.</strong></em> If a character failed to notice the faulty device in the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/dressing-for-success#Firebreak" title="Firebreak" data-content-chunk-id="39e8837b-df16-43c1-9aa7-88177b3adc2b">Firebreak</a>” event earlier in the chapter, or noticed it but did nothing about it, the device explodes when activated. The explosion happens in the quadrant of Kollema Hall’s first floor with the largest number of characters. Everyone in that quarter of the hall must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have starry embers burn small holes into their attire. Creatures are otherwise unharmed. Guests are startled, and many are upset about what’s happened to their outfits, but within 10 minutes most attendees calm down.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f40ca44d-590a-4158-b71c-7bbc605c99ea"><em><strong>Dance among the Stars.</strong></em> As the dean finishes her speech, the magic placed on the Kollema Hall demonstration stage activates. Anyone who enters a space on or above the stage gains a fly speed equal to their walking speed. This allows the guests to literally dance on air. Anyone who leaves the space above the dance floor in midair drifts gently to an unoccupied space in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/dressing-for-success#K1SerenityQuadrants" title="area K1" data-content-chunk-id="5269cf55-d69b-4a12-b276-39d00fa559aa">area K1</a>. This magic lasts until the end of the masquerade.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c3ababdc-92aa-4ee2-834f-4fa01cf6e911">Use the Magister’s Masquerade as an opportunity to heighten the characters’ suspicions about Dean Tullus. After her welcome announcement, Dean Tullus grows distant. In the course of the evening, a character keeping an eye on the dean can make a DC 12 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check. On a success, the character notices the dean engaged in one of the following strange behaviors:</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ced67fca-748e-4ac7-bc3e-f045764c181b">Part of the tradition of the Magister’s Masquerade involves a speech made by the spirit of Magister Kollema. The statue of Kollema animates, offering wisdom to the gathered students of Strixhaven, in the final hour of the masquerade:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>At the anticipated time, the music fades, dancers drift to the floor, and the hall falls silent as lights rise to illuminate the towering statue of Magister Kollema. After a moment’s stillness, the statue speaks.</p>
<p>“Students of Strixhaven,” Wise Kollema says in a voice that booms through the hall, yet echoes as if coming from afar. “Always remember the chain of which you are a part. Wisdom is shared, learned, added to, and passed on. Links are added and lost, but the chain of tradition connects us all—those of us who were, who are, and who are yet to come. You are bonded, students of Strixhaven, to one another and to those you’ll never know. Never doubt the wondrousness of what you’ve learned or the remarkable place you hold as the link between the past and the future. This night, we are one community, knowing no boundaries of role, college, or time.”</p>
<p>The hall bursts into applause.</p>
<p>“But be warned!” the statue of Kollema unexpectedly continues. “There is a harsh lesson you have yet to learn. When the mistakes of the past are forgotten, that dire past will return to haunt the present. Beware, mages, of the shadow that reaches for you even now.”</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e88e006-6825-4af4-95c0-6a7d5de5e751">The hall falls into silence as the voice of Kollema fades, followed by muttering and the jarringly jaunty notes of the band playing anew. Questions about Kollema’s pronouncement run through the crowd. Some faculty members report that the magister’s spirit often offers cryptic advice at the event, but they’ve never heard of anything as ominous as this.</p>
<h2 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheMasqueradesConclusion" data-content-chunk-id="c74a9b20-4c3a-4f15-9414-b7dac8209f3e"><a href="#TheMasqueradesConclusion" data-content-chunk-id="16b63049-32bc-41fd-b970-caae95c0159e"></a>The Masquerade’s Conclusion</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53c7ae11-0207-48de-865a-88afc6a58b82">After Kollema’s pronouncement, students begin slipping away. Within the next couple of hours, half the guests funnel out, heading back to their lodgings or to clandestine after-parties. Dean Tullus soon leaves as well. A character who’s been watching the dean and who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check notices her slip out, headed in the direction of Archaeo Memorial Hall.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db896a66-af55-40f5-b6ae-230501c2405c">Whether the characters follow the dean or go about their business after the masquerade, they soon stumble across an unsettling sight. Read or paraphrase the following text:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>Even considering the late hour, the walk across campus is unusually quiet. But as you round a corner, a flickering magical lantern illuminates several bewildered students standing in the path.</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0144d6c6-a48c-4edd-b5ac-4cd583093eda">These three students are <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160308-lorehold-apprentice" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160308-tooltip">Lorehold apprentices</a> (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes#LoreholdApprentice" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="13112405-eed7-4c5c-8b1d-6b132167d21c">chapter 7</a>) who were ambushed by Dean Tullus. The dean used <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4239820-murgaxors-orb" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4239820-tooltip">Murgaxor’s orb</a> to curse them with Visions of Terror (as detailed at the start of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/the-magisters-masquerade#MurgaxorsOrb" title="the adventure" data-content-chunk-id="1657a3bb-8cae-45c4-92ab-f2ccbaad1773">the adventure</a>). Dean Tullus hopes to scare off the characters by placing the students in the characters’ path.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6086af96-842c-45d0-ac08-3fb30c372fff">The students begin panicking as the characters approach them. The scene should be familiar to anyone who faced the sick students at Kollema Hall. The students attack whichever non-cursed creature is closest to them, and they can’t be calmed. During the battle, the delirious students scream things like “No! You can’t take me!” but also more useful information like “This isn’t the way to Archaeo Hall! What are you doing?!” A student who is either <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/7-tooltip">incapacitated</a> or knocked <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a> comes to their senses when the condition ends on them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f5f026b5-7f50-4c76-8257-7d3328a610b4"><em><strong>Golden Scroll.</strong></em> After the battle, one of the students drops something: a piece of a golden scroll. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check recognizes this as a ripped piece of Dean Tullus’s masquerade dress.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6f1fa0a5-b492-4a21-a464-f59444f1031d"><em><strong>Further Investigation.</strong></em> Characters who go to Archaeo Memorial Hall find another scrap of dress outside the building. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check also allows a character to notice a light flickering within the hall and a silhouette moving within.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2cd9026a-4278-4792-b0ad-d59a68893165">Characters who wait for the panicked students to recover can question them. All three students say Dean Tullus requested they assist her with an errand at Archaeo Memorial Hall, but along the way a strange headache left them dazed. One of them reached out to the dean for help, snagging her dress, but she left them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="99739f52-8a54-44d2-9a17-d970ef97afcf">If the characters investigate any of these clues, proceed with the “Midnight at Lorehold” section.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b883042a-40f3-4c99-99c3-21ba16dec78d">Following their suspicions about Dean Tullus, the characters visit Archaeo Memorial Hall, the primary administrative building on Lorehold’s campus. They know Tullus’s office is in the Deans’ Wing and find strangeness afoot there.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="89f1ca80-8a51-46dd-b7f4-486187ed1ba5">The following are general features of the Lorehold Deans’ Wing:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="55a7f05c-3d6c-4958-bf2e-fa1f2fc452dd"><strong>Structure.</strong> The exterior walls of the Deans’ Wing are heavy stone construction, while the interior walls are wood and plaster, with heavy wooden doors, except as specified otherwise.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37e40815-a1a9-46dc-8fb1-50301a34a131"><strong>Ceilings.</strong> Most of the Deans’ Wing has 12-foot ceilings, while the records rooms (<a href="#L4RecordsRoom" title="area L4" data-content-chunk-id="2d607301-5e3b-4e7d-93ea-201c738036f9">area L4</a>) have 20-foot-high ceilings.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="950c4a6a-8d39-4698-9054-9e71c36d0f77"><strong>Illumination.</strong> Unless otherwise noted, when visited at night, areas of the Deans’ Wing are unlit.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa5e1419-4bde-4010-8aac-0d5be389e8ad"><strong>Guardian.</strong> An <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16934-invisible-stalker" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16934-tooltip">invisible stalker</a> roams the halls of the Deans’ Wing after hours, serving as a guard. Until the invisible stalker is defeated, whenever the characters enter a room, roll a d20. On a roll of 18–20, the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16934-invisible-stalker" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16934-tooltip">invisible stalker</a> is in that room. Otherwise, any significant noise the characters make attracts the invisible stalker. The creature attacks anyone they find who isn’t a member of the Lorehold faculty.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="94eea4a3-70ee-4345-aa00-288cd5867172">The double door leading into the Deans’ Wing from outside is locked, but it can be opened with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>A double door opens onto a stately, carpeted hall hung with unlit lamps and fine portraits. There are doors to either side of the entrance, a double door in each wall halfway along the hall, and a single door at the far end.</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="98d6f853-0446-42e2-a5bc-cc0e61b511cd">The portraits here depict past deans of Lorehold and are invested with a measure of their spirits. Any visible creature not part of the Lorehold faculty that enters this hall after hours and proceeds more than 10 feet down the hall causes the portraits to watch the interloper and whisper.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="50308198-b5a7-43ab-abcc-16d6f998c73b">If a character proceeds more than 20 feet down the hall without addressing the portraits, the paintings target them with disconcerting magic. Each creature in the hall that can hear the whispers must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows out of the Lorehold Deans’ Wing. If the creature succeeds, it takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to flee the area.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d548b59f-b3e4-4ebb-a939-c0afb8b6dd20">If a character addresses any of the portraits, one or more of them reply and insist to know the characters’ business in the Deans’ Wing. The portraits all have the personalities of the deans they depict and are generally stodgy and pedantic. However, characters who succeed on a DC 16 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check can convince the portraits that the party belongs there. The portraits won’t use their magic on the characters if so convinced.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c67f10bd-6422-4c66-a45d-c144178db48f">Lorehold administrative personnel use these offices to handle the various day-to-day tasks of keeping the campus running. Each office contains at least one desk and chair, along with stacks of dull paperwork and some personal tchotchkes, like a paperweight bearing the Lorehold emblem or an overdue romance novel from the Biblioplex.</p>

<p>A three-foot-high stone railing surrounds this broad, paved porch, separating the space from the Lorehold campus beyond.</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7a722bab-57cd-4002-b4d9-0cc37d9e997a">These porches are used as sitting and meal areas on the rare occasion that social events are held at the Deans’ Wing. The characters can easily hop over the railings here and access the building through one of the side doors. These doors open easily from the inside, but from the outside they’re locked and require a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves tools to open.</p>

They house the spirits of departed Lorehold faculty, and they politely ask anyone who hops the railing to use the main doors during working hours. If they’re ignored, the statues shout an alarm, calling the characters “trespassers” as they move to attack. This alerts the two <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160300-cogwork-archivist" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160300-tooltip">cogwork archivists</a> in the nearby Records Room (area L4), which remain in that area, and causes the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16934-invisible-stalker" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16934-tooltip">invisible stalker</a> that guards the wing to arrive in 1d4 rounds.</p>

If they notice the characters, the archivists demand to know why they are in the Deans’ Wing after hours. If they aren’t convinced by the response, they try to grapple the intruders and eject them from the building.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="26fecad2-3445-4d9d-b1d0-f193ab76a198">The doors to these rooms are locked, and each requires a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to open.

Altering someone’s test results or final grades is a simple matter once their records are discovered. Even the sloppiest alterations aren’t questioned. This doesn’t, however, affect any benefits gained from Exams.</p>

The gruff orc professor specializes in military history and is known for his perfect recall of countless battles and historic events.

All creatures within 10 feet of the orb must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the orb. Read or paraphrase the following text:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>A hazy image of a figure appears, hovering above the green, glowing orb. The ominous shape wears hooded black robes, which disguise all but the figure’s warty, green hands and broad, frog-like mouth.</p>
<p>“Worthless, pathetic meddlers!” the figure croaks. “I won’t have my plans thwarted again! I’ll have my vengeance on Strixhaven soon enough. You all will pay!”</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f73c5f2c-eb93-4273-b61f-f01edadd35a5">This is Murgaxor, a wizard long ago expelled from Strixhaven for practicing deadly magic. He’s been controlling Dean Tullus through the orb she discovered, using it to channel his magic from afar. Now that Tullus has been thwarted, Murgaxor seeks to carry out his revenge himself. Murgaxor is a bombastic foe, though. Should the characters insult or question him, he gloats about his schemes in the following ways:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f34d0334-7ec5-4f4f-95b7-47908de735ee"><strong>Who are you?</strong> “You should already know the name Murgaxor Grenshel!

But soon all the world will know my name!”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1fac7ac3-64ac-4fa2-8fb0-f19abd02b11a"><strong>What do you want?</strong> “I have what I want for now. Dear Professor Tullus has served her purpose, my magic has spread across Strixhaven, and soon the rest of my plan will be a success.” If the characters ask more about this, Murgaxor ignores their question.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee24a6aa-200b-4dab-88c7-51d1d4517354"><strong>Why are you doing this?</strong> “Vengeance! Vengeance on a scale your feeble minds could never comprehend.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee57d77f-908f-4bef-8e8d-3e6269f25c5b"><strong>So it was you controlling the dean and sickening the students?</strong> “Bah! Manipulating those pawns was only the beginning!”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e4743d27-fdec-49b4-9c03-261372753a9e"><strong>Why are you targeting us?</strong> “You’ve confounded my plots—now for the last time!”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0ea2e5f6-f08c-41e5-8fb1-902b2f37116a">After some banter—or if the characters get a good insult in on him—Murgaxor shouts in frustration. In response, the image of Murgaxor vanishes and the orb cracks, releasing a threat from within.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9b86336e-ab3b-4242-940c-df2195625d54">After Murgaxor’s image vanishes, the cracked orb releases a cloud of mist that transforms into an entity composed of equal parts noxious wind and crackling green energy. This creature uses the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16774-air-elemental" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16774-tooltip">air elemental</a> stat block, except its Slam attack deals necrotic damage instead of bludgeoning damage. The creature fights until destroyed. When reduced to 0 hit points, the creature is drawn back into the cracked orb. The orb glows brightly for 1 minute, after which it releases another such creature with full hit points.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b447e296-8652-4feb-bcb6-b7a5db3bf1c6">The orb’s threat can be put to an end only by destroying the orb (see “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/the-magisters-masquerade#MurgaxorsOrb" title="Murgaxor’s Orb" data-content-chunk-id="a272cef5-ec48-4ef5-a5ef-cf11c8272760">Murgaxor’s Orb</a>” at the start of the adventure).

<p data-content-chunk-id="deb31299-0b82-4596-b881-e982e4a25740">If Dean Tullus survives her confrontation with the characters, she’s free of Murgaxor’s influence and grateful to these resourceful students. She covers for the characters when other faculty members ask about any strangeness (or missing possessions) in the Deans’ Wing.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eab938eb-5ded-4cc5-9bee-bce1555648ac">If Dean Tullus was killed, the masters of Strixhaven cast <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2224-raise-dead" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2224-tooltip">raise dead</a> to restore her to life. She quickly realizes what transpired and keeps the characters’ role in her death between her and the characters.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ea627d09-0081-430a-8eb6-b0e1f9f47dfd">After their encounter with Murgaxor, the characters likely realize that the evil mage has had a hand in numerous threats the characters have experienced, both during this academic year and before.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="efac3d08-e4e0-418b-a2ed-5ddbad3735cf">Dean Tullus makes sure the rest of the faculty knows about Murgaxor’s threat to the university—a threat every professor takes seriously. Although the faculty is inclined to conceal this information from the student body for the time being (to avoid panic), the characters might learn through Dean Tullus or another professor what they couldn’t learn through research: that a Strixhaven student named <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160313-murgaxor" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160313-tooltip">Murgaxor</a> was expelled long ago for using life-draining magic on his fellow students. Murgaxor was thought defeated, but clearly, he has somehow returned. The university staff doesn’t have any more information than that, but they encourage the characters to remain wary.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c16d5788-b200-4ff5-93e1-a6858553449a">If this adventure marks the end of your Strixhaven campaign, the school’s administrators thank the characters for ending Murgaxor’s threat and promise to destroy any remnants of the evil mage’s magic.</p>

In this adventure, the characters come face-to-face with an awful truth: not only does Murgaxor Grenshel threaten the safety of everyone on campus, but the university’s masters are powerless against the villain. It becomes clear that the characters must drop their studies and stop him at all costs.</p>

A former student who was expelled 200 years ago, he has artificially extended his life and seeks true immortality. He corrupted eldritch balm to cause magical mishaps, schemed to attack students at a Mage Tower game, and manipulated one of Lorehold’s deans to harm students. Now his schemes threaten the entire campus.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5284da09-e9d7-47d1-9229-e2e27c05b3ad">Earlier in the week, a load of supply crates failed to arrive at a storage area on Witherbloom’s campus when a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16929-hydra" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16929-tooltip">hydra</a> attacked the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160327-ruin-grinder" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160327-tooltip">ruin grinders</a> (described in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sacoc/friends-and-foes#RuinGrinder" title="chapter 7" data-content-chunk-id="f99c39bb-ae04-4fd3-af15-19c4937e2891">chapter 7</a>) that were hauling the cargo. The ruin grinders are now malfunctioning and wandering the bayou confusedly. The cargo they hauled is scattered about. Instructor Minexes has tasked the students in detention with retrieving the cargo and bringing it to dry land.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="df39413b-b2bd-4000-ac3e-c50e45f9c287">Ten students are scheduled to serve detention during the characters’ shift. The characters can easily find out these students’ identities beforehand from Professor Lang (see “<a href="#StudentsinDetention" title="Students in Detention" data-content-chunk-id="6094dcae-d577-48a2-884b-eaaa593f8bf4">Students in Detention</a>”). The students in detention are already there when the characters arrive for their shift.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1dd33f62-5868-42d2-a360-86ff5c3e43e2"><em><strong>The Instructor’s Secret.</strong></em> In reviewing the cargo manifest, Instructor Minexes noted one of the crates contained chemical substances that, unless recovered quickly and stored properly, could become unstable. Unwilling to frighten the students, the instructor keeps this information quiet for now.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b6a6891-3e91-4e5b-952a-4addfa966aaf">Additionally, the instructor is aware of the characters’ assignment from Professor Lang. He won’t discuss it in earshot of the other students, but if the characters have questions for him, he happily discusses the matter with them in private. Instructor Minexes doesn’t have any new information to share about Murgaxor.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="996b79d9-4097-41fd-995f-b610377e41e6">When the characters arrive, read or paraphrase the following:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>The smell of putrefaction overwhelms your senses. Ahead, a knot of sullen students and one faculty member stand on a wide wooden pathway over the reeking muck. Grinning, the orc faculty member carries a satchel brimming with scrolls.</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="16e76e92-c841-4130-804a-08db9db3ddb0">A number of students equal to the number of characters are serving detention; you can roll on the Students in Detention table (rerolling any repeated results) to identify them, or you can select ones who suit your game. Instructor Minexes, wants to see everyone learn the value of teamwork during detention. After introducing himself and welcoming everyone to the Detention Bog, he continues:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>“I am so pleased to have you all here with me today! This is an opportunity for all of us to learn more about ourselves, our fellow students, and the amazing world around us. Today we’ll be heading out into the bog to recover some lost supplies and return them to dry land.”</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cdc78a86-0e9c-4a67-9b8e-1df66222b926">Once he finishes his welcome, the instructor pairs each character with a student. He gives each pair of students a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5418-tooltip">spell scroll</a> of <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2321-tensers-floating-disk" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2321-tooltip">Tenser’s floating disk</a>. If no one in detention can read the scroll, the instructor does so for each pair.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="850f1903-bf4b-44f8-98fa-9f7d67399963">Neither Instructor Minexes nor Professor Lang is aware of the hydra attack that caused the supply run to go awry. If the characters inquire how the crates came to be lost, Minexes guesses that the ruin grinders used to haul the supplies malfunctioned. If the characters are amenable, the instructor would appreciate them finding and repairing the ruin grinders, although they don’t need to complete that task today.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="de62a398-cb81-4250-92c6-e584fb366bf0">As detention monitors, each character must spend the rest of the day supervising students who are being punished for their recent misbehavior.

<p data-content-chunk-id="4731f0b2-ffa9-4bde-926a-7768e56c09f8">Located at the outskirts of Sedgemoor on Witherbloom’s campus, the Detention Bog reeks of mud and fetid water. Here, students perform useful tasks as punishment for misbehavior—typically, collecting specimens of rare flora and fauna for use in spells, unguents, and potions. It’s unpleasant work in an unpleasant place.</p>
<h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="SearchingforSupplies" data-content-chunk-id="79fb06ec-0b12-49ac-bb39-ede9ac48604f"><a href="#SearchingforSupplies" data-content-chunk-id="3eb83a65-6715-4728-bcd8-d909504acd95"></a>Searching for Supplies</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4aef675d-8ae6-4d23-97bd-ef12f82e1bbd">The characters and students in detention must search for supplies as described below.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7a8df702-a5fd-45b1-a649-0bdbd348d91f"><em><strong>Objective.</strong></em> Instructor Minexes directs the students to look for the lost supplies in the area shown on <a href="#DetentionBogLocations" title="map 6.1." data-content-chunk-id="d6310a13-34c0-48ef-9b91-5efee2f11c30">map 6.1.</a> The characters and their charges must find the six lost crates in areas <a href="#D1TheStickiestCrate" title="D1" data-content-chunk-id="91adea9f-a197-4ef3-94fe-6ae1afa465de">D1</a>–<a href="#D6UnstableCrate" title="D6" data-content-chunk-id="58adcf1b-e3de-46f9-bb9c-6b05fcee767c">D6</a> on map 6.1 and bring them all to the trail in the map’s northwest corner, where Instructor Minexes waits for the students to complete their task. A trail near this rendezvous point leads to a more solid section of Witherbloom’s campus.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8fe4e677-9558-42bf-9c73-50161a1c7de5"><em><strong>Crates.</strong></em> Each crate is a sealed, steel box weighing about 150 pounds. Also, each crate has AC 19; 33 hit points; and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. Finally, each is secured with a locking mechanism that requires a successful DC 18 Dexterity check with thieves’ tools to unlock. Instructor Minexes carries a master key that unlocks each crate. They all contain spell components. The unstable cargo Instructor Minexes is worried about is in <a href="#D6UnstableCrate" title="area D6" data-content-chunk-id="343feb65-92f9-46dd-8c4e-2ff1257cac57">area D6</a>; see that area for more information.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="de41398f-5481-4d70-a6d0-1c01a76adff3"><em><strong>Murgaxor’s Influence.</strong></em> When the characters examine any of the crates except for the empty crate in <a href="#D5EmptyCrate" title="area D5" data-content-chunk-id="c1c9a7a5-4aec-40e6-ba6d-ddbfb07d27d5">area D5</a>, they get an unsettling feeling. <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2065-detect-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2065-tooltip">Detect magic</a> reveals latent, sinister magic in the air, as well as a strange sense of magically generated protection.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="290cef80-e375-47c8-8abf-21b8ddee039b">The characters can deduce that this magical signature belongs to Murgaxor, who must have contaminated all of these supplies. If the players don’t figure it out on their own, a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check reveals that Murgaxor has cloaked himself with magical protection, but only from something very specific. It’s possible that he has protected himself from the spells of specific spellcasters, although it isn’t clear yet who.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="87bf19e1-797f-4978-8f25-d9a27e4625b2"><em><strong>Spell Scrolls.</strong></em> The instructor has brought a number of <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5418-tooltip">spell scrolls</a> of <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2321-tensers-floating-disk" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2321-tooltip">Tenser’s floating disk</a> equal to twice the number of pairs of students. Either the instructor or a character must read each scroll and cast its spell, which must be used to transport the crates to the northwest corner of the map. If the task takes longer than the duration of two scrolls (2 hours), the characters must figure out how to move the crates on their own.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f744e264-2a11-42e0-b82d-68281fe71a8a">The Detention Bog is a muggy place with the following features:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c50d2f83-d09a-4b88-9426-881d730bfd4f"><strong>Endless Muck.</strong> The muddy, stagnant water is 2 feet deep unless otherwise specified and counts as <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#DifficultTerrain" data-tooltip-href="/rules/86-tooltip">difficult terrain</a>.

<p data-content-chunk-id="da39a339-cb64-46bc-a300-4385676f2ac4"><strong>Poor Visibility.</strong> Pervasive mist and drizzle reduce visibility to 30 feet.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b8683d0c-7d4d-4eaf-98e5-bb3d127ef24f"><strong>Teeming Creatures.</strong> The bog is filled with animal life, much of it noisy and distracting.

The crate explodes if it is moved or jostled. If the characters leave the crate alone after they see it, the crate explodes 10 minutes later. When the crate explodes, creatures within 30 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>“It’s far more terrible than we thought. The crates you found have been tampered with. We have evidence of a strange magical signature left behind by the culprit. We now believe Murgaxor Grenshel is responsible, but he has hidden himself from all known forms of divination magic. It’s clear that Murgaxor has enacted a protection ritual against all spells and effects cast against him by a faculty member.</p>
<p>“It gets worse. Murgaxor’s influence over Dean Tullus coerced her into tainting the spell components, food, and drinks of nearly everyone on campus last year. Anyone who came in contact with these are now threatened by the ritual Murgaxor is conducting.”</p>
<p>“Once complete, this ritual will drain the life energy out of everyone affected. Some will die. Others may not. Either way, we believe that the ritual will transfer that energy to Murgaxor, making him immortal.</p>
<p>“Murgaxor’s plan is clear now, and we faculty members are powerless against him. But you’re not.”</p>
</aside>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b1f93c26-62c7-4d68-b992-6ea55b2e8033">At this point, the characters should realize that they’re Strixhaven’s only hope to stop this terrible plan.

Authorities believed something about those locations enhanced his magic, but he was never caught. Sightings soon stopped, and no further evidence of Murgaxor’s presence was found.

<p data-content-chunk-id="c25438d5-38f8-4acc-b697-e141055ebe1c">Indeed, the Fortress Badlands have become a haven for acolytes of Murgaxor’s teachings and their thralls.

<p data-content-chunk-id="80072aac-63ae-48f8-81a1-a0acc85b2eda">Dealing at least 25 radiant damage to the dome with an attack or a spell creates a 10-foot-diameter hole in it. Appearing at the point where the attack or spell made first contact with the dome, this hole remains open for 1 minute.</p>

If the check succeeds, the character can switch the requisite damage type from radiant to another type chosen from the following list: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, piercing, slashing, or thunder.

Finding each glyph requires a successful DC 16 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check. If the wights in area N5 warned the characters about the glyphs, checks made to find them have advantage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cc755aa3-1817-4d85-9a71-6e341562e32a">Once a glyph is found, a successful DC 16 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check disables it.

The Locus can’t be moved, but it can be damaged in the following special ways:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2c008d41-e016-4229-b302-b011f729769b"><strong>Rip Out Its Guts.</strong> A character can reach inside the Locus through one of its mouths and try to rip out its innards with a DC 15 Strength (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/2-tooltip">Athletics</a>) check. If the check fails, the character is unsuccessful and takes 10 necrotic damage. If the check succeeds, the character takes 5 necrotic damage and deals 22 (4d10) slashing damage to the Locus, ignoring its damage threshold and resistance to slashing damage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="626d7044-6e9e-4b84-909f-61367eaf00c3"><strong>Undo It with Magic</strong>. A character within 5 feet of the Locus can use an action to try to overload it using an incantation taught in school. The character concludes the incantation by making an Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check. If the check fails, the character takes 5 necrotic damage. If the check succeeds, the Locus takes 22 (4d10) force damage, ignoring its damage threshold.</p>

<p>Globules of swamp water float in the air, their surfaces rippling. A bullywug, sitting hunched with legs crossed, is partially hidden within a cocoon made of thin, tightly woven strands of mud. Five bright stones buzz around this hunched figure like flies, and a runic circle crackles with eldritch power on the floor below the figure.</p>

Whirling around him are five stones he needs to complete his life-draining ritual (see “Murgaxor and the Ritual Stones” below). While performing the ritual, Murgaxor can’t move or take actions, bonus actions, or reactions. However, he can take lair actions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b54f881b-d11d-41c0-a421-df168a692375"><em><strong>Barrier.</strong></em> Murgaxor is surrounded by a barrier of arcane energy resembling a cocoon of writhing mud. While surrounded by this barrier, Murgaxor and the stones encircling him can’t be targeted by attacks or spells. The barrier has AC 14; 200 hit points; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The barrier can’t be circumvented by teleportation magic, which fizzles if anyone tries to teleport past it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="31b15701-d39f-4933-8c6b-1e6b80830f77"><em><strong>Murgaxor and the Ritual Stones.</strong></em> Once the barrier is destroyed, characters can attack Murgaxor and the five ritual stones circling him. Each stone is an 8-inch-long cylindrical opal covered with delicate golden runes. It has AC 18, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing Murgaxor to 0 hit points or destroying all five ritual stones ends the ritual before it can be completed (see “<a href="#StoppingtheRitual" title="Stopping the Ritual" data-content-chunk-id="27b36547-018b-46b1-a637-561f6ebf4980">Stopping the Ritual</a>” below).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5dc23005-ea56-46c5-a277-5f96ad0447f4"><em><strong>Murgaxor’s Lair Actions.</strong></em> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Murgaxor can take one of the following lair actions; after he does so, he can’t use that action again until he finishes a long rest:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eaca8b9a-4273-4374-ab7a-bdfa4762f371"><strong>Clay Behemoth.</strong> A <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16825-clay-golem" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16825-tooltip">clay golem</a> erupts from the floor in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the ritual circle. The golem obeys Murgaxor’s commands, takes its turns on initiative count 10 (losing initiative ties), fights until destroyed, and reverts to a mound of inanimate clay after 1 hour.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b93172ba-ed31-4663-bfab-90e4c547186c"><strong>Earthen Fist.</strong> A Medium fist made of packed earth rises from the floor in an unoccupied space that Murgaxor can see within 30 feet of him. The fist then attacks one creature of his choice that is within 5 feet of the fist. The fist has a +11 bonus to hit, and on a hit, the target takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage and is <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/6-tooltip">grappled</a> (escape DC 15). The fist disappears if the attack roll misses or if the grapple ends. When the fist disappears, this lair action recharges, allowing Murgaxor to use it again.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9ee528c7-f812-4ff3-af7d-ebc98428229d"><strong>Necrotic Burst.</strong> Tendrils of necrotic energy erupt from the ritual circle and lash out at any number of creatures Murgaxor can see within 15 feet of the circle. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or it takes 5 (1d10) necrotic damage and can’t regain hit points until the start of its next turn.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="450ae4ff-177a-412a-9a0e-0dd6e73fe86c"><strong>Summon Mephits.</strong> Murgaxor summons four <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17173-mud-mephit" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17173-tooltip">mud mephits</a> that appear in unoccupied spaces within 15 feet of the ritual circle. The mephits obey Murgaxor’s commands, take their turns on initiative count 15 (losing initiative ties), and fight until destroyed.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4026e280-7926-4cd2-a564-0938b263a973">If Murgaxor’s barrier and ritual stones are destroyed, Murgaxor loses access to his lair actions. In addition, any creatures or effects brought forth by his lair actions (such as the clay golem, the earthen fist, and the mud mephits) transform into heaps of harmless clay, earth, or mud. When Murgaxor’s ritual is stopped, read:</p>
<aside class="read-aloud-text">
<p>A warbling, high-pitched wail escapes Murgaxor as he crashes to the floor with a wet thump. A rush of air and a concussive blast momentarily replaces all sound. The thrum of magical power is gone.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a75bf255-efe1-4445-a03c-231c9baeb471">If the characters stop Murgaxor’s ritual, the mishaps plaguing Strixhaven University cease, and the corruption affecting Strixhaven’s scholars vanishes. If Murgaxor survives the ritual’s premature end, the characters have a choice to make. They can take him back to Strixhaven to stand trial for his crimes, or they can administer justice themselves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd6bf4d8-b0d6-448a-9921-c7a2da7b7c69">News of Murgaxor’s defeat lifts the gloom on campus and restores its typically joyful atmosphere. Professor Sharpbeak tells the characters that the faculty plans to honor the heroes on their graduation day with a celebration attended by their Friends, Beloveds, and even Rivals. The faculty also offers each character a token of gratitude, in the form of a rare or uncommon magic item of the character’s choice.</p>

Shortly afterward, the ritual deals 70 (20d6) necrotic damage to everyone on campus as Murgaxor siphons their life force. Hundreds of scholars die, and many more are severely injured. Murgaxor becomes immortal and one of the most powerful spellcasters in the world. If the characters survive, perhaps the Founder Dragons and the archaics can guide them as they attempt to stop Murgaxor in a dystopian new world.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e760cbda-ad53-4692-8535-a7bc5db0e0f1">Herein you will find some weapons that deal unusual damage types and spellcasting that functions in atypical ways. Such an exception is a special feature of a stat block and represents how the creature uses the weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no effect on how a weapon or a spell functions for someone else.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="60b95a82-55e1-4d1f-af51-5d58399d8120">Archaics are towering, multi-armed creatures overflowing with magic. Despite their solitude, archaics carry vast understanding of magic and the world’s history, as well as the ability to warp the fabric of the world around them. Sages who seek out archaics for their knowledge receive confusing and often contradictory answers to questions. If a supplicant successfully unwinds the tangle, the answer they seek is revealed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7b14d8f4-0aa8-446d-9e08-e49e4840e97e">In truth, archaics are the reincarnated souls of the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/2160314-oracle-of-strixhaven" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/2160314-tooltip">oracles of Strixhaven</a>. When an oracle dies, their soul travels back through time to the explosion of magic that brought the Founder Dragons into being. In that outrush of creative force, the oracle’s soul can be caught in the tide and clad in the very substance of the world, becoming an archaic. Because their knowledge cuts across the flow of time, archaics are careful how much they reveal to mortals and thus tend to speak in riddles.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="66f17af9-6aa1-4044-a537-307f3d24959a">To create an art elemental mascot, a mage draws power from a blend of all the natural elements, extracting their vibrant colors to craft a swirling outer shell before imbuing its core with a planar spirit.

<p data-content-chunk-id="f7772b08-54fa-4719-b72f-16bfd1689858">The dragon Beledros masters the intertwined magic of life and death. Her power taps into the life force flowing through living things and the natural world. She manipulates that energy to give healing and life or to bring death and decay. Her mastery of this magic sustains her own life force even without the sustenance of food, drink, or even air.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="83d02532-897a-40e8-b702-b08c04f1f62a">She founded Witherbloom College to pass on her understanding of the natural cycle. She hoped to create generations of stewards who would use her teachings to defend nature and help others. In keeping with the dichotomous nature of her philosophy and magic, she views the more dangerous aspects of nature, including the inevitability of death and decay, as natural and integral parts of existence.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0571162e-c0d3-437f-990a-c87071a04789">Brackish trudges are lumbering masses of sentient fungus and vegetation that thrive in the bayou. They are living examples of the conflicting forces of life and decay existing in a harmonious cycle. Flowers and other plant life grow on their backs, necks, and heads. When these plants die, they decay and become the ideal habitat for fungi. The older a trudge is, the wilder and more varied are the plants and fungi that thrive in the tiny ecosystem on its back.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f0c79d3-b0b9-4235-b5c0-b740c8fd469d">While sometimes ill-tempered and territorial, brackish trudges are usually content to mind their own business. When trudges are roused to defend themselves or drive off rivals, their punishing tusks laced with deadly fungus spores can make short work of the unwary. Trudges are also notoriously difficult to slay; the energies of life and death within them allow them to survive harrowing injuries.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e4fac02b-b9f8-4e88-9ed7-e7f3f1d8c38b">Programmed with knowledge of Strixhaven’s extensive lore catalog, cogwork archivists serve as keepers of the university’s various libraries. The archivists’ towering metal frames are equipped with long, articulated limbs and retractable conservator tools, which they use to organize and preserve documents from throughout Strixhaven’s winding history. Many cogwork archivists can be found among the towering shelves of the Biblioplex, simultaneously retrieving scrolls for curious students while keeping a stern eye on any rowdy groups that might disrupt the quiet atmosphere.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="caafe3c8-8821-4096-9414-3d703dee1bff">Slipping through the darkest corners of the world, daemogoths are powerful fiendish creatures that feed on misery and other negative emotions. Some sages refer to daemogoths as tear lickers, owing to the fiends’ tendency to lurk near battlefields and other sites of great tragedy to consume the anguish saturating the area.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fcae921d-2bf9-46c0-902e-3fe1ce505755">Daemogoths are creatures of forbidden knowledge and magic, all fueled by their consumption of anguish. They trade magical influence over the lives and minds of others to ambitious mortals in exchange for the mortal’s agony.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4b3701c7-494a-4a8b-b160-7f62967ff1f3">Daemogoths are alien-looking in the extreme. Their eyes are insectile or smooth and bulbous like gleaming jewels, and they have five arms. They typically wear long robes, which drape low over their forms, and they sport a halo of horns, antlers, or floating stones or crystals.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0a017ed2-9223-470f-8a4e-ff83251de9c1">To an untrained eye, a fractal mascot looks like a creature made from facets of hard light. But arithmancers know that these fractals are actually living equations: artificial life forms created by extrapolating magic from the mathematical patterns in nature.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="867d8c74-81c5-4507-bb06-78cff5e33489">Because of their arithmetic basis, fractal mascots can alter both their size and density. Quandrix College has adopted the fractal as its mascot, and many a Quandrix student can be found playing fetch with a fractal companion in between lessons.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="50797ab6-6433-4f64-bc45-bf01b78d0bc6">The dragon Galazeth Prismari embodies the flow of magic from inspiration into artistic expression, whether through physical form or another sensory medium. His magic draws on primal energy—such as flame, lightning, and the tides—and weaves them into spectacles both beautiful and deadly.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9f0a30be-0ef5-4856-84f1-de67870b6ad3">Galazeth founded Prismari College to ensure that the study of magic wouldn’t ever be relegated to pure practicality. His teachings emphasize that magic’s beauty must contribute to unfolding culture and personal emotional growth. Galazeth views dynamic expression and precise perfection as necessarily competing forces, both within individuals and the world at large.</p>

These living blobs of shadowy ink are often summoned by professors who require assistance in their writing workshops—the inklings provide endless ink—or by lonely students hoping for company as they study. However, inklings can just as readily support mages in combat, disrupting opponents’ sight.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="362a9209-6666-4b8c-9f98-7768a170a0a3">The archaeomancers of Lorehold College draw their magical might from the flow of time and fate and the way those forces shape the course of history. Scholars of this broad mystical study divide between those who see history as an unpredictable jumble of chance and those who believe events form a perfect—and predictable—pattern.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="eebe63da-feac-4990-9956-97e03f3a7099">Deep in crumbling ruins and piles of dusty scrolls, Lorehold students—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—study the magic of the past, searching for arcane artifacts and speaking with long-dead adventurers to uncover secrets lost to time.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="83bb0ccf-97aa-4123-87c5-3a90c134233c">Though many Lorehold students bury themselves in old tomes, others take a more cavalier approach to their studies and travel the world to see history made before their eyes. Their magic can range from spells tampering with the flow of time itself to concussive blasts that break through old ruins—to sometimes just bashing things with a glowing scroll.</p>

They study the course history has taken, looking for breaking points in the flow of events, and focus their magic into creating breaks that are to their advantage. Whether those breaks are in a series of events, in obstacles, or in enemies depends on the needs in the moment. They crush enemies’ plans under the weight of time and lash out with magical energy that often takes the appearance of books, scrolls, and sheets of parchment.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="06980213-755c-41c0-8954-9011452e841f">Lorehold’s professors of order search for evidence of patterns and predictable outcomes in history. They study the flow of events, learning which occurrences herald specific outcomes, and they trace their magic through those paths of causality. In their exploration of ruins, professors of order shore up dangerous structures and find the safest paths as they search. When confronted, they confound their foes by channeling the stasis of perfect order, creating resilient barriers of force and quashing hostile magic.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7e7256c7-6a3e-4c47-9778-266e7797b208">Somewhere in the lands beyond Strixhaven’s borders lives the Oracle: a wise and accomplished mage, tasked by the Founder Dragons to ensure that the magic of Strixhaven is used to help others and not twisted to evil ends. The one who holds the mantle of the Oracle must not only understand the fundamental truths of magic, but also possess impeccable wisdom and unshakable virtue.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="857d0e51-bbbb-440d-9963-8737e93b6e7e">The current Oracle is an elderly human named Jadzi. A graduate of Quandrix College, Jadzi has since expanded her studies to encompass all disciplines of spellcasting, tempering the mathematical abstractions she wielded at Strixhaven with benevolent divination and a return to the basics of magic itself.</p>

Narr was in consideration for elevation to the role of Oracle of Strixhaven, but when the Founder Dragons passed him over in favor of Jadzi, his bitterness knew no bounds. He now uses the Oriq to gather the spells and magical energy he needs to summon a devastating being, the Blood Avatar, to destroy Strixhaven.</p>

The Oriq take pains to hide their true allegiance and wear masks to hide their identities. These masks have magical properties that function only for their intended wearers.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="29b6800e-a17b-4acb-93ca-6f64452bef1f">The students of Prismari College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—see no distinction between magic and art. No two Prismari students have the same style of spellcasting; each wields the elemental magic taught by the college in a way that expresses their personality. In the hands of Prismari students, spells that conjure fire or bend water to one’s will become vibrant and expressive showcases, thrumming with creative energy.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="80c61e80-4915-49f5-9747-c86a821f13dc">Harnessing the elemental forces of their magic requires precision and grace, and some students dedicate themselves to chasing the ideal of perfect control, hoping that by doing so, they can accurately express what is churning within their minds.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1e9891d4-aa5b-4abd-92b7-2eed45d7d3fc">The scholars of Quandrix College focus on the mathematical principles that govern reality. Through these formulas, they can manipulate properties of matter and space, as well as abstract and conceptual space such as the mind, probability, and the flow of magic itself.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a47d4721-136d-48d2-a2c5-a8500558033b">The students of Quandrix College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—immerse themselves in the magic of geometry and metaphysics. Their ultimate goal isn’t mastery, however. Rather, in their projects they explore and expand knowledge without expecting concrete answers. Whether students are extrapolating mathematical patterns in nature or engaging in speculative dives into topological formulas that bend reality, their studies blur the line between abstract numerical theory and natural reality.</p>

The professor can then teleport, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="049f6d13-1649-4bcc-a207-c5193d113058">Professors of theory advance the Quandrix philosophy that math-magical manipulation is most powerful in the abstract dimension of minds, probability, and the fabric of magic itself. Their equations shift perceptions in profound ways, alter probability, and interfere with the formation of other magic. In battle, the professors tweak probability to impede attacks and strike at the minds of their foes with lancing equations that disrupt the opponent’s resolve.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1f4465fe-a3ed-430d-9e62-d06fb47b63f4">Professors of theory hold that altering the way a person interacts with the world can change the world. They impress upon their students to use magic as a tool to shape the overall experience of reality, and in turn make the world a better place.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b607dcbf-d1d1-4d9c-90da-a8d2ffcb0063">For long expeditions, Lorehold mages often employ relic sloths to haul adventuring equipment and excavated artifacts—so long as their study isn’t in any particular hurry. Relic sloths travel at an excruciatingly slow pace, deliberating every step and moving only when necessary. But this caution makes these hulking creatures perfect for traversing treacherous and crumbling ruins, where other beasts of burden would falter. The distinctive sickle-shaped claws on a relic sloth’s forelimbs are primarily used for climbing, though they can fend off a hungry predator in a pinch.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d0262238-cd57-4852-8405-fbbbd38c6520">The scholars of Silverquill College study the power of magic shaped through spoken and written words. They use that power either to illuminate and guide or to obscure and demoralize.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6857a840-ae9d-4309-9721-8d15a8ff794d">Stylish and driven, the students of Silverquill College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—cut imposing figures on campus. Dressed in smartly trimmed black-and-white uniforms, these budding mages practice bolstering speeches and wield inky blades.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="10cd30e0-ca5d-433a-ae6a-2e1c8dd5e9b4">Some Silverquill students prefer the benevolent side of language, using their words to uplift their friends and illuminate harsh truths about those in power. Others, though, choose to wield words more ruthlessly and master the art of insults and discouragement (and in some cases, petty trash talk). Regardless, nearly all members of Silverquill College carry themselves with a fearsome, never-second-place attitude—because in the art of wielding words, confidence is key.</p>

Whether weaving their magic through spoken incantations and scathing insults or through shadows, these teachers break down the resolve of their foes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ba3ea3c-a81b-4212-a6ce-a64121556515">The professors strive to carry themselves as immaculately as possible, seeking to overawe and wrong-foot anyone who would stand against them in debate or in battle. In teaching their students, professors of shadow focus on words that find the tiniest, most invisible cracks in an opponent’s defenses and break them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="375b3ead-5a74-411f-a6d2-334f7063f870">To enhance their studies of the past, Lorehold students often call upon the spirits of dead creatures. Mages seeking longer-term assistance from ancient spirits have learned to house these spirits in statues, giving them a more permanent residence from which to assist the living.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f3071727-177d-40fa-b2d4-519dedb153f5">Some of these spirit statues bond with and mentor a specific mage, but most serve in a variety of roles for numerous individuals, ranging from research colleagues to martial tacticians. Regardless, their appearance is so common around the Lorehold campus that they have become the college’s mascots.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8e151e4b-4fd8-4be6-afae-c448c3c7c397">With cheerful dispositions and a knack for walking backward, Strixhaven campus guides lead gaggles of prospective students on tours. The guides’ gold and silver chassis are built in shapes reminiscent of the star arches surrounding Strixhaven. Embedded in their chests are holographic maps of the university’s campuses, which the guides use to provide directions. However, it’s rare for a campus guide to need its own maps, as these gregarious automatons have a gift for finding things on campus, often popping up at the most inopportune times.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="68c9ccc4-50a4-4d30-a2ab-1088d15c2d11">Velomachus Lorehold was the first dragon of Strixhaven to master the magic of order and chaos, the flow and prediction of events through time. Her magic encourages exploration and discovery through the lens of creating a direct conduit to the past.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fd8a77c2-e009-4055-a6c7-becc210df219">She founded Lorehold College to ensure mortals would never forget the lessons of the past. After living for centuries, Velomachus has grown tired of watching the same mistakes repeated continually. She hopes her college’s teachings will foster the skills to either predict future pitfalls by taking lessons from those that came before or create flexible mindsets that allow people to shift their plans effectively when the unexpected occurs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1c6624ea-2321-4d27-bd2f-acbb56692516">Velomachus’s spells, legendary actions, and breath weapon are accompanied by visual effects resembling tomes and scrolls composed of golden light, perceptible distortions as time doubles back on itself, and thunderous sounds.</p>
