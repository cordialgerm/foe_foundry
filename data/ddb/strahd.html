        <p>We turned the corner, and there was a vampire.</p>
        <p>I groaned and rolled my eyes.</p>
        <p>It was 1978, and I was playing in one of my first dungeon adventures. It was being run by a friend I had
            known in high school, John Scott Clegg, and it was typical of the type of adventure that people played in
            those days. It was all about exploring a hodgepodge collection of rooms connected by dungeon corridors,
            beating up the monsters that we encountered, searching for treasure, and gaining experience points.</p>
        <p>Now we were face to face with random encounter number thirty-four: a vampire. Not a Vampire with a capital V,
            but a so-many-Hit-Dice-with-such-and-such-an-Armor-Class lowercase vampire. Just another monster in the
            dungeon.</p>
        <p>I remember thinking at the time, What are <em>you</em> doing here? This creature seemed completely out of
            place with the kobolds, orcs, and gelatinous cubes we had seen thus far. This was a creature who deserved
            his own setting and to be so much more than just a wandering monster. When I came home from that game, I
            told all these thoughts to Laura.</p>
        <p>That was when Strahd von Zarovich was born.</p>
        <p>Strahd would be no afterthought — he demanded his own setting, his own tragic history. Laura and I launched
            into researching the mythology and folklore surrounding the vampire. We started with the vague,
            black-and-white image of Bela Lugosi in 1931, but found so much more.</p>
        <p>The first “modern” literary foundation of the vampire was penned by John William Polidori based on a fragment
            of a story by Lord Byron. It was while at the Villa Diodati — a rented house next to Lake Geneva,
            Switzerland — that Byron and Polidori met Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and her husband-to-be, Percy Shelley.
            One night in June, Byron suggested that they each write a ghost story. Mary Shelley’s contribution to the
            effort would later become <em>Frankenstein</em>. The short story “The Vampyre,” published in 1819, was
            Polidori’s contribution. He was Byron’s personal physician, and the first of the so-called “romantic”
            vampires under Polidori’s hand was actually modeled after Lord Byron.</p>
        <p>Byron — like the fictional vampires that he inspired, from Polidori’s Lord Ruthven down through the
            penultimate work of Bram Stoker — was a decadent predator, an abuser hidden behind a romantic veil. He was a
            comely and alluring monster — but a monster nevertheless. The romantic vampire of the earliest years of the
            genre was not just a spouse abuser but a spouse killer, the archetype of abuse in the worst kind of
            destructive codependency.</p>
        <p>For Laura and me, those were the elements that truly defined Strahd von Zarovich — a selfish beast forever
            lurking behind a mask of tragic romance, the illusion of redemption that was ever only camouflage for his
            prey.</p>
        <p>Initially we were going to title the adventure <em>Vampyr</em> — one of a series of games we called
            Nightventure that Laura and I were self-publishing back in 1978. The castle was called Ravenloft, and when
            Halloween came around each year, our friends asked us if we could play “that Ravenloft game” again … and so
            the better title won out. It was, in part, because of this design that I was hired by TSR, Inc., to write
            <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> adventures in 1982. Soon thereafter, I6 <em>Ravenloft</em> was
            published.</p>
        <p>Since then, fans of <em>Ravenloft</em> have seen many different creative perspectives on Barovia (a country
            which, by absolute coincidence, is featured in a 1947 Bob Hope movie called <em>Where There’s Life</em>). It
            continues to be one of the most popular <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> adventures of all time. In
            its various incarnations, each designer has endeavored to bring something new to the ancient legend of
            Strahd, and to each of them we are grateful.</p>
        <p>But the vampire genre has taken a turn from its roots in recent years. The vampire we so often see today
            exemplifies the polar opposite of the original archetype: the lie that it’s okay to enter into a romance
            with an abusive monster because if you love it enough, it will change.</p>
        <p>When Laura and I got a call from Christopher Perkins about revisiting <em>Ravenloft</em>, we hoped we could
            bring the message of the vampire folktale back to its original cautionary roots. The talented team at
            Wizards of the Coast not only graciously took our suggestions but engaged us in a dialogue that delivered
            new insights on the nightmare beyond the gates of Barovia.</p>
        <p>Now we invite you again as our guests to pass through the Svalich Woods if you dare. For here the romance is
            tragically dangerous … and a true monster smiles at your approach.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="eaeb12da-af62-458c-b5d2-c6dc3b334c65">Under raging storm clouds, a lone figure stands
        silhouetted against the ancient walls of Castle Ravenloft. The vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich stares down a
        sheer cliff at the village below. A cold, bitter wind spins dead leaves about him, billowing his cape in the
        darkness.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="47a5e8bd-c8e4-45a0-b866-49cc81e7a739">Lightning splits the clouds overhead, casting stark
        white light across him. Strahd turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face and hands. He has a
        look of power—and of madness. His once handsome face is contorted by a tragedy darker than the night itself.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ae1def59-6889-4afa-8a1d-dbb7c4a87476">Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The
        wind’s howling increases as Strahd turns his gaze back to the village. Far below, yet not beyond his ken, a
        party of adventurers has just entered his domain. Strahd’s face forms a twisted smile as his dark plan unfolds.
        He knew they were coming, and he knows why they have come—all according to his plan. He, the master of
        Ravenloft, will attend to them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9b4650f7-09cd-4387-8157-bc3e091f151a">Another lightning flash rips through the darkness,
        its thunder echoing through the castle’s towers. But Strahd is gone. Only the howling of the wind—or perhaps a
        lone wolf—fills the midnight air. The master of Ravenloft is having guests for dinner. And you are invited.</p>

        horror, presented here as <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> roleplaying game adventure for a party of four

    <aside class="rules-text" id="AClassicRetold">
        <p>A CLASSIC RETOLD</p>
        <p>This adventure is a retelling of the original <em>Ravenloft</em> adventure, which was published in 1983 by
            TSR, Inc. In the years since, the original has gained a reputation as one of the greatest <strong>Dungeons
                &amp; Dragons</strong> adventures ever, and it went on to inspire the creation of a campaign setting of
            the same name in 1990: Ravenloft, home of the Domains of Dread. </p>
        <p>Module I6: <em>Ravenloft</em>, written by Tracy and Laura Hickman, broke new ground by presenting a D&amp;D
            adventure that was as much story-driven as location-based, featuring a villain who was complex and
            terrifying. Castle Ravenloft, with its amazing three-dimensional maps, remains to this day one of the most
            iconic and memorable of all D&amp;D dungeons. </p>
        <p>This book includes the original adventure, as well as expanded material developed in consultation with Tracy
            and Laura Hickman. It expands what we know about the lands around Castle Ravenloft and sheds new light on
            the dark past of the castle’s lord. The lands of Barovia are from a forgotten world in the D&amp;D
            multiverse, and this adventure gives glimpses into that world. In time, cursed Barovia was torn from its
            home world by the Dark Powers and bound in mist as one of the Domains of Dread in the Shadowfell.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="780cc7d4-7e22-44d9-a78d-78811f0527f6">Adventurers from a foreign land find themselves in
        Barovia, a mysterious realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire and wizard.
        Using a deck of tarokka cards to predict their future, a fortune-teller named Madam Eva sets them on a dark
        course that takes them to many corners of Barovia, culminating with a vampire hunt in Castle Ravenloft.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a8d23069-0df9-42aa-9268-be6691ced55e">Madam Eva’s people are called the Vistani. They
        travel in covered wagons from world to world, luring strangers into Strahd’s domain.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="28210d8e-e149-4d9f-bf6b-304f930811ff">Barovia is a land of ghosts, werewolves, and other
        fell creatures. The wilderness hides many secrets, including forgotten ruins and battlefields that tell the
        story of Strahd’s life as a conqueror. Adventurers who explore the wilderness find the remnants of Strahd’s
        ancient enemies, not all of them as dead as one might expect.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="423f1cb8-0e76-4c09-b6e8-cbb1bdc6544b">For the people of Barovia, there is no escape from
        this harsh land. The town of Vallaki stands ready to defend itself against the servants of Strahd, but it’s far
        from the sanctuary it purports to be. The village of Krezk lies near the edge of Strahd’s domain, its abbey now
        in the clutches of evil, misguided creatures.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d64b4624-81fe-4f63-a385-2fe87de904a1">Of all the settlements in Strahd’s domain, the
        village of Barovia is by far the most oppressed. Many of its shops are closed, and the locals have succumbed to
        despair. It is well known that Strahd desires the burgomaster’s adopted daughter, Ireena Kolyana. The villagers
        neither protect nor harm her, lest they incur the vampire’s wrath. Few know that Ireena bears an uncanny
        resemblance to Tatyana, Strahd’s dead beloved.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b6fbcc8c-6cf3-45b9-9f6e-d6ebe97c89c2">The village of Barovia cowers in the shadow of
        Castle Ravenloft, Strahd’s home and fortress. The castle stands atop a great spire of rock, invincible and ever
        watchful. Every night, thousands of bats fly out of the castle to feed. It is said that Strahd sometimes flies
        with them. Barovia will never be safe until the evil in his castle is destroyed.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="82506c1d-357e-4dc1-adc0-897b6b9a1be9">Once Strahd becomes aware of the adventurers, he and
        his spies watch them closely. When the time is right, Strahd invites his “guests” to Castle Ravenloft. He aims
        to turn them against one another, torment them, and kill them, as he has done with so many other visitors. Some
        will become undead thralls. Others will never rise again.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6c0a996b-faa5-400b-a4e2-a5f2a1ab99b0">The adventurers’ best hope of defeating Strahd is to
        learn his secrets, for he is no ordinary vampire. Guided by Madam Eva’s card reading, they must scour his domain
        and his castle for magic items that might weaken or slay him, all the while trying to stay alive.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="315d575d-2c7a-4677-b25f-359a52f63bba">Although the adventurers can escape by slaying
        Strahd, he can’t be truly destroyed. Barovia is his prison, and not even death can free him from his curse.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c9cdeff7-7b6b-43f6-929b-004d65fd1e31">The adventure ends when either Strahd von Zarovich
        or the characters are defeated. Your goal is to keep Strahd in play for as long as possible, using all the
        abilities and resources at his disposal.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="50ffef9f-3eb4-41e4-90f2-8ce229ffd8b1">Much of the adventure’s action is driven by the
        clash between the adventurers’ decisions and Strahd’s goals, and the adventurers and the vampire are all caught
        in strands of fate that are represented by a special card reading detailed in <a title="chapter 1"

            data-content-chunk-id="91747fe4-12cd-427b-adff-0cb1eb9b1878">chapter 1</a>, “Into the Mists.” Before you run
        the adventure, you need to conduct that reading to determine the location of several items that are key to the
        story, as well as one of the locations where Strahd can be found.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="8d995df0-ed96-456b-9112-3faa7a17d520">The adventure is meant for characters of levels 1–10
        and includes threats for those levels and beyond. Strahd can be an especially deadly challenge at these levels.
        It is assumed that the characters will gain levels over the course of the adventure, as well as acquire allies
        and powerful magic items that can tip the scales in their favor. Characters who head directly to Castle
        Ravenloft without first increasing their power will likely die.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a69c2608-b4f9-4ce4-989e-7c139b4756c4">You can award experience points for the defeat of
        foes, use milestone awards, or a mixture of both. Given the fact that much of the adventure involves social
        interaction and exploration, rather than combat, your work will probably be easier if you use milestone awards.
        Appropriate milestone awards include the following:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7ef83b9b-352f-424c-aaaa-0ecff31d4777"><strong>Finding Artifacts.</strong> The characters

    <p data-content-chunk-id="a0fd4b18-be48-4bf6-938f-a5fcc1074948"><strong>Defeating Villains.</strong> The characters

        lead them all over the map, and a party can easily wander into an area well beyond their power. If you’d like to
        steer them toward places that correspond to their level, consult the Areas by Level table, but beware of
        undermining the sense that the characters’ choices matter. Sometimes the adventurers will simply need to flee or
        hide when they are out of their depth.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8df37605-830f-4a7d-8a10-143bdfc199af">If an area of the adventure ends up feeling free of

        ominousness. If a combat encounter feels too easy, either (a) guide it to its end as quickly as possible or (b)
        increase the threat by raising a foe’s hit point maximum to the upper end of its hit point range, by adding
        monsters/traps, or both.</p>

        horrible monster greets the adventurers as they climb the steps of a tower in Castle Ravenloft. Nearing the top,
        they begin to hear the beating of a heart in the darkness above. Not a human heart, but the heart of something
        monstrous and horrible. Such is the nature of gothic horror: fear bred by anticipation and the dark realization
        that all will be truly and horribly revealed in time.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="21855c3d-254a-49b0-a146-653036d2b2ae">The following tips can help you make this adventure

    <p data-content-chunk-id="29f32622-58b8-4d14-bf48-3187d2829a18">Horror is born out of fear of the unknown. Our fear
        is heightened when the darkness engulfs us and we can’t see, or when the truth is behind a locked door, covered
        by a sheet, or buried in the soft earth. It’s not the monster, but its shadow, that breeds horror. The more we
        know about a monster, the less we fear it, so the trick is to keep it out of the light for as long as possible.
        Here are two tricks to heighten fear of the unknown:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="b938ad24-fce3-43f5-b231-9848cea36489">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="c84a1e74-8258-422f-9769-f0961b9709c1">When it seems as though the characters have
            everything under control, you can have a gust of wind suddenly blow out their torches, plunging them into
            darkness.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="69cf5274-18fb-4016-ba36-033b5babe281">Before a monster appears, take a moment to
            describe the odor that precedes it, the eerie sound it makes, or the weird shadow it casts.</li>

        <li data-content-chunk-id="99356922-0681-4678-ad8f-091fb12dcd1d">Before characters encounter a monster, hint at
            the monster’s presence with clues such as claw marks, gnawed bones, and bloodstains.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="0d92199c-adc7-41bd-8269-cd3321da1e75">Whenever characters take a long rest, give one

        Almost everything here is old and timeworn. Everywhere the adventurers go, they should be reminded of death,
        decay, and their own mortality. Here are a couple of ways to reinforce these pervasive themes:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="d2ece1f8-bd57-4cb3-a6f4-30702ccdeffe">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="9ed6eba3-c4ce-4909-836b-2069b55346c6">Take time to describe the rotting timbers of
            buildings, the faded and moth-eaten clothing of the Barovian peasantry, the worm-ridden pages of old books,
            and the rust on iron fences and gates.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="54360089-41d0-499b-af73-dca0c4f00ff5">A character gazing into a mirror, a pool, or

    <p data-content-chunk-id="08be4a96-3a84-4205-b59d-f6393dd6dfae">A tale that is perpetually dark in tone becomes
        tiresome very quickly. It needs to feature the occasional ray of light for contrast and to create a sense of
        hope. Monsters and other terrors must be offset with creatures that are kind and lovable, giving the characters
        even more reasons to stand against the darkness. Here are a couple of ways to add glimmers of light to a tragic
        tale:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="063bf5c4-894c-41bf-b60d-493c33702a2b">

        <li data-content-chunk-id="a65ecf41-7e26-4b9c-85f3-6459d47d9fa9">Make sure that the heroes have contact with

        thing is one way to turn something ordinary into something malevolent. A groaning house, the wailing wind,
        grasping mud, and a squatting chest aren’t just mundane things—they’re characters in your story, made all the
        creepier thanks to their humanlike traits. Torches sputter nervously, rusty hinges shatter silence with their
        sudden cries of anguish, and cobwebs quietly beckon us to our doom. Here are more examples:</p>

        might be lurking. A leering gargoyle might be a monster in disguise, or merely a fiendish sculpture. A mirror
        hanging on a wall might have the power to transfix all who gaze into it, or it might be nothing out of the
        ordinary. In a horror story, taking the time to describe an object in detail draws attention to it, makes one

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7b6889d2-a069-4566-9148-8fc35a84672e">There are no stranger bedfellows than horror and
        humor. Tension can’t be sustained indefinitely, so a dash of humor provides a respite, giving horror a chance to
        sneak up on us later and catch us off guard. While humorous situations will occur naturally in the course of
        running the adventure, here are some tips for creating humor when needed:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="80eeacb6-1380-4a39-b397-e710999dad05">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="2ba946b7-a084-4c92-90c6-1a023eaf8c34">Allow NPCs (even evil ones) to tell jokes,
            speak in a funny voice, or behave idiotically. Even morbid humor is better than none.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="3a13587b-39bb-45ce-9466-35521cc6a9fd">When a hero, villain, or monster rolls a
            natural 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, describe a humorous mishap that occurs as a
            result of the low roll, such as a character accidentally knocking over a lamp and setting some drapes on
            fire while trying to hide or move silently.</li>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d758861a-4011-45da-be87-84b016197196">In life, Strahd von Zarovich was a count, a prince,
        a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against
        his family’s enemies. He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before
        slaying them all. Strahd named the valley Barovia, after his deceased father, and was so struck by its scenic
        beauty that he decided to settle there.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="85135812-0c5f-45d2-a0ba-60bce31812f2">Queen Ravenovia lamented the death of Barov and was
        fearful of Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, Sergei, away from the
        battlefield. Strahd envied the love and attention his mother visited upon his brother, so in Barovia he
        remained. Peace made Strahd restless, and he began to feel like his best years were behind him. Unwilling to go
        the way of his father, Strahd studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in return
        for the promise of immortality.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="71219713-c0a0-45a0-832c-6f509cbb1533">Strahd scoured his conquered lands for wizards and
        artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent
        fortresses of his ancestral homeland. Strahd named the castle Ravenloft, after his mother, to demonstrate his
        love for her. When it was complete, Strahd commanded his mother and brother to come to Barovia and stay with
        him. Sergei eventually took up residence at Ravenloft, but Ravenovia passed away while traveling to her
        namesake. In sorrowful disappointment, Strahd sealed his mother’s body in a crypt beneath the castle.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6b5d0be3-3eb4-4c95-ba7e-71f087669d0b">Strahd’s attention soon turned to Tatyana, a young
        Barovian woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. Strahd believed her to be a worthy bride, and he lavished
        Tatyana with gifts and attention. Despite Strahd’s efforts, she instead fell in love with the younger, warmer
        Sergei. Strahd’s pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple’s love until the day of Sergei
        and Tatyana’s wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. Strahd murdered Sergei
        and drank his blood, sealing the evil pact between Strahd and the Dark Powers. He then chased Sergei’s
        bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. Tatyana hurled herself off a castle
        balcony to escape Strahd’s pursuit, plunging to her death. Treacherous castle guards, seizing the opportunity to
        rid the world of Strahd forever, shot their master with arrows.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2515314f-682f-4885-b4b5-2beb46d3fe9e">But Strahd did not die. The Dark Powers honored the
        pact they had made. The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red. He had become a
        vampire.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4b97a4a6-acca-4631-a9f1-ab4196a51281">After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces
        of his father and mother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. He had destroyed the
        family bloodline and doomed all of Barovia. The castle and the valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane
        surrounded on all sides by deadly fog. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a5e789ca-86a1-4197-a471-e5906398bf48">Strahd has been the master of Ravenloft for
        centuries now. Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consorts—none as beloved as Tatyana, but each a
        person of beauty. All of them he turned into vampire spawn. Although he feeds on the hapless souls of Barovia,
        they provide little nourishment and no comfort. From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to
        his domain, to play the vampire’s game of cat-and-mouse. Strahd savors these moments, for though these strangers
        offer him no lands to conquer, they aren’t so easily destroyed and therefore provide a welcome diversion.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a2ed5045-b8ed-4ce0-b594-136f2eee2a57">Strahd believes that the key to his escaping Barovia
        lies in finding someone worthy to rule in his stead, but his arrogance are so indomitable that no one is ever
        good enough in his eyes. He believes in his cold heart that only a von Zarovich as great as he or his father
        could sway the Dark Powers to release him.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6a8e2d1e-3cca-401e-a04f-9bfe67eaddfa">Strahd has the following goals in the adventure.</p>
    <h4 id="TurnIreenaKolyana" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor"
        data-content-chunk-id="a4b5a4db-8c73-4535-bef2-86bf8af7927c"><a href="#TurnIreenaKolyana"
            data-content-chunk-id="19a0b238-1faa-45ce-89b1-f1b4b606322d"></a>Turn Ireena Kolyana</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a69c2d97-71e4-459e-96cc-26727f138c5c">Strahd’s unrequited love for Tatyana drove him to
        slay his brother, Sergei. Some time ago, Strahd glimpsed the young woman Ireena Kolyana in the village of
        Barovia and felt extreme déjà vu. Ireena looked exactly like Tatyana! Strahd now believes that Ireena is the
        latest reincarnation of Tatyana, and thus he seeks to claim her.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="acac6d79-bdc8-40f5-bdf5-5ff4c051232b">Strahd’s evil courtship has led him to visit Ireena
        twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her home—the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of
        the village of Barovia—and drank her blood. He intends to kill Ireena during their next meeting and turn her
        into his vampire spawn consort.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1b4e1239-1f9d-4666-857d-fa81298baefc"><a

        where to find her in the village of Barovia.</p>
    <h4 id="FindRudolphvanRichten" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor"

            data-content-chunk-id="70d90108-edb6-44db-b25a-b601bde45d95"></a>Find Rudolph van Richten</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="418200ed-77f2-46b8-a778-463188add4cc">Although he is usually focused on making Ireena
        Kolyana his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named Rudolph van
        Richten has come to Barovia. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless,
        the vampire has his spies searching Barovia for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire
        hunter, lock him in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and slowly break his spirit.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bb2c1d67-499d-4964-9b28-0d4b6c51535c"><a

            data-content-chunk-id="8f3fb809-d544-4f19-86bb-a46fea273213"></a>Search for a Successor or Consort</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="be0c2829-bd6e-4943-9df2-e36c72b52beb">Strahd can sense the arrival of new blood in his
        domain. When newcomers enter Barovia, he shifts his attention from Ireena Kolyana and van Richten to his new
        guests so that he can determine whether any of them is worthy to be his successor or consort. (Eventually, he
        decides that none of them can replace him as master of Barovia, but he doesn’t arrive at this conclusion
        immediately.)</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4c5d50cd-c737-410a-a940-ff68cdf08742">Strahd pays close attention to adventurers who are
        charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If
        they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is
        piqued—even more so if the character displays uncommon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to
        succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.</p>
    <h3 id="RoleplayingStrahd" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor"

            data-content-chunk-id="5215fa9e-7163-473b-8c78-a9380cec3705"></a>Roleplaying Strahd</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2137eee0-c063-48bd-b5e0-57a3314e3597">Strahd believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels
        neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn’t suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He
        believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b38e73f2-f86c-468d-a2ed-9fbe790bef9c">When he was alive, Strahd could admit to letting his
        emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a
        hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the
        death of Tatyana, but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn’t have
        been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c4119931-42ea-40a4-aa74-70bd9792223d">In life, Strahd lived to conquer. In undeath, he
        conquers still—not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won’t
        yield. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd’s humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little
        humanity left in him. If they ask Strahd why he’s preying on Ireena Kolyana, he tells them that Ireena’s body is
        the host for Tatyana’s soul, and Tatyana’s soul belongs to him.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="32a4a7e7-880a-40be-9cc0-96dee18877c9">Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses
        to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse Strahd for a
        time—playthings to possess or discard as he desires.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c9d13c8d-92b8-4242-adfe-bc02aa0b866b">If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of
        adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help
        one at the expense of another. If Strahd senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to
        turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping Strahd destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately,
        Strahd doesn’t honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.</p>
    <h3 id="WhenStrahdAttacks" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="bcfb600f-b225-4d64-9c0c-91baa4bb98d4">Strahd isn’t a villain who remains out of sight
        until the final scene. Far from it—he travels as he desires to any place in his realm or his castle, and (from
        his perspective) the more often he encounters the characters, the better. The characters can and should meet him
        multiple times before the final encounter, which most likely takes place in the location determined by the card
        reading. His combat details are available in <a title="appendix D"
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/appendix-d-monsters-and-npcs#StrahdvonZarovich"
            data-content-chunk-id="0af0b41c-d90a-4318-b4c0-ddacf7e8f4b6">appendix D</a>.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b9dd1dde-6229-4912-a688-392b1aed6068">When Strahd wants to terrorize the characters, he
        pays them a visit, either under the cloak of night or beneath overcast skies during the day. If they’re indoors,
        he tries to charm or goad a character into inviting him inside (along with his vampire spawn, if they are
        present). Strahd and his minions never attack Ireena.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7e5562e5-7081-4f56-b4c8-610f97ec78e4">These encounters are meant to test the characters,
        not kill them. After a few rounds of toying with them, Strahd and his creatures withdraw. If the characters
        retreat, Strahd is likely to allow them to flee, savoring their fear and believing he has broken them.</p>

                and jokers, and treat them as two separate decks: the common deck (the numbered cards) and the high deck
                (the face cards and jokers). </p>

            this evening. The damp, cobbled pavement glistens as the lights of street lanterns dance across the slick

            hush falls over the room. Framed by the lamp-lit fog, a form strides through the doorway. His heavy, booted
            footfalls and the jingle of his coins shatter the silence. His brightly colored clothes are draped in loose
            folds about him, and his hat hangs askew, hiding his eyes in shadows. Without hesitation, he walks up to
            your table and stands proudly in a wide stance with folded arms.</p>
        <p data-content-chunk-id="31849544-c716-492a-a32e-547586462c3d">In an accented voice he says, “I have been sent

            light. It is not advisable to travel the Svalich Woods at night!” He pulls from his tunic a sealed letter,
            addressed to all of you in beautiful flowing script. He drops the letter on the table. “Take the west road
            from here some five hours march down through the Svalich Woods. There you will find my master in Barovia.”

            strides to the bar and says to the wary barkeep, “Fill the glasses, one and all. Their throats are obviously
            parched.” He drops a purse heavy with gold on the bar. With that, he leaves.</p>

        Zhentarim is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence throughout the Forgotten Realms.
        The public face of the Black Network appears relatively benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and
        services, both legal and illicit, hoping to undercut its competitors.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b4134de9-5f4e-48e0-9731-83a20d133c0f">Members of the Zhentarim think of themselves as
        members of an extended family and rely on it for resources and security. At the same time, members are granted
        the autonomy to increase their own wealth and influence. As a whole, the Zhentarim promises “the best for the
        best,” although in truth the organization is more interested in spreading its own propaganda and influence than
        investing in the improvement of its members.</p>

        was a slice of heaven to those who knew of its existence before Strahd’s arrival. The serenity of the place was
        forever shattered when Strahd led a bloody crusade against the enemies of his family that ended here with the
        slaughter of hundreds. Struck by the scenic beauty of his most recent conquest and eager to escape the shadow of
        his father’s legacy, Strahd made the valley his home and named it Barovia after the late King Barov, his father.

        world that Strahd once tried to conquer. It now exists within a demiplane formed by Strahd’s consciousness and
        surrounded by a deadly fog. No creature can leave without Strahd’s permission, and those that try become lost in
        the mist.</p>

        please because he admires their lust for life and their willingness to serve him when he needs them. He also
        owes an ancient debt to the Vistani people. As a soldier centuries ago, he suffered a grievous injury in battle,
        and the Vistani tended his wounds and returned him safely to his family without making any demand for payment.
        The Vistani claim to possess potions that allow them to leave Strahd’s domain, but the potions are false
        concoctions with no magical power. Nevertheless, the Vistani are willing to sell them for a hefty price.</p>

        by the one they call “the devil Strahd.” Only a handful of them have the will to oppose him. Barovians
        congregate in the valley’s three main settlements—the villages of Barovia and Krezk and the town of Vallaki—for
        fear of falling prey to wolves and other beasts that prowl the woods. Among these people are the Keepers of the
        Feather, a secret society of wereravens. Not powerful enough to defeat Strahd on their own, the Keepers readily
        assist adventurers who find themselves drawn into Strahd’s domain.</p>

        sides of the mountains that enclose the valley. The largest of these peaks is Mount Baratok, with its
        snow-covered cap and rugged slopes. Baratok’s slightly smaller twin, Mount Ghakis, is mostly bald with tufts of
        trees here and there. Between these two mountains stands Lake Zarovich, which is fed by streams of ice-cold
        water pouring down the face of Mount Baratok. On the south side of the lake rests the town of Vallaki, enclosed
        by a palisade. West of the two mountains, atop a hill, stands the Abbey of Saint Markovia, around which the
        Barovians built a walled village named Krezk. Between Vallaki and Krezk lie the ruins of Argynvostholt, the
        fallen bastion of a knightly order called the Order of the Silver Dragon, wiped out by Strahd and his army. East
        of the mountains lies the village of Barovia, shrouded in mist and bereft of walls and defenses. The dark
        silhouette of Castle Ravenloft looks down on this village from its perch atop a 1,000-foot-high column of rock
        known as the Pillarstone of Ravenloft.</p>

        Barovians have a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2630c187-5da4-4833-9d08-e92107b14cee">Barovians are deeply invested in their homes and
        their traditions. They are wary of strange peoples and customs. The way Barovians deal with strangers can be
        unsettling to those newcomers. Barovians have a tendency to stare openly, in silence, thereby expressing their
        disapproval of anything that isn’t familiar to them. Barovians aren’t talkative with strangers, to the extent of
        being pointedly rude. Most Barovians have violent tempers that boil up through their customary silence when they
        are provoked. They also have a social cohesiveness (thrust upon them by their weird circumstances) that can make
        them act together against outsiders if a Barovian is mistreated.</p>

        born, they live, they age, and they die. But not all of them—only about one in every ten—have souls.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="77de17c1-f784-4f1c-9082-013c233fb6fd">When a being with a soul dies in Barovia, that soul
        remains trapped in Strahd’s domain until it is reincarnated in a newborn. It can take decades for a bodiless
        soul to find a host, and Barovians who share the same soul over generations tend to look alike. That is why
        Ireena Kolyana looks exactly like Strahd’s beloved Tatyana—both women were born with the same soul.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8fefe819-da92-42a7-a91f-fa7a7277efa1">Strahd needs loyal subjects to feed his ego.
        Barovians without souls are empty shells created by his consciousness to fill out the local population. Although
        they are physically indistinguishable from Barovians with souls, they tend to be bereft of charm and imagination
        and to be more compliant and depressed than the others. They dress in drab clothing, whereas Barovians who have
        souls wear clothes with a splash of color or individuality.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ed6b0046-1302-4890-ac67-4711ae300207">A Barovian woman, soulless or not, can give birth. A
        child born in Barovia might have a soul even if one or both parents do not. Conversely, the child of two parents
        with souls isn’t certain to have a soul of its own. Barovians without souls are maudlin folk who experience fear
        but neither laugh nor cry.</p>

        who have souls, but he can’t draw nourishment from the blood of the soulless. He can tell at a glance whether a
        Barovian has a soul or is merely a shell.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8a4dfba1-b144-4601-a377-d0ed25465998">If Strahd is defeated, the fog that surrounds
        Barovia fades away, allowing the inhabitants of the valley to leave if they wish. Only those who have souls,
        however, can truly leave this place. Soulless Barovians cease to exist as soon as they exit the valley.</p>

        Barovians are familiar with are the adventurers that Strahd has lured to his dark realm. Barovians thus react to
        nonhuman characters the same way most humans in the real world would react to elf, dwarf, or half-orc
        adventurers suddenly walking the streets. Most such outsiders are scorned, feared, or shunned.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="cba2ede4-c847-40fe-9e9b-184c2d04e325">The Vistani (singular: Vistana) are wanderers,
        traveling about in horse-drawn, barrel-topped wagons, which they build themselves. Compared to Barovians, they
        are flamboyant, dressing in bright clothes and laughing often. As much as they feel at home in Strahd’s dreary
        land, they know they can leave it whenever they please and aren’t damned to spend eternity there.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="409b00c9-8daa-4d64-8ae0-e06fc002c217">Vistani are silversmiths, coppersmiths,
        haberdashers, cooks, weavers, musicians, entertainers, storytellers, toolmakers, and horse traders. They also
        earn money by telling fortunes and selling information. They spend whatever they earn to support a lavish
        lifestyle, display their wealth openly as a sign of prosperity, and share their good fortune with family and
        friends.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="79159325-f790-4d44-a916-282e8d98e5fe">Each family or clan of Vistani is its own little
        gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder carries the bulk of the responsibility for
        enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group’s travels, and preserving the Vistani
        way of life. Vistani elders make all the important decisions, but whether by choice or because of their age,
        tend to speak in cryptic, flowing riddles.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a509ebdd-4cca-471c-90ef-0c3a59f375b7">Vistani families and clans are closely knit. They
        resolve disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling. The
        Vistani are quick to act when their lives or traditions are threatened and are merciless when they believe they
        must be.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b2a5c187-78d5-414b-be46-c583218abeb1">During one of Strahd’s military campaigns, years
        before he became a vampire, a group of Vistani rescued him after he was wounded in battle. These Vistani not
        only nursed Strahd back to health but also delivered him safely home. As a reward for their generosity, Strahd
        declared that all Vistani had the right to come and go from his land as they please, and this privilege extends
        to the present day. Thus, Vistani can travel freely through the fog that surrounds Barovia, without fear of harm
        or entrapment.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5e339999-b426-423d-9e50-2292d7c1c7a2">Strahd honors his debt to the Vistani in part
        because he envies the Vistani way of life—the freedom they have to go where they please, their devotion to
        family, and their festive spirit. The courtesy he shows them is not simply a matter of honor but is also born
        from his admiration of them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d84d6f8a-2691-427e-97a3-6750477a59e6">In the centuries since Strahd became a vampire, many
        Vistani have allowed themselves to be corrupted by Strahd, to the extent that they consider him their king.
        Vistani who serve Strahd are less lively and friendly than normal Vistani, and their hearts are poisoned with
        dark intentions. Strahd uses them to lure adventurers into his domain and keep him informed about the events
        occurring in lands beyond his reach. These Vistani will lie to protect the vampire, and they fear the
        consequences of disobeying him.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="29575dfd-c152-430b-b810-e2c1497896d7">When it comes to sharing information about their
        dark master, Strahd’s Vistani pretend to be helpful, but the information they impart is misleading at best and
        often deceptive. They readily tell adventurers that they have a potion that protects them from the deadly fog
        that surrounds Barovia. Although this is a lie, they attempt to sell their fake potion for as much money as they
        can get.</p>

        <li data-content-chunk-id="55780cb0-820a-4355-ad0c-6aabb3461d53">Strahd comes from a royal bloodline. He died
            centuries ago yet endures as one of the undead, feasting on the blood of the living. Barovians refer to him
            as “the devil Strahd.”</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="3733fd56-17e9-45f1-872e-5f2c56f3bf3f">Strahd has taken many consorts, but he has
            known only one true love: a Barovian peasant girl named Tatyana. (The Vistani don’t know what happened to
            her.)</li>

            named it after his father, King Barov. Strahd uses wolves, bats, and other creatures to spy on all of his
            realm.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="6e37a875-5177-4239-bc13-3ec92236591c">Barovians are simple, frightened people. Some
            have old souls, but many do not. The soulless ones are easy to spot, for they know nothing but fear. They
            have no charm, hope, or spark, and they don’t cry.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="3980ebca-2207-4ccb-9100-4ebb257ac938">The Old Svalich Road passes through Strahd’s
            domain. Three settlements lie on the road like beads on a string: Krezk to the west, Vallaki in the heart of
            the valley, and Barovia to the east. Strahd has spies in each settlement.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="4919d9da-80e1-4d98-8492-983605c50fbd">There’s an old windmill on the road between the
            village of Barovia and the town of Vallaki. It should be avoided at all costs! (The Vistani refuse to say
            more.)</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="84c95cd7-31b0-4c17-b60d-c64295e5e4f9">It is wise to stick to the road. Wild druids,

        <li data-content-chunk-id="23b0cb36-6656-427f-bf81-1d7ee47e82a2">Some Vistani women are blessed with prescience.
            Of all the great Vistani fortune-tellers, none compares to Madam Eva. If knowledge of the future is what you
            seek, Madam Eva will tell you your fate.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="81242e23-9f77-418f-a717-f2b2c7f0deff">A prescient Vistana can’t see her own future or
            the future of another Vistana. It is the burden of the Vistani’s great gift that their own fates can’t be
            divined.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="30974514-072c-494e-a158-6ec17b62db2d">Vistani curses are potent, but they are invoked
            with great caution. Vistani know that to curse one who is undeserving of such punishment can have grave
            consequences for the one who utters such a curse.</li>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="06bbedb3-1a7f-46b6-99b6-06b21128f407">The curse is a repayment for an injustice or a
        slight. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the curse. The saving throw DC is 8 + the
        Vistana’s proficiency bonus + the Vistana’s Charisma modifier. The curse lasts until ended with a <a

        <li data-content-chunk-id="fa676e38-eaac-4f7a-b8f0-5bada7e94043">The target’s appearance changes in a sinister
            yet purely cosmetic way. For example, the curse can place a scar on the target’s face, turn the target’s
            teeth into yellow fangs, or give the target bad breath. When this curse ends, the Vistana it takes 1d6
            psychic damage.</li>

        <p>STRAHD'S SPIES</p>
        <p>As the undisputed master of Barovia, Strahd has many spies, from swarms of bats to wandering Vistani, who
            report to him at dawn and dusk each day. These agents constantly patrol the land of Barovia and report
            everything they see to him. </p>
        <p>Every day and night that the characters remain in Barovia, one or more of the vampire’s spies check on them
            and attempt to return to Strahd with a report. When a spy appears, characters who have a passive Wisdom (<a
                class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills"
                data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) score equal to or greater than the spy’s

            encounter if the characters are unaware of its presence. If they do notice it, the spy’s goal is usually
            escape, not combat. A secondary goal for a spy might be to acquire some physical object—a possession, an
            article of clothing, or even some part of a character’s body such as a lock of hair—that Strahd can use to
            improve the efficacy of his <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2239-scrying"
                data-tooltip-href="/spells/2239-tooltip">scrying</a> spell. If one of Strahd’s spies is confronted by
            the party, the spy attempts to grab some accessible item from a character before fleeing. If Strahd acquires
            such an item, he uses his <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2239-scrying"
                data-tooltip-href="/spells/2239-tooltip">scrying</a> spell to learn as much as he can about the party
            before planning his next attack, and to verify what his spies have already told him.</p>

        <p><strong>THE LANDS OF BAROVIA: COMMON FEATURES</strong></p>
        <p>Unless the text says otherwise, the following rules apply to doors, secret doors, locks, and webs in these
            lands. </p>
        <p><em><strong>Doors. </strong></em>A wooden door can be forced open with a successful DC 10 Strength check, or
            DC 15 if the door is barred or reinforced in some other manner. Increase the DC by 5 if the door is made of
            stone, or by 10 if it is made of iron. Decrease the DC by 5 if the door is made of glass or amber, or if the
            door is weakened in some manner (such as by rot or corrosion). </p>
        <p><em><strong>Secret Doors.</strong></em> If there are obvious clues to a secret door’s presence, such as
            scratch marks on a nearby wall or footprints leading to it, a character with a passive Wisdom (<a
                class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills"
                data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) score of 15 or higher notices the secret door.
            Otherwise, finding a secret door requires a search of the area and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a
                class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills"
                data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check. </p>
        <p><em><strong>Locks.</strong></em> A creature proficient with thieves’ tools can use them to pick a typical
            lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A typical padlock can be broken by smashing it with a
            bludgeoning or slashing weapon and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check. </p>
        <p><em><strong>Webs.</strong></em> Characters can pass through ordinary webs, including thick cobwebs, without
            fear of being <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip"

        <p>A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly
            where you’re standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of Barovia
            against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse.
            “When the vampire appeared, the wizard’s peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were
            never seen again.</p>
        <p>“The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to
            a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and
            great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck
            the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard’s magic
            couldn’t save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for
            the wizard’s body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River Ivlis had already spirited

        through. He is also happy to make a profit from any strangers unlucky enough to find themselves here. He serves
        his own interests and offers no sanctuary. He never bargains since, as he says, “If you want it badly enough,
        you’ll pay for it.” He has no competition in the village.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5320a1f0-eb40-4fcb-add7-5efffd5a488d">If the characters give Bildrath a hard time, he

        doesn’t carry a shield (AC 14). Parriwimple’s real name is Parpol Cantemir, but no one in the village calls him
        that. His muscles rippling beneath his leather tunic should give ample notice of his strength. At the same time,
        Parriwimple is simple-minded. He is devoted to his uncle and will not follow the characters as long as Bildrath

    <aside class="read-aloud-text">A single shaft of light thrusts illumination into the main square, its brightness

    <p data-content-chunk-id="0eb4cc15-5f07-47cb-8559-b0660c93b94f">The tavern building is about 60 feet square. Close
        inspection of the sign reveals that it originally read “Blood of the Vine.” (An “n” has been scratched over with
        the “f.”) This once finely appointed tavern has grown shoddy over the years. A blazing fire in the hearth gives
        scant warmth to the few huddled souls within. They include the barkeep, three Vistani sitting together, and a
        man named Ismark Kol­yanovich—who happens to be the son of the village burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich.</p>

        table, sipping his wine. Other villagers call him “Ismark the Lesser” because he has lived in the shadow of his
        father for most of his life.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="81ee2396-851e-46e8-a16b-2f405d83e2e4">Ismark isn’t a typically dour Barovian. He invites
        the characters to join him, offers to pay for their wine, and asks for their aid in protecting his adopted
        sister, Ireena Kolyana. If they agree to help, he takes them to the burgomaster’s residence (<a title="area E4"
            href="#E4BurgomastersMansion" data-content-chunk-id="35e9d021-3f76-408b-bf02-c11f0b9231f2">area E4</a>). He
        wants the characters to help him escort Ireena to Vallaki, a settlement in the heart of the valley, beyond the
        view of Castle Ravenloft and (he hopes) beyond the reach of Strahd. Ismark knows that moving Ireena is a gamble,
        since she’s vulnerable to Strahd when she is outside their home, but he has heard assertions that Vallaki is
        well-defended.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eaf60023-dc9d-4c14-8dde-e4f791475cee">Ismark is as tight-lipped as any of the other
        Barovian villagers, unless the talk deals with Ireena or Strahd. Ismark knows everything the other villagers
        know. He also knows that, for some unknown reason, Strahd is attracted to Ireena and desires her above all
        others.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="71b8003f-8eba-4960-8dfa-a28ee0c05de7">If you used the “Plea for Help” adventure hook and
        the characters show Ismark the letter they received, he knows the burgomaster’s handwriting well enough to
        confirm that the letter was not written by his father.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d50ed251-293c-4e65-b350-cbda09720124">Ismark has spent most of his adult life training
        with weapons in the hope of one day confronting and killing the Strahd. If the characters suggest that he
        accompany them, Ismark agrees provided that Ireena is first taken to a place of safety. As long as Ismark
        accompanies the characters, he acts as a party member for the purpose of determining each character’s share of
        experience points (though he gains no experience points himself).</p>

        the house itself. Yet, against the walls, the growth has been tramped down to create a path all about the
        domain. Heavy claw markings have stripped the once-beautiful finish of the walls. Great black marks tell of the

        town of Vallaki (pronounced vah-<em>lah</em>-key) seems like a safe haven against the evils of the Svalich
        Woods, if not Strahd himself. The town lies beyond the sight of Castle Ravenloft and doesn’t, at first blush,
        seem as depressed (or oppressed) as the village of Barovia farther east. Characters who spend time in Vallaki,
        however, quickly realize that there is no happiness here, only false hope—which Strahd himself cultivates.</p>
    <figure class="compendium-image" id="Figure"><a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-left"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="59be2771-543d-4f5f-b0c7-5c292ee6d3cb">Vallaki was founded not long after Strahd’s armies
        conquered the valley by an ancestor of the town’s current burgomaster, Baron Vargas Vallakovich. The
        Vallakoviches have royal blood in their veins and have long believed themselves superior to the Zarovich line.
        Baron Vallakovich has deluded himself into believing that hope and happiness are the keys to Vallaki’s
        salvation. If he can make everyone in Vallaki happy, the burgomaster thinks that the town will somehow escape
        Strahd’s grasp and return to the forgotten world whence it came. He stages one festival after another to bolster
        the spirits of the townsfolk, but most Vallakians consider these festivals to be pointless, meaningless affairs
        more likely to incur Strahd’s wrath than to provide any hope for the future.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="24cd15de-8a22-4743-af1c-d1c885d35bb3">In the last festival, Baron Vallakovich had
        townsfolk parade through the streets with the severed heads of wolves on pikes. His next event, which the
        burgomaster has dubbed the Festival of the Blazing Sun, is soon to get under way (see the “<a
            title="Special Events" href="#SpecialEvents"
            data-content-chunk-id="29dd7213-80bd-4fc8-900d-c5990ba5a47b">Special Events</a>” section at the end of this
        chapter). Weatherworn garlands from previous festivals still hang from the eaves of Vallaki’s buildings, and
        work has begun on a large wicker sun, to be set ablaze in the town square on the day of the festival. In the
        days leading up to the festival, Baron Vallakovich has begun arresting local malcontents and throwing them in
        the stocks so that his efforts aren’t ruined by “those of little hope or faith.”</p>

            watched over by dark, brooding mountains to the north and south. The woods recede, revealing a sullen

        But now the church is at risk because someone broke into the crypt a few nights ago and stole the bones. Until
        recently, Father Lucian was the only person in Vallaki who knew about the bones, but he recalls mentioning them
        to Yeska over a month ago to put the fearful boy at ease. After the bones were stolen, Father Lucian asked Yeska

        Lucian has not reported the theft for fear of the distress that the news might cause, and he doesn’t want to
        ruin the burgomaster’s festival. If the party includes a good-aligned cleric or paladin, Father Lucian mentions
        the theft in the hope that the characters can provide assistance.</p>

        asks them if they would be so kind as to find out what’s holding up the latest shipment, promising them free
        room and board if they return with the wine.</p>

        they know the woods and valley well. They’re willing to serve as guides for 5 gp per day, or to provide
        directions to important landmarks in exchange for free drinks. They think it’s foolish to travel “this cursed
        realm” at night and won’t do so unless their payment is exorbitant (100 gp or more).</p>

        his bow for every wolf he’s killed, while Yevgeni adds a new swatch to his wolfskin cloak every time he makes a
        kill. Both men have families but spend most of their time together, either drowning their sorrows or hunting in
        the woods. Most of the wolf heads that adorn the tavern walls are the result of their handiwork.</p>

        she reads to her “book club,” which is made up of the most fanatical group members. Inspired by her words, these
        zealots have created smaller cults of their own. Once her cult has enough members, Fiona plans to take the town
        by force. To reward her most loyal followers, she has her pet imp stand invisibly in the center of a pentagram,
        then performs a false ritual that calls upon “princes of darkness” to lavish their appreciation upon the
        cultists. The imp then sprinkles onto the floor a few electrum coins, which Lady Wachter allows the cultists to
        keep.</p>

        “dyeliver” it to him, in exchange for which Blinsky offers to make them any toy they desire. Because “byusiness”
        has not been good, he says, he has no other reward to offer except, perhaps, his new monkey companion.</p>

        this camp all serve Strahd. The elders have died, leaving a pair of brothers named Luvash and Arrigal in charge.
        Both men are evil and willing to do whatever Strahd demands of them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1b227b49-8337-4159-9cd4-21f50b573da3">These Vistani have two problems. First, Luvash’s
        seven-year-old daughter, Arabelle, recently disappeared from the camp. Consequently, half of the Vistani are out
        searching for her when the characters arrive. Second, the Vistani have exhausted their supply of wine and are
        eager to obtain more. Characters who help them with either problem earn the Vistani’s respect.</p>

        hair, but otherwise they are similar to <a title="wood elves"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c8db4b13-ca17-4b8e-a719-ae07a7728434">The dusk elves reside in small homes built into the
        hillside and are mostly self-sufficient. They are skilled trackers, and many of them are away from camp when the
        characters arrive, helping the Vistani search for Arabelle. Strahd has tasked the Vistani with keeping an eye on
        the dusk elves, and the dusk elves know they aren’t safe in Barovia without the Vistani’s “protection.” Strahd
        has also forbidden the Vistani from helping the dusk elves escape his domain.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2a78ad6b-46e0-4fb5-a186-8f93e6b567ff">There are no women or children among the dusk elves.
        Strahd had all the female dusk elves put to death around four centuries ago as a punishment for Patrina’s
        murder. Thus, the remaining elves can’t procreate. A broken people, they are aware of the vampire’s absolute
        hold over the land of Barovia. They keep a low profile and have no desire to incur Strahd’s wrath again.</p>

        Kasimir informs the characters that the secret to breaking Strahd’s pact and freeing Barovia from its curse
        might be hidden there. Kasimir doesn’t know whether this claim is true or not, but he states it as a way of

        look like Barovian women — a frumpy mother and her two homely daughters — the hags snatch children, devour them,
        and use the windmill’s grindstone to crush their little bones into powder. This powder is a key ingredient in

        can no longer afford the hag’s dream pastries, the hags offer to trade their pastries for the Barovians’
        children, thus preying on the adults’ selfishness while acquiring the ingredients they need to make more
        pastries. This is how the hags sow corruption in Strahd’s domain and why they don’t take the children by force.
        The hags are interested only in children who have souls. They prick each child with a needle; if the child
        cries, that’s a sign that the infant has a soul.</p>

        for dream pastries. The boy, Freek, is seven years old. The girl, Myrtle, is barely five. Their crates are full
        of crumbs, as the hags are fattening them up. If freed, neither child wants to go home, because of what their

        erected centuries ago by the valley’s original human inhabitants. Each moss-covered stone bears a crude carving
        of a city, each of which is associated with a different season. The city of winter is shown covered with snow,
        the city of spring is arrayed in flowers, the city of summer has a sunburst overhead, and the city of autumn is
        covered with leaves. If the characters ask any of the priests or scholarly NPCs in Barovia about the stones, the
        characters are told that ancient legends tell of the Four Cities, said to be the cities of paradise where the
        Morninglord, Mother Night, and the other ancient gods first dwelled.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1a0c42a8-b33b-4242-8d82-a4a155ff60a4">Several ravens circle overhead, and one pecks at
        something on top of the stone that depicts the city of autumn. Upon inspection, the characters see the raven is
        pecking at a dream pastry, and on the ground in the center of the stone circle is a small pile of children’s
        teeth. The hags placed these here to desecrate the stones and as an offering to the entity they worship, the
        wicked archfey Ceithlenn of the Crooked Teeth.</p>

        ago, determined to annihilate them, the last thing he expected to encounter was a silver dragon.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="26988837-1ebc-4333-8891-88feb1d9591f">The dragon, who called himself Argyn­vost, had come
        to the valley years earlier in the guise of a nobleman named Lord Argynvost. The dragon didn’t lair in the
        valley solely because of its idyllic beauty. He knew of a place called the Amber Temple — a repository of evil
        power guarded by the forces of good. Argynvost wanted to make sure that whatever was trapped inside the Amber
        Temple wouldn’t be allowed to escape, so he built his fortified mansion, Argynvostholt, close by.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1f17f227-6be8-4309-bb15-1baa0e56e7e2">Like many silver dragons, Argynvost was
        extraordinarily wealthy, and he was comfortable living among humans while disguised as one of them. He used his
        resources to attract other champions of good, and valorous knights flocked to the valley to join Lord
        Argynvost’s prestigious Order of the Silver Dragon. Only those who were initiated into the order were told of
        Lord Argynvost’s true nature.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ec959e4e-6618-49a4-ac81-fc5c66d2e1e9">During the war between Strahd and his foes, the
        Order of the Silver Dragon drove away malefactors searching for the Amber Temple. It also sheltered Strahd’s
        enemies and proved more than a match for Strahd’s battle-weary soldiers. But the early victories of the order
        didn’t win the war. Even with Argynvost on their side, the knights were ultimately overwhelmed when Strahd’s
        reinforcements swept into the valley. Those forces slew the last of the knights and battled the dragon inside
        Argynvostholt. After the dragon was slain, Strahd had its corpse hacked to pieces, stripped to the bone, and
        transported to Castle Ravenloft as a trophy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ff4f9227-7825-4b16-8358-eb02850d49a2">Since the dragon’s death, Argynvostholt has become a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b6b6a69d-6320-4c53-99d9-54305bf17203">The death of Argynvost enraged the spirit of
        Vladimir Horngaard, the greatest of the dragon’s knights. Horngaard returned as a revenant and swore to avenge
        the destruction of the order. His zeal was so great that it also brought back the spirits of several other
        knights, who rose as revenants under Vladimir’s command.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8779e223-9bec-4fd0-893d-2dc5000e2b57">The vengeful revenants killed many of Strahd’s
        soldiers, and whenever the undead knights were cut down, their spirits found new corpses to inhabit. Though the
        knights were grossly outnumbered, they waged war for months and slew hundreds of foes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3acdce5e-eaf2-4483-864d-b32dfb380170">When Strahd died and became a vampire, Vladimir’s
        knights should have gone to their everlasting rest, but their spirits couldn’t leave Strahd’s domain. They
        marched to Castle Ravenloft and were confronted by the Vistani seer Madam Eva, who told them Strahd had died,
        only to become a prisoner in his own land, tormented by the death of his beloved Tatyana and the murder of his
        brother Sergei.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="33562e2c-ac57-419e-8289-8572d49a985d">After receiving that news, Vladimir ceased his
        advance and led his knights back to Argynvostholt. He realized that Strahd had already died and been damned to a
        hell of his own creation. With nowhere else to go and nothing else to do, Vladimir set his knights to killing
        Strahd’s agents and anyone else who might help to ease Strahd’s torment. Consumed by hatred, the knights have
        lost their honor and nobility. Their redemption hinges on whether Vladimir can set aside that hatred. The undead
        knight can be found brooding in the ruins of Argynvostholt.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7b6df579-b3c9-4ddd-8488-bfc0c5979328">The spirit of the dragon Argynvost isn’t at rest,
        either. It can sense that the knights have been corrupted, and it reaches out to the characters, hoping they
        will help the knights find peace. If the characters retrieve the dragon’s skull from Castle Ravenloft and place
        it in the mausoleum of Argynvostholt, the dragon’s spirit ascends to the highest tower of the mansion and
        transforms into a beacon of light that flashes across Barovia. The light of the beacon reminds Vladimir
        Horngaard of what he has lost, enabling him and his fellow knights to let go of their hatred and find both
        redemption and rest.</p>

            achieve its revenge before its body crumbles to dust and its soul enters the afterlife. In Barovia, however,
            a revenant can remain in its body indefinitely, and once it has reaped its vengeance, its soul remains
            trapped in Barovia. </p>
        <p>If the body of a revenant is destroyed before its vengeance is fulfilled, its spirit seeks out a new corpse
            or skeleton to animate. To determine where the revenant’s new body rises, roll a d20 and consult the
            following table.</p>

        never venture away from the village. Within their walls, they grow trees that provide ample wood to keep them
        warm on cold nights, and they draw water from a blessed pool. They have chickens, hares, and small pigs, as well
        as gardens of beets and turnips. The only thing they depend on from the outside world is wine. The burgomaster,
        Dmitri Krezkov, comes from a noble family and regularly has wine delivered from the nearby winery, the Wizard of

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2a2537e8-b6dc-4ba5-8e88-d17cfb5b7f24">Looming high above Krezk is the Abbey of Saint
        Markovia, once a convent and hospital, now a madhouse overrun with wickedness. After Saint Markovia and her
        followers failed to overthrow Strahd, the abbey became a fortress closed off from the rest of the world. Strahd
        ruthlessly preyed on the fears of the clerics and nuns holed up inside, but ultimately it was their isolation
        and greed that doomed them. The clergy began fighting over food and wine. By the time their supplies ran out,
        they had either been killed by each other’s hands or driven hopelessly insane by Strahd’s acts of terror against
        them. For years afterward, the villagers of Krezk avoided the place, fearing that the abbey was cursed, haunted,
        or both.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d63baa07-d07b-44f9-9d06-3f16801d5fb5">Then, over a century ago, a pilgrim from a distant
        land came to Krezk and insisted that he be allowed to reopen the abbey. The nameless man was strikingly handsome
        and extremely persuasive, and the villagers couldn’t help but do as he commanded. Eternally young, he presides
        over the abbey to this day, and locals refer to him simply as the Abbot. Many villagers suspect that the Abbot
        is Strahd in disguise, for they’ve heard stories about Strahd appearing in other guises. The truth, however, is
        even more disturbing.</p>

        blood, but before she could be turned into a vampire, the burgomaster of Berez, Lazlo Ulrich, with the aid of a
        local priest named Brother Grigor, killed Marina to save her soul from damnation. Enraged, Strahd slew the
        priest and the burgomaster, then used his power over the land to swell the river, flooding the village and
        forcing the residents to flee. Later the marsh crept in, preventing the villagers from returning. Berez has

    <aside class="read-aloud-text">Toward the south end of the village lie the remains of a mansion built on higher
        ground. It has been reduced to piles of stone and rotting timber. Empty, arched windows stare at you. South of
        the ruin, an untamed garden runs rampant, surrounded by broken walls that are no longer able to contain it. East
        of the ruin, someone has erected a crude wooden fence, forming a circular yard in which several goats are
        penned. Surmounting the fence posts are human skulls.</aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7b0d689d-fa08-4a80-b876-bbf2b800ff78">The ruined mansion is littered with the rotted
        remains of furniture and decor. The last burgomaster of Berez, Lazlo Ulrich, haunts the ruin as a <a
            class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16871-ghost"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16871-tooltip">ghost</a>. If the characters search the mansion, the ghost
        appears before them:</p>
    <aside class="read-aloud-text">A ghost takes shape in the fog, assuming the form of a giant of a man, his features
        mutilated and his entrails hanging out like frayed ropes. Despite its intimidating presence, the apparition has
        a cringing light in its eyes. “Why do you invade my home? Begone, I beseech you!”</aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ba9bdcbf-36a9-4b05-bc76-af02448a88f9">Strahd refuses to let Burgomaster Ulrich’s spirit
        find rest because of what he did to poor Marina. The ghost recounts Marina’s sad tale if prompted. Only by
        convincing Ulrich that Marina has been reborn in the form of Ireena Kolyana can the characters put the tortured
        spirit to rest. The ghost must see Ireena in the flesh, and it can’t travel beyond the confines of the crumbled
        mansion.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dd62a95d-e3f3-42cc-9b34-e1368a17737b">Ulrich’s ghost is neutral good. It attacks if
        threatened or if the characters begin searching the ruined mansion for treasure. If the ghost is reduced to 0
        hit points, it re-forms after 24 hours. The characters receive experience points for the ghost only if they lay
        Ulrich’s spirit to rest, not if they defeat the ghost in combat.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="054b0737-3043-4fce-850a-1e33aad10b75">If your card reading reveals that a treasure is
        hidden in Berez, Ulrich’s ghost points the characters to the treasure’s true location, saying these words as it
        fades away:</p>
    <aside class="read-aloud-text">“Travel west. Two hundred paces from the mansion lies a monument to my folly and the
        treasure you seek.”</aside>

        staircase that leads down to an intact cellar. A single character can clear the rubble in 4 hours, and multiple
        characters working together can reduce the time proportionately. The cellar is a 30-foot-square room with
        mortared stone walls, a 10-foot-high ceiling supported by wooden beams, and a floor submerged under 3 inches of
        stagnant water. The cellar contains two dozen empty, rotted casks from the Wizard of Wines winery. Each cask is

        a hill giant’s skull that Baba Lysaga has hollowed out and transformed into a vehicle. It hovers in place until
        Baba Lysaga commands it to fly, which she can do only while inside it. It has a flying speed of 40 feet. No one
        else can control the skull. A creature inside the skull has three-quarters cover against attacks made from

    <aside class="read-aloud-text">The hut is fifteen feet on a side and packed with old furniture, including a wooden
        cot, a wicker cabinet, a slender wardrobe, a wooden table, a stool, a barrel-topped wooden chest reinforced with
        brass bands, and an iron tub stained with blood. In the middle of the room is a ghastly wooden crib with a
        small, angelic child sitting in it. All the furnishings except for the crib are bolted to the floor. Beneath the
        crib, green light seeps up through cracks between the rotting floorboards.</aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e4f5a416-0423-411a-ac14-5b0d2c54bbc3">The child and the crib are illusions created by Baba

            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2218-tooltip">programmed illusion</a> spell. Baba Lysaga refers to the child as
        “Strahd” and created the illusion out of madness, because she considers herself a protective mother.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a18e00e7-0325-4d53-ad47-001fadf4648c">Beneath the hut’s rotting floorboards is a
        3-foot-deep cavity containing the magic, green-glowing gem that Baba Lysaga took from the Wizard of the Wines
        winery. This gem animates the hut (see “<a title="The Creeping Hut" href="#CreepingHut"

        section below). The floorboards can be ripped up or smashed with a successful DC 14 Strength check. Characters
        can also break through the floor by dealing 10 damage to it. The hut doesn’t give up the gemstone easily,
        however (see “<a title="Baba Lysaga’s Creeping Hut"

        about the druids of Yester Hill, specifically how they turned away from their ancient beliefs to worship the
        devil Strahd. Muriel knows that the druids visit the circle of standing stones from time to time, and she does

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c0366164-22ed-4a20-960b-1591303ccc39">This ring of menhirs is one of the oldest structures
        in the Balinok Mountains — older than the Amber Temple, and much older than Castle Ravenloft and the various
        Barovian settlements scattered throughout the valley. The menhirs were raised by the same ancient folk who
        carved the megaliths near Old Bonegrinder (see <a title="chapter 6"
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/old-bonegrinder"
            data-content-chunk-id="b1baf01e-a62a-4cdd-8599-afcfe5e711fb">chapter 6</a>). Characters who have seen those
        megaliths can, with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check, discern rudimentary similarities between those stones
        and the menhirs arranged here.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2d43152a-a08c-467d-aac6-0d5fa5a1ee06">The circle is 100 feet across, and the menhirs are
        spaced apart at regular intervals. The stones located to the north, west, south, and east are taller than the
        other eight stones, which have weatherworn glyphs carved into them that represent different animals. Characters
        who inspect the smaller menhirs can discern the following animal shapes carved into them: bear, elk, hawk, goat,
        owl, panther, raven, and wolf.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e678ec72-56c6-405a-8162-8f7e86b2de14">The standing stones are nonmagical. However, druid
        characters who enter the circle can sense that powerful gods once blessed this site, and that it still holds
        some measure of power. They can also sense one of its properties, namely that creatures within the circle can’t
        be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ab7f1543-1cf0-4c03-b669-e8409f33374d">The circle has another property that druid
        characters can’t sense but might discover when they use the Wild Shape feature within the circle’s confines. Any
        druid that uses the Wild Shape feature within the circle gains the maximum number of hit points available to the
        new form. For example, a druid character using the Wild Shape feature to assume the form of a giant eagle would
        have 44 (4d10 + 4) hit points while in that form.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0e8c2284-c366-4227-ac79-5b30ab3f7840">At your discretion, the circle might have other
        strange properties that have been forgotten over time. Although she knows something of the circle’s history,
        Muriel is unaware of its properties.</p>

        becoming a lich. He returned to his tower and was able to complete the transformation. Some years later, after
        Strahd became a vampire, Khazan paid a visit to Castle Ravenloft with the notion of challenging Strahd for
        rulership of Barovia. Instead, much to Khazan’s surprise, Strahd persuaded him to serve as an advisor in matters
        of magic. When not advising Strahd, the lich spent most of his time in the Amber Temple, trying to master the
        secret of demilichdom in the hope of finding a way to magically project his spirit beyond the confines of
        Strahd’s realm. His efforts failed, and Khazan destroyed himself. His remains lie entombed in the catacombs of
        Ravenloft.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bcd530b7-9369-4736-bb67-9d064a736260">Khazan’s tower stood empty for ages, it seemed, and
        would have collapsed under the weight of neglect were it not for the magic wards placed on it long ago.
        Recently, the tower was taken over by the legendary vampire hunter Rudolph van Richten, who used it as a base
        from which to explore Barovia. He has since relocated to the nearby town of Vallaki, where he hides in plain
        sight.</p>

        protégé, Ezmerelda d’Avenir, who has taken to living in the tower while she searches for her mentor. She isn’t
        present when the characters arrive, however.</p>

            tower on it. The tower is old and decrepit, with collapsing scaffolds clinging to one side where a large

        from wires like ornaments along the wagon’s interior walls. A creature within 30 feet of the wagon when it
        explodes must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) fire damage on a failed save, or
        half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures inside the wagon or within 5 feet of it have disadvantage on
        the saving throw. The wagon is reduced to flinders by the explosion, and the contents of the wagon (see

        disabling the trap causes lightning to envelop the tower. Any creature outside the tower and within 10 feet of
        it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, with disadvantage if it is wearing armor made of metal,
        taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. As long as the effect
        persists, any creature that enters the lightning for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22
        (4d10) lightning damage. The lightning lasts for 10 minutes.</p>

        take 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage from falling debris. The collapse not only destroys the tower but also most of

        figures in the proper sequence, the trap is disabled and the door swings open on rusty hinges for 10 minutes.
        The lines of the symbol on the door reveal the proper sequence. The dance can be performed in one of two ways; a

        own, Strahd relies on the druids and the werewolves of the Svalich Woods, as well as human spies and vampire
        spawn hidden in Barovia’s settlements, to help him find and kill Ezmerelda. If Strahd learns that she and the
        characters are working together, he invites the characters to Ravenloft, expecting that Ezmerelda will accompany
        them. The characters receive their invitation in the form of a letter delivered by one of Strahd’s spies. If the
        characters open and read the letter, show the players the “<a title="Strahd’s Invitation"

        one of the only indulgences left to them. Without it, many Barovians would lose their last shred of hope and
        succumb to utter despair.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9df78f55-4b91-40e1-bf94-a18195748905">Although the Vistani often bring wine from distant
        lands, they share it infrequently. Thus, most of Barovia’s wine comes from one source: the Wizard of Wines
        winery and vineyard.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0bdaa55d-a861-4e70-980a-4b83277ae9fe">The Wizard of Wines was founded by a mage whose name
        is buried in the annals of history. The wizard fashioned three magic gems, each one as big as a pinecone, and
        planted them in the rich valley soil. These “seeds” gave rise to healthy grapevines, which produced sweet, plump
        grapes. Even after Strahd’s curse settled over Barovia, the gems kept the vines and their grapes from succumbing
        to the darkness.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="948463aa-3850-436a-82a7-4f56636f5c3e">Strahd bequeathed the winery and vineyard to the
        noble Krezkov family as a reward for the family’s loyalty. Later, an arranged marriage between the Krezkovs and
        the Martikov family led to the land being taken over by a Martikov descendant. The winery and vineyard have been
        tended by the Martikovs ever since. At some point, the Martikov family became infected with widespread
        lycanthropy. The current patriarch, Davian Martikov, is a wereraven, as are his children and grandchildren.</p>

        unremarkable Purple Grapemash No. 3, the slightly more tantalizing Red Dragon Crush, and the rich Champagne du
        le Stomp. Ten years ago, one of the vineyard’s magic gems was dug up and stolen, and as a result, the winery
        stopped producing its best vintage, the champagne. No one knows what happened to the gem. Davian Martikov blames
        his middle son, Urwin (see <a title="chapter 5" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-town-of-vallaki"

        watch the night the gem was taken. Davian is convinced that Urwin shirked his duty to spend time with his
        betrothed, and the two men have been at odds ever since. To this day, Urwin steadfastly denies his father’s
        accusation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="62258c96-7768-4f56-9b54-6031363102fd">Adding to Davian’s misery, the wereravens have been
        fending off frequent attacks by Baba Lysaga’s scarecrow constructs. Three weeks ago, during one such attack,
        another gem was found, dug up, and taken. Davian believes that it is in the possession of Baba Lysaga (see <a
            title="chapter 10" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-ruins-of-berez"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="62ab730f-55dd-4065-b90d-20d55abf9960">Davian’s belief is correct. The gem was a lucky find
        for Baba Lysaga, who had previously suspected that magic was the root of the vineyard’s health but knew nothing
        of its source. Even after this great discovery, Baba Lysaga continues to send her scarecrows against the winery,
        antagonizing the wereravens like a bad neighbor.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="796f3e7b-508f-411f-8d3b-f90c7afa6bc8">Five days ago, evil druids stole the third and final
        gem and bore it to Yester Hill (<a title="chapter 14" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/yester-hill"
            data-content-chunk-id="96b2ef99-5141-42b6-aba6-12592da529b8">chapter 14</a>). The wereravens launched a
        counterattack on Yester Hill, hoping to get it back, but to no avail. The druids and their blights proved more
        than a match for the lycanthropes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="15d4ac9b-b2f5-49cb-af44-57cf114aed91">Two days ago, the druids returned with a horde of
        blights and drove Davian’s family from the winery. They’ve also poisoned the fermentation vats, leaving the
        winery with only a few bottles and barrels of drinkable wine.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="04a8498d-a320-4e6c-9b5c-a006ff919dae">Even if the characters succeed in helping the
        Martikovs reclaim the winery, wine production in the valley will eventually stop as the vineyard dies off. Only
        by recovering the magic gems and replanting them in the soil can the characters ensure that the Barovians aren’t
        without wine to comfort them on dark, wretched nights.</p>

        Amber Temple in the Balinok Mountains more than two thousand years ago. They needed a vault in which to contain
        the evil vestiges (remnants of dead, malevolent entities) they had captured and the hoard of forbidden knowledge
        they had amassed. They dedicated the temple to a god of secrets, whom they trusted to keep it hidden from the
        rest of the world until the end of time. Unfortunately for the wizards, even the will of a god couldn’t prevent
        other evil creatures from learning the temple’s location. The wizards were forced to guard the temple
        themselves, to keep its secrets from falling into villainous hands. The evil forces that were imprisoned within
        the temple eventually corrupted the wizards, turning them against one another.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1d982c5b-f297-47fe-b45e-96182141006c">The wizards were dead and gone by the time an evil
        archmage named Exethanter arrived at the temple. He breached the temple’s wards, spoke to a vestige trapped in
        amber, and discovered the secret to becoming a lich. After his transformation, the lich Exethanter took over the
        temple and turned the skulls of it previous defenders into flameskulls under his command. Exethanter then took
        it upon himself to watch over the temple, not to hoard its evil secrets but to share them openly. Meanwhile, the
        evils within the temple fed on each other, growing in power.</p>

        Exethanter sensed that he was a man of destiny. The evil powers in the temple felt something much stronger: a
        darkness that eclipsed their own. Strahd communed with these evil vestiges and forged a pact with them. When
        Strahd later murdered his brother Sergei, that pact was sealed with blood. Strahd transformed into a vampire,

        up. These recent years have been difficult for Exethanter, whose body and mind have been falling apart. The lich
        has grown weak and forgetful. He no longer remembers his name or his spells. He knows only that the Dark Powers
        that created Strahd’s domain were born in the temple, and that these entities feed on the evil that Strahd
        represents. Strahd is the darkness that sustains them.</p>

        <p data-content-chunk-id="1557fc48-87ee-4047-8a7f-49f06cb1516e">An amber sarcophagus looks like a rough block of
            solid amber 8 feet tall, 5 feet wide, and 5 feet thick. Trapped inside the block is a sliver or wisp of
            utter darkness no more than a few inches long. The darkness is the vestige of a dead and hateful god—a shard
            of pure evil with shreds of sentience and awareness. The vestige can’t be harmed or controlled, and it is
            immune to all conditions. </p>
        <p data-content-chunk-id="a476f406-477c-4542-905e-c589cc19142f">An amber sarcophagus has AC 16, 80 hit points,
            and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying one causes the vestige trapped within it to disappear,
            leaving no trace. You choose whether it is banished or destroyed. </p>
        <p data-content-chunk-id="ceca03bd-a566-401e-8019-50f3bd4e1e51">A creature that touches the amber sarcophagus
            forms a telepathic link with the vestige inside. The vestige offers the creature a dark gift. The creature
            must willingly accept the gift to gain its benefits. A dark gift is described to the creature in general
            terms; its precise game effect isn’t revealed until the creature accepts the gift. For example, a creature
            that touches Fekre’s sarcophagus in area X33a is offered the power to spread disease. That the gift grants
            the ability to cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2046-contagion"

            dark gift if it is being manipulated or coerced, or if it declines the gift. Once it receives a dark gift, a
            creature can never receive that same dark gift again. </p>
        <p data-content-chunk-id="7de4cbc4-b94e-468d-99fa-29213f43ca2c">The instant a dark gift is bestowed, the
            creature receiving it undergoes a transformation, gaining a sinister physical trait or flaw, or one of each.
            Unless the text states otherwise, a trait or a flaw that accompanies this gift can’t be removed by anything
            short of a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2303-wish"

            gift, it must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature’s alignment
            changes to evil. A character who turns evil becomes an NPC under the Dungeon Master’s control, although the
            DM can allow the player to continue playing the evil character.</p>

        a simple matter, requiring no ability check, and a character within reach of the chest cavity can use an action
        to dig into it. Have that character’s player roll a d20: on a result of 13 or higher, the character unearths the

        part of the wall of fog, that person might relate an ancient legend about it. According to the mountain folk of
        Barovia, there was always a wall of mist near Yester Hill, even before the deadly mists entrapped all of
        Barovia. The ancient folk called the mist the Whispering Wall, for within it they could hear the whisper of
        voices from the past and the future. They believed that an ancient god gave up his divinity to preserve the
        world from destruction and that his last exhalation as a god produced this mist. Within it were all his memories
        of the world and all his visions of its possible futures, and with proper preparation, a seeker could go on a
        vision quest within it. Some students of the arcane contend that the Dark Powers took a bit of that fog and
        twisted it to create the mists of Barovia, and that perhaps Strahd’s domain is just a dark memory in the
        Whispering Wall.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f0ef2bb5-6e05-45e3-82e8-ae26d94407d8">West of Lake Baratok is a cave complex that the
        werewolves of Barovia use as a den. Characters who interrogate captured werewolves can learn the den’s location.
        Most of the werewolf pack is out hunting when the characters first arrive, including the pack’s leader, Kiril
        Stoyanovich.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="47dacfd1-a3df-4c06-a1e4-6757fa3380d5">The werewolves call themselves the Children of
        Mother Night, because they all worship that deity. Recently, a schism formed within the pack as the result of a
        challenge to Kiril’s leadership. The rift began when another werewolf, Emil Toranescu, questioned the treatment
        of children kidnapped by the pack.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3eee0a26-ba9e-423f-9d55-d3d50655b21a">Kiril would arm the children with weapons and force
        them to fight each other to the death until only one child was left standing. The winner would then be turned
        into a werewolf, ensuring what Kiril called “the strength and purity of the pack.” Emil advocated keeping all
        the children alive and turning them into werewolves, thus increasing the pack’s size. Emil believed that a
        larger pack would ensure the werewolves’ survival, whereas Kiril saw a larger pack as too difficult to control
        and feed.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="681843ed-1f53-43d1-a176-ce93443a863a">This ideological divide couldn’t be reconciled and
        led to many disagreements. The other werewolves were split between the two camps, and it seemed likely that
        either Kiril or Emil would die before the conflict could be resolved.</p>
    <aside class="epigraph--with-author">
        <p>The wolves began to howl. They knew me. All the wolves of Barovia did.</p>
        <p>—Strahd von Zarovich<br>in I, Strahd: The Memoirs of a Vampire</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="88204b22-5f1b-4396-8620-bf5d81e105f7">Then Kiril disappeared for several days, causing the
        other werewolves to wonder whether he had fled or had been quietly disposed of by Emil and his allies. When
        Kiril returned, he was accompanied by a pack of several dozen dire wolves loyal to Strahd, and he brought word
        from Castle Ravenloft that Strahd was not pleased with Emil’s attempt to fracture the pack. The dire wolves took
        Emil back to Castle Ravenloft to face punishment, and he was never seen again.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c298c940-26db-4ddb-a8af-eeb8d19b4f32">Kiril reestablished his dominance, but his ideas and
        tactics didn’t sit well with the pack’s older members, and they certainly didn’t please Emil’s mate, Zuleika
        Toranescu. She knows she can’t slay Kiril on her own, and after what happened to Emil, the rest of the pack is
        unwilling to challenge Kiril’s authority and face Strahd’s wrath. Kiril won’t let Zuleika hunt, so she’s more or
        less confined to the den.</p>
    <aside class="rules-text" id="sidebarTravelThroughtheMists">
        <p>TRAVEL THROUGH THE MISTS</p>
        <p>The werewolves serve Strahd out of fear, believing that Mother Night has blessed him with godlike powers and
            eternal life. Although he can’t leave Barovia, Strahd can allow certain creatures to come and go, such as
            the Vistani. He periodically allows the werewolves to slip past the misty borders as well, so that they can
            bring or lure others into his domain. Unlike the Vistani, however, the werewolves can’t come and go as they
            please.</p>

    <aside class="read-aloud-text">
        <p>Thick clouds fill the sky. Through the chilly morning mists, the land of Barovia is visible far below. There
            is peacefulness here. Rest has come to the valley for the first time anyone can remember.</p>
        <p>A light flashes behind you. Wheeling around, you see a stately man—a being of flesh and blood—in shining
            armor and a flapping cape. His countenance shows great strength of will, yet the forcefulness of his
            presence is tempered by his calm, sad eyes. His features are those of Strahd, yet subtly different.</p>
        <p>His voice is calm and peaceful. “My name is Sergei von Zarovich.” He turns to Ireena. “Tatyana, the time is
            at hand to rest. Come, my love and wife.” He stretches forth his hand.</p>
        <p>Ireena Kolyana’s questioning eyes suddenly open with recognition and knowledge. Forgotten memories rush back
            to her. “Sergei!” she cries, springing to him with the grace of a doe. They embrace.</p>
        <p>Ireena turns to you and says, “I am Ireena Kolyana, but in my past I was Sergei’s beloved Tatyana. Through
            these many centuries we have played out the tragedy of our lives. Now, with our deepest gratitude to you,
            that tragedy is over. It is time for joy to begin again.”</p>
        <p>Shimmering light surrounds Ireena and Sergei. Hand in hand, they walk east toward the edge of the overlook.
            Their feet do not touch the ground as they tread a path beyond this mortal world. Their invisible road takes
            them beyond the eastern precipice, their glow illuminating and thinning the clouds above Barovia. The clouds
            suddenly break open, letting shafts of glorious sunlight flood through. In the valley below, the strange fog
            dissolves. Barovia is free once more.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="444ca1e8-b5a7-4f82-9e49-60013d791cb1">The Barovians take the sunlight as a sign that the

        to go and no reason to leave. A few depart, fearing the return of the darkness or longing to see their ancestral
        homelands. Those who have souls can leave the valley, while those without souls fade into nothingness as they

        what it feels like to live a life of hope. When Strahd is reborn, the mists surround the land of Barovia once

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1f8f32f2-0781-4376-a933-1ceea7fe5991">Death House is the name given to an old row house in
        the village of Barovia (<a title="area E7"
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-village-of-barovia#E7HauntedHouse"

            data-content-chunk-id="f759d979-f21e-4a42-b49a-2e3b793804ba">village map</a>). The house has been burned to
        the ground many times, only to rise from the ashes time and again—by its own will or that of Strahd. Locals give
        the building a wide berth for fear of antagonizing the evil spirits believed to haunt it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ae959800-1eaa-485d-b058-e7153d4c9c8b">The wealthy family that built the house practiced
        the dark arts. Through seduction and indoctrination, they expanded their cult to include a small yet nefarious
        circle of friends. When word got out, the rest of the village turned a blind eye to the house and the nightly
        debaucheries happening within it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="879f0342-b0a3-4fc0-aea0-17096782dbd1">The cult tried to summon malevolent extraplanar
        entities with no success. The cultists also preyed on visitors, sacrificed them in bizarre rituals, and hosted
        morbid banquets to feast on their corpses. When nothing came of these ritualized murders, the cultists’
        activities became thinly disguised excuses to indulge their lurid fantasies. The ranks of the cult thinned as
        members began to lose interest in the debacle.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e77812a1-5923-4d75-a873-e1106e9f95b8">Then Strahd von Zarovich arrived.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d25fe645-e3d4-494f-a6be-06a4341d9fdc">The cultists regarded Strahd as a messiah sent to
        them by the Dark Powers. Drawn to Strahd like moths to a flame, they pledged their devotion for a promise of
        immortality, but Strahd turned them away, deeming the cult and its leaders unworthy of his attention. The
        cultists withdrew to Death House in despair.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="47f43776-c940-4221-b07c-c318463e76e6">The cult’s habit of trapping and devouring wayward
        visitors proved to be its downfall. On one occasion, the cult snared a band of adventurers whom Strahd had lured
        to his domain to be his playthings. A black carriage arrived at Death House soon thereafter, and from out of its
        black heart stepped the vampire himself. The cultists tried to impress Strahd. In response, he slaughtered them
        for slaying his playthings. Centuries later, the cultists’ spirits haunt the dungeons under the house. The
        building itself, it seems, is unwilling to let the cult be forgotten.</p>

        <p>DEATH HOUSE’S FEATURES</p>
        <p>Death House is aware of its surroundings and all creatures within it. Its goal is to continue the work of the
            cult by luring visitors to their doom. Various important features of the house are summarized here. </p>
        <p>The house has four stories (including the attic), with two balconies on the third floor—one facing the front
            of the house, the other facing the back. The house has wooden floors throughout, and all windows have hinges
            that allow them to swing outward. </p>
        <p>The rooms on the first and second floors are free of dust and signs of age. The floorboards and wall panels
            are well oiled, the drapes and wallpaper haven’t faded, and the furniture looks new. No effort has been made
            to preserve the contents of the third floor or the attic. These areas are dusty and drafty, everything
            within them is old and draped in cobwebs, and the floorboards groan underfoot. </p>
        <p>Ceilings vary in height by floor. The first floor has 10-foot-high ceilings, the second floor has

        <p>Characters can burn the house to the ground if they want, but any destruction to the house is temporary.
            After 1d10 days, the house begins to repair itself. Ashes sweep together to form blackened timbers, which
            then turn back into a sturdy wooden frame around which walls begin to materialize. Destroyed furnishings are
            likewise repaired. It takes 2d6 hours for the house to complete its resurrection. Items taken from the house
            aren’t replaced, nor are undead that are destroyed. The dungeon level isn’t considered part of the house and
            can’t repair itself in this fashion.</p>

        the Abbey of Saint Markovia in Krezk. This nameless holy figure, whom others call <a

            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17372-tooltip">the Abbot</a>, was drawn to the abbey after Saint Markovia died
        by Strahd’s hand. He sought to restore the abbey after it fell to corruption, but was himself corrupted.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="55e13ebb-e875-4fb9-9c96-0392372ed7dc"><em><strong>Angel in Disguise.</strong></em> The
        Abbot is a deva that has lived for millennia. He typically assumes the form of a strikingly handsome human
        priest in his late twenties or early thirties. More than a hundred years ago, the deva was sent from the Upper
        Planes to honor the legacy of Saint Markovia. He reopened the abbey and began tending to the physically and
        mentally ill. In so doing, he hoped to bring some much-needed light to Barovia. His efforts worked for a while,
        but then the Dark Powers began to corrupt him.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e31ac75f-b5f8-4aed-9bd1-c4f6625c3714"><em><strong>Imperfections.</strong></em> The Abbot’s
        fall from grace started when the Belviews—a family of sickly, inbred lepers—came to the abbey seeking salvation.
        The deva rid them of their diseases, an act for which they were eternally grateful, but could not cure them of
        certain human defects that had been present since birth. The Abbot became consumed with a prideful, obsessive
        desire to rid the poor Belviews of their lingering imperfections. The Belview family, however, had strange ideas
        of what it meant to be perfect. They didn’t want to be ordinary humans. They wanted the eyes of a cat, wings to
        fly like a bat, the strength of a mule, and the guile of a snake. In short, they craved bestial traits, and the
        Abbot, taking pity on them, yielded to their mad desires.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3cc3c5b1-2ee9-4e47-a3bb-2866f4934b68"><em><strong>Enter Vasili von Holtz.</strong></em>
        The Abbot’s early experiments proved fatal to their subjects, but the Belviews insisted that he keep trying. One
        day, a Barovian lord named Vasili von Holtz visited the abbey. The Abbot knew at once that the man was evil, but
        von Holtz stressed that he only wanted to help. He furnished the Abbot with forbidden lore plucked from the
        Amber Temple (<a title="chapter 13" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-amber-temple"
            data-content-chunk-id="5fc0e3d7-21e2-47a5-9951-637dd7a30c85">chapter 13</a>), then helped the Abbot
        transform the Belviews into mongrelfolk—maniacal humans with bestial deformities and traits. The Belviews were
        happy, albeit insane. Only then did von Holtz reveal himself to be Strahd von Zarovich. Somehow the deva
        realized that any attempt to slay Strahd would be futile—that the ancient curse upon the land meant that the
        vampire could never truly die, at least not in Barovia.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="561452d8-4cc0-4bc4-bf41-d105032afa77"><em><strong>Bride of Strahd.</strong></em> Strahd
        confided in the Abbot, lamenting his curse and telling the deva that he wished nothing more than to escape
        Barovia. His performance garnered the deva’s sympathy, and the Abbot, playing into Strahd’s hands, set for
        himself the goal of finding a cure for Strahd’s “malady.” The Abbot is now convinced that the cure lies in
        reuniting Strahd with his lost love and, in so doing, ending Barovia’s curse. The Abbot has recently completed
        work on a flesh golem bride made from the body parts of dead women. While the Belviews languish in the abbey’s
        madhouse, the Abbot is giving his creation lessons in etiquette and ladylike conduct so that “she” can be
        formally presented to Strahd and win his love.</p>

        of their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple instructions. Some animated objects might converse
        fluently or adopt a persona, but most are simple automatons.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5a9e1c9b-2459-438d-89fb-45af2fdb72f4">Baba Lysaga built a hut atop the rotting stump of a
        giant tree that was felled long ago. It was only after she embedded a magic gemstone in the hut that the whole
        thing was imbued with a semblance of life. When she wills it to do so, the hut pulls its gigantic roots free of
        the earth and shambles around like a spidery behemoth, shaking the ground with every step. The hut attacks with
        its flailing and stomping roots. It can also use its roots to fling large rocks.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="58cb9a43-f142-48a4-b8a1-7b63c631a40f"><em><strong>Hut Interior.</strong></em> The hut is a
        15-foot-square, ramshackle wooden building with a gently sloping thatch roof. Its furnishings have been bolted
        to the floor, since the hut lurches from side to side when it walks.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ba385727-ad68-418a-bef5-9f95d7f59ae1"><em><strong>Heart of the Hut.</strong></em> The
        gemstone that has given life to Baba Lysaga’s hut was previously buried in the Wizard of Wines vineyard. The gem
        was one of three imbued with life-giving magic that made the grapevines in the vineyard healthier, guaranteeing
        the finest wines. Baba Lysaga stole one of the gems and perverted its magic, using it instead to animate her
        wooden hut.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e04949fa-477c-4181-b158-d2ba1deb0456">Removing the gem from the hut renders the hut <a
            class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition"
            data-tooltip-href="/conditions/7-tooltip">incapacitated</a>. That task is easier said than done, however.
        The glowing green gem is contained in a cavity in the stump, beneath the rotted floorboards of the hut. The
        floorboards can be ripped up with a successful DC 14 Strength check or smashed by dealing 10 damage to them.
        Once the floorboards are out of the way, a creature can reach into the cavity and snatch the gem. But if someone
        attempts this while the hut is alive, the cavity sprouts wooden teeth, becoming a mouth that bites anything that
        tries to remove the gem; a creature trying to remove the gem must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a
        successful save, the creature claims the stone without getting bitten. On a failed save, the creature is bitten
        for 10 (3d6) piercing damage and fails to obtain the gem.</p>

            data-content-chunk-id="40fcd041-8c20-4f9b-964a-4b3d04b8ba4f"></a>Baba Lysaga</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2592334b-1aa1-46c8-852b-53e389756b40">Two women gave life to Strahd von Zarovich. The
        first was Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen, Strahd’s biological mother. The second was the queen’s midwife, a devout
        follower of Mother Night named Baba Lysaga. Although it was the former who raised Strahd and enabled him to
        follow in his father’s footsteps, it was the latter who sensed a potential for greatness and darkness in Strahd
        surpassing that of any other mortal. Lysaga believed then, as she believes now, that she is Strahd’s true
        mother.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e9f0bbcb-817c-4b3f-99f9-2dc172478e69"><em><strong>Other Mother.</strong></em> When Strahd
        was still a baby in his crib, Baba Lysaga cast protective spells on him and crept into his nursery on stormy
        nights to sing magical rhymes to him. She also placed the “spark of magic” in him, ensuring that he would become
        a spellcaster.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="02643525-d7e3-4f6a-8cd2-5d7b5dbbd894">Baba Lysaga’s unhealthy attachment to the baby
        Strahd did not go unnoticed. After she received several disturbing reports, Queen Ravenovia was forced to banish
        the midwife from the kingdom. Lysaga never saw Strahd again, but she has succeeded in staying alive to witness
        the triumphs of her beloved boy, who, in her mind, is eternally blessed. Despite the horrors Strahd has wrought,
        Lysaga still envisions him as the perfect child she delivered into the world. Strahd is the only thing in her
        life that matters to her.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c8d3bb46-e745-4959-af35-4168e8453da8"><em><strong>Mother Nearest.</strong></em> During her
        exile, Baba Lysaga made countless sacrifices to Mother Night, pleading with the goddess to afflict Queen
        Ravenovia with ill health and visit death upon her. Lysaga eventually got her wish, and after Strahd settled in
        the valley of Barovia, Lysaga moved as close to him as she dared to.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="683ea2fe-f21e-403d-a290-db7b340fb0dd">In the filth-ridden depths of her heart, Lysaga
        knows that Strahd would never accept her as his true mother, nor could she bear his rejection. As a result, she
        has never confronted him. She would rather exist in perpetual denial, whiling away the days, months, and years
        practicing fell magic and looking for ways to help her “son.”</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="634822b0-bf22-40c1-a8fc-98aa8599ac1c"><em><strong>Raven Bane.</strong></em> Baba Lysaga
        has allies in Castle Ravenloft—a coven of witches. Through the aid of these witches, Lysaga recently uncovered a
        potential threat to Strahd: a secret society of wereravens called the Keepers of the Feather, a group that uses
        ordinary ravens as their spies.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="624f17c1-dfc3-4df6-a0c2-334c3a4e5b92">Strahd doesn’t consider the wereravens a serious
        threat, but Lysaga has chosen to make them the bane of her existence. After much searching and scrying, she
        discovered a wereraven refuge at the Wizard of Wines winery (<a title="chapter 12"
            href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-wizard-of-wines"
            data-content-chunk-id="d722ce56-b975-4e93-963c-3e305f13c161">chapter 12</a>), and she has begun to wage war
        against it. In addition, she has forged an alliance with the mad druids that haunt Yester Hill (<a
            title="chapter 14" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/yester-hill"
            data-content-chunk-id="efc69990-e559-406f-aa7a-dc0a990ce22f">chapter 14</a>), convincing them that she gave
        birth to Strahd, whom the druids consider a god. With the druids on her side, she expects to rid Barovia of its
        wereraven menace.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f827b214-f3ad-488f-bdd9-5cff94c8e6fa"><em><strong>Gifts of Mother Night.</strong></em> The
        goddess Mother Night has bestowed magical gifts on Baba Lysaga as rewards for her ceaseless devotion to Strahd.
        Her skin has the resilience of stone, she is resistant to harmful magic, and she is shielded against divination
        magic. Mother Night has also imparted to Lysaga the secret of longevity, which requires her to bathe in the
        blood of beasts on nights of the new moon. Failure to do so causes Lysaga to age rapidly, becoming mere dust and
        bones in a matter of seconds.</p>

        forge pacts with Strahd and the Dark Powers of Ravenloft in exchange for magic and longevity. They prefer to
        live in the shadows and can see in the dark. When traveling in the open, they use <a

                Strahd.</strong></em> Barovian witches have no scruples. They will deal with anyone in return for power.
        They will also betray anyone for the same reason. The only thing they fear is Strahd, and his wish is their
        command. Barovian witches sometimes refer to themselves as the brothers and sisters of Strahd, though never to
        Strahd’s face.</p>

        Barovian witches are obsessive collectors, each believing that almost anything found—a piece of broken bone, a
        dead rodent, a handful of dust, or some other worthless item or substance—could be valuable or useful as a spell
        component, a ritual object, or a potion ingredient.</p>

        creatures, and a tree blight is a particularly enormous variety. It looks like a dead tree or treant, 30 feet
        tall, with spongy wooden flesh, thorny branches, and rubbery roots that trail behind it. It has blood for sap
        and is so saturated with blood that it doesn’t catch fire easily.</p>

        blight feeds on warm-blooded prey and takes perverse delight in causing carnage. It strikes with its heavy
        branches and crushes prey to death with its roots. It can open its gaping, tooth-filled mouth and bite a
        creature caught in its roots. The roots of a tree blight can be severed, though cutting them causes the blight
        no harm.</p>

        blight will often fight alongside other kinds of blights, but it hates other tree blights and will attack them
        given the chance. Tree blights also hate treants, and the feeling is mutual.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="491bd64a-6a36-4d23-8555-999d0fcad559">Ezmerelda d’Avenir, a Vistana, is the protégé of
        Rudolph van Richten—despite the fact that her first encounter with the vampire hunter was anything but pleasant.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ecdaa95d-8d9f-406c-8b60-c353fe7911e8"><em><strong>Witness to Tragedy.</strong></em> When
        Ezmerelda was a little girl, her family kidnapped van Richten’s teenage son, Erasmus, and delivered him into the
        clutches of a vampire. Even today, years later, she can still hear Erasmus’s pleas for mercy. That event haunted
        her childhood.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a94038b0-1b8a-463b-80f4-85c183459ae1">Van Richten tracked down Ezmerelda’s family soon
        after the kidnapping, but not before the Vistani had sold the boy. Though van Richten could have done them harm,
        he instead interrogated Ezmerelda’s mother and father on the whereabouts of his missing son. Satisfied with
        their answers, he spared their lives before departing with the information they had given him. Ezmerelda
        witnessed van Richten’s act of mercy and was deeply moved by it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c4f99fcb-301a-4f36-a50b-b06b3f5606c2"><em><strong>Van Richten’s Tragic Tale.</strong></em>
        At the age of fifteen, Ezmerelda, still troubled by what her family had done to van Richten, ran away from home.
        After many harrowing adventures, she tracked down van Richten two years later. Thinking she was a Vistana
        assassin, he put a sword to her throat and threatened to spill her blood. Ezmerelda convinced him that she
        genuinely wanted to help him find his missing son, whereupon van Richten told her the saddest of tales. He had
        found his son, who had been transformed into a vampire spawn. When Erasmus pleaded to his father for salvation,
        van Richten granted his request by ending his existence.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="67b407b8-1e5d-41d2-a9e6-2cb451d159f3"><em><strong>Farewell.</strong></em> Ezmerelda
        remained by van Richten’s side for two years, helping him track down and slay many creatures of the night. But
        because van Richten could never bring himself to fully trust a Vistana, he kept secrets from her. The two
        vampire hunters got on each other’s nerves, and their arguments became more frequent. At last, Ezmerelda
        suggested that they part company with some shred of their friendship still intact, and van Richten agreed.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5d0e7412-577c-436f-9b5f-c58061d8297d"><em><strong>Ezmerelda’s Prosthetic.</strong></em>
        Since bidding farewell to van Richten, Ezmerelda has amassed a sizable personal fortune, some of which she used
        to buy a wagon to carry her vampire-slaying paraphernalia. On one of her less successful adventures, a werewolf
        bit off her right leg below the knee, and although she avoided being afflicted with lycanthropy, Ezmerelda was
        sidelined for months. She commissioned a master artisan to craft a prosthetic lower leg and foot. After several
        tries, he delivered a prosthesis that restored her mobility. She has since adapted well to the prosthetic
        appendage.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="66febcc4-45e8-454e-8d95-b7504aead4d8"><em><strong>The Great Vampire Hunt.</strong></em>
        While in the company of a Vistani caravan, Ezmerelda heard a rumor that Rudolph van Richten had gone to Barovia
        to slay the most powerful vampire of them all. She decided that he might need help and traveled for months to
        reach Strahd’s domain. She rode her wagon to Vallaki and learned about an old tower that seemed the sort of
        place van Richten would use as a base. When she arrived there, she found some of van Richten’s belongings, but
        of the vampire hunter there was no sign. Although she is anxious to learn the whereabouts of her mentor, she is
        also eager to earn his trust and respect. To that end, she has been poring over van Richten’s research and
        learning about Strahd and Castle Ravenloft, with every intention of dispatching the vampire herself.</p>

        keeps a deck of tarokka cards in her wagon (<a title="chapter 11"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1a61ef9f-9c1e-43e4-9ed7-737656687eb6">Izek and his sister were born in Vallaki. One
        morning, their father and their uncle took them fishing on Lake Zarovich. On the way back to town, a dire wolf
        attacked Izek and bit off his right arm. His father carried Izek back to town while his uncle distracted the
        beast. His sister ran and hid in the woods and was never seen again.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="06f7bfc2-e6cf-4d33-9f6a-5d56e17f0f79">Unlike his sister, Izek was born without a soul. As
        time wore on, he forgot his lost sister and learned to cope with his disability.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9202edf5-2bd5-4401-ac10-734399ac8e12"><em><strong>Orphaned Killer.</strong></em> Izek’s
        parents succumbed to their grief, leaving him an orphan. He became a sociopath. Other children ruthlessly mocked
        him because of his dead family and his missing arm, but he was a large boy and had no trouble killing them and
        disposing of their bodies. He was eventually caught in the act and brought to the burgomaster. Instead of
        punishing the boy for his crimes, Baron Vallakovich pardoned Izek and took him into his home. Izek has been
        loyal to the burgomaster ever since, enjoying the power of his position and the comforts of his master’s
        mansion. When he isn’t enforcing the burgomaster’s will, Izek drinks copious amounts of wine.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8536acd9-ec8d-4fdf-822d-2e667c72abdc"><em><strong>Fiendish Gift.</strong></em> After years
        of doing Baron Vallakovich’s dirty work, Izek awakened from a drunken stupor one morning to find that he had
        grown a new arm to replace the one he had lost.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0165b89e-7029-4b6c-8708-a96b3af5c984">The new appendage has barbed spines, elongated
        fingers, and long nails. He can create fire with the snap of his fiendish fingers and has used the flames to put
        the fear of the devil in every Vallakian.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0346d855-d980-4c5a-aad2-a27870333c23"><em><strong>Doll Collector.</strong></em> Perhaps
        more disturbing than his fiendish arm and his murderous nature is Izek’s collection of dolls, which he keeps in
        his bedroom in the burgomaster’s mansion. Izek often has dreams of a beautiful young woman, and for years he has
        forced a local toymaker named Gadof Blinsky to craft dolls in her likeness. The woman is Ireena Kolyana,
        although Izek doesn’t know her name.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a8ef5193-238d-4ec4-b6ed-859c9dc49964"><em><strong>Family Is Forever.</strong></em> Izek
        has dreams of Ireena. If he spots her, he tries to take her by force to the burgomaster’s mansion. If he
        succeeds, he holds her captive in his bedroom (<a title="chapter 5"

        are brother and sister. Ireena fled after Izek was attacked by the dire wolf and became lost in the woods. She
        wandered for days in shock until she was found and adopted by Kolyan Indirovich in the village of Barovia. Izek
        covets her in an unwholesome way and won’t allow anyone or anything to come between them.</p>

            href="/monsters/299546-kasimir-velikov" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/299546-tooltip">Kasimir</a>, a
        mutiliated and grief-stricken dusk elf, has been trapped in Barovia for centuries. His people were on the verge
        of being annihilated by Strahd’s armies when they surrendered. Strahd left the few survivors to the mercy of the
        Vistani, who bore them to the valley of Barovia, where they have lived ever since.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b1b31033-8682-4734-b35c-2d5d210b23b8"><em><strong>Old Friends.</strong></em> Kasimir’s
        allegiance to the Vistani is so strong that he adopted the name of the Vistana who welcomed him into his clan, a
        man named Velikov. Although Velikov passed away more than a century ago, Kasimir continues to live among
        Velikov’s descendants. Unfortunately, in his view, these modern Vistani are neither as noble nor as enlightened
        as their forebears. Not one to press the issue, Kasimir hopes to outlive the present leadership and see a return
        to the old ways.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ff15ffb1-19bf-4482-8ac7-419f109a6ced"><em><strong>Dreams of the Damned.</strong></em>
        Kasimir’s sister, Patrina Velikovna, is sealed in the catacombs below Castle Ravenloft. Convinced that she was
        the concubine of the devil Strahd, Kasimir and his fellow dusk elves stoned Patrina to death. As punishment for
        depriving him of his bride, Strahd butchered all the women in the dusk elf tribe, and Kasimir’s ears were cut
        off to punish him for instigating the stoning. He wears a cowl to conceal his mutilation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f38dd20e-699a-4d2d-81cd-01ab54d59d74">Kasimir’s feeling of loss is tinged with simmering
        rage. Patrina now speaks to her brother in dreams, telling him how years of guilt and regret have dispelled all
        evil thoughts from her mind and cleansed her tortured soul. But Kasimir remains unconvinced by her assertions,
        because he knows that Strahd has corrupted Patrina and led her down a path of evil and deceit. For that reason,
        Kasimir wants to see the vampire destroyed so that his sister can be rescued from her eternal damnation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bf91074b-fddd-4e8d-bcfa-2ef17c3952ab"><em><strong>Secrets of the Amber
                Temple.</strong></em> Patrina has told Kasimir that the Amber Temple, an ancient vault hidden in the
        Barovian mountains, is where Strahd forged his pact with evil powers and discovered how to become a vampire.
        Kasimir has been spying on the temple for years, but he needs adventurers to help him survive its perils. He
        thinks that the secret to breaking Strahd’s pact and freeing Barovia from its curse might be hidden there, but
        more important, he believes that the Amber Temple holds the secret to bringing the ancient dead back to life.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="60c692ed-200d-4fec-8abf-bffc69304512">With the characters’ help, Kasimir thinks he might
        be able to find out how to restore Patrina to flesh and blood, whereupon he can travel to Castle Ravenloft and
        end his sister’s torment. Kasimir has no inkling that Patrina is using him for exactly that purpose, and that
        her ultimate goal is to become as powerful a vampire as Strahd.</p>

        but isn’t truly one of them. She appears to be in her seventies, but she is, in fact, much older.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5cd4c3b0-b389-42cc-baed-be3eb1ebed35"><em><strong>Royal Blood.</strong></em> Madam Eva is
        Strahd’s half-sister, though Strahd is unaware of this fact. Her real name is Katarina, and she is the daughter
        of a Vistani woman whom King Barov, Strahd’s father, took to his bed during one of his many crusades. Madam Eva
        knows she is Strahd’s half-sister but has told no one of the royal blood flowing through her veins.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3113f02b-f1df-4a72-996d-b3a17cbedf7b"><em><strong>Mother Night.</strong></em> Over four
        hundred years ago, Katarina came to Barovia and insinuated herself into Strahd’s court, working as a maid in
        Castle Ravenloft. She came to know the castle like the back of her hand, and she was present for the wedding of
        Sergei and Tatyana. After Strahd went mad and murdered his brother, she fled the castle and took refuge with the
        Vistani. Later, she forged a pact with the goddess Mother Night, trading her youth for the power to undo the
        evil that Strahd had wrought. Mother Night transformed Katarina into an ageless crone gifted with the power of
        magical foresight. In the guise of Madam Eva, she uses this ability to help Strahd. She can send her Vistani out
        in their wagons to visit other worlds and bring adventurers to Strahd’s domain, in hopes that they will find a
        way to destroy the vampire or set Strahd free.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4b77d8d8-c913-47e5-81c7-2e634cf32e83"><em><strong>For the Love of Strahd.</strong></em>
        The Dark Powers of Ravenloft would consider Madam Eva a worthy choice to replace Strahd as the master of
        Ravenloft, but she has all the power she desires and doesn’t seek to supplant him. She would rather help Strahd
        find someone else to succeed him, although she has grave doubts about her ability to locate such an individual.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="218ba70e-592f-446b-b6a0-93a5617b54c5">Mongrelfolk are humanoids that have undergone, or
        whose ancestors underwent, horrific magical transformations, to the extent that they retain only a fraction of
        their original being. Their humanoid bodies incorporate the features of various beasts. For example, one
        mongrelfolk might have the basic body shape of a dwarf with a head that combines the features of a cat and a
        lizard, one arm that ends in a crab’s pincer, and one leg that ends in a cloven hoof. Another might have the
        skin and horns of a cow, the eyes of a spider, frog’s legs, and a scaly lizard’s tail. Each mongrelfolk’s mad
        combination of humanoid and animal forms results in its having a slow, awkward gait.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="172656f3-54ec-4479-822d-c3aae7c25bf0"><em><strong>Sound Mimicry.</strong></em> Mongrelfolk
        have misshapen mouths and vocal cords. They speak fragmented Common mixed with various animal cries and
        nonsense. They can effectively imitate sounds made by beasts and humanoids that they’ve heard. Mongrelfolk
        aren’t sophisticated enough to use these sounds as a covert form of communication, but they can use the sounds
        to lure enemies into a trap or otherwise distract them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5fcdd7e8-67c9-478a-a239-ee572e8640fe"><em><strong>Outcasts.</strong></em> Mongrelfolk are
        seldom welcome in other humanoid societies, where they are abused, enslaved, or shunned. They typically live on
        the fringes of civilization in ruins, deserted buildings, or other places that other humanoid races once lived
        in or built. They tend to be timid and skittish outside their homes and fiercely territorial within their lairs.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="74fe7109-5fc5-405e-a13f-2204737d5735"><em><strong>Camouflage Experts.</strong></em>
        Mongrelfolk often hide their deformities under cloaks and cowls. In this way, they can sometimes pass as stout
        humans or thin dwarves. They are fond of camouflage, attaching leaves and twigs to their cloaks, making brown
        paint to cover their skin, and weaving grass nets under which they can hide. They use such camouflage while
        hunting in the wild or while standing guard outside their lairs. Until it is seen, a camouflaged mongrelfolk has
        advantage on <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills"
            data-tooltip-href="/skills/5-tooltip">Stealth</a> checks made to hide.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dd294797-05b8-46e6-ad32-c4e40c4e728b"><em><strong>Horrific Offspring.</strong></em> It’s
        possible to restore a mongrelfolk to its original form using a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"

        spell, but the same can’t be said for a mongrelfolk’s offspring. Only mongrelfolk that are made by magic can be
        restored to their original forms. Mongrelfolk that are born are true mongrelfolk and not the subjects of a spell
        or an effect that can be undone.</p>

        nearly all children born to such parents are mongrelfolk. (About one child in every hundred is born looking like

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3f22a95d-3105-4b2c-ba5c-eed0d4c1a122">A phantom warrior is the spectral remnant of a
        willful soldier or knight who perished on the battlefield or died performing its sworn duty. It appears like a
        translucent version of its living self.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1bbd6c73-2f7a-43a6-b97c-8287f6d79504"><em><strong>Task Driven.</strong></em> Although one
        is often mistaken for a ghost, a phantom warrior isn’t bound by a yearning to complete some unresolved goal. It
        can choose to end its undead existence at any time. Its spirit lingers willingly, either out of loyalty to its
        former master or because it believes it must perform a task to satisfy its honor or sense of duty. For example,
        a guard who dies defending a wall might return as a phantom warrior and continue guarding the wall, then
        disappear forever once a new guard assumes its post or the wall is destroyed. The period between the time it
        died and the time it rises as a phantom warrior is usually 24 hours.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="18705e13-19e1-423f-9b32-7905f33b2598"><em><strong>Faded Memories.</strong></em> A phantom
        warrior retains the alignment and personality it had before it died, and it remembers how it died. Memories of
        its life from shortly before it died are hazy, and older memories are forgotten. A phantom warrior can usually
        remember the last 1d10 + 10 days of its life; everything that happened before that is an impenetrable fog.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="432a8be9-817b-45ea-8541-776ba6fbde89"><em><strong>Forceful Presence.</strong></em>
        Although they are incorporeal, phantom warriors can harness the energy around them to deflect incoming attacks
        and strike with great force. An invisible sheath of energy surrounds a phantom warrior’s ghostly armor, shields,
        and weapons, which become as hard as steel yet don’t impede the warrior’s ability to move through walls and
        other solid objects.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c7404ea7-f662-4f82-aec9-056017892489"><em><strong>Undead Nature.</strong></em> A phantom
        warrior doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>

            data-content-chunk-id="d73eca44-6b0d-4836-8910-00b04a31b36a"></a>Pidlwick II</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1ea494a0-6225-489a-bd04-ac32f9633972">After her husband died in battle, Duchess Dorfniya
        Dilisnya set her sights on becoming Count Strahd von Zarovich’s bride, but she failed to win his love. Her
        visits to the castle were nonetheless frequent, and she never traveled without her fool, the delightful
        Pidlwick. The little man was like a ray of sunshine in Castle Ravenloft, and though he failed to amuse Strahd,
        he delighted Tatyana and Sergei with his jokes and gambols. As a result, Strahd didn’t object whenever Pidlwick
        and the duchess came to visit.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="193051d3-5eab-427d-9f9e-3b1fc0f2f514">Eager to please and desiring to return the courtesy,
        the duchess commissioned the legendary toymaker Fritz von Weerg to build a clockwork effigy of Pidlwick as a
        gift for Strahd’s family. Although the duchess’s heart was in the right place, the effigy didn’t have Pidlwick’s
        abilities, and it failed to entertain anyone. Even though Pidlwick himself had spent months training it, the
        effigy couldn’t speak, and its movements were more awkward than amusing.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c8d4fd5d-5ce2-480a-b56b-f1a0ac0c68d2">A harsh winter trapped the duchess, her fool, and
        her fool’s effigy in Castle Ravenloft for several months. The duchess subsequently succumbed to illness, after
        which Tatyana asked Pidlwick to remain at Castle Ravenloft.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ecbc11cd-95b0-4c8d-b356-74ca7591dd83"><em><strong>One Pidlwick Too Many.</strong></em> Von
        Weerg was no ordinary toymaker, and he put a little of himself into all his creations, which is to say his works
        had a touch of their creator’s madness. Pidlwick II knew that it had no purpose as long as Pidlwick remained in
        Castle Ravenloft, so it pushed Pidlwick down a long flight of stairs, killing him. Everyone else thought it was
        an accident. In the days that followed, Pidlwick II tried its best to fill its namesake’s shoes, but the
        effigy’s mere presence was upsetting to Tatyana, and it was never called on to perform. Eventually, it was shut
        away like a discarded toy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4fdd90c4-5e71-437f-bf86-f872bf9e03f3"><em><strong>Evil Toy.</strong></em> Pidlwick II was
        kept in a small closet adjacent to one of the guest bedrooms. On rare occasions when someone stayed there,
        Pidlwick would sneak out of the closet in the middle of the night, smother the guest with a pillow, and then
        retreat back to the closet. The castle staff never considered that the effigy might be responsible, instead
        assuming that the guests had died in their sleep.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eede907b-ff5d-4b51-91fe-24a399723afb">But Strahd was not fooled. He came to realize fairly
        quickly that the clockwork effigy had begun to display a murderous nature. Rather than have Pidlwick II
        destroyed, Strahd kept the fool around to dispose of irksome guests from time to time.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4f4e08ef-e75a-4afa-9a2d-5177179fbc95">After the deaths of Sergei and Tatyana, the castle
        became virtually abandoned, and there were no more guests for Pidlwick II to “entertain.” The clockwork effigy
        emerged from its closet and found new places to hide. It fears Strahd and eagerly follows anyone who gives it
        the attention it craves.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1e3c3047-8165-4285-b010-7c5c2724a6e6">Pidlwick II is basically an oversized toy—a
        4-foot-tall mechanism stuffed with gears, springs, and other components expertly fitted together to impart a
        semblance of life to it. Its skin is made of stitched leather pulled taut over an articulated wooden frame.
        Pidlwick II has rubbed soot around its eyes and mouth, giving it the triangular eyes and jagged grin of a
        jack-o’-lantern.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="59531797-00c8-4348-99df-77682a6d8f9a"><em><strong>Exile.</strong></em> Rahadin was exiled
        for refusing to bow down to a dusk elf prince whom he considered weak and corrupt. When the dusk elves later
        declined to pay fealty to King Barov, Rahadin helped Barov conquer them. The elf kingdom’s royal line was
        obliterated, the dusk elves hunted like rabbits. The few that survived were either subjugated or forced to live
        among the Vistani. So pleased was Barov with Rahadin that the king made the dusk elf an honorary member of his
        family.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4fee20fd-09bf-4c24-a8c5-263056ebec82"><em><strong>Chamberlain.</strong></em> After Barov
        died, Rahadin continued to fight as one of Strahd’s generals. When the wars ended and Strahd turned his
        attention to building Castle Ravenloft, Rahadin saw to it that wizards and artisans were brought to Barovia.
        Years later, Strahd appointed Rahadin his castle chamberlain. Rahadin was pleased to do whatever Strahd asked of
        him, and he instilled terror in the castle staff by routinely flogging those who didn’t perform their duties to
        his exacting standards.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ef90225d-7de3-4912-987f-42c0bb9dfe43">When a dusk elf named Patrina Velikovna came
        knocking on Strahd’s door, Rahadin could see that she intrigued Strahd, but Rahadin was suspicious of her
        motives. Patrina tried to seduce Strahd with the prospect of immortality—something Strahd desired above all. She
        told him of a vault of forbidden lore called the Amber Temple, where the secret of gaining immortality was
        hidden. While Strahd was off exploring the temple, Rahadin handled all of his master’s affairs and began
        searching for a woman who could tear Strahd away from Patrina Velikovna. In this task, he failed. His goal was
        fulfilled, however, when Sergei, Strahd’s brother, found Tatyana.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="67be7bf3-0e0b-4fcd-b498-5114ec822c50">Tatyana was Strahd’s type—a woman of exquisite
        beauty and gentle manner. When Strahd returned to Ravenloft, the young woman instantly caught his eye, and
        Rahadin had the pleasure of informing Patrina that her presence at the castle was no longer desired.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fc015001-6072-4051-91a7-7e9c323a5cfa">Rahadin’s loyalty didn’t waver after Tatyana died
        and Strahd became a vampire. Rahadin continued to do his master’s bidding. Eager to put Tatyana out of his mind,
        Strahd lured more women to the castle, taking several of them as brides before draining their lives and turning
        them into vampire spawn. Rahadin would see to it that these women were lavished with jewels and fine clothes,
        and made comfortable during their stay in Ravenloft.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c2f1a8d6-f92b-40ef-a87a-2bc32d237f98"><em><strong>Executioner.</strong></em> Patrina
        Velikovna and her people were living among the Vistani when they heard of Tatyana’s death and Strahd’s curse.
        The ageless Patrina returned to Ravenloft in the hope of winning Strahd’s love. This time, it was clear that
        Patrina craved Strahd’s power and that Strahd would never love her. Rahadin assumed that Patrina would suffer
        the same fate as those women who had come before her. He was proven wrong when Patrina’s own people stoned her
        to death to keep Strahd from claiming her as his wife.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a7e44ebb-897f-495f-8eb0-6fe9ed00d1a7">Strahd was upset that the dusk elves had taken
        Patrina from him. After securing her body and entombing it in the catacombs of Ravenloft, Strahd sent Rahadin to
        punish the dusk elves. Rahadin slew the female elves so that the males couldn’t breed. He also sliced off the
        ears of Patrina’s brother, Kasimir, who had orchestrated the stoning.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="59c0b7b2-1f7c-4d4d-9f1b-925606489712"><em><strong>Screams of the Dead.</strong></em> So
        dreadful a creature is Rahadin that anyone who stands within 10 feet of him can hear the howling screams of the
        countless men and women he has killed in his lifetime. Rahadin can’t hear them, nor would he be haunted by them
        if he could. The only thing he cares about is Strahd von Zarovich, for whom he would gladly give his life.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="433e0905-5de8-406f-9bfc-c8c9ce5d3aee">Several months ago, a colorfully dressed half-elf
        bard came to Barovia in a carnival wagon, with a pet monkey on his shoulder. He took over an abandoned tower on
        Lake Baratok before rolling into the town of Vallaki several months later. Claiming to be a carnival ringmaster
        in search of new actors, he began regaling locals with tales of distant lands.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e3cd7f1a-d1c8-4133-aa2d-6d900e60de8e"><em><strong>Monster Hunter.</strong></em> The
        half-elf ringmaster is, in fact, a legendary human vampire hunter named Rudolph van Richten. Van Richten’s tale
        is a sad one. A scholar and doctor from a land called Darkon, he married his childhood sweetheart, Ingrid, and
        together they had a son, Erasmus. When he was fourteen, Erasmus was stolen away by Vistani and sold to a vampire
        named Baron Metus to be used as a companion. By the time van Richten found his son, it was too late: the baron
        had already transformed Erasmus into a vampire spawn. Erasmus begged his father to end his suffering, which van
        Richten did by pounding a wooden stake through his son’s chest. Baron Metus avenged that deed by killing van
        Richten’s wife, and van Richten has lived with the horror of his family’s destruction ever since. After
        destroying Baron Metus in turn, van Richten sought revenge against the Vistani and took up a life of hunting
        evil monsters.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="397b280f-fea8-40ee-9484-5d0902ffdadc"><em><strong>The Waiting Game.</strong></em> Van
        Richten isn’t a young man anymore. He knows his road is coming to an end, but his work isn't done. He has come
        to Barovia to kill Strahd von Zarovich, the greatest vampire of them all. Van Richten has studied Strahd for
        years and knows he can’t hope to best the vampire in a straight-up confrontation: he must wait for the right
        moment to strike. He has good evidence to suggest that Strahd periodically hibernates in his coffin, sometimes
        for years, when all is quiet in the realm. While he bides his time, van Richten hides in plain sight with the
        aid of a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4651-hat-of-disguise"
            data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4651-tooltip">hat of disguise</a>, his thoughts protected by a <a
            class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4725-ring-of-mind-shielding"
            data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4725-tooltip">ring of mind shielding</a>. He is trying to learn more about
        the Keepers of the Feather—a society of wereravens that oppose Strahd—while trying not to expose the secret
        society to their mutual enemy. He thinks the wereravens might prove helpful when the time comes. Van Richten
        also wants to take out as many of Strahd’s spies as he can, starting with evil Vistani.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cdd2e70d-dc55-42d7-a840-bfcd0797e7f7"><em><strong>Man with a Plan.</strong></em> Van
        Richten doesn’t know that his former protégé, a good-aligned Vistana named Ezmerelda d’Avenir, has come to
        Barovia looking for him. He taught her many of his monster-hunting techniques, but she doesn’t know all of his
        tricks and disguises. So far, their paths haven’t crossed. In the event that van Richten becomes aware of
        Ezmerelda’s presence, he does his utmost to protect her without putting his own plans in jeopardy. If he can
        manipulate a party of adventurers into keeping an eye on her, he will do so.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d0651911-e04d-47e4-b879-7faea57fd93f">Van Richten works alone. A curse placed on him long
        ago by a Vistani seer brings doom to those he befriends. Furthermore, he believes too much is at stake to risk
        exposure. Consequently, if he thinks he’s in danger of being unmasked, he retreats to his tower (see <a

        joined the Order of the Silver Dragon at a young age and quickly earned the friendship of its founder, the
        silver dragon Argynvost. When he became a knight of the order, he traveled to distant lands to wage war against
        the forces of evil. The dragon stayed home and, in the guise of a human noble named Lord Argynvost, brought new
        initiates into the order.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="400951ed-4b9b-4eba-9f90-aa9f639a97ea"><em><strong>Enemies of Strahd.</strong></em>
        Vladimir found himself fighting Strahd’s armies time and again as they swept across the land. When it became
        clear that Strahd couldn’t be stopped, the knights of the order led hundreds of refugees to Argynvost’s valley,
        but Strahd tracked them to their sanctuary and overwhelmed them with a vast force. Vladimir, whom Argynvost had
        made a field commander, couldn’t hold back the evil tide and was killed, only after the heartbreak of witnessing
        Strahd himself slay Vladimir’s beloved, his fellow knight Sir Godfrey Gwilym. With the battle won, Strahd
        surrounded Argynvostholt. Rather than cower in his lair, Argynvost emerged and battled Strahd’s armies to the
        bitter end.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3f7eff79-b40a-4d21-8c88-685849adce42"><em><strong>Deadly Vengeance.</strong></em>
        Unwilling to accept his failure, Vladimir returned as a revenant. So great was his hatred of Strahd and his
        thirst for vengeance that those feelings fueled the spirits of many of his fellow knights—including Godfrey—to
        come back as revenants as well. Vladimir continued to wage the hopeless war, even as Strahd tightened his grip
        on the valley.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="72df4b93-acd6-4fe5-aeae-388cba5a61f3">When Strahd became a vampire, Vladimir and his
        revenants should have gone to their eternal rest. But Strahd’s deeds were so heinous that Barovia and the
        knight’s spirits became trapped behind curtains of mist.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fb23bf79-ee17-43a5-b3fc-35ae975552fb"><em><strong>Blinded by Hatred.</strong></em>
        Vladimir hates Strahd but doesn’t want to see the vampire given his final rest. Vladimir wants Strahd to suffer
        forever for the deaths of Godfrey and Argynvost, the destruction of their order, and all the other crimes of
        which the vampire is guilty. Vladimir believes that all of Barovia has been swept into hell, and he wants to
        make sure that Strahd stays trapped in it forever. It angers Vladimir that he and his fellow knights are also
        trapped, but in Vladimir’s mind, such is the price of keeping the vampire confined. Even his love for Godfrey is
        now just a dim memory shrouded by his hate.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="75074cd9-2237-4332-aafc-fcb8d31845db">Were Vladimir to let go of his hatred, his spirit
        would find peace and could remember the warmth of love. Were Strahd to be defeated, even temporarily, the mists
        surrounding Barovia would fade, allowing the spirits of Vladimir and his knights to enter the afterlife.
        Nevertheless, Vladimir would rather savor Strahd’s torment than bring peace to his fallen order or peace to the
        land of Barovia. Gone are the days of honor and valor.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="fdf3641e-ece4-4569-bb40-2a3e788256fd">Wereravens are secretive and extraordinarily
        cautious lycanthropes that trust one another but are wary of just about everyone else. Although skilled at
        blending into society, they keep mostly to themselves, respect local laws, and strive to do good whenever
        possible.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c41a00e4-ae5a-448e-b41f-579561d9f1b8">In their human and hybrid forms, wereravens favor
        light weapons. They are reluctant to make bite attacks in raven form for fear of spreading their curse to those

        Wereravens refer to their tightly knit groups as kindnesses. A kindness of wereravens usually numbers between
        seven and twelve individuals. Not surprisingly, wereravens get along well with ravens and often hide in plain
        sight among them.</p>

        Wereravens like to collect shiny trinkets and precious baubles. They are fond of sharing their wealth with those
        in need and, in their humanoid forms, modestly give money to charity. They take steps to keep magic items out of
        evil hands by stashing them in secret hiding places.</p>

        fortune-telling. In the hands of a Vistani seer, a deck of tarokka cards can tell tales of the future and
        provide answers to many a dark and mysterious question.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d1c1028b-66ba-4657-a7d2-6cb7ab1b5147">Although the workmanship and artistic quality of the
        cards can vary from deck to deck, the ability of the cards to call forth information about the future is far
        more valuable than the monetary worth of a deck.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a5dba806-8fcf-495b-a5f0-a9f0927c4243">Anyone can craft a deck of tarokka cards, but only
        someone of Vistani blood can imbue the cards with the gift of prophecy. Once they are crafted and empowered,
        they must be stored in accordance with ancient tradition, or they lose their efficacy. When not in use, tarokka
        cards must be wrapped in silk and stored in a wooden box.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="674b44ba-3380-4c46-ad8b-07d62abd37a8">A tarokka deck has fifty-four cards, each of which
        has its own name. Forty of them comprise the common deck, which is divided into four suits: swords, coins,
        stars, and glyphs.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="81aa49e9-45aa-4a2b-8102-23434c8baec2">Each suit contains cards numbered one through nine,
        plus a tenth card that is called the master of that suit. A card can be referred to by its suit designation or
        by its name. For instance, the three of glyphs is also known as the healer, and the wizard card is also known as
        the master of stars.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7b31ce56-c4d4-4cd5-8d7a-ae238e5d77b8">The remaining fourteen cards make up the high deck,
        which symbolizes the natural forces of the multiverse. These cards are represented by a crown symbol and are the
        most powerful cards in the deck.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4c798764-079a-4a19-bce9-11f09d6fe02c">The cards that compose the high deck aren’t
        considered to be one suit, although they are often denoted with a crown icon to mark their importance. Rather,
        each card is an important power in its own right. If one of these cards comes out in a casting and seems to
        contradict the prediction of an earlier card, the Vistani always assume that this card takes precedence.</p>

            <p>Hail to thee of might and valor.</p>
            <p>I, a lowly servant of Barovia, send honor to thee. We plead for thy so desperately needed assistance.</p>
            <p>The love of my life, Ireena Kolyana, has been afflicted by an evil so deadly that even the good people of
                our village cannot protect her. She languishes from her wound, and I would have her saved from this
                menace.</p>
            <p>There is much wealth in this community. I offer all that might be had to thee and thy fellows if thou
                shalt but answer my desperate plea.</p>
            <p>Come quickly, for her time is at hand! All that I have shall be thine!</p>

            <p>I am the Ancient. I am the Land. My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. I was the warrior, I
                was good and just. I thundered across the land like the wrath of a just god, but the war years and the
                killing years wore down my soul as the wind wears stone into sand.</p>
            <p>All goodness slipped from my life. I found my youth and strength gone, and all I had left was death. My
                army settled in the valley of Barovia and took power over the people in the name of a just god, but with
                none of a god’s grace or justice.</p>
            <p>I called for my family, long unseated from their ancient thrones, and brought them here to settle in the
                castle Ravenloft. They came with a younger brother of mine, Sergei. He was handsome and youthful. I
                hated him for both.</p>
            <p>From the families of the valley, one spirit shone above all others. A rare beauty, who was called
                “perfection,” “joy,” and “treasure.” Her name was Tatyana, and I longed for her to be mine.</p>
            <p>I loved her with all my heart. I loved her for her youth. I loved her for her joy. But she spurned me!
                “Old One” was my name to her—“elder” and “brother” also. Her heart went to Sergei. They were betrothed.
                The date was set.</p>
            <p>With words she called me “brother,” but when I looked into her eyes they reflected another name: “death.”
                It was the death of the aged that she saw in me. She loved her youth and enjoyed it. But I had
                squandered mine. The death she saw in me turned her from me. And so I came to hate death—my death. My
                hate is very strong. I would not be called “death” so soon. I made a pact with death, a pact of blood.
                On the day of the wedding, I killed Sergei, my brother. My pact was sealed with his blood.</p>
            <p>I found Tatyana weeping in the garden east of the chapel. She fled from me. She would not let me explain,
                and a great anger swelled within me. She had to understand the pact I made for her. I pursued her.
                Finally, in despair, she flung herself from the walls of Ravenloft, and I watched everything I ever
                wanted fall from my grasp forever.</p>
            <p>It was a thousand feet through the mists. No trace of her was ever found. Not even I know her final fate.
                Arrows from the castle guards pierced me to my soul, but I did not die. Nor did I live. I became undead,
                forever.</p>
            <p>I have studied much since then. “Vampyr” is my new name. I still lust for life and youth, and I curse the
                living that took them from me. Even the sun is against me. It is the sun and its light I fear the most,
                but little else can harm me now. Even a stake through my heart does not kill me, though it holds me from
                movement. But the sword, that cursed sword that Sergei brought! I must dispose of that awful tool! I
                fear and hate it as much as the sun.</p>
            <p>I have often hunted for Tatyana. I have even felt her within my grasp, but she escapes. She taunts me!
                She taunts me! What will it take to bend her love to me? I now reside far below Ravenloft. I live among
                the dead and sleep beneath the very stones of this hollow castle of despair. I shall seal shut the walls
                of the stairs that none may disturb me.</p>

            <p>For more than three decades now, I have undertaken to investigate and expose creatures of darkness to the
                purifying light of truth and knowledge. “Hero” I am named in some circles; “sage” and “master hunter” I
                am called in others. That I have survived countless supernatural assaults is seen as a marvel among my
                peers; my name is spoken with fear and loathing among my foes.</p>
            <p>In truth, this “virtuous” calling began as an obsessive effort to destroy a vampire that murdered my
                child, and it has become for me a tedious and bleak career. Even as my life of hunting monsters began, I
                felt the weight of time on my weary shoulders. Today I am a man who has simply lived too long. Like a
                regretful lich, I find myself inexorably bound to an existence I sought out of madness and, seemingly,
                must now endure for all eternity. Of course I shall die, but whether I shall ever rest in my grave
                haunts my idle thoughts, and torments me in my dreams.</p>
            <p>I expect that those who think me a hero will change their minds when they know the whole truth about my
                life as a hunter of the unnatural. Nevertheless, I must reveal, here and now, that I have been the
                indirect yet certain cause of many deaths, and the loss of many good friends. Mistake me not! I do not
                merely feel sorry for myself. Rather, I come to grips with a devastating realization: I now see that I
                am the object of a baleful Vistani curse. More tragically, the nature of this hex is such that I have
                not borne the brunt of it; instead, far worse, those who surround me have fallen victim to it!</p>
            <p>I have related the tragic story of how my only child Erasmus was taken by Vistani and sold to a vampire.
                I explained how Erasmus was made a minion of the night stalker, and how it was my miserable part to free
                him from that fate at the point of a stake. What I have neglected to illuminate before is how I tracked
                Erasmus’s kidnappers across the land, or how I “extracted” Erasmus’s whereabouts from them.</p>
            <p>In fact, the Vistani took Erasmus with my own, unwitting permission. They had brought an extremely ill
                member of their tribe to me one evening and insisted that I treat him, but I was unable to save the
                young man’s life. In fear of their retribution, I begged the Vistani to take anything of mine if only
                they would withhold their terrifying powers, of which I knew nothing. To my lasting astonishment, they
                chose to surreptitiously take my son in exchange for their loss! By the time I realized what had
                occurred, they were already an hour gone.</p>
            <p>Incensed beyond reason, I strapped the body of the dead young man to my horse and doggedly followed the
                Vistani caravan through the woods, naively allowing the sun to set before me without seeking shelter
                from the night. Shortly after darkness fell, I was beset by undead that would have slain me, had not
                their master—a lich—intervened and spared my life, for reasons that I do not completely understand. He
                somehow detected me and, with his powerful magic, took control of a pack of zombies that wandered in the
                forest. He spoke to me through the mouths of the dead things and placed a magic ward against undead on
                me, then animated the dead Vistana and bade it tell me where I could find its people. Unfortunately (I
                say in hindsight), the plan worked. I found the child-stealers, and my unwelcome entourage included a
                growing horde of voracious undead that could not touch me, thanks to the lich’s ward.</p>
            <p>When I found the caravan, I threatened to set the zombies on the Vistani unless they returned my dear
                boy. They replied that he had been sold to the vampire, Baron Metus. Something inside me snapped. I
                released the zombies, and the entire tribe was eaten alive.</p>
            <p>Yet the story has not ended. Before she died, the leader cursed me, saying, “Live you always among
                monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath their claws!” Even now, so many years later, I can hear
                her words with painful clarity. A short time later, I found my dear Erasmus made into a vampire. He
                begged me to end his curse, which I did with a heavy heart. The darkness had torn him from my loving
                arms forever, and I foolishly believed that the curse had exacted its deadly toll. I wept until an
                insatiate desire for vengeance filled the bottomless rift in my heart.</p>

            <p>Hail thee of might and valor:</p>
            <p>I, the Burgomaster of Barovia, send you honor—with despair.</p>
            <p>My adopted daughter, the fair Ireena Kolyana, has been these past nights bitten by a vampyr. For over
                four hundred years, this creature has drained the life blood of my people. Now, my dear Ireena
                languishes and dies from an unholy wound caused by this vile beast. He has become too powerful to
                conquer.</p>
            <p>So I say to you, give us up for dead and encircle this land with the symbols of good. Let holy men call
                upon their power that the devil may be contained within the walls of weeping Barovia. Leave our sorrows
                to our graves, and save the world from this evil fate of ours.</p>
            <p>There is much wealth entrapped in this community. Return for your reward after we are all departed for a
                better life.</p>

            <p>My knights have fallen, and this land is lost. The armies of my enemy will not be stopped by sword or
                spell, claw or fang. Today I will die, not avenging those who have fallen, but defending that which I
                love—this valley, this home, and the ideals of the Order of the Silver Dragon.</p>
            <p>The evil surrounds me. The time has come to throw off this guise and show these heathens my true fearsome
                form. Let it spark terror in their hearts! Let them tell their stories of dark triumph against the

                Argynvostholt. No doubt my bones will be scattered among my enemies like the coins of a plundered hoard,
