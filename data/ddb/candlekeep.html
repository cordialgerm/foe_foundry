    <p data-content-chunk-id="7228c5bf-3c86-425a-babd-2030d4210874"><em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em> is an anthology of
        adventures written by members of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons community. Each adventure begins with a book that
        the characters find in Candlekeep, an enormous library located on the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms
        setting.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a48d5fd7-0216-4fa1-b9fd-21bc69f9dde9"> If you’re not running a Forgotten Realms campaign,
        you can adapt the adventures in this book for other settings, substituting any large library similar to
        Candlekeep. Examples from other published D&amp;D settings include the following:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="80b6974b-cfea-4ed7-b6b2-40ae67f9c7ab">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="18af2d7d-5b36-4bce-bc8f-4e403e4886e5">On the world of Exandria, the Soltryce Academy
            in Rexxentrum (a large city on the continent of Wildemount) or the Cobalt Reserve in Westruun (a small city
            on the continent of Tal’dorei)</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="e5515572-b01f-420b-b8fa-5063a14aaf9c">On the world of Eberron, the Library of
            Korranberg in the nation of Zilargo, the University of Wynarn’s library in the nation of Aundair, or
            Morgrave University’s library in the city of Sharn</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="dbba9b33-1108-4cea-a25f-d82c5443e8f5">On the world of Oerth, the Great Library in the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f49b064e-b7b3-49a0-a638-2c3b3596eb28">The Candlekeep Mysteries table summarizes the
        adventures in this anthology. Each adventure is designed for four to six characters of a particular level, but
        you can adjust it for larger or smaller groups as well as for characters of higher or lower level by swapping
        one monster or trap for another, changing the number of foes in an encounter, and adjusting DCs to make
        important tasks easier or harder for the characters to accomplish.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7de850b8-d535-4dd5-8f5c-c1187a1e76f1"> Each adventure in this anthology embraces one of
        the following narrative conceits:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="315fd420-9220-4a40-84e9-965a2e209b62">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="90868620-ff10-4247-b8af-a2c2810ff19e">The characters discover a book in the library
            that contains a mystery. Getting to the bottom of this mystery requires embarking on an adventure.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="285cd2c4-7516-4766-b204-14d281a7221d">The characters come to Candlekeep on a quest
            for information, perhaps to solve a crisis elsewhere in the world. During their research, they uncover a
            book and the mystery it contains, which leads to adventure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ec7e0201-2753-4b1d-8885-c6976d4ff4c8"> These short adventures work best with players who
        like mysteries and discovering their secrets. That said, each adventure contains opportunities for exploration,
        roleplaying, and combat, to appeal to players of all persuasions.</p>

        players, have a candid out-of-game conversation with them about hard and soft limits on what topics can be
        broached in-game. Your players might have phobias and triggers you aren’t aware of. Any topic or theme that
        makes a player feel unsafe should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they
        give you consent to include it in-game, incorporate it with care. Be ready to move away from such topics and
        themes quickly if a problem crops up. It’s okay for characters to feel stressed and anxious, but your players
        should be relaxed and having fun.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="09d2e510-e58c-4ffe-a36c-95a37848b61d"> Most of the locations described in this book can be

    <p data-content-chunk-id="56ef3dc8-f05f-4161-a6d1-2bcbf8df5808"> Take the Lykortha Expanse, a cave network that
        figures prominently in one of this book’s adventures. You could situate these caves in any wilderness or
        Underdark setting where fungi are likely to be found in abundance. You can also modify the villain and its goals
        to better support an ongoing story or threat in your campaign. Conversely, you could remove the villain, keep
        the map, and repopulate the Lykortha Expanse with creatures that better suit the characters’ level or the
        particular story you want to tell. Sometimes a good map is all a DM needs!</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="745344b4-db81-459b-b3a0-b8b2af2dafcd">The world of the Forgotten Realms is one of high
        fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk. Steel-hearted adventurers from
        backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales that take them to strange, glorious, faraway places.
        Good maps and clear trails can carry inexperienced youths with dreams of glory far across the world, but these
        paths are never safe. Traveling throughout the Realms invites the perils of fell magic and deadly monsters.
        Farms and freeholds within a day’s walk of a city might fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the
        sudden wrath of a dragon.</p>

        <p>In the Forgotten Realms setting, a week is ten days long and is referred to as a tenday. There are three

        <p>Dalereckoning (DR) is the most common reckoning of years in the Realms. The adventures in <em>Candlekeep
                Mysteries</em> are presumed to take place in 1492 DR, but the exact date is not important.</p>

        <strong>Edited by Michele Carter and Hannah Rose</strong></p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2f0ce753-f6fe-4755-accd-a891fad05bab">Standing atop a rocky crag overlooking the Sea of
        Swords, the massive citadel of Candlekeep has endured the elements for centuries and defied the degradations of
        time. Visible for miles around, Candlekeep has an eye-catching silhouette: a high wall interspersed with towers.
        This wall encloses a large space from which more towers rise. Those who behold the edifice say it looks like
        nothing so much as a cake decorated with an overabundance of candles.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="04f6621a-3dad-4e3a-bf23-324da8116bae">The entrance to Candlekeep is a double gate that
        stands at the end of the Way of the Lion, the only road that provides access to and from the outside world. The
        route follows a lonely path across the peninsula where Candlekeep stands.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="64056b4c-5136-43ba-80db-5a9cbdb20e96">Those who gain entry discover a cloistered community
        of scholars milling around inside Candlekeep’s walls, a place of enlightened conversation and friendly debate.
        No better place in the Realms exists for those who have a love for or a need of knowledge and who want to pursue
        such interests alongside fellow seekers.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6271d48a-fa1d-4563-90b8-ea85f085df05">Candlekeep has the largest repository of written
        lore in Faerûn, including the collected prophecies of an ancient sage named Alaundo the Seer. Those compiled
        divinations make up a tiny fraction of the accumulated knowledge and secrets contained in the library’s vast
        collection.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2892307e-82eb-4455-8641-8b39740f14d2">Not all knowledge preserved in Candlekeep is of
        historical importance. The library holds thousands upon thousands of lost recipes, old songs, collections of
        folklore, and journals written by folks whose time has long since passed. The abundance of these ancillary works
        makes finding notable tomes an exercise in patience and perseverance. Fortunately, a legion of scholars and
        sages called the Avowed look after the library and remain vigilant in the care and cataloging of all the
        knowledge it holds.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6a6a8d2f-4037-43c2-b5c1-a9e434fe16e1">The required entrance fee for admission into
        Candlekeep is a work of writing not already collected therein. Those who show up at the gates without such a
        gift are kindly but firmly turned away.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9d039212-c47c-46c2-8567-2ecbc0b655a4">The enormous double gates of Candlekeep are three
        times the height of a human and wrought of black metal magically warded to foil attempts to damage them. Both
        doors are emblazoned with the sigil of Candlekeep. One of the two gates stands open far enough to admit visitors
        during the day, and the other is kept shut.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f4205fca-8a5f-4e3f-aa69-b4d7af1d6d45">Bedecked in purple vestments, five Avowed <a
            class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16985-priest"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16985-tooltip">priests</a> of Deneir (god of writing) oversee the front gates,
        examining and discussing written works presented by hopefuls trying to gain entrance. If a question arises, the
        Avowed send a runner to consult with a sage in the library. The runner eventually returns bearing a missive of
        acceptance or denial. Visiting scholars experienced in this procedure often bring a selection of possible
        donations to ensure admittance. Despite the stringent entrance requirements, the Avowed do accept rare editions
        of tomes already in the collection, journals of those who recount unique or insightful experiences, or the odd
        work that has been annotated by a prominent scholar outside the library. Once granted admission, visitors
        quickly discover that it’s wise to assemble a “wish list” of works that members of the senior staff are
        interested in collecting, potentially reducing the guesswork of readmission on future visits.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a9e606f1-70a2-46de-b368-dbc42f12a4c0">Those admitted to Candlekeep, referred to as
        seekers, can request the assistance of an Avowed adjutant who acts as a guide and research assistant for the
        duration of their visit. This guide has access to all the resources of the library, with the exception of the
        vaults that contain the rarest and most dangerous works. Seekers can appeal to higher-ranking Avowed for
        permission to peruse these off-limits works.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="153c904f-1bcb-4479-abf1-f5eee2107316">Numerous magical defenses protect the library. The
        most innocuous include wards to protect the library’s books from mold, weevils, and other threats. Other
        protections are more dramatic, as discussed below.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6776672e-7d4e-4a94-809f-ff7ccbbf6fb6"><em><strong>Magic Restriction.</strong></em> Wards
        prevent anyone from entering Candlekeep by any route other than through the front gates. Any attempt to
        magically bypass these gates fails. These wards do not prevent creatures from using magic to exit Candlekeep.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7ba9f1e7-41ed-4de3-b558-6525b5108045">Anyone who tries to fly over the wall into
        Candlekeep is stopped short. Magical flight is dispelled, and the subject floats slowly to the ground fifty feet
        outside the gates. An intangible ward forces creatures that can fly naturally to either land or circumnavigate
        Candlekeep altogether. Ordinary birds are unaffected by this ward, and a clever wizard or other individual can
        bypass the ward by assuming the form of a Tiny bird. The Avowed don’t discuss this flaw with outsiders, but
        anyone who can see the gulls flying over Candlekeep can easily reach the conclusion that certain creatures are
        exempt from this magical restriction. </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8347ee87-918c-48b5-ab1d-bfc2aa8c04a3"><em><strong>Fire Suppression.</strong></em> Flames
        larger than a candle are suppressed within the keep. (The fireplace in the Hearth, Candlekeep’s tavern, is an
        exception.) Thus, any spell that creates fire is wasted if it is cast within the keep.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8902b021-b4fd-40c3-a3c3-8a643f474d01"><em><strong>Theft Protection.</strong></em> Every
        book, scroll, and other work considered part of Candlekeep’s collection is magically protected against theft.
        Any such work that is removed from the keep disappears and immediately returns to its proper place in the
        library.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="065b078c-5977-48f0-bf47-379efc179b21">This ward also has a flaw that the Avowed don’t
        discuss with outsiders. If pages from a book or parts of a scroll are torn away, these fragments can be removed
        from Candlekeep as long as the bulk of the work remains in the library. Similarly, if a work is split into
        pieces and entirely removed from Candlekeep, only the largest piece disappears and returns to its proper place
        in the library.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="536b4bd6-add6-4745-9973-51b519a08f67"><em><strong>Shielding Mythal.</strong></em> From any
        location in Candlekeep, the Keeper of Tomes (see “<a href="#TheAvowed"

        activate a <em>mythal</em>—an exceptional, unbreakable magical effect—that envelops all of Candlekeep in a
        protective shield through which nothing but air and sound can pass.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="0286650c-40f7-4a48-aded-edcc006b9135">From outside, the Hearth appears to be a modest
        tavern of sturdy construction, with warm light emanating from a pair of small windows on either side of the
        front door. Upon entering the establishment, visitors quickly realize that it’s three times more spacious on the
        inside.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0350bc26-bd41-4b63-92fc-efefa3864050">The Hearth gained its larger dimensions courtesy of
        extradimensional magic created by worshipers of Gond (god of craft). An intricate clockwork device is suspended
        in a two-foot-diameter, faintly glowing crystal orb embedded in the ceiling over the bar. The Avowed call this
        device a geometric amplifier. It is the source of the magic required to maintain the integrity of the enlarged
        space.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="25099c03-9cb3-4247-a447-4e45e7cbd635">The bar seats up to twenty customers, and patrons
        can also be seated comfortably at round tables with stout wooden chairs or at rectangular tables with benches. A
        dozen soft, cushy armchairs encircle the fireplace in the center of the room.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ba938f38-5596-4093-9ec4-dc38da887371">The Hearth’s patrons are a mix of fresh-faced

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3f2285e2-2d5c-4ad7-bfb8-f48a2195c18d"><em><strong>Demiplanar Chambers.</strong></em>
        Several doors line the walls of the Hearth. Although visible from inside the taproom, they do not appear to
        exist when the structure is viewed from the outside. Each of these portals leads to a 30-foot-square demiplane
        that houses either a private meeting chamber or a shrine dedicated to Deneir (god of writing), Gond (god of
        craft), or Milil (god of poetry and song). Anyone can freely enter one of the shrines, but access to a private
        chamber requires a key from the barkeep and a payment of 5 gp.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5eda217f-52ef-4281-a248-cdc12cf1de2e"><em><strong>Meeting Chambers.</strong></em> Each of
        the meeting chambers is humbly appointed with a large round table and chairs, plus a pair of sideboards
        containing dishes and cutlery. The menu and beverage list are posted on one wall in case those inside want to
        order food and drink during their gathering.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b40c0f95-941b-4e4d-99e0-2280aa80cd37"><em><strong>Shrines.</strong></em> Each of the
        shrines is outfitted with a simple wooden altar, tables and benches for study and reflection, and suitable wall
        hangings. These adornments vary from deity to deity, but generally include beautiful tapestries telling key
        stories of the relevant deity or framed, illuminated scriptures discussing and illustrating the god’s key
        tenets.</p>

            by himself in a corner of the Hearth’s taproom, reading a book. </p>
        <p>A few years ago, the ogre was like many others of his kind—brutish and cruel. He met a halfling adventurer
            wearing the shiny gold headband and killed the puny runt for it. When the ogre attuned to it, the headband
            grew in size, enabling him to wear it. With an improved ability to reason and ponder, the ogre felt
            compelled to appreciate the error of his ways and seek out a better life. He adopted the name Little One, to
            honor the halfling whose life he cut short.</p>
        <p>Shunned by polite society, Little One came to Candlekeep hoping to learn as much as he could. He’s a quiet
            but popular fixture in the keep, and the Avowed are always saying hello to him and recommending new books
            for him to read. He is currently reading <em>Storm King’s Thunder</em>, by Scriers Phink. This book follows
            the exploits of a band of adventurers searching for a storm giant king named Hekaton, whose sudden
            disappearance caused great upheaval up and down the Sword Coast some years ago.</p>
        <p>You can use Little One to introduce your player characters to rare books such as the ones described in this
            adventure anthology. Little One doesn’t mind sharing whatever book he is currently enjoying.</p>

        author.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e15cc56d-16d7-4212-bcb0-4108bc1fb428"><em><strong>Nonmagical Tomes.</strong></em> The
        copying and binding of a typical book in Candlekeep’s library generally costs 100 gp or so (double for a
        translated version), though large books incur an additional charge. The manufacture of a facsimile takes weeks
        or even months for large tomes, so those who desire such a work must commission it in writing, provide payment
        in advance, and then return to the front gates to pick up the book or pay an additional price to have it
        delivered.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e10f4d6f-62cb-4ce9-9b81-4bba84e9f903"><em><strong>Spellbooks.</strong> </em>A copy of a

        3rd-level spells, four 2nd-level spells, and six 1st-level spells (20 spell levels total) costs 1,000 gp to copy
        over to a new book.</p>

        year, Candlekeep releases a small book stamped with the sigil of the library and credited to “The Avowed of
        Candlekeep.” These limited editions contain short essays, excerpts, and other writings relevant to a particular
        theme or subject, such as gardening, gemstones, longevity, or transformative curses. They are sold at the keep
        and by Candlekeep representatives in large cities for between 50 gp and 100 gp per book; speculators often

        beyond. The Inner Ward is off limits to seekers without special dispensation, which must come from the Keeper of
        Tomes, the First Reader, or one of the eight Great Readers. When permission to enter the Inner Ward is granted
        by such an individual, it’s customary for the beneficiary of this consent to receive a signed and sealed letter
        of admittance. The wax seal must be intact and unbroken when the letter is presented to the Keeper of the
        Emerald Door. The Keeper determines the letter’s authenticity by opening and reading it. If the letter passes
        muster, the Keeper returns it, opens the Emerald Door, and allows the letter’s owner to enter the Inner Ward.
        Unless a shorter or longer duration is specified in the letter, permission to occupy the Inner Ward lasts for a
        tenday, during which time the letter’s recipient can come and go as they please.</p>

        desired works and deliver them to the seeker’s preferred place of study in Candlekeep (usually a chamber in the
        Pillars of Pedagogy). Not all books in the collection can be checked out in this manner, however; the rarest and

        audible recordings from these magic gemstones. Each one holds a prophecy spoken by Alaundo himself in an
        antiquated version of Common that is incomprehensible without the aid of magic. These gemstones came to be
        called the echoes of Alaundo.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="07d402ae-5898-4c3a-8cb0-f5f44d6a21da"><em>The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces</em> was
        donated to Candlekeep with the rest of the library of the mage Fistandia, following her untimely disappearance.
        In her will, Fistandia bequeathed her collection to Candlekeep in appreciation for the many years she spent in
        its hallowed halls. This book is a treatise on extradimensional spaces similar to those created by the <a
            class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2362-mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2362-tooltip">Mordenkainen’s magnificent mansion</a> spell. This information
        alone would make it worthy of note, but Fistandia’s additions in the margins are even more interesting. In
        arcane shorthand, she details how she created a permanent <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
            href="/spells/2362-mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2362-tooltip">Mordenkainen’s magnificent mansion</a> spell and records the
        command word to open the mansion’s doorway.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="17cee923-7a88-42e1-86a6-2654a68ee624">Many researchers perused this book over the years it
        spent in Candlekeep, but knowledge of the command word was useless without the location of the gateway to the
        mansion—until a chance discovery by the sage Matreous, an expert in the application and removal of curses. Upon
        arriving at Candlekeep to further his expertise, Matreous cast <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
            href="/spells/2065-detect-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2065-tooltip">detect magic</a>, as was his
        habit. The spell revealed a gateway in the very study room he had been assigned!</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0f5b852b-9d3a-47ae-8244-cd86e4b52ff1">Forgetting about his earlier purpose, Matreous asked
        for any knowledge of who might have created such a gateway. Research by the Avowed revealed that Fistandia
        requested this room each time she visited the keep. They also turned up mysterious reports that she rarely left
        the room for weeks at a time. Rumors said that she was not even seen to eat or sleep during her visits. She
        would, however, go missing for hours at a time. Matreous concluded that she must have gone through the gateway
        during those absences. By searching through the books Fistandia donated to the library, he found the command
        word to open the portal and stepped inside.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="97130768-82eb-4fd4-a295-32d99cde352d">The characters have come to Candlekeep seeking aid
        for a stricken town, which could be the home of one or more of them. The settlement has withered this year.
        Crops have failed, the livestock stands in the fields like stick figures, and the rain has dwindled. A local
        mage determined that a curse had been levied on the land and recommended that the town seek aid from a sage
        named Matreous. After some inquiries, the mage found that Matreous was studying in Candlekeep and sent the
        characters to find him.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f763e0a5-5e9b-48f9-ab24-9d68fc4d91c5">Alternatively, the characters could discover <em>The
            Joy of Extradimensional Spaces </em>while researching one of the following topics:</p>

        are two mysteries. The first is the whereabouts of the missing sage Matreous. The characters can resolve this
        question by opening the portal to the mansion. The larger mystery, however, is how to escape once they are
        trapped inside.</p>

        of stone blocks. The floors are hardwood, and the bedroom, study, trophy room, and dining room have carpets that
        cover most of the floor space in those rooms. The mansion has brass or bronze fixtures and doors of ironbound
        oak. The furniture is all of deep brown wood, and most of the rooms are illuminated by oil lamps.</p>

        another command word, which Fistandia hid in the form of a puzzle. She created seven books, each with a single
        gilded letter on its spine. When placed next to each other in the proper order, they spell the command word,
        “liberty.” The books bear not only the lettered spines but also the same image of Mordenkainen that graces the

        to the research he conducted to find the mansion, he has the skills to keep the portal open from the other side.

        inches wide and nine inches tall. The brown leather cover is worn from time and use. The name of the book and
        its author, Mazfroth Gethur, are elegantly written in cursive with black ink on the first page. The care put
        into the front page, however, does not apply to the rest of the book’s contents. Mazfroth’s handwriting is messy
        and hasty, as if they couldn’t write down their thoughts fast enough. Furthermore, the book’s 151 pages don’t
        all match, indicating that the author kept adding more pages. The book’s stitching is haphazard, and looks like
        it could come undone at any moment.</p>

            directly, while divine spellcasters are granted access to it by their deities and ideals. Damage to the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="640f87c2-85b2-4a0a-abf7-0c2f67514fb8">A gingwatzim is a peculiar form of life created by a
        spell or a ritual. The magic that brings it into being draws on spirit energy from the Ethereal Plane to give
        the gingwatzim its true form—that of a luminous (but not too bright) sphere of ectoplasm roughly 3 feet in
        diameter. A newly formed gingwatzim appears as near to its creator as possible and follows its creator’s
        commands without question, using telepathy to communicate.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4053d5ec-31ed-4fd8-a4e4-695ca14792dd">A gingwatzim can assume two other forms that are
        determined by its creator at the time the gingwatzim comes into being. One is an exact duplicate of a Tiny
        nonmagical object that its creator is wearing or carrying. The gingwatzim’s other form is that of a specific
        Tiny beast.</p>

        taken the form of <em>Mazfroth’s Mighty Digressions</em> attacks the characters, it does so by assuming its true
        form and then using its Energy Drain action. A gingwatzim must feed on the life energy of other creatures to
        survive, but it can’t feed while in the form of a beast or an object, which is why it must revert to its true
        form first. Its other form is that of a bat.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="78f38d9d-8fa4-49ed-b860-3380bb5c4b36">This particular gingwatzim was instructed by its
        creator to remain in book form, but it hasn’t fed in days. Consequently, it tries to consume the characters'
        life energy and fights until destroyed. All the while, it terrorizes its prey with telepathic messages such as
        “Feed me!” and “Need life!” No trace of the destroyed gingwatzim remains, depriving Candlekeep of its copy of
        <em>Mazfroth’s Mighty Digressions</em>.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1dbce0f9-e6cb-4c1c-8a22-9e8a08b87379">The gingwatzim that attacks the characters was
        created by a jackalwere named Korvala, using a ritual taught to her by a now-deceased lamia named Nidalia.
        Korvala is the leader of the Amberdune Pack, a gang of jackalweres that sells books and scrolls in the markets
        of Baldur’s Gate. Korvala commanded the gingwatzim to take the form of <em>Mazfroth’s Mighty Digressions</em>,
        one of the more valuable books in her collection. This ruse enabled her to sell a copy of the book without
        giving up the genuine item, which Korvala is loath to part with.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="13d544cc-d3ab-46f5-a75c-4e0e47602c50">The Amberdune Pack remains fiercely loyal to
        Nidalia, even though she has been dead for months. Rather than corrupting and tormenting others, Nidalia
        preferred to collect books and scrolls. Though she was peaceful and compassionate, she was nonetheless killed by
        a group of adventurers. The jackalweres that survived fled with Nidalia’s heart and what books and scrolls they
        could carry.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="727f565b-dc45-4c99-9f1c-768b32b37dd8">With Korvala as their new leader, the pack began
        working on a way to resurrect Nidalia. It soon became clear that wouldn’t be a simple task. After all, the <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b309caa4-9e27-4ce2-be9a-e813c861c73d">The pack’s plan to sell books and scrolls, as well
        as gingwatzims disguised as books and scrolls, proved to be more challenging than they expected. Most of their
        profits are spent to help them survive in a city with more than its fair share of bribery and corruption.
        They’ve pinned their hopes on raising enough money to resurrect Nidalia before someone discovers their ruse, but
        they didn’t account for the possibility that some of their gingwatzims would end up in Candlekeep.</p>

        tenday-long visit by reading rare books and meeting likeminded people.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0aef5ca3-5a8d-42fb-beba-ea896fb584be">Yalerion can be found in the House of the Binder,
        socializing with other followers of Oghma. They sometimes read books in the Pillars of Pedagogy.</p>

            Digressions</em> was actually a monster in disguise.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="12292fea-7428-4fdd-b340-4ca0875058a8">If asked the right questions, Yalerion discloses the

        particularly elusive target. Her entrance gift wasn’t cheap, and she’s annoyed that it turned out to be a
        monstrous fake. She is helping the Avowed with various chores to make amends.</p>

            stall because she didn’t want to stay in the Wide for too long. (If the characters ask why, she says, “It
            reeks of greed.”) But she does remember it was in “not the most reputable” corner of the marketplace.</li>

                Hunger</em>, had revealed its true form, attacking and destroying a wizard’s homunculus. The wizard
            killed the monster before it could harm anyone else, but not before it turned into a spider and tried to
            scuttle away. When the monster died, no trace of it was left behind.</li>

        Upper City—home to the patriars, the wealthiest citizens of Baldur’s Gate. Visitors to this district find
        streets illuminated by magical lights, luxurious boutiques, and expensive restaurants. The elegantly dressed
        residents treat poorer people with great disdain. The Upper City is truly a place of exclusive decadence; a
        nightly curfew means that those who don’t live there must leave at nightfall each day unless they have a special
        token.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9f4f6597-6b20-4315-9c30-395c6689cd0b">Almost anything can be found in the Wide. Vendors
        can operate here without official licenses and taxation, as long as their wares are legal. Even so, the Wide is
        not immune to corruption: hefty bribes and reputations determine where every vendor is situated in the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="fa0440a6-5f19-443b-b70e-5c2fe53654ff">While working as booksellers in the Wide, the
        jackalweres are confident and happy to talk with customers. If they’re unexpectedly questioned without Korvala
        present, they quickly become nervous. Though their innate ability to lie means that they can easily behave
        deceitfully, the pack doesn’t cope well without leadership. The presence of Korvala comforts the other
        jackalweres. They admire her strength and guidance, and they defend her as fervently as they would Nidalia.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="36f6aac9-3219-4e04-a80a-a6a8245e2222">The Amberdune jackalweres are not hostile unless
        provoked. They attack only as a last resort, preferring to use their Sleep Gaze to subdue foes, then flee. They
        are notably more reluctant to fight spellcasters and characters using silvered or magic weapons.</p>

        fear in her enemies. Though normally calm and composed, Korvala becomes angry and combative when recalling the
        struggles she and her pack have experienced, including Nidalia’s death. Though she is a capable leader in her
        own right, the burden of taking over from Nidalia is a heavy one.</p>

        Korvala performs it. Nidalia’s <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2120-geas"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2120-tooltip">geas</a> spell forced Korvala to keep the ritual a secret, and

        ramshackle huts and flimsy tents—a stark contrast to the opulence of the Upper City. Merchants with wares too
        meager—or too illicit—to sell in the Wide make do with unregulated back alley markets here. The stench of

        the room and the characters are willing to hear her out, Korvala explains the Amberdune Pack’s motives to them.
        She believes in her plan and doesn’t feel the need to omit anything. Both her pain and her determination are
        evident in her steady voice and careful words.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2498d1ad-ecd2-410f-8bbd-71585f7ca497">If the characters ask Korvala about the monstrous
        books that wound up in Candlekeep, she shares the following information:</p>

        <li data-content-chunk-id="d77806bd-4927-4e76-864e-3d53e9f377bc">Using a ritual taught to her by Nidalia,
            Korvala can create creatures known as gingwatzims. (Korvala claims to be under the effect of a <a
                class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2120-geas"
                data-tooltip-href="/spells/2120-tooltip">geas</a> spell cast by Nidalia that prevents her from sharing
            this knowledge. This is a lie. Regardless, Korvala will not divulge the ritual.)</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="091f95c4-50fc-4322-8de3-1b9d719d5c91">Korvala can empower a newly formed gingwatzim
            to assume two other forms, allowing it to duplicate a specific object and a tiny beast. As an object, a
            gingwatzim can hide in plain sight. As a common beast, it can move about without attracting too much
            attention.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="ae9ab362-5cdc-417d-86ee-6f5083eae14a">A gingwatzim isn’t particularly bright, but it
            obeys the orders of its creator. The ones Korvala creates are instructed to remain in book form, but a
            gingwatzim must occasionally feed on the energy of the living to survive.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="2b9679d6-7cce-4e2f-89e3-2e7f1e596b1e">Korvala has created eight gingwatzims so far,

        <li data-content-chunk-id="2c649c13-4f76-42d6-8bfc-81888130ea75">Korvala never intended her gingwatzims to show
            up in Candlekeep. As reparations, she’s willing to surrender the original versions of <em>Mazfroth’s Mighty
                Digressions</em>, <em>The Dark Hunger</em>, and <em>Fallen Tethyamar</em> so that the characters can
            deliver them to Candlekeep. (Korvala keeps these books along with three others in <a href="#A6HiddenVault"

        Amberdune Pack gain the support of Korvala and the other jackalweres, as long as the characters hold up their
        end of the bargain. Furthermore, if the party is able to assist the pack in reviving Nidalia, such as by helping
        the jackalweres amass the money they need, they’ll also have a lamia as an ally.</p>

        of the Amberdune Pack have a potential enemy once the jackalweres finish licking their wounds. If the Amberdune
        Pack becomes a recurring adversary, consider having Korvala learn other rituals or spells better suited to
        fighting the characters to reflect this grudge.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e2d016e8-aceb-4e98-a42c-f23c0e3f80e3">The <em>Book of the Raven</em> arrived at
        Candlekeep, fittingly enough, by way of a raven in 1282 DR, the Year of the Many Mists. The raven bore the book
        in its talons, set it on the ground within Candlekeep’s walls, and pecked at its covers until an Avowed acolyte,
        witnessing this act of defilement, scared it away. The marred book quickly found its way into Candlekeep’s
        archives, where it garnered little attention until a visitor named Anil Zasperdes rediscovered it sixty years
        later and hid a treasure map inside it.</p>

        in a place where the characters are likely to find it. This raven contains the restless soul of a dead girl
        named Heluthe, who wants to frighten away the squatters in Chalet Brantifax, her former home. The raven can’t
        speak or make its intentions clear, but it hopes the map in the book will lead characters to the chalet, which
        is described later in the adventure.</p>

        the keepers of Candlekeep cataloged it as the <em>Book of the Raven</em> based on how it was received. Its

        made by pecking beaks. Bound with black wire between these covers are thirty-three pages that have yellowed with
        age and wrinkled from moisture. Each page bears tiny, blotchy brown script written in an unsteady hand by an

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1aaa12d0-192b-4fd2-bfbe-36f27ee2d06c">The <em>Book of the Raven</em> is the firsthand
        account (written in Common) of an anonymous author who, after falling off her horse and breaking her leg, was
        rescued and befriended by Vistani travelers who graciously nursed her back to health. The author and her horse
        traveled with the Vistani for three months, during which the author spent most of her time laid up in a Vistani
        covered wagon, where she took to writing this book to pass the time. Although a dozen Vistani are colorfully
        described in the tome, only two are mentioned by name: Drasha, a teenage girl who applied bandages and poultices
        to the author’s wounded leg, and Darzin, a one-armed boy with a terrible fear of wolves who sang beautiful songs
        to help the author take her mind off the pain.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="657332cb-4509-47dd-a47c-0a9ed274aef4">The book provides a detailed account of the Vistani
        way of life, with emphasis on their food and music. Their overland journey is also discussed, albeit from the
        viewpoint of one who spent most of it inside a covered wagon. The author describes rough roads, days of travel
        through impenetrable mist and thick forest, crackling fires on cold nights, wolves howling in the dead of night,
        and ravens pecking at the roof of the wagon in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="35cf57df-a665-48fc-ac46-e01f6817fa03">Late in the book, the author writes of being able to
        hobble about on crutches. She describes the cheery mood of her benefactors as the Vistani caravan traveled a
        winding mountain road to the gates of a tall, dark castle. The book ends with a description of the castle’s
        dreadful countenance. The writing abruptly stops on the third-to-last page, suggesting that the book was
        snatched from the author in midsentence. The last two pages are blank.</p>

        learn the following information about the Vistani:</p>

        <li data-content-chunk-id="484bb01f-9d16-41e5-b32f-e71fc72ea3cc">The Vistani are planar travelers often
            encountered in the Shadowfell, and they seem to be immune to the despair that besets all other visitors to
            that plane. They travel in horse-drawn, barrel-shaped wagons and have no permanent home.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="0f012584-ce74-4075-a694-6f470f13ab1b">The Vistani display their wealth openly as a
            sign of prosperity, sharing their good fortune with friends and strangers alike. Vistani resolve
            disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="8c281fe9-6ea1-47b0-9254-34344d5c6de9">Vistani families can be big or small, but each
            family is a gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder has most of the responsibility
            for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group’s travels, and preserving the
            Vistani way of life.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="b2d0cfd4-04df-4351-8ff3-6f1874a1e5d8">The Vistani have the power—some say gift—to
            travel through the mists that lead to forlorn realms within the Shadowfell known as the Domains of Dread,
            where creatures born in darkness dwell. This “gift” was thrust upon them by mysterious entities called the
            Dark Powers, as a boon for their kindness toward strangers.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="2f2c62ae-42ea-4b89-89f0-1ffca2854e2a">The Vistani believe that ravens carry lost
            souls within them. Hence, killing a raven is considered bad luck in Vistani culture.</li>

            Raven</em> has to do with the map Anil Zasperdes slipped between its pages. It’s clear that the map was
        never part of the book to begin with. You can photocopy and distribute the accompanying handout among your
        players when their characters find the map.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0371f69c-36b4-4bec-92d0-a066f5d877ad">Zasperdes was a wereraven who had a gift for hiding
        things. He was also the founder of the Scarlet Sash, a group of wereravens known for stealing magic items from
        evil individuals and hiding evil items from the world at large. He chose the <em>Book of the Raven</em> as a
        hiding place for the map because anyone interested in its subject matter might also be interested in following
        the map to its destination: a ruined chalet nestled in remote highlands.</p>

        Wytchway, a hamlet that serves as a starting point. Its location is left deliberately vague so that you can
        place it anywhere you like. The characters can find it by consulting sages or old maps in Candlekeep.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b9b41f0c-0979-44c4-8eaf-9281dddfc1ce">Monster attacks forced the residents of Wytchway to
        abandon the hamlet years ago. All that remains is a broken-down wagon surrounded by rotted fences and
        dilapidated, fog-shrouded farmsteads overrun with wild pigs.</p>

        which you can replace with some other tantalizing adventure location of your own creation. Little remains of the
        trail that once led to the chalet, which is depicted in the bottom left corner of the map, but the other
        landmarks are still present: rock formations called the Hand and the Horn, a tall outcropping of rock with three
        pine trees growing atop it, a river, a bridge, and a hill scorched by dragon fire.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="26c9ad40-f40a-4654-b283-934c972ede69">Flesh out the journey to the chalet as you see fit,
        adding one or more combat encounters appropriate for the characters’ level if the players are spoiling for a
        fight. The characters’ journey ends with a slog up a lonely hill, atop which is perched the chalet.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="82dde6f6-9c9f-4644-994e-8c0edd04f76e">This stone chalet was built for a wealthy noble
        named Baron Brantifax on a site chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty. In the years following the baron’s
        death, the house fell prey to neglect, allowing the Scarlet Sash to lay claim to it without dispute. The
        wereravens chose the place because of its remoteness and its proximity to a shadow crossing, which they monitor
        for evil activity. See the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#Shadowfell"

        the chalet and alight on the tombstones in its graveyard. They nervously stare and squawk at visitors but pose
        no threat to the characters; when night falls, the ravens fly off, and an eerie silence settles over the house
        until sunrise, when they return.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c95ee08f-1b67-4431-af0e-959e53ea2349">As the characters will discover, these birds are

        lanterns to light their way. These lights occasionally cluster in the upper stories of the tower (<a

        Scarlet Sash continue to use the chalet as a meeting place. They keep some robes, sandals, and scarlet sashes in
        the house so that they have clothing to wear while in humanoid form. They occasionally stash magic items of evil
        repute here until better hiding places can be found for them. Adventurers who come to the chalet expecting

        armed ones, and avoid direct contact with the characters for as long as possible. When they are no longer able
        to conceal their presence, the wereravens greet the characters in humanoid form, clad in sandals and dusty black
        robes with scarlet sashes tied about their waists, and assure the characters that they mean no harm. They assume
        that the characters have come for one of two reasons: either to loot the chalet or to use the shadow crossing in
        the graveyard. The wereravens assure them that there’s no treasure to be found in the chalet. If the characters
        act in a threatening or violent manner, the wereravens assume hybrid form or raven form and flee the chalet by
        the most expedient route, returning nevermore. (Other members of the kindness are warned to stay away from the

        other criteria for membership must find a patron in the Scarlet Sash or some other wereraven willing to turn
        them into lycanthropes. Any member of the Scarlet Sash who bestows the “gift” of wereraven lycanthropy on a
        character becomes responsible for that character’s conduct in the eyes of the other members of the kindness;

        require good roleplaying, and it could take days, weeks, or months for members of the Scarlet Sash to trust any
        characters enough to welcome them into their tight-knit circle.</p>

        <p>Vinique the wereraven stole this six-inch-tall sculpture from an evil merchant before it could be sold at
            auction in a major city. Carved from an ogre’s petrified heart, the gray figurine depicts the Demon Prince
            of Undeath in ghastly detail, clutching his skull-topped wand in one hand and three severed heads by the
            hair in the other. The figurine smells like decaying flesh, and this scent is detectable out to a range of 5
            feet.</p>
        <p>The figurine is a Tiny object with AC 17, 3 hit points, and immunity to all types of damage except radiant
            damage. A <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2064-detect-evil-and-good"

            the figurine has been desecrated. As long as it has at least 1 hit point, the figurine has the following

            <li>Dead creatures within 30 feet of the figurine can’t be brought back to life.</li>
            <li>A creature that holds the figurine while praying to Orcus for at least 1 hour has a 10 percent chance of
                summoning a smoky avatar of the demon lord. Once this avatar is summoned, it can’t be summoned again for
                30 days. Orcus’s avatar has the statistics of a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"

        (god of courage and self-sacrifice). The fourth painting is a portrait of Baron Brantifax seated in a chair,
        with a gray mastiff sleeping at his feet, and his wife standing by his side. Brantifax is depicted as a stout,
        well-dressed man in his fifties, with bags under his eyes. The baroness is shown as a tall, thin woman in her
        fifties. One of her hands rests gently on the baron’s shoulder, while the other grasps a small bouquet of roses.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2f4efd6c-6a3b-4576-be45-84c6d8e92f0e"><em>Shemshime’s Bedtime Rhyme</em> has been
        gathering dust on its shelf in Candlekeep for over six hundred years. The children’s book arrived at the library
        in unceremonious fashion, though the same could not be said of its courier. Yowen Pilt, a procurer of rare books
        who did business with Candlekeep, was delirious when he arrived with his latest bundle. The records of the
        episode are sparse, but they report that he was placed in isolation for weeks after a “singing malaise” began to
        spread among the library’s Avowed. The records contain no further mention of the book dealer. The Avowed
        cataloged and shelved his final delivery, which included <em>Shemshime’s Bedtime Rhyme</em>.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="06caa7f2-d7ef-4a99-8090-b2d26a84d712">The adventure takes place in the Firefly Cellar, a
        windowless basement beneath the House of Rest, so named because its only light comes from lamps lit by swarms of
        fireflies.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7a5ec546-0676-409d-9322-527a3f2af704">After spending the night here, all the characters
        wake up in the morning with the same tune in their heads, and each one hums it under their breath. They soon
        discover that the tune has “spread” to the Firefly Cellar’s other occupants, and the Avowed institute a
        quarantine to contain what is actually a curse. The adventure is built around a sequence of events that unfold
        when the characters are quarantined in Candlekeep’s Firefly Cellar with a handful of the library’s attendants,
        in an attempt to keep Shemshime’s curse from spreading throughout the entire library. The events describe
        Shemshime’s growing supernatural influence and how people deal with the mounting pressure of confinement under
        dangerous circumstances.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="300738f9-70e9-4996-a4ae-5dba2639d75e">The characters must identify the curse’s source.
        Their search eventually leads them to Crinkle, the Firefly Cellar’s kenku caretaker, who has the book.
        <em>Shemshime’s Bedtime Rhyme</em> contains the malevolent spirit called Shemshime, and the book holds the
        secret of how to stop it.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7bc94449-209f-4c26-a795-0f77709dd885">Discovering the book’s whereabouts is part of the
        adventure’s mystery. A kenku named Crinkle, one of the Avowed and the caretaker of the Firefly Cellar, became
        enamored with the book and hid it in her quarters. Though the book is not present at the start of the adventure,
        the characters must deal with the foul magic emanating from it.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BookDescription"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d3248d8a-d935-40b8-8b65-c962b3ab01aa">This children’s book is a mechanical curiosity of
        gnomish design, with a cover made of wood and copper. The front cover bears a faded, hand-painted rendering of a
        round millstone. The book is square, eighteen inches along each edge of the cover. A silver music box set into
        the book’s spine is heavily dented at one end.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="309deb3e-b455-4bce-95e7-66099902268d">The book has no pages in the typical sense, but it
        opens to reveal a pop-up cutaway illustration of a quaint watermill made of painted panels of wood, tin, canvas,
        and leather. It’s a clockwork device designed to animate four separate scenes while a music box built into the
        book’s spine plays a metallic tune that implants a rhyme in the minds of those who hear it (see the accompanying
        handout). The mechanized scenes feature cutout figurines of members of a family dying in a series of grisly ways
        as a shadowy figure looks on. The images are as follows:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="00d08d6f-556c-44a7-b6b2-ae8fece6f91c">

            the music box is repaired—shows the daughter defeating the shadow by crushing it under a millstone.</li>
    </ul>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="8a07b171-2b88-4ac6-8448-543a27565671">Centuries ago, a family living in a remote water
        mill endured a string of unfortunate events. A malevolent spirit called Shemshime attached itself to the family
        and caused the “accidents.” The daughter finally destroyed Shemshime by crushing it under a millstone that had
        been blessed by a traveling halfling cleric of Chauntea (god of agriculture).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="354d43fd-813d-47b7-80a3-9236999c43c6">The story became a local legend, a cautionary tale
        meant to warn people to keep their attention on their chores. When a traveling gnome bard heard the tale, he was
        so intrigued that he set the story down in the book, <em>Shemshime’s Bedtime Rhyme</em>. By doing so, he
        inadvertently created a conduit through which Shemshime could return.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c7db6187-4f57-4045-b72c-6203048ab4f0">Yowen Pilt procured the book from an adventurer who
        discovered it among the debris of a shipwreck. He brought the mechanical book to Candlekeep, where it has been
        ever since.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="0a874ddd-78c6-4a18-b111-a772a87d7a39">The kenku Avowed, Crinkle, loves to collect all
        kinds of curios and baubles. <em>Shemshime’s Bedtime Rhyme</em>, with its intricate mechanical workings and
        charming music box, was too tempting to resist. After years as the Firefly Cellar’s caretaker, she discovered
        the book when it was selected to have its spine repaired as part of a restoration project involving this part of
        Candlekeep.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ddd79904-68f1-4a8c-93b5-e0754e99188c">Before the adventurers arrive at the Firefly Cellar
        at the beginning of the adventure, Crinkle brought the book to her room (<a href="#F11CrinklesRoom"
            data-content-chunk-id="23a98d67-c08a-4cd0-87b7-1eb0263ebf4c">area F11</a>) and opened it. The music box
        started to play, and she became the subject of Shemshime’s curse.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eb0408ce-66b5-4e48-b864-6a2aa936da68">The rhyme is presented in the accompanying handout.
        Until the music box is repaired, it always skips back to the beginning of the song before playing the last
        stanza. That means the last stanza of Shemshime’s rhyme doesn’t get implanted in the minds of those who hear the
        song until the music box is fixed and the tune plays in its entirety. The missing stanza is as follows:</p>
    <aside class="epigraph">
        <p>See a daughter grinding grain</p>
        <p>Wish the spirit’s time was through</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="19fad986-5339-4362-950f-87ee6934747c">Those who hear the melody of the rhyme find it to be

    <p data-content-chunk-id="bf05d64a-e90e-45ea-8119-58ce4b2c1ced">The rhyme acts as a summoning ritual intended to
        restore Shemshime. When enough people join in the singing of the rhyme, or enough time passes while people are
        singing it, the ritual will be completed. As that occasion approaches, Shemshime’s power grows. Anyone who hears
        the cursed tune is in turn cursed to hum or sing it. They are then capable of transmitting it further.</p>

        beneath the House of Rest. Characters might find themselves drawn to this location for one of two reasons.
        Perhaps the House of Rest has had an influx of guests, and the characters are forced to stay in the only
        available rooms, which happen to be in the Firefly Cellar. Alternatively, the idea of taking lodging in an
        actual part of the library, close to a collection of ancient books, might be a compelling enough reason for the
        characters to stay there.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a3244afc-28bb-4d56-91dd-88f10a8429fd">The characters descend into the Firefly Cellar
        through the hatch in the ceiling of <a href="#F1TheStacksBalcony"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="717d86ad-0f0c-484e-8560-0082e55cc72a">When they arrive, they find the elderly elf Varnyr
        precariously balanced on a ladder while arranging a few of the flowerpots on top of one of the bookcases. She’s
        engrossed in her work. Before the characters say anything, she starts speaking without looking at them.</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>“Ebder, are you back?”</p>
        <p>“I never left!” grumbles a voice from below.</p>
        <p>“Oh?” The elf looks down and seems surprised at your presence. Then she says, indicating the room around her,
            “Ah. Visitors. I’m Scribe Varnyr. Sorry for the state of things. As you see, the restoration project is a
            work in progress. I’ll be with you shortly.” She returns to her work. A moment later, she says, “Actually,
            would you mind bringing that stack of books downstairs to Ebder? I’ll meet you there.” She points to a small
            pile of books on a stool. “Thanks so much.”</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="fd43749d-ffc0-49ce-af91-c757fed199fa">Ebder gives his name if asked. If the characters
        present him the pile of books, he pinches the bridge of his nose with a sigh and explains that the books are not
        for him but for the other guest, K’Tulah, who’s staying in one of the rooms below. He gives the characters
        directions to her room (<a href="#F13KTulahsRoom"
            data-content-chunk-id="d01fddc6-da48-46fd-9c10-6cf0dcf3da3d">area F13</a>) and asks them to deliver the

        apologetically says that she’s exhausted from the day’s work and they will talk in the morning. She offers areas

        the characters to stay the night. Behind her is Crinkle with a tray of food for them. With that, Varnyr bids
        them good night and leaves the characters alone.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8d40b936-95bf-443c-b940-fccacc779117">The characters can look around the library, talk
        with Ebder for a few more hours, or go to their rooms. Ebder isn’t much of a conversationalist, but he warms up
        if anyone asks about his daughter, Gailby.</p>

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>After your first night in the Firefly Cellar, you gather around a table in the center of the collection’s
            main floor. It’s quiet, until you notice that your companions are humming a melody under their breath—the
            same tune that’s been stuck in your head since you woke up. After a moment, you realize that you too are
            humming along.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="add872d0-fcc0-4dc5-9dd8-e47a7a893fc0">The characters are humming Shemshime’s rhyme. They
        don’t know it by name, and though they all hum it perfectly, they’re not entirely certain they knew it before
        today. Unknown to the characters, the cursed tune spread to them when Gailby Smallstone sang it in the hall
        outside the characters’ room after she heard it from Crinkle.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ffd59c84-1798-4a51-8cf2-66e977268032">K’Tulah and Ebder share the table with the
        characters. Ebder is reading from the same book he had last night. The humming clearly bothers him, and after a
        short time, he sternly asks the characters to keep quiet in the library. If the characters try to stop humming,
        they notice they can’t do so without conscious effort (see “<a href="#ResistingtheRhyme"
            data-content-chunk-id="81d6360c-f35e-4da1-895e-8ff1c1a10f1e">Resisting the Rhyme</a>”).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4b4033ba-0a52-4ca5-9c2d-530402849eb8">After a few minutes, Ebder begins humming the melody
        as well, though he is unaware of it at first. Moments later, the hatch in the ceiling of the upper floor (<a

        shut, followed by the sound of several mechanical locks engaging. Varnyr, the senior-ranking Avowed in the
        place, has locked the hatch, sealing herself, the characters, Ebder, Gailby, K’Tulah, and Crinkle inside the
        Firefly Cellar.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e41a9a60-fa28-43c3-aaad-1765514184af">As she descends the spiral staircase to <a

        cursed tune in a soft voice. With effort, Varnyr suppresses her humming and shares the following information:
    </p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>“When I first arrived at Candlekeep, the Avowed were concerned about a ‘singing malaise.’ A book merchant had
            been afflicted with it and was put in isolation after several Avowed began singing the song as well.” She
            pauses and frowns. “I don’t know what happened to him or the others. That was six hundred years ago.”</p>
        <p>She gathers her composure and adds, “I’ve alerted the Avowed and sealed the exit to stop whatever this is

    <p data-content-chunk-id="0103bb70-b34d-4298-ba9c-cb5d81c3f470">Varnyr refuses to speculate about the “malaise,”
        since she’s not a spellcaster and doesn’t want to guess at the cause without evidence. “But perhaps you can find
        an answer in all this,” she says, waving at the disheveled room.</p>

        by one character or multiple characters working together.</p>

        Shemshime’s maddening whispers in their heads. After making an ability check to fix the music box, regardless of
        whether the check succeeds or not, a character must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw, taking 14 (4d6)
        psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

        <p>The book trembles, and its mechanical inner workings squeal to a halt for a moment before whirring back to

        some effort. Because Shemshime is fixated on the book, the spirit pursues whoever has it. In other words, the

        an action to drop or topple a heavy object on it. Shemshime must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to
        avoid being crushed under the object. On a failed save, Shemshime vanishes and one of the following outcomes
        occurs:</p>

            pulled into the nearest closed book, ending the curse. That book transforms into a copy of <em>Shemshime’s

        contain the book collection. Despite its age, the cellar appears well kept, with smooth stone walls and worn
        wooden floorboards covered here and there with new rugs. The only entrance is a metallic orange hatch set into
        the ceiling at the top of the stairs that lead down into area F1.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b952cae5-da11-4751-85e8-a2ff5d4277dc">The bottom floor contains a kitchen and living

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>The circular room contains curved, dark wood bookcases packed with books of assorted shapes, sizes, and ages.
            Flowers in ceramic pots line the tops of the shelves, giving the area a sweet fragrance. Alcoves are spaced
            at regular intervals around the perimeter of the room. Four of them contain polished bronze statues of
            bespectacled scholars, and three hold overstuffed chairs. In the center of the room, a brass railing
            surrounds an overlook that gives a view of the lower level of the stacks.</p>
        <p>Hanging from the ceiling, above the opening in the floor, is an enormous stone sculpture of an open book that
            looks as though the cover is flapping to keep it aloft. A spiral staircase to the east leads down, as well
            as up to the trapdoor exit set into the ceiling. The occasional errant firefly flits about.</p>
    </aside>

        it’s tidier and more welcoming than the chamber below. She has brought in rugs and flowers and polished the
        statues. Three of the statues were in such a poor state that she replaced them with comfortable reading chairs.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="aa1080f2-57e5-4fe1-9e1a-20ad0cbaf911">The bookcases are 10 feet tall, and each one has a

        rope-and-pulley mechanism with a fraying basket at one end is fixed to the railing. Centuries ago, the Avowed
        put it here to move books between floors. It’s essentially a large lidded wicker basket that can be lowered or
        raised. It’s not in the best condition, so it holds a maximum of 50 pounds without falling apart. The box is
        currently raised, and the rope is tied to the railing.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="69afd18f-8eef-4a42-8880-adbb51a4328b">Characters who search the book lift find two small

        This piece of stonework is 12 feet across and weighs 1,500 pounds. The cover is etched with the words “BE
        CURIOUS.” It’s suspended above area F2 by three chains, but the chains’ fittings in the ceiling beam above are
        in bad shape. If 200 pounds or more are added to the weight of the sculpture, the chains come out of the ceiling
        and the sculpture falls. Alternatively, striking the chains with enough force to break them makes it fall. Each
        chain has AC 19, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</p>

        <p>The musty smell of old books hangs in the air here. Concentric rings of bookcases dominate the space, with a
            heavy granite table occupying the room’s center. The table would be a circle, but for six semicircular gaps
            cut into it around its edge, creating spaces for six chairs. Small stacks of books rest on the table along
            with a candleholder that contains firefly-filled jars.</p>

        quiet reading. The shape of the table creates six individual study spaces. The table weighs around 300 pounds,
        and four rolled-up indigo rugs rest underneath. Varnyr intends to use the 15-foot-long and 5-foot-wide carpeting
        as runners in the north, east, south, and west aisles on this floor.</p>

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>All around, fireflies float lazily about like embers caught in the air. Three writing desks sit against the
            north wall, with a sheepskin rug beneath each one. On one of the desks rests a book beside a stack of paper,
            along with a stoppered ink jar and a porcupine quill pen. Another desk has a leather case on it. A moldering
            tapestry hangs, off-center, on the west wall. To the southeast is a wood-paneled wall with a closed door set
            into it. A weak yellow glow emanates from under this door.</p>

        texts. The three desks are of fine quality but could use maintenance. Ebder works here to create new copies of
        books deemed unrepairable. The book on the desk has a bookmark poking out from its pages. It’s an ancient tome,
        its title worn away over time. Its pages fall out if it’s opened. The leather case on the other desk contains a

        be disturbed. A character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, or it can be destroyed. The

        fell into the hands of the archivists and librarians of Candlekeep as part of a collection of works recovered
        from a ruined keep in Tethyr, far to the south. It describes a conflict between a settlement of grippli
        (froglike humanoids distantly related to bullywugs) and an invading force of yuan-ti. The explorers who found
        the Book of Cylinders and bore it safely to Candlekeep claimed it wasn’t a historical account, but a warning of

    </p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>“Candlekeep has long relied on a community of grippli to the north for fresh seafood. These frogfolk capture
            and raise giant crabs as livestock in an offshore cluster of pens they have erected just outside their
            village, then trade the meat and other salvageable parts for items they can use, particularly those made of
            metal or glass. Candlekeep has long been a steady customer, but over the last several tendays the grippli
            have become less and less active, and the supply of food has been all but cut off. To make things worse,
            rumors have arisen about serpent creatures being seen near the Cloakwood and the grippli village.”</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cbad5350-d412-4f0c-8d74-970aef69c198">Pelk tells the characters that this news came by way
        of Mitor Jans, a ship captain who makes a living transporting crab meat to Candlekeep. Pelk also reveals that
        Jans, eager for shipments to resume, has volunteered to take adventurers by sea to a trading post where they can
        meet with the grippli leader-in-exile, if they decide to undertake the quest to help the frogfolk.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="31215bbc-539b-4baf-abfb-d19c7b803add">Pelk informs the characters that the Avowed are

        <p>“This book was brought to Candlekeep several years ago. The explorers who found it claimed it was not a

    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bb4d07dd-01fe-4ba3-88b2-178076c871ea">Pelk allows the characters to inspect the book. It
        is surprisingly light, and brief examination shows it to be a cunningly contrived container. Its covering is
        made of supple leather reinforced with thicker strips of hide. Opening the cover reveals three intricately

        and simple images, apparently telling a story in three parts. If the characters can’t figure out what the
        cylinders have to say, Pelk or another staff member at Candlekeep can give them instructions.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bb04d47d-317b-4574-995e-aee7dbcf2a9e">The first step is to remove some of the clay from
        its bag and mix it with water to form a thick paste, then spread the wet clay in a thin layer on a flat surface.
        Rolling one of the cylinders across this surface presses the writing into the clay and makes it readable. After
        repeating the process for each of the cylinders, the characters have the full story and can use that knowledge
        to determine what they do next.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="49d09480-5b0a-413c-a113-4c0fd14f05b6">The impressions in the clay are mostly characters in
        the Dwarvish script, combined with simple pictographs that tell a tale about the frogfolk and the serpentfolk.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="675897a8-5735-458e-af54-f0a1cd49a2c8">The first cylinder shows and explains how the
        grippli became skilled at harvesting giant crabs, which are loaded onto seagoing vessels and taken away while
        the frogfolk celebrate their newly earned wealth.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1439362c-8027-454e-87ee-92b3354743be">The second cylinder’s story begins with serpent
        creatures lurking ominously outside the grippli village. Then the serpentfolk rush forth, capturing or killing
        any of the frogfolk who try to stand against them. As the village falls into disarray, the giant crabs escape

            off, people who returned to Candlekeep from a trip to the grippli trading post reported that a small band of
            yuan-ti had taken up residence at an old temple site where the grippli village used to be located. These
            serpentfolk, unlike others of their kind, are friendly toward the grippli, and the frogfolk are helping them

        whatever information they have gleaned, that the grippli trading post is the first stop on their mission. The
        trading post is on the coast, due west of the Cloakwood and roughly 90 miles north-northwest of Candlekeep by

        Jans tells them that he and his ship, the <em>Dog Ear</em>, have made the trip from Candlekeep to the trading
        post and back again more times than he can count. He and his crew know exactly where to sail to avoid undersea
        hazards and stay on the most efficient route. If the characters are suspicious of Mitor’s motives, a successful

        the road that leads inland (east) from Candlekeep. That road intersects with the Coast Way, which runs north
        along the eastern edge of the Cloakwood. About 50 miles north along the Coast Way is a trail that runs west into

        miles in total, takes at least seven days to traverse by foot, and at the end of it the characters will be
        entering the village before they visit the trading post. Both of those facts might have a marked effect on how
        the adventure continues (at your discretion). In addition, you might pit the characters against some random

        strangers but forced by circumstances to consider outside help. The warriors of the village and its leader, Pond
        Mother, are doing all they can to protect the grippli who have taken refuge at the trading post, and they cannot
        mount a counterattack against the evil yuan-ti, who have already killed several grippli for trying to stand up
        to them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f44f2cbb-292a-408d-835c-016f8c030e53">Assuming the characters traveled by ship to reach
        the trading post, the grippli guarding the dock watch them carefully but don’t speak right away. Grippli have
        difficulty voicing the language of humans, so they speak in Primordial. (Mitor Jans has some fluency in
        Primordial and offers to be an intermediary if needed.) As long as the characters are nonhostile, the grippli
        will allow them to disembark.</p>

        If the party seems trustworthy, she speaks to them. She prefers Primordial (it’s easier on grippli vocal cords)
        to address outsiders, but she can speak Common if there are no Primordial speakers in the group.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="96aa492a-44f2-45b6-b3f3-dc4165102202">She informs the party that a small band of yuan-ti
        arrived in the area over a month ago, claiming to be followers of a benevolent deity they called the Scaled
        Mother. They were friendly, the opposite of other yuan-ti that the grippli had encountered and fought with.
        These yuan-ti expressed interest in excavating and restoring the previous site of the grippli village, a mile
        from its present location. Pond Mother saw no reason to refuse them, since their motives were seemingly
        innocent. But then, two tendays afterward, another group of yuan-ti came on the scene. These yuan-ti attacked
        the village, killed any frogfolk who tried to resist, and captured the grippli who weren’t able to escape.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5d49f690-6f26-43d0-a110-32f4ddeb4917">She asks the characters for help, telling them that
        the yuan-ti have been eating their eggs and tormenting the few grippli who remain in the village. Nothing has
        been heard from the friendly yuan-ti since the larger force of evil ones descended on the village. Pond Mother
        fears that either they have been disposed of, or they have been imprisoned in the old temple that lies north of
        the village. In any event, saving the eggs, or as many of them as possible, is the grippli’s main concern.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="82b61975-2b6b-4409-b0b7-49311b0c7f97">If the characters demand payment, Pond Mother can
        offer the modest contents of the trading post’s coffers (200 gp) for clearing out the village and safeguarding
        the eggs. She points out that the characters are also entitled to keep any items of value that don’t belong to

        route, fraught with obstacles and perils.) Mitor Jans will transport the characters as far as he can, then drop

        wide enough for two Medium creatures to walk side by side, while the smaller branching ones are wide enough for
        only a single person. Interspersed through this web of rickety wood and netting are processing platforms built
        around the stone columns, each large enough to hold four creatures. Under the water, in open-topped cages made
        of netting, lurk a great number of giant crabs that haven’t been fed recently. As the characters start to make
        their way to shore, the water begins to froth as the giant crabs become excited.</p>

        lagoon on the other side from rough water when a storm is raging. This breakwater is made of intertwined
        branches reinforced by tough vines. Hinged on the sides and split in the middle, it can be opened to allow the

        building made of wood and mud bricks has been turned into a prison where the evil yuan-ti are holding some of
        the followers of the Scaled Mother. The hemispherical building, 20 feet high and 50 feet in diameter, is by far
        the largest structure in the community.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2d81a504-ca34-4a58-aea5-a07e76aace61">The ground level contains a pool of water in the
        center, directly beneath an opening in the roof of the same size. The marshy ground around the pool serves as an
        assembly area for group ceremonies. Two staircases on opposite sides of the dome lead up to the second floor,
        which is divided into four chambers, each about 10 feet square. Three of these rooms currently hold a total of
        ten wounded <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17123-yuan-ti-pureblood"

        and comes into their view, whereupon they all rush to attack. The prisoners, even if they’re left unattended,
        won’t leave their cells willingly while combat is going on.</p>

        prisoners, the benevolent yuan-ti explain what they know of the situation: they are allies of the grippli who
        have been victimized by the evil yuan-ti that invaded the village recently. They know from their captors that
        two of their number have been hauled through the marsh northward to the location of a temple in the old village,
        where they are to be sacrificed to the evil deity Sseth sometime soon.</p>

        20-foot-diameter circular areas. These repositories, filled with clean, fresh water, are where the grippli lay
        their eggs and nurture offspring as they mature.</p>

        grippli to tend the eggs, which is why the eggs haven’t all died since the arrival of the serpentfolk. This
        permission could be an act of mercy, or it could just be that the yuan-ti like to eat the eggs: each of the
        malisons has been consuming at least one egg per day, and always within sight of one or more of the grippli for
        no reason other than cruelty.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3b6dc5fb-9f51-484b-af05-6a434b211d69">All six yuan-ti are languishing on the ground
        between the pools and don’t react until at least one of them becomes aware of the characters. If one of the
        malisons remains alive after 3 rounds of combat, it pours a vial of poison into the water of one pool, which
        kills all the eggs in it. On each succeeding round, if the characters don’t prevent it, the same creature moves
        to poison a different pool until it is vanquished or until all the eggs have perished.</p>

        live in each home, which consists of a single medium to large room, lit with simple fish oil lamps. Grippli
        don’t sleep in the water, but in soft hammocks suspended over it. Their personal effects are secured to the
        walls above the water in netting. Furniture is of simple but well-crafted wood, or adapted driftwood. Some homes
        have ceramic and glass jars (obtained through barter) and bronze pots and pans (likewise), used on occasions
        when the grippli want to cook something before eating it.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="73bcc3e3-ce9c-4278-9333-c952fc8d5bf2">The old village was abandoned when the grippli
        realized they would fare better being closer to the water. They relocated to where the village now stands. The

        the Scaled Mother had begun to excavate the temple ruins, hoping to find evidence of their benevolent deity. The
        work is continuing under the rule of the evil serpentfolk, but it’s slow going. Several grippli have been forced
        to continue digging the place out, while their masters stay inside the part that has already been opened up.
        It’s here that preparations are being made for the sacrifice of the yuan-ti’s prisoners.</p>

        be able to escape the notice of the grippli prisoners. But the frogfolk know enough to remain silent in the face
        of potential rescue, and they use hand signals to direct the characters toward the courtyard. From there, the

        preparing to strike it. As the characters take in the scene, the abomination is studying the script on the
        sarcophagus intently, engrossed in what it sees. At a gesture from the abomination, the chime is struck. As it
        rings out, the seam around the lid of the sarcophagus glows brightly for an instant. Then the sarcophagus comes

        With fast action and accurate attacks, the characters can interrupt the ritual and prevent further harm to the
        victims. The abomination must use two of its turns to finish performing the ritual, which climaxes with one more
        sounding of the chime as the lid is thrown open. If the abomination takes any damage before completing the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="fefd255d-450d-4e88-b197-366e70a881cd">When the abomination and its malison minions fall,
        the captured yuan-ti are overcome with joy. They tell the characters that they hail from a land to the south
        called Chult. They were called into service by the deity they know as the Scaled Mother and followed her
        portents as they traveled north. They began excavating the old temple, with the grippli’s consent, in the
        expectation of finding relics left behind by the yuan-ti that raided through this area in ages past. They were
        unable to open the lid of the sarcophagus once they unearthed it and were in the process of clearing rubble from
        the courtyard stairs when the evil yuan-ti descended on the village and captured all the followers of the Scaled
        Mother.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7c8f1ab1-ee29-4840-82cf-cd1433c0a803">With the threat to the area neutralized, it doesn’t
        take long for things to return to normal. When the grippli prisoners realize that the characters have
        persevered, they waste no time getting the news to the village and the trading post. The refugees return home,
        and within a tenday the frogfolk have repaired any damage to the crab pens and are back in business.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1a27cc71-5d62-469f-bbcd-b362f36f82b8">The benevolent yuan-ti, once they recover from their
        wounds, might decide to continue digging out the temple or to return to their homeland, as you see fit. If the
        excavation goes on, you can populate the lower level of the temple with treasures or traps at your discretion.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="84b9f8ab-5cde-4bc2-bdd4-178a610b3401">If the characters journeyed by land and went
        directly to the temple after spending little or no time in the village, the now-freed grippli prisoners explain
        that other evil yuan-ti are stationed in the village, and they too need to be dispensed with before the grippli
        can reclaim their homes.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f4979559-76f2-4671-b42d-3828425177c3">Having done what they came to do, the characters are
        free to take their leave of the grippli anytime; once regular traffic resumes between the trading post and
        Candlekeep, the heroes have no trouble finding a ship that will carry them back to the library.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e458188c-f777-4e84-a6aa-448cb659f342">In the meantime, if the characters prevented one or
        more eggs in the brood pools from being killed, the returning grippli are so ecstatic that Pond Mother offers to
        perform a ceremony for the party’s benefit, called the ritual of friend marking. If they agree, they are brought
        to the pool in the center of Pond Mother’s home at midnight. The grippli, croaking sonorously, surround the
        characters while they stand in the warm water and Pond Mother pours the contents of a jar into the pool. The
        liquid swirls, and motes of light begin rising up around the characters. Any party members who have second
        thoughts at this point can avoid the effect by succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Party members who
        don’t resist, or who fail their saves, fall into a trance until dawn—when they come to their senses, completely
        rested and healed. All party members who completed the ritual can speak and understand the Grippli language from
        now on.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="038e8a81-14d0-487f-95a3-73550e0e5327">At first glance or from a distance, a grippli looks
        like a large frog. Its head and body are indeed those of a frog, but its front extremities end in hands with
        fingers that enable it to manipulate weapons and other objects, and its rear legs have similar digits that it
        can use for grasping and climbing. A grippli can move as quickly on all fours as it can on two legs.</p>

        rely on ambushes and guerrilla warfare to defend themselves and their settlements. They can snare foes with
        their tongues to make them easier targets. Grippli villages are generally built from mud bricks and other
        natural materials harvested from the immediate vicinity.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c4d3dfd4-f289-49a7-adab-bb47561c6c95">Young grippli are raised by the community rather
        than by a single set of parents, and all of a community’s eggs are kept in freshwater pools until they mature.
        Protecting their eggs is a major concern for grippli, since lizardfolk, yuan-ti, and other creatures are known
        to have a taste for them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="57bcd455-b392-4e66-8ec6-6bd29b8187dc"><em><strong>Close to Nature.</strong></em> Most
        grippli care more about survival than they do about abstract ideals such as good and evil. Grippli religion is
        based in animism and nature spirits; the frogfolk do not pay reverence to a single deity, but they might beseech
        a particular nature spirit for aid from time to time.</p>

            Characters</strong><br> <strong>Written by Derek Ruiz</strong><br> <strong>Developed &amp; Edited by Scott
            Fitzgerald Gray</strong></p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="87295527-f75e-4f99-ab53-b1772f4fa250">In this adventure, the characters are caught up in
        an unsolved mass killing in the city of Waterdeep—after the ghost of one of the victims seeks them out.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ef312a19-3fc6-46cf-afe1-2b4a3ddd5d08"><em>Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor</em> came to
        Candlekeep five years ago, courtesy of a Waterdavian apprentice mage named Sirok, who bought the book at a
        street sale. It was part of a collection once owned by the renowned Yellowcrest family of Waterdeep. As he
        presented the book as payment for entry into Candlekeep, Sirok told the Avowed priests a grim story of how the
        patriarch of the family, Lord Yellowcrest, had returned to Waterdeep from a business trip to find his wife,
        their three children, and the house’s four servants all murdered. In the aftermath of this terrible loss, the
        grieving lord sold all his possessions, then moved away from the city to live out his life in solitude.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="34ccbb62-27d0-4730-8c74-6a8304293d1c">Sirok never got around to reading the book, and his
        story about the Yellowcrests was something he learned from gossiping acquaintances. The dark pedigree of Sirok’s
        donation was soon forgotten, and <em>Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor</em> was cataloged and placed into the library’s
        archives, where it has gone unnoticed ever since.</p>

            data-content-chunk-id="d7fa109e-7779-4c2b-a273-644bdf566b3c"></a>Beginning the Adventure</h2>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2f9d8b62-f126-4241-8c45-a5f3a9f6057a">The adventure begins when the ghost of a young woman
        named Sarah appears before the characters as they peruse the stacks of Candlekeep. The reason that Sarah’s ghost
        is able to manifest for the first time to the characters, after five years of silence, is left to your judgment.
        The spirit of the murdered woman might be drawn to a character who is dedicated to law or good, one whose
        background features a similar tragedy, or one who struggled to rise from poverty as she did. Alternatively, if
        one of the characters has a penchant for reading books from Candlekeep’s shelves at random, you might have Sarah
        appear because her story is being read for the first time since her diary came to the library.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6c9459cc-af87-4d18-8e24-3a174316796b"><em>Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor</em> is a nondescript
        general text, so it fits best in some forgotten corner of the library where tomes of no particular interest are
        stored. Read or paraphrase the following when you’re ready to begin the adventure:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>The air around you grows suddenly chilly. A cloud of vapor begins to shimmer along the nearby shelves,
            growing thicker around a nondescript leather-bound book. The mist suddenly coalesces into the vague form of
            a young woman—a translucent spirit wearing a servant’s uniform and bearing the symbol of a tree outlined by
            a rising sun at her shoulder.</p>
        <p>The figure weeps aloud, tears running down her cheeks. She opens her mouth as if to speak—which reveals that
            her tongue is gone. Moaning in anguish, she reaches toward you. Then the mist shreds away to nothing, and
            the spirit fades.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="92d6636c-3700-451f-be94-50cc4c03274d">The book’s title appears handwritten on the first
        page, and it is clear that all of its pages were once blank. Only a handful of pages at the end of the book
        remain so. The rest are filled with handwriting that starts out crude but slowly becomes more elegant, hinting
        that it was produced by a person learning to write, who then practiced their writing by keeping a diary.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="354c301d-8d44-448d-b741-0125d6ba32fa">The pages of <em>Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor</em> are
        a mixture of exercises, drawings, and reminiscences. The earliest pages bear nothing but repetitions of the name
        “Sarah.” Lists of household chores, pending activities, shopping lists, and names take up a full third of the
        book.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cafcb213-d214-43b3-9484-cf09a6bb26d5">Where the diary begins, the book becomes a firsthand
        account (written in Common) of the life of Sarah, who describes herself as a servant in the Waterdeep manor of
        Lord Viallis Yellowcrest and Lady Maria Yellowcrest. The diary entries are not on consecutive pages, and most
        are undated. In addition to writing about her daily obligations and life in the manor, Sarah also wrote about
        Lady Maria, who came from a poor family and empathized with Sarah’s own lack of education. Lady Maria’s genuine
        affection for Sarah led her to teach the young servant to write, and to give her the leather-bound book that
        became the diary.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="AGlimpseofDarkness"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="36af9385-aaa3-454e-b8f9-c92bceedc021">The last entries of the diary, dated just over five
        years earlier, change in tone as Sarah worries about the strange conduct of Lord Yellowcrest, and his habit of
        spending too much time with ancient books in his study. The final diary entry reads:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>I stole close to Lord Viallis today, and saw that he had chalked a circle marked with strange runes across
            the floor of his study. A puddle spread within the circle and appeared to me as bubbling blood. Lord Viallis
            stood next to it motionless, one of his vile books in hand, and muttered something I could not hear. I
            slipped away quickly, though I fear he might have heard me this time. I have never been so scared, but I
            must tell Lady Maria what I have seen. I must!</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f625620e-7da4-4294-aaaf-bb66ad1521d7">In her diary, Sarah tried to draw the image of the
        cover of an old tome Lord Viallis was reading. The sketch shows a monstrous creature with a bulbous head, long
        arms, tentacles for legs, and multifaceted eyes (see “<a href="#LordViallissTome"
            data-content-chunk-id="f083cc67-d17c-4a75-a310-a797edd6e4bc">Lord Viallis’s Tome</a>” later in the adventure
        for more information).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a015f0f2-4319-431d-a220-edcc73a58db3">Sarah also attempted to sketch what she remembered
        of the rune-marked circle. Any character who has proficiency in the <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="9356d271-292f-4699-94c1-7c596e088b86">A thorough reading of the diary reveals the broad
        details of the lives of Sarah and the Yellowcrest family. Alternatively, if the characters call Sarah back (see
        below) and are able to communicate with her, you can allow the poor servant’s spirit to reveal some of this
        information:</p>

    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4a627a35-297d-4e29-8bea-40154cf70405">The details of the murders at Yellowcrest Manor can
        be learned from a few hours’ research into recent Waterdeep history, or by consulting any scholar at the library
        who has an interest in that history or the noble families of Waterdeep. The public details of the dark event are
        well known:</p>

            business, then returned to find his wife, his sons and daughter, and the manor’s four servants brutally
            murdered. Shocked into a deep depression by the tragedy, Lord Yellowcrest left Waterdeep to be alone with

        Maria and the three Yellowcrest children—all murdered by Lord Viallis as part of his willing descent into evil.
        For five years, the young woman’s immortal spirit has been bound within <em>Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor</em>.
        Ever grieving, the spirit has had no way to communicate with the mortal realm—until the presence of the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c02de204-147a-4144-92f8-305c9d0ed9ae">Sarah understands characters who speak Common and
        tries to respond to them, but she can’t speak because Lord Viallis cut out her tongue before killing her. The
        ghost tries to communicate through moaning whispers and by pointing the characters to the parts of her diary
        that hint at Lord Viallis’s evil.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="79f32163-d4f3-44e1-935b-b02479c24aa5">Sarah’s ghost is bound to the diary and can’t move

    <p data-content-chunk-id="27528aa5-c58b-4abd-a2d6-8e9415938cee">Five years ago, Lord Viallis murdered his family,
        Sarah, and three other servants as part of a ritual to contact an otherworldly entity. The ritual was
        successful, and with the magic circle he had scribed, Viallis established contact with a Great Old One called
        Gaernoo. This aberrant patron offered to grant Lord Viallis arcane powers in exchange for establishing a cult
        dedicated to Gaernoo.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="25bded7a-b683-4d3c-bfdc-b9e57b0b7202">Lord Viallis, empowered by Gaernoo’s otherworldly
        magic and wanting to get away from talk of his family’s death, moved to the village of Greenfast, a day’s travel
        southeast of Waterdeep and the home of his business partner, Faerl. Claiming that he wanted to have his family
        interred close to him, he took the remains of his wife and children along, with evil intent. For the last five
        years, Viallis has been building a cult to Gaernoo around himself, calling it the Burnt Tongue Cult for the
        sacrifice that new members must make before being accepted.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e800f8e8-9d72-4e49-a9a1-48b1c1b7eeab">The crude sketch composed by Sarah shows the monster
        on the leather-bound cover of the book Lord Viallis was reading. This creature is a representation of the statue
        in <a href="#B7DarkChapel" data-content-chunk-id="62e08870-7f9c-4ccc-9d8a-a5fd9f6463ab">area B7</a> of the
        temple of the Burnt Tongue Cult. Knowing that Candlekeep is the best possible place to learn about a mysterious
        book, the characters can spend a day or two in diligent research to turn up references in other works to a book
        whose cover matches Sarah’s sketch—a tome called <em>Retribution of the Ancients</em>.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="582f268f-f919-4a08-ad91-688b7dfd8d3a">That work is not a part of Candlekeep’s collection,
        but several of the Avowed know it by reputation. It is a dark work of ritual magic, its contents potentially
        deadly in the wrong hands.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="fdebe45a-cda2-4811-910d-36b84e1c3282">Accepting Sarah’s mission to seek the truth of what
        happened at Yellowcrest Manor and to locate the remains of Lady Maria and her three children takes the
        characters to Waterdeep, which holds the first clues in the mystery. Like all other books in Candlekeep,
        <em>Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor</em> cannot be removed from the library, so make it clear to the characters that
        Sarah’s ghost has revealed all she knows. The characters can have the book copied at the usual rates to have a
        way of referencing Sarah’s notes and sketches, but you can also assume that they remember any necessary
        information from the book as the adventure continues.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e3e9f2c4-7f96-4359-a6d0-a2d0f81d5276">To get the characters into the mystery as quickly as
        possible, their trip to Waterdeep unfolds with no problems or random encounters, unless you determine otherwise.
        The easiest way for characters without access to teleportation magic to travel from Candlekeep to the City of
        Splendors is to sail up the Sword Coast. Many merchant ship captains offer to carry adventurers as passengers
        for free, in exchange for their assistance if anything goes wrong along the way.</p>

        They can also wait in Waterdeep to try to talk to Faerl. The overseer arrives two days later, and spends that
        day visiting each business in turn. Characters who stake out any of those locations can see Faerl as he arrives
        just after noon in a private coach, which barely fits along the narrow Trades Ward streets where the Yellowcrest
        businesses are located. His bodyguards include two <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"

        adventuring company and made a name for himself. A well-known sortie against a bandit lord south of Neverwinter
        earned him the nickname “Sir Vecken of the Broken Horn,” after his horned helmet was nearly cloven in two during
        the fight. A year ago, he returned to Waterdeep to live with his father, Yacken, and has since retired from
        adventuring.</p>

        is initially pleased to see them. He assumes they are adventurers he must have met and forgotten about during
        his earlier days. When the characters make the reason for their visit known, he grows visibly grim but invites
        them into his home for tea. In the living room, Vecken’s old helmet with its shattered horn hangs above the
        fireplace hearth.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d47ac153-163c-45e1-8337-8a1ea51c0ba9">Vecken is sympathetic to the characters’ objectives
        because he still feels the pain of Sarah’s death five years ago. Any talk of the characters having spoken to
        Sarah’s ghost reduces him to tears. Through the course of their conversation with him, Vecken can reveal the
        following information:</p>

            other three servants were interred in the public cemetery, Waterdeep’s City of the Dead. The remains of Lady

        <li data-content-chunk-id="f9031f82-3159-49f3-992c-4804c7b1bc57">Vecken remembers talk of Lord Viallis wanting
            his wife and children to be interred near his new home, so that he need never return to Waterdeep to visit
            them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b85b3e99-a99b-4d0d-be02-6345252e0914">Vecken doesn’t know that Lord Viallis has relocated
        to Greenfast. If the characters share this information with him, he grows thoughtful, then says that he has
        heard from former compatriots of recent trouble along the roads in that area. South of Waterdeep, travelers are
        being robbed of valuable relics and jewelry, and more than a few have disappeared, their bodies never found.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="87487231-cfdd-4399-b42b-53bfbfa94ea8">If the characters ask Vecken to join their
        investigation, the warrior demurs, telling them he would rather let the past fade. In truth, he won’t join the
        characters because their unexpected news has inspired thoughts of vengeance that he wants to undertake on his
        own. As soon as the characters leave him, Vecken dons his armor and weapons and heads for Greenfast by horse.
        Assuming the characters don’t set out for Greenfast immediately by faster means, the warrior arrives at the
        village ahead of them, confronts cultists on the road, and is captured. See <a href="#B11Cells"

        southeast of Waterdeep. Characters can easily obtain directions to the small farming settlement, which lies a
        short distance off the Trade Way, along a broad creek flowing into the Dessarin River. Greenfast is a prosperous
        community whose farmers take advantage of their proximity to the Trade Way to sell to both Waterdeep and
        Daggerford.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3ff7136b-380a-4cc7-a917-7ba525543a8d">Lord Viallis is well known in the village, though
        any people the characters talk to describe the retired noble as a quiet person who keeps to himself. All the
        villagers know about the tragedy of five years before. They also know that when Viallis moved to Greenfast, he
        announced his plans to rebuild an old tower an hour away as a private estate. Not much has happened at the site
        as far as the villagers are aware, though construction and renovations are slowly ongoing, and Viallis is known
        to have a number of workers living at the tower. (Viallis’s talk of rebuilding the abandoned tower is a cover
        for his sinister activities, as the characters will discover.)</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6a7a3890-85ef-448c-b181-0ad7270e34a2">Viallis lives in a comfortable house (see <a

        he is not home when the characters arrive. The village features other places the characters might go and a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="21719ea2-66a9-4d01-86b5-d386a6a80778">Kara knows that Viallis is creating some sort of

        is working for or romantically involved with Viallis, not knowing that he holds her prisoner. Kara has never
        been to the estate and has no idea of the extent of Viallis’s activities there, but she can give the characters
        directions if they share what they suspect about Viallis and promise to bring Yaeda back.</p>

        Old Fargo has long distrusted Lord Viallis, instinctively seeing him as a bad sort, but he keeps his thoughts to
        himself unless the characters engage him in conversation. With appropriate roleplaying or a successful DC 13
        Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills"
            data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check, he describes Viallis as a collector of
        sycophants who uses wealth to try to impress people. His son, Young Fargo, fell into Viallis’s circle of
        influence a month ago, and Old Fargo hasn’t seen him since. He knows that Viallis and his followers are said to
        be building an estate away from the village, and he can give the characters directions there.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e9331562-075c-49aa-af8d-12ecea4dc0bc">An hour out of Greenfast stands an old stone tower,
        long abandoned and crumbling. When Lord Viallis came to Greenfast after murdering his family, Faerl showed him
        the tower, thinking that Viallis might consider it a suitable site for a summer home. But Viallis, already well
        involved in his plans to make contact with the Great Old One called Gaernoo, saw even more potential for the
        site.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d4bb5328-5e6e-43af-b850-5a6d1f8110ab">For five years, Viallis has led and nurtured a cult
        to Gaernoo, whose members have been working to reclaim the ruined tower site, creating a temple within the
        subterranean levels below. Though the cult remains small in numbers, it has grand ambitions.</p>

        <p>Amid a grove of gnarled scrub trees stands a half-fallen stone tower. Rough workers’ tents, piles of timbers,

        the signs of construction are largely spurious. The timbers that might have been used to shore up and help
        rebuild the tower walls are years old and beginning to rot. The tools are rusted. The tents show signs of recent
        occupation (cultists who don’t live in the village bunk here, near the temple) but contain no personal effects.

        site, making what restitution they can to Viallis’s victims, and collapsing the tower to seal off the entrance
        to the temple. The attacks along the Trade Way drop off immediately. The farm folk are grateful to the

        children close to her as she meets each character’s gaze. Sarah’s ghost appears, her connection to the diary

            Characters</strong><br> <strong>Written by Kelly Lynne D’Angelo</strong><br> <strong>Developed &amp; Edited
            by Kim Mohan</strong></p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ea881600-411a-430e-a65e-e28e8401f556"><em>Lore of Lurue</em> is the work of Ecamane
        Truesilver, the first High Mage of Silverymoon, at the behest of the lesser deity Lurue the Unicorn. It was
        later added to Ecamane’s personal library, where it collected dust long after Ecamane’s death in 712 DR.
        Eventually, the book made its way into the hands of a young and eager traveling monk, Ulraunt. He thought that
        the book would be an appropriate offering for his entrance into Candlekeep, and right he was. After being
        accepted, the book was stored in the library’s archives. The book offers a look into the history behind the
        founding of one of the most prominent cities in Faerûn, Silverymoon.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="293d3414-5ee5-4f3d-aea4-0c0b124ec6e8">In actuality, <em>Lore of Lurue</em> is an enchanted
        storybook—one that, if read, could bestow upon its reader gifts and blessings. The moment the characters open
        the book, they are transported to a demiplane in the heart of a forest. From there, they are set on a course
        that leads them to investigate a blight that has arisen in the woods. It’s up to them to find the source of this
        corruption and expunge it from the world. What is causing this disruption, and what is its purpose?</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="aa7475ce-a068-4936-8633-a125f3aeab67">Characters in Candlekeep might discover <em>Lore of
            Lurue</em> in its place on the shelves, or elsewhere in the library, in one of several ways, including:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="dd913c1a-b086-484b-8961-3fe23f30d854">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="834d30bc-64a7-4c1c-bc17-26ded2406818">Assisting one of the Great Readers of
            Candlekeep by helping them sort a pile of books that need to be reshelved</li>

            library</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bc5fed6f-79c0-48be-98b6-da4cfae40c51">Whether the book is shelved or not, it captures the
        characters’ attention the first time any of them sets eyes on it. If it’s unearthed from within a pile, it
        stands out immediately because of its rich purple leather covers and the golden relief of a unicorn’s head that
        adorns the front cover.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="87c258f0-931e-4670-86ea-8dda58c3f0d2">If the book has been properly put away, on a high
        shelf in the History of Faerûn section marked “Silverymoon,” the vibrant color of its leather outshines the
        dusty tomes on either side of it. The title appears on the spine in elaborate gold calligraphy. Someone who
        looks closely enough can spot the crest of Silverymoon intricately rendered at the end of each word: a silver
        crescent moon with horns pointing to the right and a silver eight-pointed star enclosed within the crescent.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1034c14e-c7c5-4679-bee7-3a6a3eabb3b4">The tome is large—twelve inches wide and sixteen
        inches tall—and contains hundreds of pages. If the characters intend to read it, all they need to do is find a
        place in Candlekeep where they can all gather around as the book is opened.</p>
    <aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="LuruesOrigins">
        <p>LURUE’S ORIGINS</p>
        <p>Thought by many to be the daughter of Selûne, god of the moon, Lurue the Unicorn is a lesser deity with
            strong ties to Mielikki, god of the forest. Mielikki oversaw the forest in the early days of creation, but
            once her work was done, she needed a guardian to represent her and be her eyes and ears on the Material
            Plane. Selûne agreed with Mielikki’s assessment and offered Lurue for the role. Lurue took on the mantle of
            Mistress of Moonlight with pride, diligently working for the coexistence of humans, elves, and other talking
            beasts within the forest’s expanse.</p>

        <p>“Our story starts during the time leading up to the winter solstice on the final night of Uktar in the year

            horizon. It seems silent and still, here in the heart of the forest. But to anyone who knows the forest
            well, that silence can be misleading.”</p>

            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2119-tooltip">gate</a> spell is activated. Any creature within 10 feet of the
        book is pulled into the portal and transported to a demiplane along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying
        (see the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse#OtherPlanes"
            data-content-chunk-id="f61e99f7-6e76-454c-9bef-f1a9d67e9364">Other Planes</a>” section in the <a

        move to and through the passage to join their comrades.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3045f130-20f1-4443-ac1d-a75ca21618c7">After the characters open and “enter” the book,
        their literal path through the demiplane is dictated by the story that Ecamane Truesilver penned long ago. The
        characters begin a short distance south of where a meadow meets the edge of a forest. If anyone tries to move
        away from the forest, they are halted by an impassable barrier of force that disallows any other route.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c9667830-b139-4445-abb6-116809c2376a">The story takes the characters generally northward
        through several noteworthy locations, each one equivalent to a major section in the book. No map is necessary
        for the adventurers to get from one place to the next; if they try to deviate from the direction the story takes
        them, the same barrier of force prevents them from making any progress.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="0bb85087-bc66-437b-a908-b7463777b473">Anyone who opens <em>Lore of Lurue</em> and begins
        to read it, and those who accompany the reader, become subject to the book’s unique enchantment, which was
        placed upon it by Ecamane Truesilver shortly before his death in 712 DR.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ad02081a-6037-4be7-9cf6-3849dbd11635">The geography of the demiplane to which the book
        permits access bears some resemblance to the area of Faerûn near where Silverymoon is located today,
        particularly the High Forest and the River Rauvin, but the book’s story dates back to the days before the future
        site of the city was settled.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a8a0d966-e12f-408e-9f66-1b3511582f15">As the story opens, the weather in the demiplane is
        brisk but not frigid, and the winter solstice is imminent. When the characters follow the course of the story,
        they arrive at the site of the adventure’s climax just before midnight on the day of the solstice.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3f47f5e0-620f-4c8b-9137-929675264dfb">The characters are active participants in the story,
        and its events are real to them: they can defeat enemies and be defeated by them. But a player character who
        drops to 0 hit points while on the demiplane is immediately teleported out of the demiplane and back into
        Candlekeep where the book is located.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="72ce1853-c403-44d1-b4f0-1b67beef224b">A teleported character reappears with 1 hit point
        and loses any items they had collected on the journey so far. Explain to the player of the character that they
        can rejoin the party by going through the gate again after finishing a long rest. In the meantime, the other
        party members will have moved along in the story. Because time passes differently on the demiplane from how it
        flows on the Material Plane, the returning character appears back with the party in the encounter area that
        follows the one the character previously experienced.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="46fcb649-bfe6-4c0a-a052-f76c922c2352">The gate remains active until the characters’
        contribution to the story has come to an end (one way or the other), whereupon the characters are ejected from
        the demiplane and deposited around the book back in Candlekeep. No one other than the characters can use the
        gate, or even perceive it, while the mission is under way.</p>

        being sullied, tainted by blood lust.” He begs the characters to continue on their journey, which is taking them
        toward the pool, and do whatever necessary to make the pool pure and clean again. The treant urges the
        characters to resume their travels and suggests that they stop along the way at the community of Dewlight to
        speak with a sprite named Wheeldoli, who might have more news for them. Feynor gestures with one of his branches

        <p>Moss-covered trees and overgrown brush suddenly thin out, giving way to a small glen not more than a hundred
            feet across. This area is peppered with colorful mushrooms growing virtually on top of one another, some of
            the clusters more than three feet high. A warm glow emanates from tiny lanterns that hang from each
            mushroom. Jutting up from the caps of the mushrooms, chimneys made of petrified bark let out wisps of

        aggressiveness, but if the characters start by mentioning that they have spoken with Feynor, or if they talk to
        him about the book they discovered, the sprite becomes friendly and contributes some additional details about
        their situation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e5ee1af4-10f4-450e-a57e-47896032546f">As a scholar among his kind, Wheeldoli knows about
        some of the gods revered by the big folk, and he shares his supposition about the nighttime thunderclaps and
        lightning strikes in the distance. “Signs of a battle brewing,” he says. A group of vicious predators have been
        stalking through the forest of late, and Wheeldoli fears they are disciples of Malar the Beast Lord (see the “<a

        later in the adventure). The disturbances to the north, he says, seem to be coming from the vicinity of the Pool
        of Eternal Spring, a hallowed site associated with a lesser deity known as Lurue the Unicorn. The sprite says he
        would not be surprised to find that Malar’s minions are behind that turn of events as well.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1478a8df-9132-41c1-bb14-60185111b698">In conclusion, Wheeldoli injects some urgency into
        the situation. “Whatever’s happening at the pool is likely to reach its peak on the winter solstice, which is at
        most a day or two from now.”</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="073080ac-0830-426e-93d8-b5ac54313281">When the characters have learned all they can from

        the stone wall, they can peer over the 2-foot-high wall into the hole, which is dark, but they don’t get an idea

        way of seeing the bottom of the pit. If they don’t see the grick at the same time it sees them, the monster

        of Lurue the Unicorn to serve the Beast Lord’s ends in his newly claimed domain. It is this effort that the
        characters must foil if they are to see their role in the story of <em>Lore of Lurue</em> end happily.</p>

        trail through the forest. After a few minutes of careful travel, they get evidence that they’re not alone: from
        somewhere nearby ahead, they hear gruff voices growling and roaring. It’s easy for the characters to sneak
        toward the sounds for a closer look. The following boxed text corresponds to the campsite shown on the

        <p>A group of vicious-looking warriors are gathered around the fire. They clink together their bone mugs and rip
            into raw animal flesh with their teeth. Fresh blood drips from their mouths and hands. It seems like a

        campsite, the way forward is obvious: lightning flashes in the sky every few minutes, seeming to be centered
        over a place that’s within a couple minutes’ walk to the south.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5bdab05f-6744-422a-9d45-3a4d86ff53a5">In the far distance, the sky is clear, but directly
        above the pool is a black storm cloud spitting bolts of red lightning. When the characters arrive, standing at
        the edge of the pool are six wolf-like humanoids, their backs to the characters. With faces raised up in
        supplication, they chant ominously. Read:</p>

        <p>You have come upon the Pool of Eternal Spring, or at least what’s left of it: its once clear waters are now
            streaked with red and black impurities. Standing at the edge of the pool is a feral-looking human clad in
            animal skins. This individual leads five werewolves in chanting “Water into blood, earth into bones!”</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ffb5f60e-1ac4-4821-9d0a-bb0686f7a74c">In less troubling times, the Pool of Eternal Spring
        was a little slice of Mount Celestia on earth. Its crystal-clear waters nourished the nearby lands and fostered
        the most abundant plant and animal life imaginable. The usual pleasant fragrance that wafts from the pool is now
        replaced by the scent of metal and blood.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="73bf1f9f-976e-4510-a7c4-f962825470f5">The cult of Malar has prepared the pool in
        anticipation of the winter solstice. By filling the Pool of Eternal Spring with offerings to Malar—creatures of
        the forest that have been brutally killed and slain, then tossed into the water—the cult has tainted it as a
        gesture of reverence to their deity. Unbeknownst to them, the arrival of the solstice triggers the final phase
        of Malar’s plan.</p>

        one leading the chant is in humanoid form. The characters have come on the scene just in time to witness the
        final stage of the ceremony, which culminates at midnight. Before the characters can do anything to prevent it,
        a bolt of red lightning splits the sky and strikes the surface of the pool. When the resulting steam cloud
        dissipates, the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/1528960-corrupted-avatar-of-lurue"

        breathtaking sight; her silver, stardust-like mane, her shimmering hooves, and her perfectly formed spiral horn
        elicit awe from even the most hardened souls. As powerful and striking as she is in her true form, she’s just as
        wicked in her alternative state. With necrotic energy twisting and dancing at the tip of her black horn, this
        corrupted avatar of Lurue is instead a nightmare come to life.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cc48b548-49fc-4a21-b696-0cbc4bfcd0b6">While tainted by the influence of Malar, the avatar
        of Lurue carries out the Beast Lord’s will: to slaughter anything that dares to cross its path.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="194247f5-46a0-4bf1-9525-27c7f5a08b2a">When the corrupted unicorn comes into being, it does
        so within reach of at least one of the cult members. If a fight has not already started, roll initiative. On
        each of the avatar’s turns, and when using its legendary actions, it randomly attacks one or more creatures from
        among any targets it can reach. The avatar prefers a wounded foe over a fresh one, but it also singles out
        enemies who deal grievous injuries to it and attacks them without mercy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="320e650d-0ca5-49fe-beba-8430c5aa19f6">The cult members, briefly transfixed by the
        spectacle they have just witnessed, are not immediately hostile, though they defend themselves against
        characters who threaten or attack them. When it becomes apparent to the werewolves that they are also being
        targeted by the avatar, they might join forces with the characters (if the avatar is getting the upper hand) or
        break off and run away (if the characters seem to be in control of things).</p>

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>A jagged stroke of white lightning originates from the moon and strikes the unicorn, transforming it into a
            true, living avatar of Lurue the Unicorn with a silvery mane, shimmering hooves, and a spiraling horn. She
            gives a thankful nod and bends down to dip her horn, now cleansed of corruption, in the pool.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fb001022-6cb6-49bd-9f28-acc224432281">The lightning bolt from the moon either destroys the
        corrupted avatar to spare the adventurers from a likely tragic ending, or revives and purifies the slain avatar.
        (The book speculates that this divine intervention is courtesy of Selûne, who has been waiting for Malar’s plan
        to come to fruition so that she might demonstrate to him the utter futility of his desire to hold sway over the
        forest.)</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f1bddc8d-a365-4d21-a211-74c891e3e50a">Divine magic pours from Lurue’s horn and turns the
        tainted pool back into silvery, glistening pure water. The Pool of Eternal Spring is restored to its former
        nature. A short distance away along the bank of the pool is a narrow, spring-fed outlet stream that leads north
        toward the river. The purifying effect continues to flow into and along the stream, removing all traces of
        corruption that might have escaped in the current. Her work finished, Lurue lifts her head, regards the
        characters once more, and prepares to take her leave.</p>

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>The avatar of Lurue galloped through the night, freed from the threat of Malar. As a way of showing her
            gratitude, and ensuring that Malar and his minions would never dare to ravage the forest again, she
            continued to let the silvery spring flow, turning the place into a Pool of Eternal Silver. These waters,
            forever protected by her grace, lie near the site of a city now called Silverymoon, which was named as such
            in honor of this tale.</p>

        characters return to the same spot in Candlekeep they left. <em>Lore of Lurue</em>, closed and sealed, rests
        where it did when the characters’ experience began.</p>

        ticking clock to stop a misguided cult from launching one of Candlekeep’s towers into space, along with a small
        trove of valuable tomes. One of the cultists has a change of heart and tries to thwart the whole enterprise by
        stealing one of the books, hoping to delay the launch. This book ends up in the characters’ possession after the
        cultist dies while carrying it.</p>

        describes how Candlekeep was built and contains architectural diagrams for most of its structures. The book’s
        author, a former Keeper of Tomes named Isajar, also describes the magical wards protecting Candlekeep. Among
        other things, Isajar was well known for detesting the use of the letter C as a hard consonant, preferring the

        of Candlekeep’s custodial staff, as well as several homemade constructs called skitterwidgets (described at the
        end of the adventure). As soon as he learned about the theft of <em>Kandlekeep Dekonstruktion</em>, Stonky
        test-fired the ship’s rockets, which triggered the earthquake.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ce6436c0-245b-4130-9cfb-65cc8e24bb16">Following the test, Stonky set the Barn Door on an
        automatic countdown to launch. The characters have 1 hour (starting from when the earthquake ends) to deactivate
        the countdown timer or disable the rocket before it blasts off and launches Stonky’s cult (and its modest
        collection of books) into space.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c49c6c6f-fd15-4603-b2b3-ce072776b4e6">Among the folk gathered in the Court of Air is
        Bookwyrm the dragonborn, who was having a drink in the Hearth when the earthquake struck. Bookwyrm is the First
        Reader of Candlekeep (see the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cm/candlekeep#Readers"
            data-content-chunk-id="6ea3885f-132b-45b8-a793-fd5189989231">Candlekeep</a>” section earlier in this book)
        and has the authority to grant access to the library’s Inner Ward.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f29c1149-0793-4949-8d54-583d78b5e14b">If the characters make the case that the Barn Door
        should be investigated at once, Bookwyrm listens to what they have to say, then puts them in charge of the
        investigation, escorts them through the Emerald Door, and gives them directions to the tower. Along the way, the
        First Reader explains that the Barn Door was condemned years ago when sages concluded it was no longer safe for
        occupancy. Bookwyrm knows nothing about the Barn Door’s true nature, having never read <em>Kandlekeep
            Dekonstruktion</em> or entered the tower. He does, however, know the command word to bypass the <a

            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2003-tooltip">arcane lock</a> spell on the tower’s front door (“jeopardy”), which
        he shares with the party.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="365e4fbe-fe70-49c0-bc29-08867f906bcb">If asked about Stonky Noptopper, the First Reader
        knows that the rock gnome oversees the custodial staff assigned to clean and maintain the towers of the Inner
        Ward. Bookwyrm believes that Stonky would never do anything to endanger Candlekeep.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1b871438-58a9-4020-bfea-f8b69b758afd">It takes 5 minutes to walk from the Emerald Door to
        the Barn Door. As the characters begin to investigate the condemned tower, Bookwyrm meets with the Keeper of
        Tomes and the Great Readers to discuss next steps. None of them can act soon enough to stop the Barn Door’s
        launch. From this point forward, the characters are on their own.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="123d7181-17c0-4a29-bdf4-c0c9f23a9a08">The Livestock is the name of Stonky’s secret cult of
        custodial engineers, chosen as a play on the Barn Door tower’s name. All the cult’s members came to Candlekeep
        hoping to be accepted as acolytes, but the leaders of the Avowed never gave them the opportunity. The custodians
        recruited by Stonky are united in their bitter belief that they have been overlooked and underappreciated.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4fbdd952-8387-4f5d-b841-8aad36cccc5d">Stonky has persuaded his followers that the way to
        ascend in the hierarchy is to reveal that the higher-ups are not as capable of protecting the lore of Candlekeep
        as they should be. He dreams of delivering a solution for its protection that no Avowed has yet considered:
        sending the most important books in the library into space.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d45e29f7-5749-4041-8dfa-912f4238c0e7">The cultists look to Stonky for validation and the
        promise of ultimate knowledge. Having finally found purpose in the triviality of their roles, the cultists take
        up positions in the tower when the countdown to launch begins.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="074c31b0-ae8c-42c4-b8d9-33d02926ed8e">Stonky has assigned aliases to the members of the
        Livestock. Each alias is a combination of a farm animal and a farm export, as shown in the Livestock Cult
        Members table. All these cultists are chaotic neutral and wear custodial uniforms.</p>

        from its master for 1 minute on a success.</p>

        Candlekeep by adventurers seeking refuge from a storm that seemed to follow them wherever they went. A junior
        member of the Avowed, although unable to open the book, cataloged it as a treatise on the Inner Planes, based
        solely on Zikran’s reputation as an expert on the subject. The book has been moving through the archives ever
        since, as Avowed who were also unable to open it take guesses at its contents. After a time, they stopped

    <p data-content-chunk-id="604d7ecd-a81b-4e73-97f7-1c9ed743cc71">The book is a heavy tome with covers of white marble
        bound in pale blue leather. A large padlock prevents the book from being opened and resists all attempts to open
        it with magic, but it snaps open when the book is held by someone who intends to leave Candlekeep with it. The
        book contains one hundred eight mostly blank pages made of tissue-thin white paper and emits a soft breeze
        whenever a page is turned. Most important, when the book is first opened, it reveals the creature trapped inside
        it: a djinni named Gazre-Azam.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c3ffc800-a2f3-44fb-84cf-ec0da4a82241">The first ten pages of the book contain various
        notes in Zikran’s hand that indicate he tried several times to trap a djinni in the book before finally
        succeeding. The next eight pages are observations of Gazre-Azam’s behavior during his time of servitude to
        Zikran. The last ninety pages of the book are blank, and a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<a

        wizard’s spellbook. At some point, the spells were removed in such a way as to leave the pages blank.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="cfeea69f-d923-4f36-ae33-d302d3444faf">Gazre-Azam has been trapped in the book for many
        years. When the book is opened, it releases small, wispy clouds that form into the shape of Gazre-Azam’s head.
        The <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16842-djinni"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16842-tooltip">djinni</a> speaks to any character willing to listen and asks
        for their aid.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9bc5d5d8-0baf-44d0-a61a-19a17b56e9d0">Gazre-Azam was summoned by Zikran, a water genasi
        wizard, and bound to the book. Zikran wanted the djinni to teach him how to make elemental devices, with the
        ultimate goal of building a floating castle fortress. For some time, the djinni served the wizard. Hoping to
        earn his freedom, Gazre-Azam shared much of his knowledge, but the wizard would not release him. When Gazre-Azam
        changed tactics and became less helpful, Zikran cast a complicated and near-permanent spell to keep Gazre-Azam
        from escaping. The djinni reveals that the only way to free him is for Zikran to end the enchantment willingly
        or for Zikran to be killed. Repeatedly and desperately, yet still with a noble manner, Gazre-Azam asks for the
        characters’ aid. In exchange, he offers the characters one free casting of a <a
            class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2303-wish"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2303-tooltip">wish</a> spell.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="453cf117-d374-4616-8eb6-927f09b32ba3">If the characters agree to Gazre-Azam’s request, he
        asks that they take him along. While bound to the book, Gazre-Azam can’t use his magical abilities, but he can
        speak freely to the party and provide valuable information. Once members of the Avowed learn that a creature is
        trapped in the tome, they will allow the characters to leave Candlekeep with it, on the condition that the book
        is returned to them once the djinni is freed. (The Avowed are in no rush to get the book back.)</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="89d93869-6d18-4b21-aa60-21c6bd223e27">Gazre-Azam hasn’t seen Zikran in a long time, but
        since his enchantment is still intact, he knows that Zikran must be alive. He suggests searching for Zikran at a
        seaside laboratory—the last place where the djinni interacted with Zikran. It might hold clues about what the
        wizard is up to now. Gazre-Azam describes to the characters a landmark that might help them find this hidden
        location. His directions are as follows:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>“Follow the Sword Coast south for two nights and a day until you find a spire made of coral. Stand at the
            base of this spire and look inland, and you will see the mouth of a flooded cave. This cave contains
            Zikran’s laboratory and sanctum.”</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="57813fcf-f14e-437e-a6e9-d6160dc12e8b">To follow Gazre-Azam’s instructions, the characters
        must travel along the cliffs and beaches of the Sword Coast. The party might encounter a number of foes or NPCs
        along the way, as appropriate for your campaign. If no such enemies or NPCs are present, you can harass the
        party with three <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17065-wyvern"

        script of a play written in Common. It is split up into three acts, telling the story of a heroic bard before he
        becomes corrupted by evil. A wizard named Ryllia Liadon donated the book to Candlekeep as an entrance gift. She
        didn’t tell the Avowed that the book contains the secret to accessing Wisteria Vale, a magical demiplane created
        by the Harpers to imprison a bard named Arrant Quill until they could free him from the influence of an evil
        artifact.</p>

        Candlekeep and a promise of 5,000 gp if they successfully complete their task. The Avowed of Candlekeep furnish

        Wisteria Vale was the name of a village on the River Chionthar, just east of Baldur’s Gate, that was destroyed

        <p>WHO ARE THE HARPERS?</p>
        <p>The Harpers are an organization of spellcasters and spies who covertly oppose any abuse of power, magical or
            otherwise. Working alone or in small cells, they gather information throughout Faerûn, analyze the political
            dynamics in each region or realm, and use what they uncover to help the weak, the poor, and the oppressed
            from behind the scenes. Harpers act openly only as a last resort.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="774dfcff-98e8-46ff-9473-071bd9e35085">In the first act, the protagonist, Vargan, lives out
        a peaceful childhood in the village of Wisteria Vale. Vargan is a boy with a penchant for storytelling and a
        knack for magic. During the day, Vargan helps his parents on the farm, and in the evening he performs in the
        tavern to the delight of all the villagers. When Vargan is on the cusp of adulthood, the cruel Lord Ephraim
        Rathmore visits Wisteria Vale, demanding drink, food, and a place for him and his retinue to stay. When the
        hospitality isn’t to his liking, he burns down the village. Lord Rathmore leaves Vargan alive as a witness to
        his village’s punishment, but not before slashing him across the face with a crystal dagger. The event changes
        Vargan forever, and he vows to bring down the pitiless lord and prevent him from hurting anyone ever again.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e667f83d-c767-4402-b58d-7f3bb090f72a">Vargan tracks down Lord Rathmore in a bustling city.
        Unsure how to proceed, the young bard starts asking around the city for information. He is approached by a
        wizard, who tells him that she belongs to a secret group looking to bring down Lord Rathmore and others who have
        been corrupted by evil. The wizard invites Vargan to join the secret organization, and he agrees, becoming a
        member of the Harpers. With the aid of information from the Harpers, Vargan sneaks into Lord Rathmore’s manor
        during a banquet disguised as a performer and dispatches Rathmore once and for all. Although his quest for
        vengeance has been fulfilled, Vargan is obsessed with the fact that many other corrupt and evil people exist
        across the land, and that only people like him and the Harpers can stop them.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="309b42c8-624a-4efb-913b-18e55bbfb689">Vargan becomes more powerful, using his talents in
        magic and espionage to single-handedly take down corrupt kings and mages. Although he becomes a legend among and
        outside the Harpers, Vargan stays humble, believing that it is his duty to protect others. At the climax of the
        play, Vargan battles an archmage who was turned evil by an ancient crystal touched by the evil god Cyric. Though
        Vargan defeats the archmage, prolonged contact with the crystal corrupts the bard, convincing him that his
        former allies are too powerful and must be eliminated. The Harpers devise a solution to prevent Vargan from
        hurting anyone while they develop a cure: banishing him to a demiplane.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="33562ee4-e260-4fc0-adbf-0b211ccce02f">The play ends with a short monologue by the Harper
        wizard who befriended Vargan years ago, saying that though Vargan’s ultimate fate is still unknown, the day will
        come when light will banish darkness.</p>

        dagger infused with several forms of purifying magic. The magic dagger is carved from a single piece of
        amethyst, with leather wrapped around the hilt and minuscule runes emblazoned on the flat of the blade. When
        light hits the dagger, the blade appears to pulse with an inner radiance. The dagger resembles the one that
        scarred Quill as a child.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="35bf5a14-8b80-40c5-8642-7c318b645917">To activate the spells imbued within the dagger, the
        weapon must pierce the flesh of the intended target. After the purifying magic is released, the dagger loses its
        magical properties.</p>

        the portal to Wisteria Vale, after which they can explore the village and talk to the inhabitants. The locals
        reveal that Quill lives in a manor on the edge of the village, but he hasn’t left it recently because he has a
        very important guest: a beholder that suddenly appeared in Wisteria Vale. To allay the villagers’ justifiable
        concerns about his guest, Quill is planning a party for that evening and has invited everybody in town to meet
        the beholder.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0e514fed-3180-4277-90db-48dc611438a8">As the characters explore the manor, they must avoid
        the gaze of the beholder. They learn from Quill’s notes that the beholder dreamed itself into Wisteria Vale from
        the Underdark, and that Quill has been trying to charm it into revealing how to escape the demiplane. It
        eventually becomes clear that the beholder has imprisoned the real Quill in a magic painting.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="04e27dff-8c7b-415f-b0de-1bd3f50d21c5">The characters must find Quill, convince him that
        they’re here to help, and administer the cure without incurring the wrath of the beholder, who wants to keep its

        Vale is hidden in the text of the play. Ryllia tells the characters that there is a line in the final scene that
        gives a clue to the portal’s activation phrase, though she doesn’t know the details. A character who examines
        the script notices that the penultimate line spoken by the Harper wizard in the play is underlined twice. This
        line reads:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>We lift up our light to reveal what is hidden and banish the darkness forever.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="66792c40-1fe2-453d-bed1-e772aaf88f39">A character who makes a successful DC 12
        Intelligence check realizes that this line might be more than a metaphor—a puzzle that requires literal
        interpretation of an aphorism would be just the kind of thing a Harper playwright would enjoy. Shining a source
        of light directly on the page reveals a phrase written in invisible ink: “Harpers at Twilight.”</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="748125ad-c69a-4f87-a94f-3fdf4e9581bd">When that phrase is uttered, the book shakes and
        flies into the air, pages flipping of their own accord and separating from the binding, then rearranging
        themselves to form a portal. Anyone who steps through the opening is transported to Wisteria Vale. After all the
        characters pass through the portal, the pages rearrange themselves back into the form of the book, and the
        portal closes.</p>

        for one purpose: to imprison Arrant Quill while they devise a cure for his corruption. Everything in Wisteria
        Vale is bright and colorful, tailored to keep Quill comfortable and entertained. The weather is always mild and
        temperate, with just enough rainy days to nurture crops. Wisteria blossoms are always in full bloom amid the
        verdant greenery. The air is filled with the soothing sounds of nature, from birdsong to the chirping of
        crickets to gentle breezes ruffling the leaves. Time passes differently here: each day in Wisteria Vale equates
        to three days on the Material Plane.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="773ba56d-8416-4e2e-9549-827dcb08a357">Because of the nature and purpose of the demiplane,
        any spells used to try to escape Wisteria Vale fail. The only way to leave the demiplane is to terminate it by
        curing or killing Quill.</p>

        innocents, the Harpers created constructs out of wooden mannequins to act as villagers (see the accompanying
        stat block). Magic makes them look like flesh-and-blood people, and the constructs conduct themselves as
        convincingly real humanoids who are simply living their lives in Wisteria Vale. <a

        interact with the environment around them and hold lengthy conversations, a few clues to their true nature
        exist. A character who observes one or more of the commoners closely and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<a

        check notices that if the villagers are asked about anything outside Wisteria Vale or their individual talents,
        they quickly change subjects to small talk about the weather or gossip, and always in Common regardless of their
        apparent origin.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="994e87ab-2134-475a-aed3-93a4a4fd48b5">Constructed commoners don’t bleed or feel pain like
        flesh-and-blood humanoids. If a villager’s hit points drop to 0, its true form is revealed: that of a lifeless
        wooden mannequin. Overnight, the mannequin disappears, and a replacement villager is generated by the demiplane
        to take over the “slain” villager’s place and role in the village a few days later. If the mannequin is
        disintegrated or reduced to ashes, it is not replaced and the population of the village permanently decreases by

        Recently, a beholder named Renekor entered Wisteria Vale by dreaming itself into the demiplane. Renekor sees
        Wisteria Vale as its own creation—a very real (if utterly bizarre) sanctuary brought into being by its dreaming

        erratic weather and strange phenomena. Each time the characters move to a new location or room, roll on the
        Wisteria Vale Events table to determine what strange effect they experience, if any. When the characters are in
        the manor, closer to the beholder itself, roll twice and use the higher result.</p>

        where the characters come from and why they’re here. If the characters mention that their purpose is to cure
        Quill of his corruption, the villagers are confused, since Quill has been nothing but kind and friendly to them
        since his arrival.</p>

        with many smaller eyes on stalks. Though the villagers were frightened by the creature, Quill assured them that
        he would keep it under control. He urged them to treat the creature as an honored guest while it was in Wisteria

        villagers, and the name. The locals find Wisteria Vale to be normal and don’t question any of the oddities of

        tavern is the heart of the village, a place where people gather to talk and share meals. Even though the
        villagers don’t need to eat or drink because they are constructs, they do so when Quill is around. In the
        evenings when Quill visits the village, Ulrich always insists that Quill perform for an enraptured audience that
        never seems to get bored of his stories and songs.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9ab54fbb-4625-4e67-9b59-e9239126e236">Daphne tells the characters that Quill hasn’t
        visited in the past two weeks, which is unusual for him. She theorizes that his absence is due to the arrival of
        the many-eyed creature, and while the villagers trust Quill, they are still concerned about him.</p>

        Quill and his secretive past. Henrietta is a cobbler by trade and also a social butterfly, helping to organize
        community events and create decorations from spare cloth and leather.</p>

        his arrival in Wisteria Vale, the appearance of the creature two weeks ago, and the party in the manor taking
        place that evening, to which all the villagers have been invited. Like their neighbors, Josephus and Henrietta
        have reservations about Quill’s strange houseguest.</p>

        three selfish desires: to preserve his well-being, to alleviate his boredom, and to escape Wisteria Vale. He
        holds a grudge against the Harpers and Ryllia for imprisoning him in a place that reminds him of the people he
        lost in his childhood, though he also takes some comfort in being able to live out the life he could’ve had. His
        time spent alone with his thoughts in Wisteria Vale has led him to suspect that the Harpers were never going to
        find a cure, and that they were simply biding their time until he became complacent enough that they could kill
        him without his being a threat. Quill’s corruption has convinced him that the Harpers have become a powerful
        force that must be taken down; he trusts only himself to identify and eliminate agents of tyranny.</p>

        can resist this effect by succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. From inside its extradimensional chamber,
        a painting looks like a frameless, 5-foot-square open window through which is visible the interior of the room

        These doors lead to the other paintings’ extradimensional chambers. Only one of the three doors can be open at
        any given time, and a door can’t be opened unless the other two doors are closed. Each door is opened by pulling
        on its shiny brass doorknob, regardless of which side of the door one happens to be on.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="debf6a1c-9bd3-4235-a0ca-1f6e664cbbb4">The chaotic nature of the connection between the

        door leads, use the appropriate table for whichever extradimensional chamber the characters are in presently.
        The characters always enter a new chamber through the doorway on the wall opposite that chamber’s window.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="93b0a6a0-80e4-4af8-92d1-c6793ed79aa0">No matter how much time seems to have passed inside
        the painting, when Quill and the characters leave the extradimensional space, they land near the north wall of
        the ballroom during the party that Renekor and the fake Quill are hosting. The room has been decorated with
        garlands of wisteria, and small tables hold hors d’oeuvres and drinks. Renekor and the fake Quill are in the
        middle of the room, surrounded by a crowd of thirty villagers dressed in fine attire, all having a good time.
        Five villagers have gathered on the stage to perform instrumental music. This band includes a harpsichordist, a
        cellist, a violinist, a flutist, and a fiddler. Milling through the crowd are four waiters. All the guests,
        performers, and waiters are unarmed <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"
            href="/monsters/1528959-constructed-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/1528959-tooltip">constructed
            commoners</a> that do not engage in battle and flee if combat erupts.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="305ae2a7-c717-4d09-8b47-77e833693881">Renekor can tell the real Quill from the fake one.
        When it notices the characters and the real Quill, the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"
            href="/monsters/17099-beholder" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17099-tooltip">beholder</a> attacks, hovering
        just out of reach of melee weapons and using its lair actions when appropriate. The two suits of <a
            class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16786-animated-armor"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16786-tooltip">animated armor</a> standing guard outside the ballroom also
        attack at the command of the beholder. Renekor wants to keep Quill alive and avoids attacking him.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5132a3d9-12a6-4ee5-b129-85817fcdc8bc">The two Quills look the same. However, the fake
        Quill can’t do anything except move and talk, and it is dispelled if it takes damage from a spell or magic
        weapon. No other magic or damage affects it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="437d5ec8-af59-4307-a065-b21d8287e920">If the real Quill believes the characters are on his
        side, he gives them permission to stab him with the magical crystal dagger. If he thinks the characters have
        come to Wisteria Vale to kill him, he flees using his <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
            href="/spells/2275-teleport" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2275-tooltip">teleport</a> spell, reappearing in
        some other location of your choice in Wisteria Vale. Quill’s priority is to stay alive.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1f22ddd5-9799-4ea3-8d10-c4eb6a634037">Quill loses his immunity to damage while he’s within
        15 feet of Renekor, but he is not immediately aware of this. Once Quill realizes that Renekor is negating his
        invincibility, he tries to distance himself from the beholder.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9727db6d-f324-4df1-8d79-60eef3ef7110">If combat erupts in the ballroom, the villagers
        begin to panic and scatter, turning the ballroom into difficult terrain until they clear the room, which takes 2
        rounds.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="AdministeringtheCure"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6fa40670-6e8b-4e5a-ba7f-1aed43c3311f">If Quill is stabbed with the magical crystal dagger,
        he staggers backward, momentarily dazed as he overcomes the effects of his corruption. His eyes glow an eerie
        purple for a few seconds before returning to normal, whereupon his alignment reverts to neutral good. After
        regaining his senses, he thanks the characters for helping him—just before the world around them disappears.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="734fcc7b-f1bd-48a6-8d2c-1e2fbfdd6ea3">When Quill is either cured or killed, the demiplane
        of Wisteria Vale unravels. Everything around the characters fades before a streak of blue light flashes across
        their vision and they arrive back in Candlekeep, appearing in unoccupied spaces as close to <em>The Curious Tale
            of Wisteria Vale</em> as possible.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8502e8ec-161d-41c5-b968-d613f69ece9c">If Quill survives the ordeal, he happily reunites
        with Ryllia, who gives the party the full reward of 5,000 gp. Quill is indebted to the characters and might
        become a valuable ally in the future. If Quill dies, the demiplane unravels as the characters and Quill’s corpse
        return to Candlekeep. Ryllia is saddened to hear of Quill’s death, but if his body is delivered to her, she pays
        to have the bard resurrected. She gives the party 2,500 gp, half of the promised reward, and uses the other half
        of the funds to pay for the materials and services needed for Quill's resurrection.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bd87c451-e8e8-4591-a43d-f88409aaa81a">If Renekor is alive when the demiplane unravels, the
        beholder is sent back to its lair in the Underdark, where it holds a deep grudge against the characters. It
        sends its minions to spy on them while it gathers resources and plots revenge.</p>

            Characters</strong><br> <strong>Written by Jennifer Kretchmer</strong><br> <strong>Developed &amp; Edited by
            Scott Fitzgerald Gray &amp; Christopher Perkins</strong></p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6c3bf828-406e-47de-a7b3-91eec3df0fde">In this adventure, the player characters investigate
        the disappearance of a Candlekeep sage and disrupt the plans of an ambitious oracle bent on domination.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="53af4aa9-fa2d-46e0-94ed-a3237c0db89b"><em>The Canopic Being</em> arrived at Candlekeep
        nine months ago, wrapped in yellow cloth embroidered with the image of an eye. It was delivered with a
        handwritten note reading, “As fate wills it,” signed by Xemru Thaal, a high priest of Savras, god of divination
        and fate. As preservers of the teachings of Alaundo the Seer, the Avowed of Candlekeep were keen to study what
        they expected to be a book exploring the divinatory arts. When its horrific contents were revealed, <em>The
            Canopic Being</em> was relocated to the library’s vaults, where it currently resides.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="da459a4a-a4ba-4c81-94b7-4d1b1a5d1b71">The book is the record of a ritual that allows the
        transplanting of a mummy lord’s organs into living vessels to forge a dark connection between donor and
        recipient. The end of the book contains a list of those recipients—which includes the names of all the
        characters.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f8ef8006-5625-4988-bbd2-320f49e3773d">This adventure begins with the characters being
        tasked with finding a Candlekeep scholar who has not returned from a research expedition to the distant eastern
        realm of Tashalar. The characters can be in Candlekeep already doing research of their own, or they might be
        summoned there if they are known to the library and its scholars.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="07315c66-65ec-40a5-b78d-3081ebc7d690">Read or paraphrase the following when you’re ready
        to begin the adventure, replacing Great Reader A’lai Aivenmore with another scholar of the characters’
        acquaintance if you so choose:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>A’lai Aivenmore’s mood is dark as they pace before you. “Mayastan Sadaar, one of our finest sages, had been
            studying a particular tome, held in the vaults.” So saying, A’lai gestures to a book on a cluttered desk
            whose cover appears to be of made translucent crystal.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6906a754-b964-4685-9be0-327f0311a308">A’lai describes the book as a treatise on dark
        rituals and tells how it arrived at Candlekeep as a donation from a high priest of Savras. She talks of how
        Mayastan came to her, clearly bothered by something she had read in <em>The Canopic Being</em>, and saying that
        she wanted to continue her research with the help of the oracle of the House of the All-Seeing Orb in Tashalar,
        east of Chult. Mayastan went there by way of teleportation. Shortly after Mayastan left, A’lai consulted the
        tome, hoping to gain some sense of what was troubling the sage.</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>A’lai pushes the book toward you, opening it to a page near to the end that is filled with a list of names in
            a half-dozen different hands. Across the top of the page in the rushed script that fills the rest of the
            book is written the legend: “Those Who Have Been Bestowed.” At the bottom of the page is Mayastan Sadaar’s
            name—followed by the names of each of you.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d572ded2-0da8-4ce6-9170-358726d976e1"><em>The Canopic Being</em> has a cover and spine
        made of thin crystal sheets, with gems that represent eyes embedded in them. Every so often, the eyes move,
        shifting their gaze between different locations. The book’s pages are edged in a protective crystalline finish
        and filled with a hurried, nearly illegible scrawl. Xemru Thaal’s note (see the accompanying <a

        All-Seeing Orb, a temple of Savras in Tashluta, the capital city of Tashalar.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="992c8967-e3f2-46fa-b5bc-8a34baaa7fd6">The book describes rituals relating to the creation
        of a mummy lord. One is a unique and horrific process by which a mummy lord’s organs, normally stored in sacred
        canopic jars during mummification, can be magically preserved and transplanted into living humanoids. The
        transplant recipients come under the control of the mummy lord, either as living supplicants or golems through
        which the mummy lord can see and speak. The book also hints of a ritual that can free a servant after the mummy
        lord is destroyed.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d3315f8f-4b22-4222-a84f-da4eee3d2b96">The last page of the book appears to be a list of

        experienced years before, the oracle has embraced undeath by becoming a mummy lord, using the rituals described
        in the book. The list of names in the back of the book is written by many scribes, since it includes creatures
        bonded to other mummy lords before the tome came to Valin. The names Valin has added at the end are those of the
        oracle’s current and intended victims, as seen in her visions:</p>

                <p>Author’s Note</p>
                <p>When we began this journey, only the oracle of the All-Seeing Orb, the great Valin Sarnaster, had an
                    inkling where it might lead. It is my honor to have been selected as the first donor and recipient.
                    By giving Valin a piece of myself and receiving a piece of her in return, I can help the fate of the
                    world unfold as she has foreseen.</p>
                <p>It is my honor to protect the oracle in her sanctuary, ensuring that only donors and recipients may
                    visit her. I have no need of the rite of reclamation, for I believe in the vision and perfection of
                    Valin Sarnaster.</p>
                <p>For clarity's sake, I offer this record of the procedures performed on the donors and recipients,
                    whose fates and organs are now bound to the oracle. May she serve the All-Seeing for centuries to
                    come.</p>

        city of Tashluta in Tashalar, find Mayastan Sadaar at the House of the All-Seeing Orb, and bring her back. The
        First Reader has no proof that Mayastan is in danger, but the implications of her name appearing in <em>The
            Canopic Being</em> are alarming. A’lai expects that the characters have their own reasons to investigate,
        having seen their names in the book. If they need further incentive, she offers the party 5,000 gp or the future
        services of Candlekeep to undertake the mission.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f62d2636-496c-402a-a646-e5116e07db0f">Tashluta is the busy port-city capital of Tashalar,
        set between sea, mountains, and jungle. It is a welcoming stopover point for travelers, merchants, and traders
        in the south. Tashalar is a land known for warm, breezy weather, bright, flowing garments, and spicy, delicious
        foods. It is also famous for the obsession its citizens have for divining the future; most Tashlutans claim to
        have some amount of skill with personal prognostication.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="03de733d-8c4f-4bf6-86f9-08068a359133">One of the most notable sights in Tashluta, the
        House of the All-Seeing Orb is an immense compound dedicated to the study of magical divination. Clerics, mages,
        and other scholars work at the institution’s Celestial Observatory, its Library of Ultimate Truth, and its
        College of Divination.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="905d7bbf-c9d8-4d84-bcf1-5fbd09ad6e1b">When the characters arrive at the temple, read or
        paraphrase the following:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>The teleportation circle is surrounded by a courtyard garden and several buildings. The day is warm, with a
            mild breeze. Yellow-robed sages and priests, some carrying tomes or mysterious-looking magic devices, bustle
            about the immense compound. The largest building is patterned with inscribed eyes. A larger, more detailed
            eye is carved above the building’s main doorway.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="033048ca-531a-447a-bc9d-6a1886677a47">The large building is the compound’s main temple,
        home to the priests and oracles of Savras. Despite its elaborate exterior, the interior of the temple is simple,
        containing only an altar, modest living quarters, a kitchen, and a dining area. The building’s only noteworthy
        feature is its reflecting pool, which is filled with holy water.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="05cca2f7-62e1-45a3-9c85-bab6ddf09ad5">When the characters enter the temple, read:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>Several priests are present in the temple, all with a third eye tattooed on their foreheads, and all wearing
            simple yellow robes belted at the waist with a sash. Many carry elaborately carved and decorated staffs.
            Some are at work sweeping or scrubbing the temple’s floors, while others gaze into scrying bowls or
            scrutinize tea leaves.</p>
        <p>The priest who sits at the largest table has her tattooed eye decorated with gemstones. Her dark green hair
            is close-cropped, with a mark shaved into it that matches a sigil on her cherrywood staff. She looks up
            toward you as she pours from a steaming pot of tea.</p>
        <p>“More visitors from Candlekeep. Most delightful. I trust that your journey was not too taxing?”</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c833b027-ac88-4d40-b712-e7440a818e5d">The figure with the bejeweled third eye is Shir
        Endellion (a lawful neutral human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16985-priest"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16985-tooltip">priest</a>), currently the highest-ranking official in the
        temple. While engaged in her divinatory studies a tenday ago, she foresaw the arrival of both Mayastan Sadaar
        and the party, but she does not know the purpose of the characters’ visit.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="98934864-70e0-444a-b635-c514dc5c1dc9">If the characters join her, Shir offers them tea,
        then calls for fine Tashlutan wine, pastries, and other finger foods to be delivered to the table. The priest
        knows the following information, which she is happy to share:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="8b6a83e5-1b9e-4005-9107-213785d0975f">

            with the oracle Valin Sarnaster. The sage was taken to Valin’s sanctum and has not returned.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="b21701ea-4522-4852-b2eb-5ee20dd5f795">Valin Sarnaster is known to all who serve
            Savras, and her works have long been an inspiration. She has lived alone for decades now, so that the
            influence of the outside world will have no effect on her divinatory abilities.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="492e237b-01b5-43b2-9cc4-50f5de311bec">If <em>The Canopic Being</em> is discussed,
            Shir doesn’t recognize the name of the book. If its contents are described, she is horrified, but she says
            that the dark rituals the book describes have nothing to do with Savras’s work. If she is told that Xemru
            Thaal sent the book to Candlekeep nine months ago, she has no idea why that happened.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="d23409ad-0cc8-4874-bdfc-600e7cd50f1f">If the characters ask to see Xemru, Shir says
            that the high priest went through the portal to visit Valin eight months ago and has not come back. Messages
            received from him through Valin’s attendant, Alessia, say that he continues to study with Valin and plans to
            remain with her for the foreseeable future. (Xemru accepted the future in which he saw himself becoming
            Valin’s servant. But a sense of misgiving caused him to send <em>The Canopic Being</em> to Candlekeep as
            evidence of what Valin had become—as Valin had already foreseen.)</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="7396846b-86a3-4012-806e-944c972a9630">Valin lives in a secret sanctum, since she
            would otherwise be sought out by too many people seeking her wisdom and counsel. A portal hidden in the
            temple complex is the only means of reaching her. The oracle sends her attendant, Alessia, through the
            portal regularly to convey and receive messages.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="2efb24fa-1842-483f-914c-3042053c2b11">Three other people have traveled through the

            tiefling gladiator; and Mayastan Sadaar, the Candlekeep sage. As with Xemru Thaal, none of the other

        <p>The presence of the characters’ names in <em>The Canopic Being</em> points to the mummy lord oracle, Valin

            interest in the characters is left to your determination.</p>
        <p>Valin has long plotted to usurp the role of Savras, acquiring power through her dark rituals that will enable
            her to become a new demigod of fate. In her visions, she has seen that the characters will thwart her
            plans—so she has arranged the events that cause them to come to her, so she can end their threat before it
            begins. In the course of their fight to expose and destroy Valin, the characters might gain glimpses of the
            future or hear coded threats from her about the fate she sees for them. Especially if your campaign is built
            around an epic story line, these oracular insights can help you foreshadow what’s to come.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Rite of Reclamation.</strong></em> A ritual known as the rite of reclamation involves claiming
            some of the dust of Valin’s body after she has been reduced to 0 hit points. The ritual describes a process
            for mixing the dust with wax to create a magic candle, then floating the lit candle in a vessel of holy
            water. If a creature imbued with one of Valin’s organs spends an entire long rest within 5 feet of the
            candle, the candle is consumed, Valin’s organ is destroyed, and the creature’s missing organ is restored.
            The rite of reclamation is known to Valin and detailed on a scroll found in <a href="#T5ScryingPool">area
                T5</a>. The characters might also be able to learn the ritual through research or a side quest.</p>

            imbued with one of Valin’s organs has been killed and the characters have access to the creature’s original
            organ. Removing Valin’s organ from the creature’s body reveals it to be shriveled, glassy, and pulsing with
            unnatural life. If the creature’s original organ is replaced within 1 hour of its death at the same time
            Valin’s organ is destroyed, the creature returns to life immediately as if targeted by a <a

        made of crystal, and most of them are unlocked. A character can use an action to try to open a locked door,

        explains that time passes differently in the observatory, making it not unusual that those visitors have
        apparently been gone from the world for months. (This is a lie told to her by Valin.) She thus does not
        understand that the canopic golems have been created from Valin’s visitors. She has not been through <a

        determines it. She does warn them against the dangers they might face in certain areas, including the mirrors of

        freestanding walls inside it show a super-realistic reflection of everything in the room, including the other
        mirrors—quickly creating a confusing cascade of images. Any creature that enters the area and can see normally
        is overwhelmed by multiple visions of itself. Each creature that passes through this area must succeed on a DC
        20 Dexterity saving throw or accidentally make contact with a mirror. A creature that makes contact with a
        mirror for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in contact with one takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b914f022-efa2-4cf9-bb6b-23e1af626584">A creature that passes through the area without
        taking damage earns a gift of supernatural insight that lasts until it finishes a long rest. While it has this
        gift, the creature can roll a d8 and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it
        makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the number, but it must decide
        before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. A creature can’t gain this gift again until it finishes a
        long rest.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4129dce4-bc38-410e-ae6a-50fdc77ada97">Candlekeep received <em>The Scrivener’s Tale</em>
        ten years ago from Machil Rillyn, a noble and a former adventurer from the city of Baldur’s Gate. The terms of
        Machil’s gift stipulated that the book was to be locked away and never read. Alas, his stipulation fell on deaf
        ears. When the book falls by accident into the characters’ hands, each of them is afflicted by a supernatural
        malediction known as the scrivener’s mark. The characters must travel to Baldur’s Gate to learn the origin of
        this potentially deadly mark, then retrace Machil Rillyn’s steps to a ruined library called the Haven of the Red
        Quill. All the while, the archfey bound to the book assails their minds, begging to be freed from her dark
        prison.</p>

        undertaken by the characters in Candlekeep. <em>The Scrivener’s Tale</em> comes into their hands by accident,
        courtesy of an unwitting Avowed acolyte named Ramilir. In the course of delivering the characters an armload of
        requested texts, Ramilir inadvertently scooped up <em>The Scrivener’s Tale</em> from its shelf in Candlekeep’s

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e998b2a5-083a-4b89-981d-ba0dcf6ff502"><em>The Scrivener’s Tale</em> tells the story of a
        selfish and amoral archfey called the Princess of the Shadow Glass, who is locked in a blood feud with the Queen
        of Air and Darkness, the ruler of the Gloaming Court in the Feywild. The queen is described as an intelligent,
        gleaming black crystal that hovers above a throne of twisted, petrified wood. The princess is cast in the role
        of the protagonist, yet she views everyone else as a pawn in her struggle. The tale ends with a monologue
        promising bloody reprisals upon everyone the princess believes has wronged her.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="184e8c90-dd55-409f-981d-63fd7e5a7520">Exiled to the mortal realm, the Princess of the
        Shadow Glass finds a home in the land of humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings. They show her true
        friendship, gifting her with treasures, lands, and titles. In the end, her companions (including the book’s
        narrator, known only as “the scrivener”) convince the princess to reclaim her rightful place as a high noble of
        the fey.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="91a4a669-defd-459a-84f0-d7c8dc5e4e2a">The details of <em>The Scrivener’s Tale</em>
        indicate that the Princess of the Shadow Glass began as a fey of indeterminate type, most likely an eladrin, and
        ultimately became an archfey possessing powerful magical abilities relating to shadow, glass, and illusion. The
        scrivener of the title is an elf named Zyrian, who wrote the book nine hundred years ago. The content of the
        book suggests that the scrivener was compelled to write the tale, which contains effusive praise for the
        princess.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="820cc1fb-5d77-4431-8794-0ffa2e290f3f">Machil Rillyn ordered <em>The Scrivener’s Tale</em>
        hidden away by the scholars of Candlekeep because he understood the potency of its magic, having borne the
        scrivener’s mark until he paid to have a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2303-wish"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2303-tooltip">wish</a> spell cast to end its effect on him.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a4e6c65c-7fa9-4430-87b2-9241f3f4fcb8">When a character reads even a small part of <em>The
            Scrivener’s Tale</em> for the first time, all the characters feel the magic of the book wash over them.
        After finishing a short or long rest, each character discovers that 20 percent of their skin is covered in
        writing that matches portions of <em>The Scrivener’s Tale</em>. The text starts at the character’s fingertips
        and winds around one arm to the shoulder, chest, and back. The lettering in the Elvish script is tiny but
        precise and legible. Each character also gains the level 1 benefit and drawback of the mark, as noted in the
        Scrivener’s Mark Effects table. Any character marked in this way must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw every
        third dawn thereafter. On a failed save, the level of that character’s mark increases by 1. Each additional
        level of the mark covers another 20 percent of the character’s skin with writing until 80 percent of the
        character’s body is covered; the character also gains a new benefit (up to level 4) and a new drawback, in
        addition to retaining the ones from lower levels. A character can choose to fail the saving throw, and a
        character instantly becomes aware of any new benefits and drawbacks.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a74590f-0eec-4e5f-b647-91e770ff5478">This progression means that the adventure might end
        after 12 days as a character succumbs to the highest level of the mark’s effect, assuming that character fails
        every saving throw.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d973254e-bb1d-465d-9bca-43e12e91b689">You can adjust the progression of the mark as you
        see fit. If you want to run lengthy side adventures while the characters travel overland to Baldur’s Gate, you
        might lower the DC of the Charisma saving throw or call for the save at longer intervals. Conversely, if the
        characters have access to enough magic that they’re likely to finish the adventure quickly, the effects of the
        mark might increase by one level every day at dawn with no saving throw allowed.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5ceed55d-f15e-45d1-aed0-e531f8ddce21">The mark can’t be removed from any character except
        by a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2303-wish"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2303-tooltip">wish</a> spell or by destroying the Princess of the Shadow Glass,
        either of which ends the mark on all the characters. If a character dies and returns to life, the scrivener’s
        mark remains in place.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f4a9db0f-1464-4a74-be20-53a862f8addc">A number of separate agencies keep a semblance of
        order in Baldur’s Gate. The most widely known among them is the Flaming Fist, a mercenary company that deals out
        violence freely to keep the middle and lower classes in line. The wealthy elite of Baldur’s Gate, known as
        patriars, generally keep to the Upper City, which is built on high ground. The Lower City, closer to the river,
        holds the middle classes and is the site of much of Baldur’s Gate’s long-simmering class conflict. The city’s
        poorest folk live in the Outer City, a series of squalid neighborhoods located outside the city walls.</p>

        make general inquiries about the retired adventurer and patriar Machil Rillyn. They learn that Rillyn House, his
        noble estate, is in the Upper City. Their inquiries also inform the characters that Machil died ten years ago
        (not long after gifting <em>The Scrivener’s Tale</em> to Candlekeep), having built up a fortune as an adventurer
        but squandering most of it before his death. His family is now led by his niece, Yvandre, who has only recently
        begun to regain her family’s former standing.</p>

        needs of Baldur’s Gate with the riches earned during his adventuring career, he continued his mercenary
        explorations, seeking glory and plunder across the Sword Coast. Machil found less glory over time, though, and

        suffered briefly from a magical malady that produced strange writing on his skin, and which he finally overcame

        truth, Machil was murdered by agents of the Queen of Air and Darkness, who were looking for the book.) Those who
        accompanied Machil on his final expedition were mercenaries, and Yvandre doesn’t know who they were or where

            corrupted my love for you. I pray that someone avenges the evils done by Nintra Siotta, Princess of the
            Shadow Glass, Lady of Dread Omens, Seeker of the Three Crowns. But spend not your own lives against it. The
            scrivener bound her in his haven, and only there can I be free of her. But it is too late for me.” (Machil
            wrote the letter when he knew he was being pursued by agents of the Gloaming Court but was killed before he
            could send it.)</li>

        are ready to retrace the late adventurer’s steps to the place where <em>The Scrivener’s Tale</em> was found: the
        library called the Haven of the Red Quill, hidden beneath the ruins of Delimbiyran. An overland journey from
        Baldur’s Gate or Candlekeep would take a month, so the characters’ best course of action is to teleport to
        Delimbiyran or the nearby town of Daggerford. If the characters lack the means to teleport themselves, Teles
        Ahvoste can cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2275-teleport"

        of Daggerford, was once part of Phalorm, the dwarven, elven, and human Realm of Three Crowns. Repeated attacks
        by powerful neighboring clans eventually laid Phalorm low. The smaller kingdom of Delimbiyran rose in Phalorm’s
        place with the city as its capital, only to fall in turn. The passage of nearly nine centuries since then have
        left little more than a few partially collapsed walls and archways to mark the fallen city aboveground, though
        its underground ruins are better preserved.</p>

        with agents of the Queen of Air and Darkness, an appropriate time to do so would be shortly after the characters
        enter Delimbiyran. The surface ruins are otherwise bereft of dangerous inhabitants.</p>

        complexes of your own design hidden amid the ruins of Delimbiyran. Previously undiscovered trapdoors might
        conceal staircases leading down to long-forgotten cellars, crypts, armories, workshops, shrines dedicated to
        dwarven deities, prisons, and tunnels to the Underdark. Terrifying creatures such as arcanaloths, beholders, and
        vampires would find themselves at home in such places.</p>

        tries to convince the characters that if they don’t vanquish the ghost quickly, the scrivener’s mark will
        destroy them. At the same time, she uses the link binding her to the characters to gain an instinctive sense of
        their actions, though she is not aware of the details of what they’re doing. “Destroy the scrivener,” she says,
        “and I will rid you of his evil mark!” She also says, “The only way this ends well is with us saving each
        other!”</p>

        Zyrian can be permanently destroyed by reducing his ghost to 0 hit points after the haven’s guardian creatures

        Generations of the haven’s scholars bound themselves to defend the site beyond death. Three stone golems and a
        number of undead scholars (now mummies) protect the site, held in magical stasis until a threat is detected. The
        masters of the haven once knew the rituals that would summon the keys held by the golems, allowing easy passage

        character bears when the fight begins. If any character has a level 4 mark, or if Nintra is having too hard a
        time in the fight and needs an additional edge, she can use an action to force a character to make a DC 20
        Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the character’s mark becomes one of the next higher level.</p>

        more levels of the scrivener’s mark must extinguish the candles, whereupon Nintra turns to ash, as does <em>The
            Scrivener’s Tale</em> in Candlekeep. The panes of shadow glass lose their magic when Nintra is destroyed and
        shatter harmlessly, and the scrivener’s mark fades from all the characters.</p>

        sell the collection, you can decide what it might be worth, but the characters should earn at least 50,000 gp
        for the lot (see also “A Little Light Reading” below). Such a reward might take the form of one or two very rare
        magic items, a small keep, a large parcel of land, or a seaworthy galley with a full crew.</p>

        away.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="23f53e51-cdf3-4fa5-a80e-f2e726097532">The characters might decide to seal the site away or
        take it over as a home base or stronghold. If the latter occurs, news of a group of powerful adventurers setting
        up shop in the ruins of Delimbiyran travels quickly. Other groups might become interested in restoring the
        greatness of the fallen city or searching for other dungeon complexes buried under the ruins—and might
        inadvertently stumble upon dangerous secrets and magic.</p>

        Glass brings the characters to the attention of the Queen of Air and Darkness—whether they want that attention
        or not. Though the queen does not deign to consider herself in the debt of mortals, she might bestow favors on
        them if asked, or she could become a powerful but unpredictable ally or patron.</p>

        Haven of the Red Quill represents an amazing find for the scholars of Candlekeep. If the characters offer up
        some or all of the collection for donation, they earn the favor of the First Reader and all the Avowed, and
        might develop close, permanent ties to the library-fortress.</p>

        Daggerford. If the characters spend time in Daggerford before setting out on their next adventure, they might
        encounter the black dragon once more as it swoops over the town’s walls, settles on a rooftop, and demands
        tribute from the townsfolk.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7498605a-08e2-46b6-a56b-69bc44c14f7d">This adventure revolves around a thin book titled
        <em>Alkazaar’s Appendix</em>, brought to Candlekeep by a renowned explorer named Alkazaar in 1363 DR, the Year
        of the Wyvern. This slim volume accompanied a thicker tome titled <em>Alkazaar’s Thrilling Tales</em>, in which
        Alkazaar chronicled his numerous heroic exploits. He bequeathed these books to Candlekeep and also gifted the
        Avowed with a series of live storytelling sessions. The longer-lived Avowed remember these performances with
        fondness and have passed the stories on to the adjutants over the years. One story stands out from all the
        others, and the Avowed of Candlekeep wonder about it to this day: the tale of the lost golem, featuring the one
        adventure that Alkazaar could not complete. This story is told in <em>Alkazaar’s Appendix</em>.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c7cdeb96-4538-44c9-a598-cfad027494f7">This adventure begins when the characters read the
        story of the lost golem in <em>Alkazaar’s Appendix</em> and discover the magic picture in the book. The
        picture-portal can teleport the adventurers to the golem. The book was found by members of a tribe of nomadic
        people called the Bedine, who live in the desert of Anauroch. The Bedine are discussing what to do with the
        golem and how they can profit from it. The golem appears inactive, but the party can figure out how to activate
        the golem from the book. By talking with the Bedine, the adventurers learn about a ruined cave complex known as
        the Hall of Rainbows that could contain clues to the golem’s origin. But the Bedine also warn that the cave
        complex is in the territory of a deadly purple worm.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d275fa4a-b0e3-4728-8fbe-4f20485e4fdc">The adventurers travel to the Hall of Rainbows.
        After defeating the worm, they discover clues that lead to the ruined city of Azumar. They must navigate the
        ruins and find the vault where the golem’s master, Prince Hamukai, now rests.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ad8f016e-2e8c-43a9-9328-5099f2dc2614">In the final showdown, the party must defeat a
        dracolich named Zikzokrishka and then command the golem to open the vault and complete its mission—to deliver
        the prince’s body to Elysium.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="90dfc782-d0c3-48bd-9aa5-310e4ed36db2">Alkazaar was an adventurer of great renown. Tales
        proliferate about his daring and incredible discoveries across Faerûn. Knowing that the definitive collection of
        Alkazaar’s adventures rests within the walls of Candlekeep is reason enough for an adventurer to seek out this
        legendary book and claim a cozy corner to read about the escapades of Alkazaar and his dungeon-delving
        companions. <em>Alkazaar’s Thrilling Tales</em> is a hefty tome, but its smaller companion—<em>Alkazaar’s
            Appendix</em>—contains the intriguing story of Alkazaar’s one unfinished quest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="10723717-cf21-4fe7-aedd-88b08c523b89">The Avowed in Candlekeep<em> </em>could bring
        <em>Alkazaar’s Appendix</em> to the characters’ attention and approach the characters (especially if the party
        has visited Candlekeep before) in hopes that they can complete Alkazaar’s unfinished quest and perhaps procure
        for the library the fabled <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4556a3cb-beb9-4288-93e4-3bc9f2739ca5"><em>Alkazaar’s Thrilling Tales</em> is a weathered
        and cracked leather-bound tome eight inches by ten inches by two inches thick. Embossed gold letters proclaim
        the title on its lavishly decorated cover. Its beautifully rendered interior abounds with images of Alkazaar’s
        handsome, mustachioed face under his wide-brimmed hat. Alkazaar is often shown with the wind whipping at his
        flowing shirt but having no effect on his tight pantaloons and shiny boots. He’s depicted looking marvelous in
        fantastical realms alongside his rugged and ready adventuring companions.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f1be35eb-be1d-4777-816e-067e75bab0cc"><em>Alkazaar’s Appendix</em> is barely half an inch
        thick but otherwise has the dimensions of its companion. When it is opened, a few grains of sand fall from
        between its crisp, dry pages. It contains the story of the lost golem as well as detailed drawings of a stone
        golem with a brilliant blue sapphire for a heart. One of these illustrations doubles as a portal to Anauroch
        (see “<a href="#ThePicturePortal" data-content-chunk-id="a2b26618-0920-44a4-8a99-cb1f83282cc7">The Picture

        <li data-content-chunk-id="c9fe8a0a-904b-4a4a-af90-7c6f3f66cbad">In the Anauroch desert, he came across a
            wandering stone golem. Alkazaar believed this golem was the legendary Sapphire Sentinel, rumored to have
            been created by Netherese wizards to protect one of the fabled <em>Nether Scrolls</em> under the control of
            Prince Hamukai.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="e5f42fa5-fb54-4e97-87ba-71823a423006">The golem recognized its master’s name,
            Hamukai, when Alkazaar mentioned it. From that point on the golem followed him, obeying his commands.</li>

        <li data-content-chunk-id="12d1a522-8d3a-4381-9790-264f1656a4b0">Alkazaar met Bedine nomads who said they knew
            of a place that held clues about the golem, but it was in purple worm territory. He followed the Bedine
            guides until a sandstorm obscured the route. The camels ran off, and, after losing his guides and his
            transportation, Alkazaar called an end to the expedition.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="9626f40f-b009-495d-9726-e8066389f9fb">Before he left the desert, Alkazaar inscribed a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="788333d1-d06c-40d1-b4bb-2f8d8ef32579">Long ago, the wizards of Netheril created a
        magnificent stone golem to guard one of the <em>Nether Scrolls</em>—a collection of dangerous scrolls that
        described the creation of magic and the nature of the Weave. The wizards gave the golem a sapphire heart and
        magically bound a sliver from the gem to the right palm of its master, Hamukai. They charged the young
        wizard-prince of the ancient nation of Anauria with guarding the priceless scroll. The sapphires allowed both
        Hamukai and the golem (whether together or separate) to unlock a magically sealed vault that held the <a
            class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/3001257-nether-scroll-of-azumar"
            data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/3001257-tooltip">Nether Scroll</a>.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="471618ea-a642-424c-ad29-11aa754958f5">The blue dragon Zikzokrishka discovered the scroll’s
        location, and she arrived at the vault ready to destroy any and all in her path. In the ensuing battle, the
        golem gravely wounded Zikzokrishka, but she blasted the golem with eldritch magic that damaged its memory and
        hurled it to a far corner of Faerûn. Thinking his golem destroyed, Hamukai put a shield around the vault
        containing the scroll that could be opened only by the sapphire’s power. Too weak to continue the fight,
        Zikzokrishka limped away to heal her wounds. But as she left, she incanted a powerful Netherese curse: when the
        prince died, the shield would disappear and the scroll would be hers for the taking.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2c4f3747-89ee-4ffc-bf9e-24bb83260d52">Knowing that Zikzokrishka’s curse had sealed his
        fate, Hamukai made a decision. Against the wishes of his subjects, who dearly loved him, the prince ordered his
        wizards to perform a ritual that would keep him on the brink of death for millennia. His magically sustained
        life force would maintain the shield that would seal him in the vault and protect the <a

            data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/3001257-tooltip">Nether Scroll</a>. Since opening the vault required either
        the sapphire shard in his right palm or the golem’s sapphire heart (which he assumed was destroyed along with
        the golem), Hamukai felt sure of the scroll’s safety.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="13bb3cc1-0b0a-4c82-aeeb-c798879ef683">Zikzokrishka returned with an army, intent on
        ripping the sapphire from the prince’s head. She scattered the populace and reduced the prince’s city of Azumar
        to ruin. To her dismay, she found the prince’s tomb to be impregnable. Howling with rage, Zikzokrishka knew that
        the spell that kept the prince alive would thwart her curse for thousands of years, far beyond her draconic life
        span. In her thirst for power, she sought and achieved transformation into a dracolich, willing to wait an
        eternity to outlast the spell that held Hamukai near death, knowing his life force would one day dissipate and
        the vault would become openable.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d589dcd1-fcff-4fcc-b03f-81ff7ae4806c">As she held her vigil, the desert wasteland of
        Anauroch consumed the city. Believing the golem and its sapphire to be destroyed, Zikzokrishka now lies coiled
        around the vault’s entrance, waiting with the patience of undeath for the death of the prince, surrounded by her
        undead minions and jealously guarding her promise of godhood.</p>

        Chwingas shun other creatures, but they find the trappings of civilization fascinating. They puzzle over
        creatures that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga encounters one or more
        humanoids, its curiosity compels it to shadow those creatures for a short time and observe them. If it takes a
        liking to a particular humanoid, a chwinga uses its cantrips to aid it, or bestows a magical gift before
        departing. The features that attract a chwinga to a particular humanoid vary. A chwinga might like the way a
        humanoid walks or the way it combs its hair, or be smitten by a humanoid’s ability to play music or to eat
        copious amounts of food.</p>

        <p>A fungal plague is ravaging the Sword Coast, spreading quickly from one settlement to the next. Although
            magic has proven effective at ridding individuals of the spore infection, the plague is spreading too
            quickly to contain. Creatures that become infected fall ill with a fever and sprout disgusting, gooey,
            fungal growths before losing their autonomy, acting like zombies. They also release spores that infect other
            beasts and humanoids. Eventually, the plague reduces all infected creatures and foodstuffs to puddles of
            ooze.</p>
        <p>Humanoids infected with the plague drone the word “Xanthoria” over and over for no discernible reason before
            death finally claims them. You have determined that there’s a book by that name contained in the
            library-fortress of Candlekeep. With luck, the book holds information that might help you end the
            saprophytic plague before it wipes out every village, town, and city in Faerûn.</p>

        house her soul in a living sprite named Thunderwing. Though initially concerned with ways to end the unnatural
        life of the undead, Xanthoria’s research took a dark turn, as chronicled in her journal, titled

        humanoid that comes within 10 feet of a creature infected by the saprophytic plague must succeed on a DC 20
        Constitution saving throw or become infected as well. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the plague
        for 24 hours, and any creature that is immune to disease succeeds on the save automatically.</p>

        can spread the contagion. This is the time when infected humanoids begin speaking the word “Xanthoria” over and
        over, with no understanding of what the word means. This behavior is the result of a mycelial network of spores

    <p data-content-chunk-id="01d66930-8fd0-49ff-8210-24d4f862f94f">Upon arriving in Candlekeep, the characters can use
        an Avowed guide to help them track down the book titled <em>Xanthoria</em>. This quest brings them to the
        attention of Zelyth Lightleaf, one of Candlekeep’s sages and the foremost expert on Xanthoria—both the book and
        its mysterious author:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>Your guide does not return. Instead, you are greeted by a robed wood elf with brown hair and a plain face. In
            her hands, she holds a book so encrusted with lichen that its covers can barely be closed around its
            wrinkled pages. “I believe you’re looking for this,” she says with a warm, bright smile. “My name is Zelyth
            Lightleaf. I’m Candlekeep’s foremost expert on this book and its author.”</p>

        joined the Avowed, using the book as her entrance gift into the library. She found it in an abandoned satchel
        near a secluded cave system called the Lykortha Expanse, which is known among druids for its rare fungal
        growths. Zelyth assumed the book had been lost and took possession of it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e1b0c5b8-5b32-4d0c-96bc-a389dd3363e6">Quiet and unassuming, Zelyth concentrates on
        training new acolytes and tending to those in need, but she’s aware of the fungal plague spreading like wildfire
        up and down the Sword Coast. She has been expecting someone to show up looking for the book.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0c435a4e-070a-4eaa-a020-02d731384f1a">Zelyth allows the characters to peruse the book and
        assures them it’s safe to do so. (The lichen covering the book poses no danger.) She also shares the following
        information with the characters:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="058f448c-7643-49d3-9a2a-beaae92769ba">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="6cfcf6a7-747a-4006-9fd2-8b7e4ba9452f">Xanthoria was a druid of Silvanus (god of wild
            nature) whose forest home was threatened by undead. By researching fungi and lichen, Xanthoria hoped to
            create a weapon that could protect her forest against undead invaders.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="d9b861bc-33a9-4108-8d10-e2ddeeaad4b7">At some point, Xanthoria’s research became more
            geared toward creating a ward against death itself, then finally toward achieving lichdom.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="22497393-47d5-43ec-8255-539f91eae1da">According to the book, Xanthoria never
            discovered the source of the undead incursion that prompted her initial research.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a235da32-ce32-47ef-ac5f-238be839a2b2">Zelyth doesn’t know what caused Xanthoria’s slide
        into corruption. If questioned about the saprophytic plague, Zelyth muses that the book’s information could be
        helpful in preventing further outbreaks.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a8c6fe10-18dc-4314-84aa-689f4842f88b">Zelyth allows the characters to spend as much time
        with the book as they need. When they’re done with it, Zelyth returns the book to its vault.</p>

        wrinkled due to age and exposure to moisture. Crumbling yellow lichen obscures the title on the front cover,
        rendering it illegible. Harmless spores puff into the air when the book is opened. Standing eight and a half
        inches tall and five inches wide, it has been cataloged as <em>Xanthoria</em>, titled after the author who is
        identified inside the work.</p>

        Joining of Two Worlds</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2e8543bc-3203-4b03-beb6-7164fc8ed739">Written in Common, <em>Xanthoria</em> begins with a
        set of scientific essays about symbiotic relationships in nature before deteriorating into confusing ramblings
        on the merits and similarities of life and death. It describes the author’s numerous experiments both natural
        and unnatural. One of the more thorough studies details the life cycle of a worm-like parasite that infiltrates
        different species of wasps, taking over their motor functions, while essentially wearing their still-living
        bodies as a disguise so the parasites can infect other wasps.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="76abb100-a466-4c58-8584-698e9cd70ac7">Ultimately, Xanthoria found a way to link her soul
        to the life force of another creature and thereby unnaturally prolong her own life, by transforming the other
        creature into a phylactery.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ab36cf4d-0c8e-4206-966f-5065474abb43">Characters who peruse <em>Xanthoria</em> learn the
        following additional information:</p>

        <li data-content-chunk-id="489a1e83-e701-463f-b477-59428cc13cc5">Xanthoria was fearful of a surge in undead
            invading the forest near her home in the Lykortha Expanse, a cave complex. She was seeking a way to stop
            their spread and preserve what she viewed as the natural order of things.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="63003f4b-7b12-4415-8b1a-2ed6ea2b7341">Most of the book discusses healthy symbiotic

        <li data-content-chunk-id="db5f4af9-6b2f-420f-bdae-5e915f0af20d">The author spent time researching undead in the
            hope of gaining insight into their actions and ascertaining where they could be coming from.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="a4c64511-a8f6-4c12-b1ea-1192e1c40881">The writing gradually turns into almost
            incomprehensible fragments, many alluding to the author's desire to combine natural life and the undead.
        </li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="a7f06317-bb2a-4126-8aec-f8c671a5f9f0">The end of the book records several failed
            attempts by Xanthoria to extend her life through a process similar to becoming a lich. There are various
            drawings of dissected animals and humanoids alongside musings on the viability of experimenting on fey
            creatures.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="16bb25cd-b4b6-4c07-a0e9-85ce6d17e73b">The sketches and margin notes get progressively
            darker the farther one reads. The terms “Mycorji? Shedaklah?” and “Lady of Lichen” appear several times
            each. Furthermore, the number 222 appears frequently throughout the latter half of the book devoid of
            explanation.</li>

        recalls that the Abyss’s 222nd layer is known as Shedaklah and sometimes is called Mycorji. On a total of 25 or

        experiences an image in their mind’s eye of a female half-elf in a gossamer cape made of mycelial threads. This
        brief vision is accompanied by a momentary feeling of intense longing and hunger. This event occurs only once.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="15d2963a-d59d-4e29-9a62-d9a5879f5f9f">Thunderwing was Xanthoria’s friend until the druid’s
        mind became twisted by the influence of Zuggtmoy, causing Xanthoria to conduct grisly experiments on living
        creatures. Thunderwing is one of Xanthoria’s more recent subjects. The sprite looks alive, yet she is subject to
        effects that turn undead.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9f4e6ca4-ca9a-42be-8116-dfa4cf95f94e">Thunderwing can’t be harmed unless she chooses to
        be. This is true for as long as she functions as a living phylactery for Xanthoria. Weapons and harmful effects

        can’t remember if Xanthoria is home or not, but she doesn’t recall seeing the druid outside the cave complex
        recently. Since Xanthoria moves freely throughout the Lykortha Expanse, she could be anywhere, according to
