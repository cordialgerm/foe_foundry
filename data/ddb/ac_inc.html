<p data-content-chunk-id="0245f0f3-694b-4a75-9c13-0aa15f3c32e6">Acquisitions Incorporated was founded in Seattle, Washington, in a time spoken of in only hushed tones: the year 2009. It first saw life as a podcast, which, at the time, was an unusual way to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The intervening decade saw Acq Inc take on many forms — streams, recorded content, comics, and, of course, live roleplaying shows. While these are all now completely normal ways to discover and enjoy D&amp;D, back then, not so much. We just did it because it seemed like a cool idea, and ten years later, it seems like maybe we were right. Today, Acq Inc’s adventures continue, dutifully chronicled online at acq-inc.com.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ccc560bc-2c81-4a76-82eb-bdd6473d5997">Our intention with Acquisitions Incorporated was to bring dark office comedy to a world of swords, sorcery, dungeons, and (dare we say) dragons. This book, created in concert with Wizards of the Coast, sets you up for success in your own fantasy-business endeavors. Chapter 1 provides an orientation for new franchise members, detailing how to start a game and play the Acquisitions Incorporated way. <a title="Chapter 2" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise" data-content-chunk-id="75e81735-ba3e-4342-a97e-07324573682c">Chapter 2</a> explores the various positions within an Acq Inc franchise, introducing a variety of roles vital to an adventuring enterprise’s success. <a title="Chapter 3" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/player-options" data-content-chunk-id="2317a137-6780-4407-a9c4-8afdad15e35a">Chapter 3</a> delves into backgrounds for Acq Inc franchise members, entrenching company goals at the core of their beings. In <a title="Chapter 4" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/the-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-content-chunk-id="5e4140f6-7a83-4aea-bfb1-47ea816a7f4d">Chapter 4</a>, all this comes together in an adventure taking characters from level 1 to 6, establishing a party’s claim on a world they’ve begun to explore and strip-mine for profit.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a8c67487-d46c-48a9-a34b-1766935f315d">Following these chapters, <a title="appendix A" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/acq-inc" data-content-chunk-id="0eab0e34-d3be-49c1-8321-540a527d420a">appendix A</a> presents stalwarts of the Acquisitions Incorporated world, founding members and characters from the company’s ongoing adventures. <a title="Appendix B" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/monsters" data-content-chunk-id="dcd40a1a-41e1-423a-8ed1-4f7aa8e335d6">Appendix B</a> details foes, from terrifying deep crows to infamous keg robots. <a title="Appendix C" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/vehicles" data-content-chunk-id="13f929f4-9ea9-40a9-9359-62be4824dbe4">Appendices C</a>, <a title="Appendix D" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/orrery-and-components" data-content-chunk-id="a3f2ee44-6843-4489-a29e-04ab133e3269">D</a>, and <a title="Appendix E" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/trinkets" data-content-chunk-id="8f9ba36f-7a53-496c-87ed-7734e600547e">E</a> conclude this guide with a variety of Acq Inc tools and treasures, from vehicles like the <a class="tooltip-hover vehicles-tooltip" href="/vehicles/battle-balloon" data-tooltip-href="/vehicles/7-tooltip">battle balloon</a> to the mighty <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705876-tooltip">Orrery of the Wanderer</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="881c1f12-1368-413c-9959-04f885e23375">Many hands worked diligently throughout the process of creating the Acquisitions Incorporated campaign and this resulting book. If you put your ear very close to the pages, you will hear us whisper, “thank you.”</p>
<h2 id="ItsJustBusiness" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="496a1938-506c-4501-9918-38018ad9da59"><a href="#ItsJustBusiness" data-content-chunk-id="cb72dd2e-bc1e-427c-a1ab-da823ac0a194"></a>It’s Just Business</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7a87fe6d-78f6-4dd2-94e1-7ab34ab22b7c">With its roots set firmly in heroic fantasy, D&amp;D might feel out of sync with modern-day business dealings. But the game and its settings are actually a perfect fit for such tropes. What better way to think of the big bad monster at the center of a web of even bigger and badder plans than as the CEO of a megacorporation, using every resource to dominate the market? What is an adventuring party but a limited-liability corporation, with each member contributing specialized skills to growing the brand and expanding a power base?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="93b9382d-455b-4dee-b10d-95134e3b78b2">Likewise, hirelings, sidekicks, apprentices, and other paid laborers working for the heroes have been staples of <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Small-Cap-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="29c15e42-dcb1-4b75-8680-d9e78e5494d6">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span> since the earliest editions of the game. Charisma in AD&amp;D was good for little other than determining how many followers your character might gather — and, more importantly, how much pain and suffering you could put those followers through before they abandoned you. The world of Acquisitions Incorporated returns these hired helpers to prominence for their importance to the campaign story. And, of course, for comic effect.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3622c8c0-1766-43d8-9acf-f58046dc7a41">When the characters are relatively low level, an Acquisitions Incorporated style of play can present them with even more hurdles to overcome. The often bizarre, unfeeling, and surreal elements of corporate and business life can add a degree of danger or absurdity to even the most run-of-the-mill adventuring. And as the characters attain higher levels — and their franchise attains higher rank — their connections to Acquisitions Incorporated can help dial up the stakes of any adventure path. In an Acq Inc campaign, every NPC is a potential customer. Every bit of treasure found is an investment in the franchise and its future. Every other would-be hero is the competition, and every villain is the head of Evil Incorporated, just begging for some market volatility.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f64700b-50ea-4b53-8d7b-2af48f8c45d1">Money, as they say, makes the world go around. And as is true in real life, so it goes in the fantasy realm. The far-reaching power of global corporations allied with political power doesn’t just inform our own real world — it molds it. Bringing that concept of powerful corporations working with or against nobility to gain money, power, and influence into D&amp;D adds another layer of depth to the story your campaigns create.</p>
<h3 id="WhatIsAcquisitionsIncorporated" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="32cfbd39-feec-433c-aa92-6e638fbae3a3"><a href="#WhatIsAcquisitionsIncorporated" data-content-chunk-id="279bdfbd-86cd-4729-8661-31656768db79"></a>What Is Acquisitions Incorporated?</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5676836b-c235-4931-93ab-40b7de9fb264">An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign has a unique texture, because it combines deeply ordinary clerical toil with multiverse-spanning stakes. And in the end, you never know which one of those tropes might save your life.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="efcf0f52-8a49-4d39-b20d-6e5f5df6acc3">Acquisitions Incorporated is high fantasy by way of office comedy. Imagine the Fellowship of the Ring insisting they only trekked from nine to five. Think about Conan barbarously assailing his way up the corporate ladder. Or perhaps King Arthur insisting that Excalibur’s real magic lie in brand awareness, or Robin Hood pivoting the Merry Men toward a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f1558e92-669d-40fe-a093-8816c6e6c032">Starting your own Acquisitions Incorporated franchise means stepping into a world of possibility. It opens up countless adventure hooks, rules for building and growing your own personalized base of operations, and a way to introduce Acquisitions Incorporated’s specific sense of farcical corporate culture, questionable morality, and unfolding narrative to your own game.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bf3ab4ce-b8df-4373-b18d-6405b8b7cb3f">Within the world of Acquisitions Incorporated, the franchise is the center of brand expansion throughout the world of Faerûn and beyond, even as it provides a new set of tools for player expression and involvement. In a way, it provides players with a greater purpose to explore. And although entirely nonnegotiable, franchise fees are incredibly reasonable.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="bd84d01b-14b4-448b-92b3-b0e948b3c49e">Throughout history, some people have had things and other people have wanted those things. But where most would gaze upon that arrangement and see an inescapable life of unfulfillment, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/359278-omin-dran" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/359278-tooltip">Ominifis Hereward “Omin” Dran</a> saw a business opportunity. Thus was Acquisitions Incorporated born. In the years since, Omin and longtime employee (though less-longtime friend) <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/359295-jim-darkmagic" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/359295-tooltip">James Winifred “Jim” Darkmagic III</a> have turned a talent for redistribution of property into a reputation as the multiverse’s premier adventurers for hire.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="159bad8a-86ad-4cd7-964b-c594e9e7acf8">Omin Dran, CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated and war priest of Tymora, is the very model of the modern Faerûn business mien. He prioritizes his responsibilities first to his shareholders (which is to say, himself); second to his goddess; and then at some later stage to the well-being of his employees. It’s definitely not third. But it’s up there somewhere.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2c085f89-4b09-4e39-9ff9-a6f9139572e5">Jim Darkmagic III comes from a long line of renowned wizards, but he turned his back on his family and his inheritance for a life on the stage — at least until well-paid heroics came calling. Jim and Omin’s unlikely partnership began when Jim was the only surviving candidate in the running for a hotly contested position with the company. (Any deaths incurred in this process were incidental, and not the result of the actions or negligence of Acq Inc.)</p>
<h3 id="HowItStarted" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="30a93e9a-f7d4-4984-addb-02734e7db2e4"><a href="#HowItStarted" data-content-chunk-id="437a44dd-4a3e-499c-8347-073d443b1a93"></a>How It Started</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8a9f1eb7-b90e-40f4-ae0e-4b1f92eec1af">Acquisitions Incorporated began as most adventuring groups do, with the wholesale removal of irksome kobolds, scouting ruined towers, delving into dwarven necropolis-cities, and abandoning wounded goblin hirelings named Splug to a terrible fate. The usual stuff. But in short order, Acq Inc traded kobolds for dragons, and upgraded ruined towers to eldritch temples. As the company grew, so too did its demand for willing and able-bodied adventurers. However, a limited payroll meant having to settle for one or the other.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6522e57d-9fd0-4fd5-b587-43e4b5ffe422">After coming to the conclusion that a mission statement best described as “minion harvesting” sent the wrong message, Acquisitions Incorporated started an internship program. In accordance with the truism “you get what you pay for,” the very first Acq Inc intern died on his second assignment with the company. But like all good leaders, Omin Dran understood that truisms cut two ways, and he led the remaining team on a legendary trek through the Nine Hells to recover the soul of said intern. (Clearly, none of those hells paid for him either.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2f2e8668-7616-4d0a-9c2d-164d580d13f7">The rogue <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/359321-viari" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/359321-tooltip">Viari</a> is one of Acquisitions Incorporated’s best internship success stories. In fact, he was so successful that he remained the company’s flagship intern for nearly a decade. He first joined Acquisitions Incorporated during an expedition into the <a title="Undermountain dungeons of Halaster Blackcloak" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdotmm" data-content-chunk-id="8ae25458-09c7-4072-9b71-0e1e8300ad4a">Undermountain dungeons of Halaster Blackcloak</a> (who, due to an ongoing defamation suit, we can no longer refer to as “the Mad Mage”). From regrowing his own arm after an unfortunate incident with the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="459f2b45-139f-415a-a7f9-3ac26c4b6a19">Apocalypse Dagger</span>, to wrangling dinosaurs to win street races, Viari has earned something far more valuable than a regular salary with Acq Inc. He’s earned on-the-job experience.</p>
<h3 id="AggressiveExpansion" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f642e053-0c9c-4691-bf9e-a5f39e5c9b5f"><a href="#AggressiveExpansion" data-content-chunk-id="00513061-9b52-4402-bea1-e48d89cf27ff"></a>Aggressive Expansion</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7b4b7475-7093-444f-96d2-eab3cea4cb32">Thanks to the company’s continuing success and robust internship program, Acquisitions Incorporated has long since outgrown garden-variety slaughter and disregard for public well-being. <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/359335-morgaen" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/359335-tooltip">Môrgæn</a>, an elf ranger from the Elsewynn, joined the team as a troubleshooter some time ago, and quickly showed that her propensity for slaughter and disregard for the public well-being is far beyond garden variety.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="94ed4cd4-dbab-423e-93e0-3ec1f7864299">Môrgæn’s recruitment coincided with Acquisitions Incorporated acquiring its first airship. Diviners have theorized that this was no coincidence, but the combined psychic will of all mortal creatures to put as much distance between them and the ranger as possible. More practical minds see the folly in this, since the airship simply gave Môrgæn a better vantage point.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="370e17c8-ff71-4ddb-88ea-04a0d261fc6c">Beyond the core Acquisitions Incorporated crew, Omin Dran has overseen regular strategic expansion of the Acq Inc brand. The “C” Team, the “B” team, and numerous other franchise operations have been established, flying the Acq Inc flag, bearing the Acq Inc sigil, and — most crucially — paying a cut of the profits into company coffers on a monthly basis.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="15af5f68-f664-4f41-92f7-dacd5b0b8bef">In the years between its founding and today, Acquisitions Incorporated has pried deep into the underbelly of Waterdeep, commandeered battle balloons above the jungles of Chult, faced down mechanical beholders, and robbed a bank operated by devils. The team has also rubbed shoulders with some of the most notorious figures in the Forgotten Realms, including bumping into Drizzt Do’Urden while journeying through the Underdark.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="832a4eb9-030d-43c1-aa7a-71f400c635dd">When Jim Darkmagic became afflicted with the Death Curse, there was no definitive proof that this was a direct result of his employment with Acquisitions Incorporated, or had been incurred while on assignment. However, as Omin had already made his stance on the subject of death and termination of employment contracts very clear, he sought to break the curse. Dabbling in some light cloning and contracting the help of a trash witch, the team managed to restore Jim to peak productivity. Never one to waste company resources, Omin also traded Jim’s clone to a devil. It seemed prudent at the time.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="466c61cb-a34a-4b6c-92ea-1d09f5771e5f">However, nothing in Acquisitions Incorporated’s storied history encapsulates the company’s efficacy better than the recovery of Omin’s sister, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/359970-auspicia-dran" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/359970-tooltip">Auspicia Dran</a>, from the Wandering Crypt. The specifics of her initial capture by that dread creature remain shrouded in mystery. Some say it was inspired by the evil actions of Omin’s other sister, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/359976-portentia-dran" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/359976-tooltip">Portentia</a>. Some also speculate that as the sole shareholder of Acq Inc, Omin founded the company for the express purpose of rescuing his beloved sister. Acquisitions Incorporated will not be making further statements on the matter at this time.</p>
<h3 id="NoCompetition" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="07132257-09b1-47c9-b133-4dfbaa6f52cf"><a href="#NoCompetition" data-content-chunk-id="e090203d-b32f-4841-84bb-91f35140abb0"></a>No Competition</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e39a75c-26f8-438f-88b9-1fa167672c96">The company’s mounting successes have led, of course, to imitators and rivals. The Six, counting among their number a certain left-for-dead goblin now named <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/360031-splugoth-the-returned" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/360031-tooltip">Splugoth the Returned</a>, have been a persistent splinter in the Acq Inc corporate paw for ages. Suggesting that acquisition is a family business, Omin’s own sister Portentia now runs and serves a competing company called Dran Enterprises. Originally founded by what turned out to be a false version of Omin’s lost sister, Auspicia, Dran Enterprises has long sought to execute a hostile takeover of Acquisitions Incorporated. All such efforts have been skillfully rebuffed, of course, with Acq Inc embracing its place as an always-independent (and clearly superior) operation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3038aa0f-37f4-4e21-9831-f054eebfe804">Riding its past success into a completely deliberate and planned expansion across the multiverse, Acquisitions Incorporated shows no signs of slowing down. (Because that would likely require self-reflection and measured responses that are historically off-brand.) And that expansion means new franchises. The first step was Ravnica, a city run by guilds and simply overflowing at the practicability of acquisition for hire. But beyond that? Infinite possibilities. Because wherever people want things they don’t currently have, Acquisitions Incorporated will be there, asking them to sign.</p>

But when you take your place as part of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, you become something more than a mere hero. As a member of an elite group standing on the cutting edge of the adventuring business, the brand precedes you. And sure, sometimes the blades on the cutting edge are kind of sharp. But with Head Office at your back, you know you have the best tools in the industry at your disposal. And maybe the basic funeral packages Acq Inc offers aren’t that great, but there are some tasteful upgrades you might consider.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c8868db7-2267-4719-a4fb-db8e877e9fbe">This chapter introduces the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise and the rules for running it. Franchise benefits are organized by level tier, and include an ever-expanding business territory, wide ranges of options and upgrades for a franchise headquarters, and more. This chapter also introduces company positions — a new set of rules for franchise characters granting access to unique, tier-based abilities that can help a party stand out in a crowded marketplace. And because taking a vacation is no excuse for diminished returns, an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise can make use of expanded rules for downtime and franchise activities, allowing players to help shape the business and the narrative of the campaign even when they aren’t in the field.</p>
<h2 id="FranchiseAdvancement" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="294e9e33-029b-47a1-b1ba-48b48a8c2dc6"><a href="#FranchiseAdvancement" data-content-chunk-id="43a14447-13ab-4689-9a8a-66e7ac645280"></a>Franchise Advancement</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="12d19cbe-8aec-4b54-ba98-0406e8915ae6">A license to operate an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise comes with nearly limitless benefits! When your party starts a franchise, you receive a region in which to operate, a franchise headquarters, and a majordomo to assist with basic headquarters needs. As your characters become accomplished adventurers (and continue to contribute to Head Office coffers), Acquisitions Incorporated helps your franchise gain even greater benefits! See the following <a title="Franchise Advancement table" href="#FranchiseAdvancementTable" data-content-chunk-id="35ebc368-12d5-4a71-8ddf-14fb58997a58">Franchise Advancement table</a> for a summary of what you get at each rank.</p>
<h3 id="FranchiseRank" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="8be72880-a315-44ab-b926-e7bc80a51fb5"><a href="#FranchiseRank" data-content-chunk-id="92d1b689-25c7-4e90-84df-7e5c35c7cbef"></a>Franchise Rank</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2dc7cbef-691a-4fc3-b9c7-14695fa68f23">By default, a franchise rank is gained at each tier of play (beginning at level 1 and advancing when the average party level reaches level 5, 11, and 17). The DM might choose to increase or decrease the level of play at which franchise tiers are gained, or tie advancement to story or campaign goals. Each franchise rank provides characters the opportunity to operate in a larger geographic area, hire staff and direct them to execute franchise tasks, and customize the franchise headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="LicensedRegion" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="5170b049-6f02-4207-adc2-7a77a3228666"><a href="#LicensedRegion" data-content-chunk-id="f254ad0d-58a2-4307-af4e-53611ffcba3d"></a>Licensed Region</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6b2e438b-f9aa-4f01-842b-46ee304bbaa4">When a franchise first starts out, it is licensed to operate in a small region focused on a settlement or similar mercantile point. You might think this means Head Office doesn’t trust its new franchisees. Not at all! No! It’s just so much easier to support a group when they start in a focused area. Don’t worry at all that a rival Acquisitions Incorporated franchise will outmaneuver you. It seldom happens. Keep growing your business, and the Acq Inc license will expand to help you find more customers and increase your brand presence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="41432a65-be2b-40be-b296-6f3f4a8a7d0e">Within your licensed region, you have the right to use the full power of Acquisitions Incorporated branding. No other Acquisitions Incorporated franchise will operate in your region, and all the region’s customers are exclusively yours. Of course, non-Acquisitions Incorporated rival organizations might be present. You are expected to drive them out of business. (Or give them untimely deaths. You do you.) A franchise can build or operate any number of locations, such as warehouses and trade shops, within its region. You may not maintain property or establish formal operations in a settlement outside your region, even if you ship goods to that location.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c089a488-170e-4221-8b3a-196aaf4c3edb">You may not use the Acquisitions Incorporated brand outside your licensed region without written, documancer-generated permission, since those areas might belong to other licensees. You can adventure outside your territory, of course, and can assist or work for other organizations. However, you are expected to prioritize missions given to you by Head Office.</p>
<h4 id="Rank1Settlement" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="9c1c749f-add6-4aaa-8505-4d8d7e59d9ca"><a href="#Rank1Settlement" data-content-chunk-id="cf236c57-8676-4f73-9421-3e422599f02a"></a>Rank 1: Settlement</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8e908448-405f-4670-8e35-83303d66b247">Acquisitions Incorporated grants your franchise a license to operate in a settlement, and in a territory around the settlement approximately 10 miles across. If your region includes a coastline, you are granted the rights to engage in sea trade within that region. You can ship goods (over land, water, or air) to one city or other settlement outside your region. (The DM approves this location, and might wish to establish your franchise’s relationship with it through play as part of the campaign.)</p>
<h4 id="Rank2SmallTerritory" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="2cfaf2f6-1d50-4efd-bd8a-708ea7dcb879"><a href="#Rank2SmallTerritory" data-content-chunk-id="749ca19c-26e5-474e-bd90-5c9efbc71ba8"></a>Rank 2: Small Territory</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c3e69c7b-39b9-4182-9e22-001d56f104b0">Your license now expands to include a region similar in size to a province or a small kingdom — typically up to 50 miles across, with your starting settlement somewhere within. (For mapping purposes, this area is roughly the same scale as a province-scale map. See “<a title="Mapping Your Campaign" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/a-world-of-your-own#MappingYourCampaign" data-content-chunk-id="5d033710-e33b-4fef-99ee-417d6df22b77">Mapping Your Campaign</a>” in chapter 1 of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="05762c05-5d26-44d5-8b1a-8d317bf65b9b"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i></span>.) You are expected to expand your trade and branding throughout the region. You’ll seize new markets, develop new offerings, increase your network of contacts, and safeguard the king and queen’s spoiled kids so the monarchs think of you positively. You can ship goods to two cities or other settlements outside your region.</p>

<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="3fa9e371-e625-4379-8aff-ddc292951274">An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is a group effort. Many decisions must be made in the course of running a franchise and playing in an Acq Inc campaign, and it is assumed that all players will be involved in making those decisions. Whenever this book talks about a franchise collectively — and in particular, when it talks about decisions being made by a franchise — the understanding is that all characters (in the game) and all players (at the table) have an equal say in determining a franchise’s fortunes and fate. Sure, arguments will crop up from time to time. But that kind of roleplaying is a big part of what makes an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6e5a7a55-c022-4cc6-ba7a-228a3d690c1e">Your license grows to include a broad expanse of provinces, a few small kingdoms, or a large kingdom or federation, covering a territory the size of half the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. A large territory might overlap with other Acquisitions Incorporated regions, though you are theoretically working with (and perhaps overseeing) smaller franchises rather than working against them. You can ship your goods to any destination, and can assign staff to a city to which you ship goods — solely to oversee the distribution of those goods, and certainly not to compete with rivals. Don’t cause too much trouble and Head Office will stay happy.</p>
<h4 id="Rank4LimitedExtraplanar" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="8debfd1e-623e-482f-8521-2357dee34935"><a href="#Rank4LimitedExtraplanar" data-content-chunk-id="1788b672-1857-41f3-a587-f84102b30c15"></a>Rank 4: Limited Extraplanar</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dfb16b3f-cf79-425c-af9c-34a7871a9dc2">Your franchise now includes specific locations located on other planes of existence. These could include such fabled trading locations as Sigil, the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire, or a githyanki outpost in the Astral Plane. Your license to operate in these regions is not exclusive. Your region on the Material Plane might or might not expand, depending on both your performance and the goals of the campaign. The DM might establish extraplanar locations through play. Failing — or succeeding — in securing an extraplanar location could create interesting and deadly rivalries!</p>

As is true of characters in any campaign, Acquisitions Incorporated franchisees are free to hire any NPCs they want, within whatever limitations the DM wants to set on such employment. But the franchise itself comes with a number of staff whose wages are part of the franchise’s cost, providing not only labor but story potential.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="0fbc5fd3-9298-4868-ba55-07f49e8000a5"><a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-left" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/5/576/02-02.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title=""><img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/5/576/420/530/02-02.png" alt="" class="ddb-lightbox-inner"></a></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c2c3ef5b-8b39-4d60-8967-91a612128b43">Each franchise rank grants a number of new staff members who live in the franchise headquarters or within its geographic scope. The cost of maintaining staff is included in a franchise’s costs. Each staff member has a proficiency bonus equal to 2 + the franchise’s rank. For skilled hirelings or crew, the DM might substitute NPC statistics when that seems appropriate. Each time a franchise gains a rank, existing staff members can be gifted with early retirement (that is, fired), and replaced alongside new hires that fit the franchise’s needs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ea9ee775-1347-4f45-8aff-a8ef753d1f01">A franchise might engage all kinds of hirelings and agents over the course of a campaign, but specialized franchise staff fall into four different categories.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ff77a63e-fe9f-4e96-8ee6-9dcb7395471a">A majordomo administers a franchise headquarters. They typically reside within the headquarters and seldom leave it, sending out communications through a dedicated messenger (at no extra cost, and traveling on foot or by means the franchise provides). A majordomo is proficient in Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) and two skills of the DM’s choice.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="523813ba-edd9-4620-8169-cf50bcfc0308">The DM is encouraged to use the rules for creating nonplayer characters in <a title="chapter 4" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#DesigningNPCs" data-content-chunk-id="7fc9c833-90db-47ec-9290-671465334913">chapter 4</a> of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="6e45899d-a6d3-476c-a45b-0befeb1bf8f1"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i></span> to detail the majordomo, giving this individual a vibrant personality and backstory. The majordomo’s goals should be aligned with the franchise and with Acquisitions Incorporated as a whole, allowing them to properly act as an ally and steward for the party.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="06720521-6dda-436d-87c0-e5bce7d628ad">It can be helpful to a campaign to provide the majordomo with a backstory that complements a franchise’s evolution over time. A sage might research how the franchise gains new capabilities. Or perhaps the majordomo was the pilot of a vessel capable of planar travel, who slowly applies those features to the headquarters. A majordomo of a franchise modeling itself after a spy organization might constantly invent devices for the franchise, making continuing progress as the party returns with gold, lore, and resources.</p>

Untrained hirelings can work for a franchise or its allies, perhaps tending a garden for a noble family or helping a merchant unload cargo from ships. They will not engage in combat and do not leave the headquarters to join the party on adventures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a6b9a1bd-cd09-44e0-8476-9091b2342252">The DM should name at least one hireling who acts as a leader for any interactions with groups of untrained laborers. Providing hirelings with a similar background (such as a band of ex-soldiers or reformed criminals) can add personality to the group. Consider using the rules in <a title="chapter 4" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters" data-content-chunk-id="fc5416a6-6952-4071-9c5a-5c745ffb73f6">chapter 4</a> of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="9b03ccab-9463-46df-b853-01cfa08c6fca"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i></span>, applying the results of a single set of rolls to the entire group. Those hirelings could all shave their heads zealously, be brawny but absentminded, play various musical instruments, use colorful oaths and exclamations, and so on.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="92e063ed-9fa7-4145-a8e6-427f0133096f">Group ideals, bonds, and flaws, along with a shared history, can all add depth to a group of untrained hirelings. Those musicians might be connected by the ideal of tradition, and bound to the franchise to protect a cultural heirloom they value above all else. Their flaw and secret could be that they stole the heirloom from their former employer, a rival merchant organization. Over time, the same hirelings might show up as part of the characters’ adventures time and time again, revealing aspects of their past and creating story continuity.</p>

</div>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fecdf0fb-7c24-4606-8c4d-680f7d9b65d2">A skilled hireling has one or more skill, weapon, or tool proficiencies. A franchise can request skilled hirelings when needed (up to the maximum allowed by franchise rank), with the players describing the concept behind the hirelings and selecting one proficiency for each. The DM can then customize the hirelings as desired, perhaps by adding additional proficiencies or adjusting their combat statistics.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d18f18ca-586a-4349-8c96-0a4fd6c81bda">Skilled hirelings can be fired and hired as needed. A franchise might bring on a couple of thugs to act as distraction during a street fair, then release those NPCs to hire a different set of skilled hirelings to conduct franchise tasks and downtime activities.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d5dc4ac-0277-404d-84b1-7df956753f39">Hirelings cannot perform more than one task at a time. A full complement of skilled hirelings assisting the party on a mission precludes other skilled hirelings from helping with franchise tasks and downtime activities until the mission is completed. As with untrained hirelings, detailing a group background and assigning personality characteristics to a group leader can make for a fun play experience.</p>

An NPC with a challenge rating of roughly half the franchise rank works well for most adventures, providing utility without disrupting balance.

<p data-content-chunk-id="b8512e48-2cc1-461e-88c4-043065abf811">Crew are skilled hirelings trained in tasks pertaining to the physical maintenance of a franchise (for example, servers or gardeners) or the navigation of a mobile headquarters (sailors for a seagoing franchise, engineers for a giant hollow statue, and so on). Crew do not leave a franchise and cannot perform franchise tasks. They typically run rather than fight back when attacked, though the DM can decide otherwise. If a mobile franchise headquarters requires more crew than is granted by the franchise’s rank, the characters must hire the remainder (typically at the skilled hireling cost of 2 gp per day).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b49225f0-b8e1-41ae-9730-418fb5bb76bb">Hiring crew can become a cooperative roleplaying activity. Potential crew might hear of Acquisitions Incorporated or the party’s exploits and come to interview with the franchisees. Choices might be offered by the DM, as between a team of ex-militia who lost their last battle and a crew of recently released criminals who swear they were wrongly imprisoned. Names, personalities, and roles can be assigned to crew by the DM and the players. Rather than simply interacting with the cook and the first mate, the characters can instead deal with Pepper, the chef who loves spicy foods, and Brazen, the veteran sailor who always talks back, creating the potential for entertaining interactions as the franchise grows.</p>
<h3 id="HeadquartersFeatures" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="002c0a82-570a-4ad6-9072-490f2984a993"><a href="#HeadquartersFeatures" data-content-chunk-id="c3b3200b-a64f-45eb-af45-128e7a684bce"></a>Headquarters Features</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9b3e8a88-2402-4996-968e-07e1ae1dc233">Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office provides the members of each franchise with a place to call their own. It might not be initially impressive (cleaning any old blood stains is the franchisees’ responsibility). But over time, characters in an Acq Inc campaign are granted resources to help construct the headquarters of their dreams! Each franchise rank affords the characters a number of choices, allowing customization and creativity. Sample features are provided as guidelines, but a franchise’s features can include literally anything decided on and agreed to by the players and the DM.</p>
<h4 id="GroupDesign" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="6dd9c114-fc74-4b8c-96ad-ae6cea3d06f2"><a href="#GroupDesign" data-content-chunk-id="da67db8b-1191-4cdc-af3d-748a82644235"></a>Group Design</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7171d0fa-9b8a-4cc5-955c-3a85bcfe6073">When selecting a feature, the characters must make decisions together — meaning the players must do the same. Deciding on the features of a headquarters should be a team effort, both in game and around the table. What should a headquarters look like initially? Do the characters prefer to travel by land or by sea, or to operate from a fixed location? Is a ruined keep more interesting than an old vine-covered wizard’s tower in the woods? Is the headquarters remote or within a settlement — perhaps an old tavern or caravansary the characters can restore?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="084e449f-b64d-49d1-a202-94a7454ef1fe">It can be helpful to think ahead as well. Acquisitions Incorporated is known for mobile franchises, helping to bring goods and adventuring services to distant locations. When a franchise headquarters becomes mobile, will it fly or sail? Will it gain the power to teleport across the land? Will it sprout legs and walk?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="664c497c-47e7-45b9-9438-f24d9d2376b2">Everything depends on the type of headquarters. The top of a wizard’s tower might detach and shoot skyward like a missile. Or a franchise’s headquarters might be contained within a giant statue, which over time gains the power to move farther and faster. A castle or other stationary structure could contain a portal or teleportation circle, allowing the characters to travel to distant locations while the stronghold remains behind.</p>

<p class="Call-Out_Call-Out" data-content-chunk-id="40c4e01e-dfc8-4f1e-a37d-b9db773bcfa0">There are a lot of perks to being an intern that people overlook. The hours are very flexible, you get a 20 percent discount in the gift shop, you get a bathroom break every four hours as long as you ask your supervisor first. And sometimes if you go into the conference room after a meeting, there will be a bunch of soda and leftover subs. You can just take as much as you want! As long as nobody sees you.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="01766d00-2b82-4040-b579-bdb4237fe9ad">The characters’ collective skill proficiencies, tool proficiencies, backgrounds, and positions within their franchise could all impact the design and construction of a headquarters. A glassblower might make beautiful stained-glass windows, while a herbalist fills the headquarters with pleasing or mysterious scents. An acolyte could outfit a small area of the headquarters as a chapel, while a sage sources a unique desk at which to work. Such features are cosmetic or limited in impact, but enable players to feel more interested and invested in their headquarters.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="91c5dc0c-feff-4dd6-9d68-eeccde851599">Each franchise’s starter headquarters is a mundane site, which has often been selected or handed down by Acquisitions Incorporated. The characters’ initial base of operations could be a ruined tower, a worn horse-drawn carriage, a beat-up fishing boat, a dilapidated store or farm, or any similar structure or site. The DM might direct the characters toward a single ideal location, or might provide a range of options for players and characters to choose from. And of course, many potential franchise locations will have an interesting past — a haunted mansion, a mysterious lighthouse, an old wizard’s tower filled with malfunctioning magic, and so forth.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f6b720c8-d2d4-4088-8f4c-86fc1efae0ae">The DM approves the headquarters concept and decides how large or small the initial structure can be, as well as any useful features.

The normal costs associated with that lifestyle for franchisees and select staff are subsumed within the overall cost of running the franchise. Outside the franchise headquarters, normal lifestyle expenses apply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-content-chunk-id="49943c28-7024-4640-8693-158f80c00d38">Many franchisees will use their starter headquarters as a point for expansion, adding new features, new rooms, new levels — and, of course, new magic as the franchise grows in rank. Other campaigns might be better served by having the franchise change headquarters at different stages. Characters might start out in a ship, then move to a castle, then take possession of a unique magical headquarters in the end. Any potential headquarters site might be discovered by the characters as part of the campaign, or sites might be suggested or allocated by Head Office.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="32c6c4b3-f2ac-4d8a-b8db-1fb19a8898a5">Any of the following suggestions can make a great starter headquarters, or can provide inspiration for other headquarters features.</p>

And just look at that cool light up top, and the oversized storage cellar. Docks close by are perfect for a starter franchise that comes into possession of a boat, and are also a sign of the lighthouse’s importance to coastal trade. Commandeering it will likely win over the locals and maybe even the region’s royalty!</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6ffcff7c-29c3-4be4-948a-d597e81ebcba">A cosmetic improvement, gained at franchise rank 2, allows a franchise to radically alter the look and feel of its headquarters. A beat-up wagon could become a gilded carriage, with luxurious interiors and servants dressed in matching finery. A tavern could proudly display the party’s kills in the drinking hall, feature mugs gathered from dwarven holds around Faerûn, and have decor matching a particular theme.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b0476174-8097-4c6a-bb7f-77469e11de04">Improvements can also be of a fantastic or magical nature, such as flickering magical torches or portraits that watch and interact with observers. The DM has final approval over such improvements, and is the arbiter as to whether cosmetic improvements might provide any actual benefits during play. When allowed, such benefits should be situational and limited. A foe might become distracted the first time a ghostly figure appears in a haunted tavern, but the quality of the illusion is such that it doesn’t stand up to continued scrutiny.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e5bbdd9a-66e8-450d-82df-155d3de45d6b">Cosmetic effects can also be focused on selling and branding a franchise, such as adding manufacturing capabilities, a light-up sign, a customer showroom or service center, and other commercial features. At the DM’s discretion, such features might generate additional income or lower the costs of certain franchise tasks.</p>

The ship’s interior is decorated in draconic art, and platforms among the rigging are linked by silk ropes attached to pulleys. These might provide benefits to crew trained in their use if the ship is ever attacked.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6c849f63-eb30-4802-893f-06893cd4be9f">At rank 2, an expansion feature allows a franchise to double the size of its headquarters. When doing so, players and characters can define the changes to the current configuration. Perhaps the headquarters expands in size laterally, or gains an extra floor. Perhaps a new basement is excavated — or poking around the existing basement reveals a secret level of dungeons heretofore unknown.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6720964f-d956-4363-ab9c-c9c28d75db02">Franchise members can decide on what features are involved in the expansion, including new windows, doors, and furniture. Adding certain types of space might also call for extra supporting features. If storage is on an upper floor, a winch might be installed to lift goods. A cellar could add another exit and an area for storing wine or alchemical supplies. Or a carriage headquarters could gain a second cart to become a wagon train.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fc44a27a-6786-42fc-b9a8-00cd7371035d">All construction is low cost but functional, as in the following examples.</p>

A stairway leads down into a network of old caverns, including some used as storage space, and finally onto a small beach with a dock.</p>

A large fireplace fills the common room with light and warmth, while new tables and chairs create a welcome environment. Guest chambers might feature a patio or balcony.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="65ec6047-03f8-49e4-ae99-8e3c46f49655">Also at rank 2, every franchise gains some form of mobility, with players and DM working together to determine how a headquarters facilitates travel (or expands on its normal travel modes) from one location to another. A ship might gain a magic sail, or could add a balloon to become a battle balloon airship. A hollow statue could gain the ability to stride across the landscape. A wizard’s tower might teleport from place to place. Or doors within a tavern could be revealed as a magical portal connected to various locations in far-flung lands.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6c510b10-88e4-4bd3-bc88-eb3ddda7824b">The DM has final approval over the method of locomotion, and can put in place any reasonable limitations or constraints on that movement. Additionally, any method of movement should have a weakness or drawback determined by the DM. As a rule of thumb, a mobile headquarters can travel a distance of 30 miles per day (equivalent to a fast travel pace) per franchise rank. This rate of travel can vary depending on weather, visibility, availability of maps, or other conditions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="267d6af7-eaa0-4d02-b805-119aa703d4cd"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="fe89d688-3ac9-4756-967e-0905cbbcea02"> Giant Stone Statue.</span> A 100-foot-tall stone statue has stairs and rooms carved within its interior. When a character sits at the helm located in a room within the statue’s head, the statue can be directed to walk across the land. The statue ignores difficult terrain, usually by simply crashing through it. However, the navigator has a limited sight line while peering out through the statue’s large eyes. When the terrain is cluttered or subject to combat conditions, it can be hard to avoid creatures or objects smaller than a large building.</p>

A galleon suspended below the balloon features a helm that controls the ship. The vessel can fly virtually anywhere, ignoring difficult terrain, but it is at risk from storms and strong winds.

Mechanical arms at the front of the locomotive set down crossbars and rails in front of the headquarters at ridiculous speed, while arms at the back of the headquarters pick up the track as it passes. The train moves at quarter speed over difficult terrain (instead of half speed). It can pass over rivers, but cannot cross lakes or large bodies of water.</p>

The wagon’s driver can cause the wagon to teleport the distance of a day’s journey, targeting a known location over the course of one or more extradimensional jumps. Such teleportation is usually done when no one is looking, to avoid arousing suspicion or frightening the locals. Though the wagon eventually arrives at the intended destination, the intervening stop-off points are unknown — and quite possibly perilous.</p>

<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="980cf911-5e8f-45aa-b0a0-1f4fd33eda6c">An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign has its own distinct feel, as talked about in <a title="chapter 1" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/acquisitions-incorporated" data-content-chunk-id="d657a468-6ff5-4ac0-b119-31dfa83baeb7">chapter 1</a> of this book. Part of that feel comes from the substantial benefits that characters gain from franchise features and company positions — mechanical boons, magic items, access to powerful spell effects, and more. These benefits are gained automatically, as a general reward for the characters’ adventuring success driving franchise advancement. So it’s important that everyone is aware how adding those built-in campaign benefits to the regular magic gained during adventuring will give the characters a boost in power.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="2ff66ab3-171a-4a48-acfc-e359ac8c1533">For an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign meant to feel and play like standard D&amp;D, the DM should consider creating a low-magic campaign, and letting the benefits of company positions and franchise features fill in the magical gaps. A standard campaign played with the rules in this book should be treated as a high magic campaign, with the DM and the players understanding that the difficulty of encounters and other tasks might need to be ramped up to offer a real challenge to the characters. Of course, nothing prevents anyone from playing a high magic campaign with the Acquisitions Incorporated rules. But DMs and players should all be aware that doing so will create extremely powerful characters — who will no doubt attract extremely powerful enemies and threats as a matter of course.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c3ea6fe7-9849-43f9-9789-2dc92e077639">At rank 2, the members of a franchise can add a weapon to their headquarters, choosing from the options in the “<a title="Siege Equipment" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#SiegeEquipment" data-content-chunk-id="89a9ee8c-9004-41a8-860f-3ac94dcfb434">Siege Equipment</a>” section of chapter 8 of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="f4a62e67-c7a3-472b-97b5-8e8594307404"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i></span>. The DM can limit those options or change the details of specific choices, and players can also design unique offensive features, subject to approval by the DM. For example, a walking statue that strikes with a fist could be treated as a ram — or the DM and the players might agree that it would be fun to use some of the effects of <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2352-bigbys-hand" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2352-tooltip">Bigby’s hand</a> for such an attack.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee164abd-f3fc-4675-9c7c-b8f670d99738">Most siege weapons (whether mechanical or magical) require two characters, crew, or skilled hirelings to operate, and such weapons might be slow to reload or recharge. Headquarters weapons are not particularly effective against small bands of creatures (such as a group of goblins), but they can be useful against a single large threat (such as a dragon). If siege weapons are abused by franchisees, they might be targeted by enemies, break down, or require costly maintenance each time they are employed in battle.</p>

An airship might have a deck that can channel lightning to repel boarders. A wagon might have transparent windows as strong as steel, and the ability to retract any rails or platforms upon which attacking foes could stand. Defensive features might impose conditions on enemies, or even deal damage. The DM should limit damaging effects to dealing 10 damage to a single target (5 damage for a multitarget or area effect) per franchise rank.

In consultation with the DM, this might cover additional features to augment the headquarters’ existing look or combat capability, or a plan to instead make an existing feature even stronger. A method of transportation might double its speed and remove an existing drawback, or an offensive feature could deal more damage or target more than one creature per round.</p>
<h4 id="SecretFeatures" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="41b5a587-cf0e-46ca-94ee-f57054041695"><a href="#SecretFeatures" data-content-chunk-id="63c0ff43-29c5-4d88-a5fd-15fb1434aef1"></a>Secret Features</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="15ee7a20-598c-41b6-bd53-899f646ae0ec">A secret feature, gained at rank 4, is one that remains unnoticed to most inspection, typically requiring a successful DC 25 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check or Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check to notice. A headquarters might have a secret exit that guarantees escape and allows franchise members or staff to leave and enter without detection. A secret feature should usually add in-game benefits, such as a potion-brewing laboratory in a secret level of a castle, or a secret cargo hold within a ship that can keep perishables fresh and provide endless stocks of food and water to crew and passengers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01a0fd52-0d63-423c-9c43-7375f11ea4f4"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="d92f1ac0-69d5-4918-9111-880ccf303332"> Escape Pod. </span>A walking statue’s head can also serve as an escape pod. If the headquarters is ever destroyed, or if the character controlling the statue activates the escape mode as an action, the head detaches from the body and takes to the air with a flying speed of 80 feet. The flight lasts for up to 5 rounds, and is directed by the same controls that originally controlled the statue. If the head is not on the ground when the flight ends, it falls and any creatures within take falling damage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="99efa3a6-8e5e-4fc7-b33f-8cc89fa46748"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="33d377b5-7fa5-4da4-9fc4-78c53c8e8e7d"> Extradimensional Tavern. </span>Several of the doors in a franchise’s tavern are inscribed with runes. Anyone who traces a rune while speaking a passphrase can access their choice of ten extradimensional rooms, 20 feet on a side. These rooms can function as libraries, laboratories, meeting rooms, kitchens, prisons, private quarters, and more, with each room’s setup and contents chosen when the rooms are first installed. Each room’s initial furnishing and equipment are included, though characters can later add to these features as they wish.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="140c5b0a-ee2d-4293-b9ce-833973ed96de"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="cbeb4949-940f-46ca-b07e-1776b940a6ce"> Glider Launcher. </span>A hidden compartment within an airship holds ten gliders. A secret door leads to the compartment, which features an exterior escape hatch activated from within any glider. Each glider accommodates one Medium or smaller creature and up to 50 pounds of gear, has a flying speed of 60 feet, and must descend at least 20 feet each round. A glider can be piloted as an action by any character with proficiency with flying vehicles. Characters without such proficiency might need to make ability checks of the DM’s choosing to pilot a glider successfully. A glider weighs 100 pounds, has AC 14, 50 hit points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>
<h3 id="FranchiseCosts" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="59b0efc0-a343-4de6-bc23-576d430a9d9d"><a href="#FranchiseCosts" data-content-chunk-id="6cd88408-e543-484a-9187-1c85099e877b"></a>Franchise Costs</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="332fc11e-7ce5-4232-a959-b29ad4cd9fab">Running an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise offers countless benefits to an adventuring party — but those benefits aren’t cheap. Operating the franchise, installing and maintaining franchise features, paying staff, creating merchandise with proper branding, settling legal issues, and more are all encompassed by the baseline cost for a franchise’s headquarters, a multiplier from the franchise’s rank, and the franchise party’s business performance for the month.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9c243a7e-16a4-403e-98dc-f5aa3b851768">If a franchise’s costs leave a party low on cash, that’s a sign that it’s time to go adventuring. Alternatively, characters might use downtime to structure a leaner business or engage in non-adventuring activities to bring in more gold (see “<a title="Franchise Tasks and Downtime" href="#FranchiseTasksandDowntime" data-content-chunk-id="e1b3f278-de14-4be1-9360-909348c97bfd">Franchise Tasks and Downtime</a>” later in this chapter for more information). A franchise’s majordomo handles these finances and makes all necessary payments to Head Office, suppliers, and other agents — as long as sufficient funds are available.</p>
<h4 id="BaselineCosts" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="5900bea1-cf35-420e-a89d-9f68c7025b0b"><a href="#BaselineCosts" data-content-chunk-id="088f2be2-8d37-4aa7-aadc-70a1a2d8786e"></a>Baseline Costs</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a4d19a53-2155-41bd-9563-e7bb07c79853">The baseline monthly cost of a franchise is calculated based on the franchise’s headquarters, as noted on the Baseline Costs table on the next page. The costs on this table differ from the costs found in the “<a title="Recurring Expenses" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#RecurringExpenses" data-content-chunk-id="782e6579-5399-4320-96f0-061c2091f68b">Recurring Expenses</a>” section of chapter 6 in the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="434f3fcd-d306-4f9f-ab71-9733e9c9cf05"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i></span>. (That section details the costs characters might expect to pay to own an inn, a keep, or other types of properties.) This is because franchise costs include a tithe to Head Office, repayment to Acquisitions Incorporated for funding the initial construction or purchase of the headquarters, the use of approved contractors for construction and maintenance, and other subtle fees.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="392f9e20-5c6f-407c-9f89-5c62db7836c0">Baseline costs are for representative dwellings, and can be adjusted by the DM as needs be. A noble estate that is the envy of other nobles might demand expenditures of double or triple the baseline cost. A franchise’s baseline costs might also change during the course of the campaign. A party might initially start out headquartered in an abandoned lighthouse with monthly expenses of 250 gp. But as time passes and headquarters features are added, that lighthouse might grow in size, weapon features, and magic to resemble a fortified tower. The DM will modify baseline costs as needed to fit the headquarters and the campaign style.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="91d67a8f-7a7b-4a1b-898d-0a216217df4f">Some characters might decide to maintain more than one headquarters for their franchise, or to control additional sites as part of the franchise’s overall operation. A franchise might use a ship as its headquarters, while also owning a number of remote trading posts run by franchise staff. The costs for all such “virtual headquarters” should be added together to derive one monthly baseline cost.</p>
<h4 id="FranchiseRankMultiplier" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="e2f657f2-5e43-4dc8-8338-bf0a0b6e74e0"><a href="#FranchiseRankMultiplier" data-content-chunk-id="182520d1-193f-4b76-b7f7-3e7c5f4a5ade"></a>Franchise Rank Multiplier</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="479b05e0-f7ed-4e86-bb7a-87e7376f6a1e">The multiplier on the Franchise Advancement table is applied to a franchise’s baseline cost. This represents the increased costs a franchise faces as it expands into larger markets.</p>
<h4 id="MonthlyBusinessPerformance" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="315730df-3e5c-4d28-9357-350f491d0cde"><a href="#MonthlyBusinessPerformance" data-content-chunk-id="57109c7f-26da-43b6-9796-3d449e518858"></a>Monthly Business Performance</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a24b301f-7917-49f1-bbfd-2200f6f432f5">Each month, a franchise performs the running a franchise task, which can be found in the “<a title="Franchise Tasks and Downtime" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseTasksandDowntime" data-content-chunk-id="e44642d2-1dd4-4fc8-87f5-b25cb47d96bc">Franchise Tasks and Downtime</a>” section later in this chapter. The result of this task is used to calculate the final monthly cost, and is deducted from the franchise’s coffers.</p>
<h4 id="Defaulting" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="5b3f5419-570a-4772-9c03-17c40529821b"><a href="#Defaulting" data-content-chunk-id="66fea1be-41f9-48e8-8b0f-d6f27202b2db"></a>Defaulting</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e8c7bcfe-3821-47d3-82b6-8516c16c6182">No self-respecting franchise would ever run out of money and fail to make its monthly payments. Right? Were that to happen, the amount owed — plus a modest 15 percent penalty — would be due to Head Office the following month. Failing to make payments — and especially defaulting on two or more payments in a row — is likely to trigger campaign consequences. Head Office might send inspectors to a troubled franchise, or assign the franchisees a difficult (and hopefully profitable) mission. Rival groups and entrepreneurs might smell blood and attempt to attack the franchise or take over its markets. Nefarious NPCs will most certainly come calling.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="04cd343c-b065-4114-a401-d1c16867904a">Defaulting on franchise payments can also strain relationships with nobles, merchants, and others who value a franchise more for its assets than for the characters. Such relationships typically turn frosty until the characters are able to prove that the franchise is back on its feet.</p>
<h2 id="CompanyPositions" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="377174bd-a05a-40cf-967f-46c7d73ba099"><a href="#CompanyPositions" data-content-chunk-id="2fb03ee1-3373-47a8-a469-91d4d15a809a"></a>Company Positions</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="99bccd35-31a7-4bfc-9250-db758e0599b6">A franchise is a complex affair, requiring its participants to fulfill a myriad of important duties necessary for its proper growth (and the enrichment of Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office). A company position establishes a character’s role within a franchise, as well as a relationship with the larger Acq Inc organization.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c34baf64-5078-4d1e-85e3-338ba9d9cfa4">When you choose a company position for your character, that choice is independent of and in addition to your character’s background, class, and other options. Though Head Office might tell would-be Acq Inc franchisees to play to their strengths, you should choose the position that speaks to you — and that feels like it’ll be the most fun. All characters who take on an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise must take a company position. A character can take only one position within a franchise.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="96e00d3b-5493-4b2e-8dff-0e81847ffe7c">Each company position has its own distinct flavor — and comes with a range of preternatural benefits. Some of these benefits take the form of material boons granted by Head Office, including specialized magic items available only to Acquisitions Incorporated franchisees. Others are shaped by the subtle power of your position and the franchise’s rank.</p>
<h3 id="JointEffort" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="73b6a7f4-15e9-4be9-8bfc-18d54f499ffa"><a href="#JointEffort" data-content-chunk-id="0c16d33a-0d2a-4b92-8201-278f8e304cf9"></a>Joint Effort</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d21e364-254c-455e-a29d-f3d4ebfb0c52">Players — and especially new players — should keep in mind the amount of creativity and collaboration a company position requires when determining which position is the best fit for their character. In addition to their various mechanical benefits, the features of each company position are intended to offer players and DMs the opportunity to collaborate on crafting campaign narrative. Sometimes this is straightforward, as when a feature allows a character to learn useful information about enemies or allies, as with the obviator’s Read the Opposition feature. Sometimes this calls for a focused collaborative effort between player and DM, as with the cartographer’s Tale of Safe Travel. Where the narrative options in a position’s features lend themselves to interpretation, the DM works with the players to determine how those options play out, as is the baseline model of every Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.</p>
<h3 id="PositionProficiencies" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="4b52936f-3cd2-47b7-8e6c-0e8817d690f4"><a href="#PositionProficiencies" data-content-chunk-id="b839589c-9ebe-44bb-b7f5-99e82448a9ff"></a>Position Proficiencies</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5734409c-19cc-439e-a14b-a1ef951d3147">Accepting a company position with Acquisitions Incorporated means more than just a title and hopes of a paycheck. With it comes access to trade secrets, best practices, and corporate shortcuts central to fulfilling one’s role within a franchise. When a character takes a specific company position, they gain proficiency in the tools and skills associated with that position. Such proficiency also extends to a variety of business practices, day-to-day tasks, and hazard mitigations that are all part of the job. Professional functions that characters can add their proficiency bonus to are detailed in the “Position Proficiency” section of each of the following company positions.</p>

<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="bbb9f09b-8aa6-4e2c-b4cc-ef02f5311e86">The tools and items that are granted to a character as part of a company position are unique objects created and bestowed by Head Office on trusted franchisees. A set of Acquisitions Incorporated tools might resemble mundane tools, but they are never the same. Countless mundane cartographers in the world have proficiency with cartographer’s tools. But only an Acquisitions Incorporated cartographer has access to a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/702253-cartographers-map-case" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/702253-tooltip">cartographer’s map case</a> and the ability to use it.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="13c83126-74e3-43d4-8415-34c034fc4782">Magic items gained as part of a company position always require attunement, but they do not count against the number of magic items a character can normally attune to. Each item can be attuned to only by the character to whom it has been granted by Head Office. If the tools of other Acq Inc franchisees are ever found, they cannot be attuned even by characters with the applicable position. (It goes without saying that such tools found at large are expected to be returned to Head Office immediately.)</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="90d2c58a-a1ac-42bd-a8c6-e8693d5b68fc">Each position magic item is representative of the significant mystic expertise of Acquisitions Incorporated — and no matter who might use them, position items always belong to the franchise proper. The use of such items is typically revoked upon leaving the company, and Head Office is known for the diligence with which it retrieves items that are “accidentally” held onto.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fb356b30-6b2d-4b54-83b3-02c08af9c03f">You choose your character’s position when the character first joins an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. Your character’s position rank is equal to your franchise’s rank. Starting from rank 1, you gain specialized training (including new proficiencies), special equipment, and your rank 1 position feature. Then, as the franchise grows, the scope of your position grows with it. Each time the franchise gains a rank (normally at levels 5, 11, and 17), your character is promoted to that new rank in their position and gains the appropriate benefits.</p>

The cartographer selects the method and route of travel for a franchise, and creates and maintains maps of the journey. As the characters travel, the cartographer maps important locations and resources, later providing finished maps to Head Office. The franchise’s cartographer is also often responsible for the selection and care of vehicles and mounts.</p>

They settle disputes and ensure that the team moves forward toward its goals, often serving as a leader (officially or otherwise) and compass for the party. A signature move of the decisionist is to impress the importance of a particular looming choice on the other franchisees, then call for a vote. The results of all franchise votes are recorded, then later reported to Head Office. Decisionists are also concerned with franchise morale and teamwork, helping all members of the franchise work together effectively.</p>

You might primarily attempt to convince others through charismatic arguments, or through force of will or intellectual cunning. You might lead by example, or by extolling the examples of other people who’ve done the things you haven’t quite gotten around to yet. Many decisionists go on to publish famous tomes, such as the best-selling <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="cecb1b3e-e6b4-4ecc-99c9-bfdb53e8e6ee">Habits of Effective Adventuring Parties </span>and <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="0926560b-4378-4899-8d5d-d472d8bb6f25">I Don’t Care If the Rogue Stole Your Coins, We Have a Job to Do</span>.

A documancer bears the responsibility of managing each of a franchise’s quests, of ensuring that every condition of the quest is fulfilled, and of recording and sending on information vital to Head Office when the mission is complete. When creating contracts with other organizations, a documancer makes sure that the language benefits both the franchise and Acquisitions Incorporated.</p>

A franchise’s loremonger studies and records all lore relevant to its operation, including tracking the economic, technical, and arcane methods by which the franchise can be improved. A loremonger records the deeds and history of the franchise, including the names of places visited and people met during missions. Those records are then sent to Head Office (often through a franchise’s documancer) to ensure brand integrity.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7087c4b2-e4ec-426d-b3dc-bfbd3cd2b3b8">As a loremonger, you are a studious individual, usually with an interest in history or technical subjects. You might revel in your role, working as a central figure in your franchise as you use your knowledge to promote it. Or you might operate from the shadows, resembling a clever spymaster and allowing others to be the franchise’s public face. You help advance your franchise by discovering secrets, tracking important lore gained during the characters’ travels, and reporting on competitors’ goals and methods.</p>

A franchise’s mission success might require combating a rival organization’s disinformation attempts one day, then besting a castle’s defenses the next. The day after that, some poor sap named Bob might need to be disposed of. And no matter what the type of challenge that needs to be overcome, the franchise’s obviator determines the optimal way to shut down and destroy that challenge. (Nothing personal, Bob. It’s just business.)</p>

Sometimes, you might prefer brute strength and improvisation. Other times, you might undertake a deep study of conflicts and rival organizations, working carefully to stay three steps ahead of the opposition. In all cases, though, you help advance your franchise by hatching effective plans and tactics, anticipating problems, and learning about your foes — ideally before they can treat you as an obstacle to their own success.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6611c0ed-3a19-4b78-a595-0dfd2bd63249">A secretarian’s focus is on people — and all the potential value that might be wrung out of them. Every person met outside a franchise is a potential customer to a secretarian, who does whatever they can to bring that relationship to fulfillment. A secretarian seeks always to promote their franchise and gain greater value than they give. They have the skills to negotiate with subemployees, temporary hirelings, seasonal staff, and other humanoid (usually) resources. When staff members have problems, the secretarian is the one who patiently listens (or at least pretends to) until everything calms down.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53d8d748-b701-4038-ad59-af74d34583eb">As a secretarian, you are respected for having the fortitude to listen to both customers and coworkers without going insane. You help advance your franchise by keeping staff happy (enough), hiring competent (enough) workers, coming up with slogans and catchphrases, launching marketing schemes, and getting jingles and slogans stuck in customer’s heads. And while your superiors don’t officially condone undermining the branding efforts of other organizations, no one can argue with the effectiveness of that approach.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8e44f353-6698-4f30-bf7e-81b4b5da29c8">Because an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is focused on the franchise, downtime is typically a big part of the game. (The adventure that makes up chapter 4 of this book, “<a title="The Orrery of the Wanderer" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/the-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-content-chunk-id="feb2ed23-ace0-4fa9-be45-9d96c2b433d2">The Orrery of the Wanderer</a>,” sets up downtime options between adventure episodes as a key component of the campaign.) But an Acq Inc campaign offers even more robust options for characters who want to get things done outside adventuring time, because the heroes of an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign have something that most adventurers don’t — a well-paid (okay, an occasionally paid) staff.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="49ecf800-1527-4bdd-b0e6-ffa84bb9042c">In addition to the downtime activities characters undertake on their own, the hard-working subemployees and interns of a franchise can carry out orders and further the characters’ goals through research, crafting, social encounters, and so forth. This lets the players direct behind-the-scenes activities even as the characters focus on the more rarefied pursuits of killing monsters and taking their stuff. Before your party sets out for the Fortress of Eternal Peril, an intern can be sent to research that magic book found in a previous adventure. Your majordomo might spend time currying favor with nobles as a means of expanding the franchise’s reputation. And what could be more fun (for you) than to have the staff engage in a bit of dangerous criminal activity? If they’re successful, the franchise gets the profits! And if they get caught, who are these people you barely know?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3400bb6e-8eb3-4491-bdbe-af48c0281f69">By allowing franchise tasks to take place not just during downtime but while the characters are adventuring, it’s possible for players in an Acquisitions Incorporated game to try to push the pace of the campaign. Characters might try to avoid taking downtime of their own in favor of having franchise employees take care of all that boring not-adventuring stuff. But because an Acq Inc campaign makes great use of social encounters, research, and intrigue, players should be encouraged to not treat downtime as optional. Moreover, DMs can and will make use of rivalries and complications during franchise tasks to drag characters into that part of the game.</p>
<h4 id="BetweenAdventures" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="ab10ba85-d5a1-4def-b13b-db0e7ab80310"><a href="#BetweenAdventures" data-content-chunk-id="70150d85-7f9b-422b-8158-bde746466789"></a>Between Adventures</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e9c3ee76-9eb4-4d06-8734-1b05bae69638">Using the traditional approach to downtime, franchise tasks can be run at set break points during the campaign. When the characters return from adventuring, they take on some of the responsibility for bookkeeping, maintenance, long-term planning, and the like, making franchise staff available for other activities under the characters’ guidance. In this model, characters and staff run downtime simultaneously between sessions of adventuring. This follows the standard approach of using downtime to advance the timeline of the campaign.</p>
<h4 id="OngoingActivities" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f58e17d4-a3bd-4e30-836d-edbba26cc8bc"><a href="#OngoingActivities" data-content-chunk-id="6ffc648c-c9c8-45dc-a779-46afa6dec720"></a>Ongoing Activities</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3749fce7-6174-4c43-9dde-4afc62b31775">A more wide-open approach to franchise tasks sees the characters direct those activities at any point during the campaign, alongside traditional adventuring. During any game session, the players can decide to focus on what the franchise staff are up to by setting assignments, giving orders, and making checks to determine the success of franchise tasks. If those tasks tie strongly into the adventure, franchise tasks can effectively become a fourth pillar of an Acquisitions Incorporated game, alongside exploration, social interaction, and combat.</p>
<h3 id="SelectingFranchiseTasks" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="9c732c93-6677-4004-a427-030ae49d52d3"><a href="#SelectingFranchiseTasks" data-content-chunk-id="9ce88ac0-95d2-4716-8f23-8221d4b8f1bb"></a>Selecting Franchise Tasks</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37d37e00-fde8-4cf8-8ee0-d1209a17334d">Whether franchise tasks are undertaken during regular downtime or alongside other adventuring activities, a franchise’s rank puts a hard limit on the number of tasks the franchise’s staff can undertake. See the “<a title="Franchise Advancement" href="#FranchiseAdvancement" data-content-chunk-id="079effd9-bbe7-49ab-a1ee-7568c8c7583c">Franchise Advancement</a>” section earlier in this chapter. (This limit is only for franchise tasks undertaken by staff. The characters are free to undertake whatever downtime activities the DM allows, as normal.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b8743d92-3be7-43dd-af54-d568cc08a756">For each available franchise task slot, players can allocate one or more staff members to a chosen franchise task. Those tasks can include any of the downtime activities in the<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="415250cb-2cee-404d-9d10-88dea4547668"> <i><a title="Player’s Handbook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></i></span> or the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="ab6105ad-4812-4587-b58b-10aed885f22b"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i></span>, the new and revised downtime activities in <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="c89069ec-a7af-44da-94f5-55db7e2331e4"><i><a title="Xanathar’s Guide to Everything" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte">Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</a></i></span>, and the new activities in this section. When all of a franchise’s task slots are filled, one of those tasks must be completed before staff can be allocated to a new franchise task. (The one exception to this rule is the running a franchise activity, presented later in this section. That activity must be performed by a franchise, but does not require that specific characters or staff members be allocated to it.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e6fecc77-3f24-403f-8345-a3082a27b713">Staff allocated to a franchise task are no longer available for other needs, including other franchise tasks. Any costs or resources associated with a franchise task must be provided by the franchise (which is to say, by the characters).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cb29aa9d-9005-4087-822c-17709f091eae">For example, a rank 2 franchise can undertake two concurrent franchise tasks. If the characters are setting out to explore the Swamp of Lingering Malaise, they might order their majordomo to send messages to various noble families while they’re away, carrying out the sowing rumors activity from the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="2882d631-467e-40d3-9f09-b8752f5edf48"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i></span>. The task follows the regular rules for that downtime activity, but is carried out by the majordomo. At the same time, the characters might send out another staff member to engage in the explore territory activity (a new activity detailed below).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2d5c38d0-f3f1-414e-adf3-5861a60d414b">When a franchise task requires an ability check, a staff member can use their own ability check modifier to determine success. (This modifier might depend on the staff member’s statistics, if an NPC, or it might be based on the franchise’s rank. See the “<a title="Franchise Advancement" href="#FranchiseAdvancement" data-content-chunk-id="22b33faa-3483-4d91-a2b0-ccef43cfe069">Franchise Advancement</a>” section.) Alternatively, the staff member can use the check modifier of a character overseeing the task and giving the staff member direction. This can encourage the characters to develop closer relationships with franchise staff through roleplaying, and keeps the players involved in staff-focused franchise tasks.</p>
<h3 id="FranchiseTasksasNarrative" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="2ba00707-ca87-487b-bc90-b404e56673d0"><a href="#FranchiseTasksasNarrative" data-content-chunk-id="12dee42a-902e-41d6-8fde-3b150d3d0e9c"></a>Franchise Tasks as Narrative</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e60c547a-027f-4b43-ae59-d02e49e55891">Franchise tasks can be an exciting, story-rich part of a gaming session. Over time, franchise tasks and character downtime activities can expand the story of a franchise and add depth to the characterizations of its NPC staff members. The successes, failures, and complications of franchise tasks might even become pivotal moments in the campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d03c26f4-05c3-4d5c-a051-c558f9e4147c">As with all aspects of an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, franchise tasks are about creating narrative. As such, to make those tasks a part of the campaign story, the DM and the players can work together to break tasks down into distinct scenes using the following guidelines.</p>
<h4 id="EstablishGoals" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="ad5ea32a-0f02-4d59-ad89-8f4dcb5520e9"><a href="#EstablishGoals" data-content-chunk-id="7394fdf1-73d3-47d7-a258-66b58ac93d3b"></a>Establish Goals</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6e3b669-283b-4cd6-aeb7-6d5ead8ecffa">When the characters select a franchise task, the players share their goals for that task with the DM. Having clear motives helps establish the stakes and provides ideas that the DM can weave into the campaign story. The DM might work up a narrative based on the players’ initial discussions, and might ask additional questions to help narrow down options.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e8289ab-5e28-47e0-9601-97d3a6c92013">As an example, consider a group of characters whose franchise headquarters is a submersible ship, and whose staff are largely former pirates. While the characters head out for a mission on the mainland, they direct the ship’s staff-member captain to surprise other vessels and liberate goods from them. The DM decides that such acts of piracy fit the shady business practice activity (introduced later in this section), and quickly sketches out a few ideas for the task.</p>
<h4 id="OpeningScene" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="39bc3141-5ded-40d1-bd53-07afe4c72775"><a href="#OpeningScene" data-content-chunk-id="19f19861-ef66-4606-b718-3526a3c7c49e"></a>Opening Scene</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ba79182b-3f4a-4424-9d47-85999f8bd17a">The DM describes the beginning of the task activity, setting the stage for the NPCs’ actions. For the submersible headquarters discussed above, the DM might begin to describe how the ship leaves port in search of easy prey. The captain and crew are in a good mood. There’s a storm in the area, but it doesn’t threaten the submersible. The DM might ask the players to describe a few undertakings the crew can engage in to pass the time, or might even ask players to temporarily take on the roles of one or more staff members, helping to bring those NPCs to life through roleplaying.</p>
<h4 id="AbilityCheckScenes" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="c8efa320-2d4a-4f6c-985c-778c6e3cf2fa"><a href="#AbilityCheckScenes" data-content-chunk-id="8b8d766b-0fd7-40c7-8f83-81cd4e752a6e"></a>Ability Check Scenes</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4a45eaf7-a2be-4b41-9d30-e9875ed3c595">For each ability check required by a franchise task, the DM describes what’s happening, determines the applicable ability, and decides whether a skill or tool proficiency is appropriate (usually as suggested in the activity write-up). Whether the check is made by a staff member or the character who directed or set up the franchise task, a player makes the roll. The DM can encourage roleplaying by asking about what kind of guidance a character provided to the staff member, or what part of the staff member’s background makes them good at the task at hand. The DM then describes successive scenes based on checks and roleplaying as the crew members locate a likely target ship and commence their attack.</p>
<h4 id="ConcludingScene" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="32acd049-2f78-4a61-86e6-f733dec255e9"><a href="#ConcludingScene" data-content-chunk-id="771e4f1c-ce11-4461-8131-1a52c86e979b"></a>Concluding Scene</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5a290fc6-6405-412a-bc76-e4d33b4739f2">The DM determines the overall outcome for the franchise task, then narrates the outcome to wrap up that small part of the overall story. If the check for the activity indicates any degree of success, the DM describes how the franchise’s pirates manage to grab some valuable cargo, in addition to other benefits as noted in the write-up for the shady business practice activity. With treasure aboard, the ship is ready for the characters’ eventual return.</p>
<h4 id="OngoingStory" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="2c479a1d-83d9-4a66-bf54-8745f533ee0b"><a href="#OngoingStory" data-content-chunk-id="fa1da491-ca35-477a-bc59-4e4f7a4b7592"></a>Ongoing Story</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ac3d62a0-227c-4f7e-a366-6066c7700371">Rather than treating franchise tasks as isolated episodes, the DM can weave the story of one task into the next, and can tie franchise tasks into the overarching campaign. Doing so assigns importance to franchise tasks, and lets the players understand how the success or failure of those tasks might drive the campaign. Even after a specific franchise task has concluded, the DM can make notes for how that task might tie to future tasks. For the characters running the submersible franchise, the ship that fought off the franchise’s pirates might remember a few details about the franchise crew. Or perhaps the plundered vessel belongs to a franchise rival, or even a foreign dignitary the characters will eventually meet, setting up a future plot twist.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b143c496-91e4-4154-b8f0-5c3d0c906e37">The franchise and downtime activities introduced in this section all incorporate the idea that such activities can introduce ongoing complications to the campaign, and that anything a franchise’s characters or employees do might bring the franchise into conflict with rivals.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="209b8103-d436-4a4b-84bd-8cb26a46d703">If you use <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="8967bd03-d049-41df-b1b5-40eaff641c0a"><i><a title="Xanathar’s Guide to Everything" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte">Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</a></i></span> in your games, you’re probably already familiar with complications and rivals as part of downtime, but you don’t need to own that book to make use of these ideas. Rather, just remember that an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is always about story. Each time the characters engage in downtime or direct their staff in a franchise task, the players and the DM can think about how those tasks and activities might complicate the ongoing campaign narrative, and how the franchise’s enemies — or potential enemies — might get caught up in those complications.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="62664f0e-7e7a-41f0-a385-b7d1ea84412e">When a complication or a rival comes into play during downtime or franchise activities, the DM determines the particulars. The activities presented at the end of this section all come with tables of possible complications, but the DM is free to come up with even more dastardly complications to suit the campaign.</p>
<h4 id="WhosWatching" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="4aba9585-bde6-40db-b04d-a9a3aef6704c"><a href="#WhosWatching" data-content-chunk-id="b18bffc9-6a7a-4bb6-8299-a418d0c6ed25"></a>Who’s Watching?</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="787d3884-1b1a-4c65-8a7e-9b8493bec902">An easy way to focus on complications and rivals in a campaign is to think about who might be paying attention to a franchise’s activities. For example, a successful philanthropic enterprise (one of the new activities in this section) could draw the attention of a noble who begins to question the reputation and honesty of the characters running the franchise. Or the party might launch a marketeering campaign (another new activity), only to discover that their branding has an accidental resemblance to the logo of an assassins’ guild. Complications are an excellent way to develop rich interactions between the setting and the characters. In an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, even the smallest actions can have unexpected (and, ideally, hilarious) consequences.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dbbd2fbe-19ec-47ab-b76d-32b1a648c235">Rivals represent any of the factions and organizations that can come into play during an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign. Rivals don’t have to be villains or mortal enemies of the characters, though. Other Acq Inc franchises all compete with the characters’ franchise, seeking to expand their own reach and impress Head Office. Governments, merchants, guilds, religious institutions, and noble families can all take notice as a franchise grows in power. And outside the characters’ immediate sphere of influence, factions such as Dran Enterprises and the Six work dark plots that might make the characters targets for assimilation or destruction. (The plots of the Six and the operations of Dran Enterprises both play a part in the adventure “<a title="The Orrery of the Wanderer" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/the-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-content-chunk-id="ec3ddd43-24a2-4022-8ca8-d9de6ef94f93">The Orrery of the Wanderer</a>,” chapter 4 of this book.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bfd87232-693e-464f-9f34-0a485a02a7cd">When a complication occurs during a downtime or franchise activity, the DM determines whether and how that complication connects to a rival. Certain complications might be caused by rivals, as when the orc army camping in the characters’ territory is revealed to have been invited there by a competing franchise. Other complications might draw a rival in, as when a greedy noble decides they want a piece of the franchise’s action.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3e2e5b9c-6a8e-47ed-b96f-1da260100347">Rival NPCs can be worked up using the rules in chapter 4, “<a title="Creating Nonplayer Characters" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters" data-content-chunk-id="10089441-c562-4a2a-80f2-72d1e43e5d95">Creating Nonplayer Characters</a>” of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="5fac0a7a-95c1-47ee-9854-cd8624be6e0f"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i></span>, incorporating schemes, methods, and weaknesses. If you use <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="dc6585b1-8694-4bee-915d-946c369429a7"><i><a title="Xanathar’s Guide to Everything" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte">Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</a></i></span> in your game, that book provides example rivals and talks about establishing a rival’s goals, assets, and plans. See also the “<a title="Factions and Rivals" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/player-options#FactionsandRivals" data-content-chunk-id="22f22c37-0ca3-4cfe-af0b-39643a9f8b7e">Factions and Rivals</a>” section in chapter 3 of this book for an introduction to some of the rival organizations that might appear in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.</p>
<h4 id="ComplicationsasStory" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f1f36f5d-058c-46d9-9b67-06e695ea04a0"><a href="#ComplicationsasStory" data-content-chunk-id="408996e5-c61b-4f64-af8f-868282e4b60d"></a>Complications as Story</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="25a6fa43-9688-41a7-a8bc-7cc5cb0dcf68">Complications and rivals make excellent adventure seeds. Whenever a complication or rival draws the interest of the players, the DM can make a note of that for future development. As the campaign progresses, the agendas of rivals change over time, just as the characters’ goals and agendas change as a result of their franchise’s success (or their efforts to stave off failure).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="90fec7fc-eb1c-43fd-a457-8e75345edffa">The DM can decide how to invoke complications as the campaign story unfolds. Perhaps the characters were forced to slay an evil guard in a raid gone bad. Later, their majordomo engages in a little gambling as part of a franchise task&nbsp;… and finds the suspicious husband of the guard at their gaming table! Likewise, if a franchise has recently tangled with Dran Enterprises or opposed another Acq Inc franchise, the chance of a complication with either group likely goes up.</p>
<h3 id="DowntimeandFranchiseActivities" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="157749dc-1703-44df-8509-59638d728404"><a href="#DowntimeandFranchiseActivities" data-content-chunk-id="145a7123-e1c9-4b7f-80e6-410c0d663869"></a>Downtime and Franchise Activities</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="47f2870e-0b93-4eb5-8701-7646efc7ab4f">In addition to the downtime activities found in other books, characters and their franchise staff can undertake the new activities presented in this section, either as regular downtime activities or as franchise tasks that can be undertaken at any time. These activities reflect the central role of the franchise in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="56f2e88c-b1c1-4a7f-9905-3acaf45ec60f">The length of time required for these new downtime or franchise activities varies, from a number of days to one workweek (5 days) or more. All the normal rules for downtime must be followed by the character or NPC undertaking the downtime or franchise activity, including spending 8 hours each day engaged in that activity for the day to count toward the activity’s completion. The one exception to this rule is that any costs for a franchise activity are paid for by the characters, even if franchise staff are executing the task.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ecba648d-5337-47c8-a4ed-7653776dce52">Some downtime and franchise activities alter a franchise’s monthly costs. See the “<a title="Franchise Advancement" href="#FranchiseAdvancement" data-content-chunk-id="78607a5e-a1ad-4fd0-b141-615c45fc7d00">Franchise Advancement</a>” section earlier in this chapter for how to determine a franchise’s base monthly costs, and see the “<a title="Running a Franchise" href="#RunningaFranchise" data-content-chunk-id="404f3c2e-9c62-4609-82e6-02a3343bede4">Running a Franchise</a>” section below for more information on how that activity modifies the base cost.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="48cf30b6-b803-484e-b422-2ecb39889c29">No matter how densely populated or remote and wild the territory in which a franchise is licensed to operate, that territory has secrets. Characters and franchise staff can explore their licensed territory in search of useful features, hidden lairs, resources, and creatures that can be engaged in beneficial service. (Or, you know, sold for parts. If you’re okay with that). Exploration can be done any number of times in a franchise’s territory, representing new areas being explored, new discoveries, or elements that have changed since the last exploration.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fd318054-41bb-480d-b797-3366d474fe37"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="642aeced-0d03-473e-b99e-e0b5db8192a6">Resources. </span>Exploring a portion of a licensed territory requires at least one workweek of effort and incurs 200 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more time and money increases the chance that the expedition finds something of use to the franchise.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d5b5a55-f23a-4fa2-87c1-8da6644ac0e0"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="3b8ca9cf-1671-46ec-b4da-84f378c55c78">Resolution. </span>A character or staff member directing the expedition makes a Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/15-tooltip">Survival</a>) check to determine the outcome. This check gains a +2 bonus if a character with the cartographer or occultant position is part of the expedition, a +1 bonus for each workweek beyond the first that is spent exploring, and a +1 bonus for every additional 200 gp spent over the baseline expenses. A maximum bonus of +10 can be applied to this check. The total of the check determines the outcome, as shown on the Exploration Discoveries table.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="393d0f96-ed21-4d73-b60b-7e96afa6da16"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="f81d79c0-8fb1-4f28-9d3b-c6b824b250bd">Major Threat.</span> A result on the table indicating a major threat represents a discovery, event, or entity that might completely undo a franchise’s ability to do business — or destroy it altogether. Such threats might include the discovery of a massing orc tribe, or a dragon entering the area to raid the franchise’s trade routes. The franchise’s monthly costs increase by 50 percent until the threat is resolved, as determined by the DM.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d0a875bc-33bb-4a41-9325-95a9823e4928"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="6374d676-9776-4a51-9a0b-b271b3b87c8b">Minor Threat.</span> A minor threat to the franchise involves uncovering a danger that can disrupt the characters’ ability to conduct business effectively. Such threats might arise from stumbling upon the lair of a monster, learning of the machinations of a noble, or discovering a rival’s outpost. The franchise’s monthly costs increase by 25 percent until the threat is resolved, as determined by the DM.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="06562df1-ac6e-4412-ba79-42deaa1c61cb"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="311ea5a3-e86a-4c85-b2f1-337fc5ca801a">Natural Feature.</span> The expedition could locate timber, precious metals, or other valuable natural resources; a feature that serves as a lookout or offers defensive value; a location that can serve as a safe house; or the like. Valuable resources lower a franchise’s monthly costs by 25 percent for 1d4 + 1 months. Other natural features can offer material benefits in future gaming sessions. For example, a tall spire of rock could serve as a watchtower, allowing the franchise to gain advance warning of any large-scale forces moving through their territory. A cave network acting as a safe house could allow the franchise to conceal goods or people in times of trouble.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a79f68b9-9f4e-4eac-afd0-cb2cc8ba59d5"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="c790a13f-f367-4682-a1bd-1494a22197bd">New Customers. </span>A new settlement is discovered in the territory, and the people there are eager to deal. These could be newcomers settling the area or a previously unnoticed village or group of farmsteads. The presence of new customers lowers franchise costs by 25 percent for 2d4 months before rivals catch wind of them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0988ed08-758d-490a-b3c3-d6e6d9484383"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="7a3d1452-d139-4b20-9341-73166e96412f">Ally or Useful Monster. </span>The dwelling of a useful ally, such as a sage or a former franchise member, is discovered. This ally can become a source of lore, providing insights into one or more campaign secrets — for a low, low fee of 100 gp times the franchise tier for each secret. The party can also make one-time use of the ally to lower franchise costs by 50 percent for 1d4 months, after which the ally departs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e5aaf912-9422-4173-9380-5f6bb933ee98">The expedition could instead locate a monster that is either willing to help the party or can be tamed. The challenge rating of the monster is typically equal to franchise rank, and providing for the monster’s needs costs 100 gp per month. This monster could serve as a scout or spy, alerting the franchise to danger in its territory. Or it could serve as a mount or guardian and be based in the franchise headquarters. Such a monster remains with the franchise as long as its costs are covered and it is treated well.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e82c8107-fbd1-40a8-8f96-44786b2c6fb7"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="914dac52-175f-4a65-928b-5a73c588e30b">Expanded Benefit.</span> The DM chooses whether the expedition turns up a natural feature, new customers, or an ally or useful monster, then increases the benefit or reduces the cost of that discovery. Natural resources might be found in greater abundance, an ally might provide secrets for half the normal fee, a monster might be of a higher challenge rating than normal, and so on.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="023542df-5f66-4c84-9253-1b5eab060e38">A growing franchise often needs fine-tuning to improve its operations and remain lean and capable. Efficiency measures, bold new paradigms, shiny business plans, internal audits, and inventory management can be key to new profits. The best plans often end up creating an auxiliary market for “how-to” books, such as <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="20a6e516-a9df-480b-a47b-5c8cd3519387">Can’t-Miss Principles of Franchise Reinvisionary Strategery</span> and<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="8440a23d-a3f0-43ae-9395-65c4d62a2a01"> What to Inquire about How to Acquire</span>. In some campaigns, Head Office might periodically require this task to ensure that a franchise grows effectively.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d0d30a8c-fe9e-42c8-9558-b7d38c0c3eb9"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="c23588ac-fe5f-45d9-bd65-24625aa40589">Resources. </span>Boldly restructuring a franchise requires at least two workweeks of effort. The franchise must also spend 100 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more time and money increases the characters’ chance to effectively restructure their franchise.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="33dc326b-8622-4876-8ffa-e41b58216560"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="452b42e2-20b3-498c-a8b8-e9911af7f76f">Resolution. </span>Characters or staff members in charge of the restructuring make two ability checks with a DC of 13 + franchise rank.

<p data-content-chunk-id="273a5295-baf8-464e-81bf-557b3907021f">Characters and franchise staff members can use this activity to modify an existing headquarters feature. This change is subject to DM approval, and is typically done within the same feature category, such as swapping one weapon option for another. In response to pressing need, the DM might allow a franchise to swap options between categories, such as losing a weapon option in favor of an arcane option. The DM can limit how often this activity is used.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be1fb2f1-342d-4661-b72b-e8c872ba5c73"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="43b4a10a-bb6a-4f12-96ff-71c3459097e8">Resources. </span>Once a modification is approved, this activity requires the involvement of the franchise’s majordomo and at least one other character or staff member. This team must dedicate at least three workweeks to this activity, and the franchise must spend 1,000 gp per franchise rank to cover expenses. The DM might also require a side trek to gather necessary materials or hire specialist labor before the activity can be commenced.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="dcb9281a-1082-4823-a352-d4b46e0b1a82">Every successful franchise knows that brands require constant management. Developing new markets, shaping catchy slogans, and surveying and engaging customers can all create new sources of revenue. Should you write and sell exciting chapbook serials based on the exploits of Omin, Jim, Môrgæn, and Viari? Should you sell a complex investment scheme to a city’s guild masters? Should you create a branded stage production based on your franchise’s exciting adventures, with a line of clothing to match? All those things and more are encompassed by the fine art of marketeering.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="961c14b8-a422-44a0-8bba-7ed64c376133"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="2b3db518-8a10-4bfb-8d4c-55ccd394f344">Resources. </span>The players must first sketch out their marketeering plan and present it to the DM. A character or franchise staff member must spend at least one workweek to engage in marketeering, and must spend 100 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more money increases the chance of the plan’s success.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f86a2585-f291-4a00-ac7f-b09fb988f014"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="f37d5ac9-ef13-44ce-b537-bbb0e7212f0a">Resolution. </span>A marketeering effort requires three ability checks, representing drafting the campaign, launching the campaign, and managing its success. Any of the characters or staff members involved in the marketeering can make a check. The DM decides which abilities and skills are applicable, based on the marketeering plan. For example, a plan involving selling a new line of religious items might require an Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/10-tooltip">Religion</a>) check to draft the idea and develop the products, a Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/16-tooltip">Deception</a>) check to convince local temples to promote the idea, and a Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check to ensure the plan receives continued support.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d09ee81b-c8ff-4782-8f5c-5039e41cfba0">Each check gains a +1 bonus for each additional 100 gp per franchise rank spent above the baseline expenses. When additional gold is spent, the character making the checks determines which checks the bonuses apply to. Additional gold can be spent at any point in the process, allowing the franchise to put more effort into subsequent checks if earlier checks are less than successful. If the character making the check has the obviator or secretarian position, they receive an additional +1 bonus to each check. A maximum bonus of +5 can be applied to each check.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d26469fe-9ccb-4aa8-bb04-4263885f7aaf">The DC of each check is determined randomly, reflecting the always-unpredictable conditions of the market. The DM rolls 2d10 + 5 for the DC, generating a separate result for each check. The total number of successes determines the outcome of the activity, as noted on the Marketeering table.</p>

Pretending to care about others can also be a great way to earn favor with governments and nobility, gain tax write-offs, or win over customers. Head Office might suggest (or even require) that a franchise undertake this activity if it has recently gained negative publicity or been discovered to engage in shady activities.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8915916c-4770-4151-a67a-559578737d3c">Franchise members should select a philanthropic cause related to a nearby area, settlement, or group of people. Example causes include such efforts as picking up trash from roads or forests, improving schools, and raising funds for victims of a recent disaster. (That last one is an especially good idea if the disaster was caused by the franchise). Success benefits the franchise by helping the selected cause — or at least giving the appearance of having done so. Failure might worsen both the underlying issue and the franchise’s reputation.</p>

The fancier the headquarters, the more the upkeep. And the bigger the franchise, the more overhead it has. The “<a title="Franchise Advancement" href="#FranchiseAdvancement" data-content-chunk-id="38666c31-306c-4cb7-836e-9c5eae8371e4">Franchise Advancement</a>” section earlier in this chapter has more information on determining a franchise’s base monthly cost.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b0835d8f-4e8c-4f41-9843-9f9aabc4d79a">Whenever a downtime or franchise activity modifies a franchise’s costs for a given month, that increase or decrease is totaled up with all other increases and decreases. For example, a successful marketeering campaign might decrease the franchise’s monthly costs by 25 percent, but then a major threat as a result of exploring franchise territory increases monthly costs by 50 percent — a net increase of 25 percent.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="98793949-51c0-4544-bf0f-b2fd94574cab">Whenever the final result indicates that the franchise’s monthly costs have decreased 100 percent, profits and expenses exactly balance each other out, so that the franchise has no payment to make for that month. Whenever the final total is a decrease in monthly costs of more than 100 percent, this means the franchise has paid its expenses and earned a profit to boot. Calculate the profit based on the amount of the decrease above 100 percent. For example, a franchise whose monthly costs come out at a decrease of 150 percent earns a profit equal to 50 percent of the franchise’s base monthly cost.</p>

If it does not do so, the franchise begins to fail. See the rules for defaulting in the “Franchise Costs” section, earlier in this chapter. Regardless of what action Head Office takes, a franchise’s inability to pay its expenses should result in complications and story ramifications. Local folk and businesses start to demand that accounts be cleared. The general public might begin to reject the franchise’s products and services, worried about dealing with dodgy businesspeople.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8dfe3e21-542a-4dde-8857-48011fc5763e">As a member of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, you scoff at those who limit their intelligence-gathering activities to mere research or sagery. The scrutineering activity covers basic research easily enough (finding a new profitable venture, learning what pleases Head Office, amassing lore about a site or monster, and so forth). But it can also expand across a much broader range of activities. You might engage (“kidnap” is such a harsh word) members of a rival group, learn the secrets of a stronghold known only to those who built it, assess an organization’s business model to determine its weaknesses, or lay rightful claim to any information that might benefit your franchise in some way.</p>

Once that access has been gained, this activity requires at least one workweek of effort and 100 gp per franchise rank spent on bribes, materials, and other expenses. Spending more money increases the chance for successful scrutineering.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7fd5428c-94b1-49ba-9ad4-1bbcab036570"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="c955a510-e613-4d63-a562-f90e3e5ea15f">Resolution.</span> The character or staff member overseeing the activity makes an Intelligence check, and can make use of a skill appropriate to the scrutineering activity at the DM’s discretion. This check gains a +1 bonus per 100 gp spent beyond the baseline expenses. A character with the documancer position gains a +1 bonus to the check. A maximum bonus of +10 can be applied to this check. The total of the check determines the outcome, as shown on the Scrutineering table.</p>

Shady business practices can also include corporate espionage against rivals and other Acq Inc franchises, including stealing goods or sabotaging commercial efforts.</p>

Any of the characters or staff members involved in the shady business practice can make a check. The abilities and skills applicable for each check are determined by the DM, reflecting the selected scheme and the ongoing narrative. For example, an attempt to set up a fly-by-night casino might require an Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check to case a town for a suitable location, a Wisdom or Charisma check making use of gaming set proficiency to run the operation, and a Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/4-tooltip">Sleight of Hand</a>) check to get away with the profits.

<p data-content-chunk-id="9b491517-d2f0-4ea1-9ae6-bcb2330d33f3">The DC of each check is determined randomly, reflecting the risky nature of criminal enterprises.

Characters or staff members undertaking this activity must look and play the part of the confident franchisee — dressing well, spending money, giving gifts to new friends, and so forth. Schmoozing with laborers and other working-class folk might incur expenses of 10 gp per franchise rank, with expenses escalating to 100 gp or more per franchise rank for schmoozing professionals and business rivals. Schmoozing at the highest level with nobles or ranking members of a faction might incur expenses of 250 gp or more per franchise rank as the character or staff member attempts to put on an impressive social display.</p>

The character makes a Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check to determine the effectiveness of their schmoozing, as noted on the Schmoozing table. A character with the obviator position gains a +1 bonus to the check. A character with a background related to those they attempt to schmooze gains a +1 bonus to the check (a criminal schmoozing other criminals, a guild artisan schmoozing a guild master, and so forth).</p>

Some schmoozed NPCs might provide only a single minor benefit to the franchise before realizing the one-sided nature of the relationship. Others might hang around wanting to help the franchise for years — whether the characters want them to or not.</p>

Has the party’s cleric accidentally started worshiping a dark god? Is the majordomo at odds with the occultant’s habit of displaying entrails in the great hall? Is the fighter questioning their life choices? The team building activity can help characters work through problems, settle differences, and adjust the work-life balance. In the end, everyone ends up with a healthier working relationship. Or at least that’s the plan.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="32e617b4-830d-46b8-a73a-346ce1e84ff0">At the DM’s determination, characters might be directed by Head Office to run this activity each time a new franchise rank is gained, or during times of exceptional chaos or uncertainty.</p>

Those individuals must dedicate at least one workweek to this activity, whose particulars are worked out by participating players and the DM. The team building exercise might be a trust-inspiring ropes course, an emotional “resolve your issues” workshop, a meeting with an NPC spiritual guide, or any other suitable endeavor. Setting up the exercise incurs expenses of from 50 gp to 250 gp per franchise rank, as determined by the DM.</p>

The players come up with such connections for their own characters. The DM creates connections for franchise staff, either on their own or in consultation with the players. (Characters and staff members do not need to pair up. If everyone else in the franchise has a particular problem with one character, so be it.)</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2a68df66-f9f8-48af-9a37-db1e43bd60f8">Were you kicked out of your village for experimenting with powers no mortal should dare trifle with? Acquisitions Incorporated has a place for you on its team. Those pesky, gibbering voices that plague your sleep? Acq Inc allows employees to work all night if that fits their skill set. And if it was ordained at your birth by the seers and mystics that your destiny would one day see you bathe in the blood of your enemies, Acq Inc has no opinion on personal hygiene as long as the job gets done.</p>

No matter what your favorite type of character, there’s something for you in this chapter. Or, if you like, you can engage with the entrepreneurial spirit of the campaign by using this material to inspire ideas of your own. Do you want to embrace the feel of Acq Inc right from the get-go? Consider one of the new backgrounds in this chapter, all with a special focus on commerce or Acquisitions Incorporated itself. Worried about whether a specific class or subclass has what it takes to make it in a cutthroat mercantile environment? We’ve got the advice and narrative options you need.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9fd57ea5-3393-46ed-8695-bc5808a39c53">This chapter also presents a new race inspired by the chaotic drive to achieve that underlies every Acq Inc campaign, as well as a number of spells with a decidedly financial flair.

<p data-content-chunk-id="41540ac4-fffa-4743-bdfd-a4c045a80c02">Scions of celebrity adventurers must deal with fame that’s not theirs, wealth they didn’t earn, and expectations they can never hope to meet. These hardships can have adverse effects, but those who cope with them can arrive at a decent attitude and a grounded worldview. Those who fail become bitter — or worse.</p>

Naturally, nothing ever happens when there are no witnesses left behind. But sometimes one casualty is left a little less than dead, just waiting to discover what a lucky break that accident actually was.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="77cb37e3-a276-42e4-a79a-b1935ab60881">You were a victim of a legal incident that was ostensibly the fault of Acquisitions Incorporated. At least that’s what the local magistrate said. But before a final ruling could be handed down, Acquisitions Incorporated offered you a job! Don’t know how to swing a sword? They promised to teach you! Think you have what it takes to sling spells? They’ve got masters who’ll have you throwing fire in no time!</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="60b00d4f-8760-460b-87cd-19499ba5cad0">With the promise of untold treasures and realms of magic and mystery just a dungeon away, you left your old life behind. Now a world of adventure is yours. Just initial here and sign here and here. Absolve Acq Inc of all former claims, and acknowledge you understand past outcomes don’t guarantee future results.</p>

Sure, being covered with the blood, sweat, saliva, and entrails of one’s enemies might be fun from time to time, but the cleaning costs alone can eat up a big chunk of a franchise’s profits.

<p data-content-chunk-id="8898a8a7-c47c-42a2-b7cd-f1bc1eeb8a92">For every CEO building up or bringing down businesses, it’s a safe bet that there’s a barbarian standing behind them. Often literally, with a large weapon in hand, and waiting for the order to go out and remove vital organs from another CEO. Corporate barbarians are the muscle behind the civil face of a franchise. It’s not that they enjoy losing their composure and having to make other people’s nice clothes all bloody, but some circumstances require carefully applied martial force. And others require the same thing, but with a lot less care.</p>

Maiming and disfigurement are also a big part of the job. Permanently eliminating someone who owes your franchise money or who double-crossed you on a deal sends a short, clear message. But leaving them hobbling when they walk or incapable of eating without a team of specialists sends a glorious, evocative poem — the kind of violent sonnet that resonates not just with the recipient, but with bystanders as well.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="852e47c2-0428-4a1c-af64-aee3575a0140">To maximize the power of your intimidation, you need to make sure the world knows who’s delivering it.

<p data-content-chunk-id="212feed4-5ebd-40d5-ad32-380fbe5eefde">While being the most impressive member of the party can be beneficial, it does come with some drawbacks. Attention and renown make others fear and respect you for sure, but that renown eventually draws sworn enemies to you whose sole purpose is your downfall. And no matter how fast you eliminate or convert one of those enemies, it’s only a matter of time before another one takes their place.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5a831c2d-1841-47f0-93f8-90d5f598578d">The loose association of minstrels and masters that was your bard college helps to define your knowledge and skills. Still, no matter what your original collegiate connections, as a bard in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, you now focus that learning into your own personal school of business.</p>
<h4 id="CollegeofGlamour" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="2ccdb910-2020-447c-adae-f5c3fac74e7a"><a href="#CollegeofGlamour" data-content-chunk-id="2892a333-e510-4dc6-9002-39c8aeba0337"></a>College of Glamour</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="15fb4341-c370-4f0b-b855-e0fcb246a29b">The lessons taught by the College of Glamour are right in your wheelhouse. Being able to make friends and influence people is the bread and butter of your profession. Rather than ply this trade in public squares and seedy alehouses, however, you have trained yourself to deliver your speeches in boardrooms and guildhalls. It’s all about convincing people to see your side of an issue — then motivating them to do exactly what you want.</p>
<h4 id="CollegeofLore" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="aa10f09a-2baf-455f-8d8a-68eb9acb2578"><a href="#CollegeofLore" data-content-chunk-id="ed011cb9-837a-4b70-8699-7a3a7946663b"></a>College of Lore</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9ef76da8-a3db-4b1d-8112-392a286a59c9">Some people swear by a well-rounded liberal-arts education. But the lore you seek out is a little more useful in its application. Knowing the capital cities of all the nations of the world might be nice on trivia night down at the tavern. But knowing the identity and location of a dozen nobles’ illegitimate children carries a little more utility in the adventuring world.</p>
<h4 id="CollegeofWhispers" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="2f539b93-fb38-41c9-b474-a637ecd5e73a"><a href="#CollegeofWhispers" data-content-chunk-id="d3d59017-8458-4ba0-9234-77f25e78936a"></a>College of Whispers</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e08f53a-3cf5-46f1-ae0c-9b265dd5a502">The College of Whispers teaches a skill set that’s attractive in terms of its power, but which can be incredibly off-putting to anyone with any moral compass. Thankfully, that’ll never be a problem for you. The ability to mess with others’ minds is a skill that needs to be used cautiously and wisely. Otherwise, you’ll never gain the much-needed trust that’s part and parcel of being an effective business leader.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2347f3ea-679f-4efd-bb08-5dfe9af2c56b">If you think wading through scores of undead in a haunted crypt or channeling divine power to keep your party alive gets the adrenaline flowing, you should try keeping the peace at a corporate board meeting. Or managing the hostile takeover of a rival. Try negotiating merchandising rights. It’s not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4056acb8-efb4-4df3-b435-e48108b40185">Thankfully, your business acumen draws on insight that’s literally out of this world.

Because the gods would never let you down, right?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="707d194a-5ef5-4de8-b863-1bf933e13fa8">Despite their supposed wisdom, many common clerics fail to grasp the simple concept of using the best tool for the job. To the devoted priest of Tempus, every problem is just begging to be solved by a formal declaration of war. A cleric of Bane has never met a minion they couldn’t wait to kick around. Lathander’s clerics are all sunshine and happiness, even when they should be hiding in dark places to avoid danger.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="87d974d5-a316-401f-b38d-67e59d99e01d">As a cleric in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, you’ll carefully choose your deity so that the domains of your divine patron synergize seamlessly with the goals of your franchise. But at the same time, you understand that the greatest thing about the gods is their prolificacy. With so many deities in so many pantheons, all of them have their own stock to sell. As such, even though you have your own personal favorite, you’ve also learned the value of diversifying your divine portfolio, keeping an array of holy symbols and icons on hand for any occasion.</p>
<h4 id="DivineDeals" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="3a9a89af-ae3f-4b37-92c9-2797357fb76c"><a href="#DivineDeals" data-content-chunk-id="f1b86066-c39a-4c53-b430-f5051f4e1bcf"></a>Divine Deals</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="74899a7f-b14e-4ba2-9acc-2a36677ce86f">From the most notable nobles to the most humble members of the working class, everyone needs faith and spiritual guidance. And what better way to teach the value of faith to others than to make sure the value of faith is measured in gp. In addition to your franchise’s regular operations, you always keep a sideline going in religious paraphernalia, selling specialized signature items to select markets. By showing the world that faith is your business, you can ensure that business is always booming.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="003e1515-bf52-49bb-8d3b-7b2906aa4dd8">Faerûn is full of pantheons and deities, some of more relevance and power than others. All those deities and their servants can be found in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, but a few select gods, goddesses, and otherworldly powers might play a larger role.</p>
<h4 id="Abbathor" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="6899d409-c67c-4d0a-9e56-e9cf880a9712"><a href="#Abbathor" data-content-chunk-id="4db98f6e-c462-450b-b899-cc26f36b2d30"></a>Abbathor</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="74d3d6d0-cc49-4f4e-bafb-b112bb0271d7">This dwarven deity of greed gets a bad rap. Because seriously, greed is just another form of the fundamental urge for survival. If gold is power and power is life, then the more gold you accumulate, the better and longer your life will be. Why is it that people who have money and power are admired and respected, yet people who stop at nothing to attain money and power are “avaricious” or “materialistic” or “felons”? Abbathor might be looked down upon and called evil for the lengths his followers sometimes go to in the pursuit of wealth, but the power he represents is the end goal of many an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise.</p>
<h4 id="Asmodeus" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="1c8ec821-7285-4bff-bfe7-ab4fb15cbf26"><a href="#Asmodeus" data-content-chunk-id="710df754-1402-4186-85a1-31f775916059"></a>Asmodeus</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1a65e03e-ec42-4248-9048-fb30ecd9c7bf">When they coined the phrase “making a deal with the devil,” this is the devil they were talking about. The Lords of the Nine Hells are the original CEOs of some of the multiverse’s most profitable megacorporations, and Asmodeus is their master. If you want a model for efficiency and motivation in an organization, look no further than the infernal expanse of Nessus. You want to talk about a perfect sales pitch and a diabolically intricate contract? Asmodeus has you covered. Many civilized nations don’t even count worshiping Asmodeus as a crime, unless you get into those nasty side trips of humanoid sacrifice and the like. But as long as you remain cognizant of not wanting to throw away potential customers that way, how much risk of going down that path could there be?</p>
<h4 id="Jergal" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="21fd007e-a0be-48e2-aeb8-7509e65bca16"><a href="#Jergal" data-content-chunk-id="9df9050a-fb42-40ba-bded-6ca17d208f52"></a>Jergal</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f7545b6e-97bf-424d-aa10-8c66ce0b2cf5">Death is a serious business. Literally. Jergal is a lesser deity who works alongside Kelemvor, the god of the dead. But whereas Kelemvor sees to the more metaphysical side of death, Jergal sees to the details. Where did sweet Nana want to be buried? What rites did your dearly departed love want performed? And how much of a donation to the church will you be making to see those things done? As an Acquisitions Incorporated cleric devoted to Jergal, you understand that there are only two sure things in this world: death, and getting paid to do something with the body.</p>
<h4 id="Lliira" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="19a1865a-b7f0-4889-b8db-ec772884fc27"><a href="#Lliira" data-content-chunk-id="ee480314-557e-4742-9864-4b20b78b529c"></a>Lliira</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="69333dd4-7e4f-42e1-a46d-7771291861be">The Lady of Joy brings merriment, happiness, and fun to the world. And there’s nothing people will pay more for than merriment, happiness, and fun. As a cleric worshiping Lliira, you open yourself up to become a vessel for the goddess’s joy — for a price, of course. Because surely, if joy sustains the soul just as food sustains the body, then there’s nothing wrong with making a bit of profit from happiness.</p>
<h4 id="Mask" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="82b2cc43-409d-498d-80e7-ac070611d3c9"><a href="#Mask" data-content-chunk-id="d21c0a1d-0e57-4a14-a8ad-471eaa2fbb92"></a>Mask</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e607fef-0124-4450-8bf5-6d5ef87f0a2c">The Master of All Thieves is an important deity for Acquisitions Incorporated characters to be aware of. Mask is the god of acquisition, after all, and governs the secrets that any successful Acq Inc franchise will be dealing in. Whether personal, professional, or business-related, secrets are an important component of gaining leverage over others. Moreover, your successful franchise will eventually have many secrets of its own that you desperately need to keep quiet.</p>
<h4 id="Oghma" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="efb21b76-2995-4437-a564-fd79628819de"><a href="#Oghma" data-content-chunk-id="1aea46d7-fc67-49b1-ba6d-721c04df742b"></a>Oghma</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee1b3ec5-cea0-4b8d-b736-f546de1ffef9">Everyone knows the adage that knowledge is power, but no one believes it more than the worshipers of Oghma. As a follower of the god of inspiration, invention, and knowledge, you seek knowledge for its own sake. But as a member of Acquisitions Incorporated, you understand further that knowledge is just the first component of any business plan, and that turning knowledge into power requires a consistent amount of the follow-up action that your franchise is famous for.</p>
<h4 id="Sune" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="18bd2e41-9bb2-4e25-99b6-a81b933c50c1"><a href="#Sune" data-content-chunk-id="e62c556d-1ebc-4b25-8d72-45a15a85c993"></a>Sune</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="65ae22b5-c137-4a06-85bc-26f11228eec4">The wise know that people are defined by their desires as much as anything else, and the Princess of Passion is the patron of desires. In the battle of logic versus passion, it’s passion that guides mortals and gods more often than not. As an Acquisitions Incorporated cleric of Sune, your intimate understanding of passion — or, better yet, your skill at manipulating the passions of others — can be a huge boon to the operation of a successful franchise.</p>
<h4 id="Tymora" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="ebfad719-50ef-48b9-a02c-c0dc1c0c5b05"><a href="#Tymora" data-content-chunk-id="5b7181a4-d0c0-4c07-bd24-64740a4a4939"></a>Tymora</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c0e2a095-f6ab-40d8-905b-497da06fa126">Luck is a lady tonight! And, as it turns out, every night. The goddess of fortune is known as Lady Luck, and every adventurer knows the importance of keeping luck on their side. As a pragmatic Acq Inc cleric of Tymora, you know that only stupid people ask the rhetorical question, “Would you rather be lucky or good at something?” Because no matter how good you are, you’ll eventually have the bad luck of facing off against someone who’s a whole lot better. When that happens, good luck is the only thing that’s going to save you.</p>
<h4 id="Waukeen" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="0ab1109b-e1fa-4f9c-94cf-d6c4de20b0a0"><a href="#Waukeen" data-content-chunk-id="a1f821d5-e063-4b04-9307-aff1a29b5e79"></a>Waukeen</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b83ffdbe-731b-4593-a2af-a141111128c1">The Coinmaiden is the de facto patron of anyone who trades goods or services for payment. And thankfully, her relative ambivalence toward the laws underlying fair trade and honoring deals makes Waukeen a perfect fit for an Acquisitions Incorporated cleric. Regardless of your best intentions, ensuring the success of your franchise means eventually having to gingerly step across some ethical or moral line. Or having to hide the fact that your franchise companions have been busy erasing the line completely.</p>
<h3 id="Druid" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="0588a32d-ff17-4e1b-9706-00f5c8574e58"><a href="#Druid" data-content-chunk-id="892a4f0e-98b2-4250-9182-522857808b0a"></a>Druid</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ce9cd558-01bb-4e23-a00a-59ab81e7b064"><em>My plan for creating an intern tier consisting of nothing but giant ants should allow us to increase productivity by 37 percent. Who’s with me?</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7f4949a5-3379-4f03-b4ec-275bdc157e1c">At first glance, druids might not seem the best fit for an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, with its frequent forays into urban settings and its focus on treasure procurement and business considerations. But the primal power wielded by druids reflects the relentless cycles of nature, which in turn make a remarkably prescient model for business. Growth and stagnation. Boom and bust. It’s all there, writ large in the passage of the seasons and the ancient dance of bigger creatures consuming smaller creatures.

<p data-content-chunk-id="0570980d-3f94-4062-9f4f-e1337bf3a3bd">Some of the most lucrative ruins and monster lairs happen to be located inconveniently in the uncivilized wilds of the world. As an Acquisitions Incorporated druid, your specialty is getting your party into and out of such areas with maximum profit and minimum bloodshed. (Well, your blood anyway.) When a veritable army of natural things that want to eat you stands between your franchise and profit, you’re the one the other party members are looking to for guidance.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1648fb8f-ad67-43ae-b52b-3aeb1f0e6ba0">Almost as importantly, every adventuring group bent on exploiting the natural world to gain resources and power needs a conservation expert to tell them when they’ve gone too far. After all, only fools would destroy their environment in the name of vast profits. Right?</p>

In addition to hanging out in parks or arboretums (or creating parks and arboretums in vacant lots when no one’s looking), you might also be called upon to tend to struggling foliage or sick animals, eliminate threats to natural spaces, or serve as a font of horticultural and biological lore to folk in the area.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2bb54d1a-2775-42e5-b7ea-24dc219a8bac">Though many druid circles are inspired by and focused on the natural world, even the most woodsy circles can fit into an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign with surprising ease.</p>
<h4 id="CircleofDreams" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="e5871ae0-a8b3-42b4-8dc0-8cfac1ab48ef"><a href="#CircleofDreams" data-content-chunk-id="357f6a4e-893c-4ed5-b422-9e3ceac3f190"></a>Circle of Dreams</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d389581-279e-4ea6-9126-47d5403f0c8f">Normally, druids who come from the Circle of Dreams have a connection to the dreamy lands of the Feywild. As an Acquisitions Incorporated druid, you maintain this connection and expand it, embracing the marketing potential of dreams and positive energy. This effluence of radiance and light is meant to be harnessed, shaped, and shared with as many people as possible. And if they’re willing to pay for that sharing, so much the better.</p>
<h4 id="CircleoftheLand" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="d54cc239-26fa-456f-aca9-0ec8595c661e"><a href="#CircleoftheLand" data-content-chunk-id="a3ee8087-002d-4fbe-8680-258ac2a0cf3f"></a>Circle of the Land</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9550a578-ab1e-4c33-b111-63d20449c91e">Any organization that wants to make an imprint on the world needs to employ an environmental consultant, ensuring that they’re engaging with the land in a sustainable and efficient manner. As a druid of the Circle of the Land, your role in your franchise makes extensive use of your knowledge of nature. Your expertise ensures that the exploits of the franchise don’t disturb nature — and just as importantly, prevent nature from disturbing the franchise.</p>
<h4 id="CircleoftheMoon" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="9e3e804c-35b3-4ccb-a809-52578851dd3a"><a href="#CircleoftheMoon" data-content-chunk-id="84acb498-5f8c-403f-9a01-634bd7852c5d"></a>Circle of the Moon</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f0470492-3c61-4d18-b426-b930ec91b864">Circle of the Moon druids are known for the myriad animal forms they wear, but those forms need not tie you to the wilderness. In rat form, you can slip past the sentries of a well-guarded guildhall to secure trade secrets. On a risky urban operation, you can adopt the form of a pigeon or an alley cat to be your party’s chief scout and spy. And in a pinch, your most combat-focused animal forms make you an excellent hand at black ops, able to infiltrate, extricate, or eradicate with equal verve.</p>
<h4 id="CircleoftheShepherd" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="c8f63da8-61ad-41fa-8f61-13fc5365e72f"><a href="#CircleoftheShepherd" data-content-chunk-id="45a98933-6220-4b55-931f-7ab7c9528ee2"></a>Circle of the Shepherd</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f7b57449-dab6-4858-ae1e-0695c421e104">The world is a dangerous place, and the innocent always need champions to keep the figurative and literal wolves at bay. Others in your circle focus on protecting the helpless creatures of the wild from natural and unnatural threats. But your vow of protection extends to the common folk as well, recognizing that they are just as much a part of the natural world — and are often just as scared and helpless as any creature left to the mercy of that world.</p>
<h3 id="Fighter" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="e6504679-48f9-437a-ae6f-6670069fd5ea"><a href="#Fighter" data-content-chunk-id="77e6a6ce-e22f-4e73-8745-23582a39f3cf"></a>Fighter</h3>

<p data-content-chunk-id="da77d89c-e104-4b93-8dca-24498502a707">Some fight to slake bloodlust. Others fight for the thrill of besting an enemy. Some fight for a code, a faith, or an ideal. But a true pragmatist fights only for coin, understanding that battle is a means to an end and not an end in itself. A fighter in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign often fights for money above all else, whether focusing on a primary role as a combat specialist or providing martial backup for the franchise as needs be.</p>
<h4 id="MissionAccomplished" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="3f11ecbb-4eba-4ea0-82b4-bf8153b02d60"><a href="#MissionAccomplished" data-content-chunk-id="35fe919a-8d5c-4d2f-a67a-21eedee0da6e"></a>Mission Accomplished</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="403b56bd-29b2-4cd8-b044-376e47c70c5b">Whether your intention is to end a target’s threat or simply deliver a message (violently or otherwise), those around you can take comfort in knowing that when you take on a job, the job gets done. When your franchise loses its direction or collective nerve, you stand tall with the power of your convictions and an even more powerful assortment of weapons to keep things on track. If that sometimes inspires a need to crack some rival skulls, that’s just the way of war. And if those skulls sometimes turn out to belong to people on your own side of the ledger, well, that’s just business.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7f45d70f-f57f-4928-8abc-18f78eb0ce3c">You are anything but reckless, however, recognizing the effort that goes into doing a job right. Berserkers flailing about the battlefield and challenging all comers have a certain amount of flamboyance, sure. But you can’t spend the coin you’ve been promised for a job if the job leaves you dead.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="af45f6f3-8774-4a14-91cd-8a8f7e07f80a">No combat tactic is too down-and-dirty when your life and the welfare of your franchise are on the line. Smart fighters use any means necessary to gain the edge in battle, whether those tricks were learned from a long-gone drill instructor, first used by an opponent against you, or an original tactic perfected by long hours of training.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="27ddbc2d-4e82-40d6-b236-1a6976d0310b">To the uninitiated, fighters are the simpletons of the adventuring world, flailing away with their weapons while taking repeated blows to the head. But those folk know precious little about the specialties and subtleties of this class. Many flavors of fighter exist in the world, and all can fit into an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise in their own way.</p>
<h4 id="ArcaneArcher" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="89862620-8e43-43bf-a17e-2a07553b4310"><a href="#ArcaneArcher" data-content-chunk-id="f7a7d18b-a526-4675-919d-79512c8782db"></a>Arcane Archer</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="15ca8f6d-e854-4815-9048-5869058aff4e">Those elves really know how to bring the hurt from a distance, don’t they? Fortunately for the arrow-slinging world, they were willing to share their arcane archery knowledge with friends, and now every Acq Inc franchise can have its very own magical cannon! As an arcane archer, you’re incredibly useful during those tense discussions when someone needs to be able to whistle, and then moments later, arrows appear out of nowhere to stick out of the ground between the feet of the people they’re talking to. Roll that next check to negotiate with advantage!</p>
<h4 id="BattleMaster" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="1894a6c1-9ae4-4312-971a-b063f682f8c4"><a href="#BattleMaster" data-content-chunk-id="45338422-a1e9-4f05-bb65-926a9443d8c1"></a>Battle Master</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0b8d8387-7f46-4445-85e7-dd8b6221b183">As a battle master involved with an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, you understand that your maneuvers might not do as much damage as the focused attacks of a less subtle fighter. But the needs of a franchise often call for subtlety and precision over simply busting heads. Add in your knowledge of the more cerebral aspects of combat, including all-important insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy, and it’s clear why you make a great addition to any franchise.</p>
<h4 id="Cavalier" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="70b9e6ca-6ec0-422c-aa3f-f32af07efe65"><a href="#Cavalier" data-content-chunk-id="37f20c10-086f-4e38-b9e0-5e360c63199d"></a>Cavalier</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c9c54910-be7b-4de5-b4b9-b40ba1c5b2ce">An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is a heady mix of adventuring and business, and both those pursuits require travel. Who better to lead a long road journey than an experienced cavalier with a reliable mount? As a cavalier, you’re one of the best warriors around for protecting less hardy allies, even off your mount, making you a mobile fighter, a team player, and a valiant protector.</p>
<h4 id="Champion" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="ff9c4cc2-6eaf-469a-82a3-8ceaad1a08db"><a href="#Champion" data-content-chunk-id="4dbccb67-394e-49aa-8719-acedfe3f3dff"></a>Champion</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b20f61d0-4709-4743-8547-2238502ebb1e">Accepting the wisdom of the old adage “Sometimes less is more” is an excellent way to go broke. Because less is less, obviously. Just look at the balance sheet. But there’s one exception to that nonrule that can make a big difference in the successful operation of a franchise — the focused, no-frills approach to combat of the champion fighter. As a champion, you quickly master your role within your franchise, because that role is simple. Lift heavy things. Stand in front of monsters. Hit them till they drop.</p>
<h4 id="EldritchKnight" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="9cf15f4f-6964-4d39-936d-950417285834"><a href="#EldritchKnight" data-content-chunk-id="1cdfe6dd-4f15-45f2-af94-acc3c0269180"></a>Eldritch Knight</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="46d6e437-71f1-4851-9648-0d8b4317d858">Fighter? Wizard? Why not both?! If a franchise’s recruiting efforts result in a party lacking either fighting or magical ability — or, Tymora forbid, both — you make a great addition to the team as an eldritch knight. Your focus on abjuration and evocation ensures that your fighting style is supported by magic that can either defend allies or deal massive damage to your foes. And if your franchise operation runs true to form, you’ll have plenty of opportunity for both.</p>
<h4 id="Samurai" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="330eae62-d1b4-4a7f-8697-1cb36cbff838"><a href="#Samurai" data-content-chunk-id="41f717f4-0d65-46ca-94af-1a6589ef6d35"></a>Samurai</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="501d12eb-84bf-47ec-98c9-a05fa30a157f">Even if samurai are rare in the lands where Acquisitions Incorporated offers franchise opportunities, their fighting spirit makes them invaluable additions to any franchise — especially if that spirit encompasses the fight for profits. As a samurai, your impressive combat skills are matched by your social grace and wisdom, providing a boon to your franchise’s standing in the community. Any franchise could do worse than having you as its public face — especially when your sense of quiet resolve is needed to quietly resolve some unexpected business disaster.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="23e248e8-8cb3-4bc6-8990-4de051e94409">Ki is a magical energy that fills the space between all things in the multiverse. Monks tap into that energy through spiritual and martial training, meditation, and contemplation. And punching and kicking. And more punching and kicking. And maybe a head-butt for good measure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8f9dabfc-ceb6-4eac-a3db-9c64c23dcbf1">Monks in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign find a way to integrate a typical ascetic life with the grandeur, majesty, and over-the-top business focus of their franchise. History (real and fantasy) has shown that monasteries don’t always shy away from engaging in profitable enterprises. As such, your Acquisitions Incorporated monk likely brings their old monastery’s entrepreneurial spirit with them — along with new ideas to energize that spirit even more.</p>

<p class="Call-Out_Call-Out" data-content-chunk-id="36d21c76-091e-4244-a361-a1b5202c1de9">In my experience, hiring a monk skilled in the art of peaceful arbitration is the only way to attempt to defuse the rather concussive methods of negotiation employed by many Acquisitions Incorporated franchisees. And if it comes to it, a monk will at least ensure that the concussions are fairly distributed.</p>

So if you just like money — you know, as a friend — then it’s all good! Many Acq Inc franchises actively try to recruit monks into entrepreneurship, knowing of their reputation for versatility both in and out of combat. If you hail from a particularly profitable monastery, you won’t need to be convinced of the benefits of a well-run business — you’ll already be on board.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a6c49565-aeba-4205-8858-ecc0411945c4">The diversity of monk traditions makes those traditions different from each other in abilities as well as in attitude. And since an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise runs mostly on attitude, it’s important for the philosophy of a monk’s monastic tradition to mesh with the philosophy of the franchise.</p>
<h4 id="WayofShadow" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="7785ddc2-90b6-412e-bd04-39765a0342bf"><a href="#WayofShadow" data-content-chunk-id="e1091284-c50c-46ac-8912-e11f1d4fcf7a"></a>Way of Shadow</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0aba0224-d1ec-4270-965a-557e697de765">Monks following the Way of Shadow fill an important role in an Acq Inc franchise: that of an infiltrator. As a shadow monk, you’re likely more adept than even a rogue at moving around without being seen, slipping into dangerous places unnoticed, and getting away with no one the wiser as to what you’ve stolen. And it’s a safe bet that your fellow franchisees will quickly learn to search the shadows before they say something they don’t want you to hear.</p>
<h4 id="WayoftheDrunkenMaster" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="3c0133f6-90de-44ae-8f3f-a0415ce4b305"><a href="#WayoftheDrunkenMaster" data-content-chunk-id="d46a3fc5-9e05-4a0d-a90b-24a9e0a80901"></a>Way of the Drunken Master</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5af7498b-5dec-4f66-8d71-37846ff312b0">The most dangerous adventurer in the room is the one that no one knows is an adventurer. As a monk who follows the Way of the Drunken Master, you excel at keeping your true threat level under wraps. Your ability to literally spend days hanging out at the tavern and never be noticed makes you a valuable addition to any franchise that needs to keep its collective eyes and ears on happenings in town. Plus, you’re a guaranteed riot at company parties!</p>
<h4 id="WayoftheFourElements" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="43499ed5-fdb5-4a55-adf4-ff9d67d25d10"><a href="#WayoftheFourElements" data-content-chunk-id="c8f0459e-a022-42cd-97df-e3cb8c09b74a"></a>Way of the Four Elements</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6943005-05e9-46c0-804d-80b7c2ce237f">Most enemies who take on a monk expect to get a few punches or kicks for their trouble. So when flames, cold, and thunder come streaking toward them instead, they’ll never know what hit them. As a monk of the Way of the Four Elements, you combine the striking power of a typical monk with the versatility of a wizard. Especially in a franchise without a dedicated combat spellcaster, your elemental affinity comes in handy.</p>
<h4 id="WayoftheKensei" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="d1c45915-666a-4648-af40-7dead940811c"><a href="#WayoftheKensei" data-content-chunk-id="a0879f02-5daa-444e-8849-6409b93122b0"></a>Way of the Kensei</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c1a9750-b0f6-40c8-8963-a66444ea62eb">Monks following the Way of the Kensei often appear to care more about their weapons than they care about the people around them. Because they do. As a monk following that tradition, you make a perfect fit for a martial-focused franchise. Your skill with weapons makes you an asset in combat, and your practical knowledge makes trading in arms a natural sideline. For you, battle is business and business is always booming.</p>
<h4 id="WayoftheOpenHand" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="80b1fc83-2acb-46f7-8a3d-2820542cb0ed"><a href="#WayoftheOpenHand" data-content-chunk-id="ffb99d83-7a80-436c-a33e-3b13bea85d2d"></a>Way of the Open Hand</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="78164056-2d8b-4df9-bbe7-70e7be92acf2">It’s always nice to have someone in a franchise who can slap an enemy so hard that they shrivel up and die several days after the characters have left town and arranged their alibis. As a monk following the Way of the Open Hand, you know that others think of you as a mysterious figure. You might sit by yourself for hours on end, humming strangely. You might say weird things that you expect others to treat as great wisdom. Frankly, as long as your fellow franchisees can count on you to break skulls when necessary, you can probably get away with anything.</p>
<h4 id="WayoftheSunSoul" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="97b3781b-f285-40dc-bdfc-ce3fe9154af5"><a href="#WayoftheSunSoul" data-content-chunk-id="f76887e7-1980-4ddd-9252-6f99625f86ef"></a>Way of the Sun Soul</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0b3d783d-8e32-4263-a013-76452a3bf7ec">Many benevolent monks have a reputation for being all punching and sunshine. As a Sun Soul monk, you epitomize this reputation. Except for the benevolent part. Whenever a fight is in need of area-effect damage, your fellow franchise members understand that you’re their best friend in the world. And if your reputation for exploding in anger (literally) makes for easier negotiations with suppliers and business rivals, so much the better.</p>
<h3 id="Paladin" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="b06bf298-244b-4808-b760-182a6bf737b5"><a href="#Paladin" data-content-chunk-id="77da2bdf-8e0c-49eb-8a78-30bd17e973fa"></a>Paladin</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="684bbc0b-4f97-4aaa-993b-d5b0f84fd9c9"><em>My companions did what!? The screams could be heard from how far away!?</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2e9a2d3d-e4c1-4350-bcd4-dfdd9eb2e59a">When many hear “paladin,” they can’t help but envision a knight in shining armor, helping innocent people in distress and living a life of utmost virtue and chastity. Yawn. In the world of Acquisitions Incorporated, at least some small part of a paladin’s dedication is focused on the code of business. Morals and ethics are all good. But an Acq Inc paladin knows that nothing puts food on the plates of the poor and roofs over the heads of the dispossessed better than cold, hard cash.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="50588910-cab7-4ed8-b1c5-59453437ba0c">And virtue and chastity are more guidelines than rules anyway. Right?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="bd8b142f-46ea-4233-a54c-54fbce75f323">All life is sacred. Well, some lives are sacred. Okay, fine. The people you protect are sacred. On certain days, everyone else is negotiable. As an Acquisitions Incorporated paladin, you are dedicated to the protection of your fellow franchisees out of loyalty and duty — and because you can’t earn all that sweet coin on your own.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8ee93274-5644-4fa0-86fe-6c767ea73874">In your role as the party’s bodyguard, your unmatched training and sense of honor drive you to take untold risks as you put others’ lives before your own. Your heavy armor is as fearsome as your heavy morals, and your healing ability, bonuses to saving throws, and lack of fear create a trifecta of comfort. Your natural leadership role also comes into play, as the squishier members of your party come to rely on your presence and protection.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="73f3d12e-ec2c-4e6f-90ba-40755c794091">Every character has a few private matters they’d rather not share, but the truth-and-honesty stakes usually aren’t as high for others as they are for a paladin. If there’s any extra drama in your life, chances are it stems from a terrible secret in your background that you need to constantly struggle to keep. What’ll happen if your friends and allies learn of your dark past? How might a sadistic DM put pressure on you throughout the unfolding story to keep your secret at all costs?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="69219ee5-063c-42da-bc7e-d03d9a9942f3">When problems arise as a result of your franchise’s operations — and clearly through no fault of your own — you fix those problems as only you can. You excel at remaining calm and attacking each challenge logically and deliberately. Especially comforting to your teammates is your insistence on using a witty catchphrase to raise their spirits in the midst of the greatest danger. Your companions take great pride in your catchphrase, even if they’re too shy to admit it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1901da5a-d64c-45c1-96e4-bbc08b16d7f2">The oath that you take (or break) as a paladin defines your character as a center of moral authority in the world. And that works just fine in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, albeit with a few minor adjustments.</p>
<h4 id="OathofConquest" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="6576ffcd-74c9-4ef7-8991-802435a92f83"><a href="#OathofConquest" data-content-chunk-id="c3481a62-26be-4c21-a398-a159a71792bd"></a>Oath of Conquest</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d1d4970-6da6-4804-8a18-e546257aa655">Most paladins who take the Oath of Conquest consider martial subjugation the ultimate form of defeat for an enemy. You have a wider view, though, and are able to embrace monetary or business-related conquest as equally fulfilling activities. Is a business rival really all that different from a rampaging dragon? Both are dangerous and antisocial, and both sit on a hoard of wealth that could be yours if you’re brave enough to take it.</p>
<h4 id="OathofDevotion" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="3fa837b0-2717-4ed6-8516-f782dc41b332"><a href="#OathofDevotion" data-content-chunk-id="08356c44-7499-4cad-beb9-529143246bb1"></a>Oath of Devotion</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4074a088-626f-4e20-b092-ac248444d5b1">As a paladin devoted to the ideals of order and justice, you’re in a perfect position to guide your franchise to great ends — even as you make an excellent foil for the less-savory plans of your fellow franchisees. Your insistence on dealing with business partners fairly, honoring legally signed contracts, and promoting the general welfare of the world helps you cement your franchise’s reputation as a group worth dealing with. It might just take a little bit of convincing for your fellow party members to see things your way.</p>
<h4 id="OathofVengeance" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="11985526-b94b-4d92-b398-02022d24c612"><a href="#OathofVengeance" data-content-chunk-id="4a356ddd-5b85-4b62-941a-454e0466a5c8"></a>Oath of Vengeance</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ecf20fae-3d62-4637-aced-3549f670f086">The fury brought to bear by an Oath of Vengeance paladin fits well into most Acquisitions Incorporated campaigns. Those who break contracts, renege on deals, fail to repay debts, or otherwise break their word can expect a visit from you in your role as the executor of vengeance. And if your fellow franchisees can make a bit of profit by picking up the pieces when your job is done, then everyone’s happy.</p>
<h3 id="Ranger" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="a7096ad0-1e3a-4506-9deb-78cfaeb71e2e"><a href="#Ranger" data-content-chunk-id="674e176c-cde0-451d-8285-082b8c2fddd0"></a>Ranger</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7bcb3553-3d71-47fb-9d0e-b0d29c9406d0"><em>All that is gold does not glitter. But frankly, if you’ve got the choice, take the glittering gold every time. That nonshiny stuff loses a ton of resale value.</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a30c990-35d9-40da-b4c3-b8965aa814a1">Loving nature, exploring the wilderness, companioning with animals: most people wouldn’t view these things as obvious assets for the rough-and-tumble business of running an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. But most people are wrong about everything. Few Acq Inc franchises set their roots or undertake all their business in urban areas. As such, countless adventures will call a franchise into the wilds, where a qualified ranger makes the difference between forlorn failure and fabulous success. Even when a franchise engages in commerce in the cities and towns of the realm, a ranger’s keen senses, sharp blades, and flesh-seeking arrows will never find lack of use.</p>

<p class="Call-Out_Call-Out" data-content-chunk-id="5d878ca0-08cc-40b8-884e-06b187836e3d">Rangers like to work alone, but it is convenient when others are around to draw the arrows to themselves.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="18a0c1e9-0e2c-43c7-8ee4-45442a343dd4">The notion of being a defender is core to your identity as a ranger. As a member of Acquisitions Incorporated, you channel your natural proclivity for protectiveness into a razor-sharp focus on the franchise. Pure profit is never an end in and of itself, but whatever deep-seated personal goals you only ever talk about in the dead of night over a dying fire, those goals need financing.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="13833c8b-4bd2-4979-8668-ba6b8e9c3723">Your role as a defender and a controller of problems makes you a natural leader for sure. Your sense of selflessness and integrity can help shape and guide the more unscrupulous business plans of your allies. Likewise, the other members of your franchise might panic when that crate of <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5413-figurine-of-wondrous-power" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5413-tooltip">figurines of wondrous power</a> you acquired turns out to all be self-activating obsidian steeds. But you have the steady nerves and earnest resolve to revert and revise any pear-shaped plans.</p>
<h4 id="AnimalsareEverywhere" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="409b6432-dc3e-491f-8be2-c842700c1fb2"><a href="#AnimalsareEverywhere" data-content-chunk-id="a30ad91e-3def-4c95-82b5-dc4ee9bf850e"></a>Animals are Everywhere</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5b1a8ce1-ef49-45c7-b56d-894e5177736c">The balance of nature is no less strong within civilization than it is in the wilds, and the streets and sewers of towns and cities are their own thriving ecosystem. As a ranger who spends part of your time in urban settings, you quickly learn to seek out the companionship of some of the many beasts that inhabit those settings.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="399eb832-f9e2-4f43-a9ca-635cf2992935">No matter whether a ranger ranges in the crowded city streets, the trackless wilderness, or the most desolate and confounding planes, all ranger archetypes can find a place in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.</p>
<h4 id="BeastMaster" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="001a3662-d7d7-475a-8e3a-8447bb0b22aa"><a href="#BeastMaster" data-content-chunk-id="203dba6f-2543-4612-bec5-9d5b91a3dfcc"></a>Beast Master</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ececfc7d-3e95-48c4-b061-f27665a4166e">Any Beast Master understands that a beast companion is far more diligent, friendly, and reliable than most people. This might be doubly true in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, where if you fall in combat, your companion isn’t going to assess the resale value of your gear versus the cost of the <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/71-potion-of-healing" data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/71-tooltip">potion of healing</a> it’ll take to revive you. Even in an urban setting, a beast companion makes a solid ally, serving as a guard or a scout when you’re skulking around places you shouldn’t be.</p>
<h4 id="GloomStalker" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="d294f65d-0120-4134-b186-381716a21fcc"><a href="#GloomStalker" data-content-chunk-id="ea909ecb-e073-4a3e-8370-ced0385414c8"></a>Gloom Stalker</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="de0a5b1a-6b92-44ba-9344-d8e00fc5bff8">Gloom Stalkers are often best known for their work in the Underdark, but shadows are shadows wherever they occur. As a Gloom Stalker ranger, you find solace and refuge in dark alleys, dimly lit back rooms, and the shadowy corners of any corporate boardroom. Moreover, your expertise as a skulker and an ambush predator fits right in with most franchise business models.</p>
<h4 id="HorizonWalker" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="5020a855-4f22-4ff8-8aba-e81ae816ad89"><a href="#HorizonWalker" data-content-chunk-id="4d8f9d8f-4f4f-4fed-b313-62ed94525e81"></a>Horizon Walker</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e938fba6-1d3b-4c6f-a345-da1507ba14bc">Every Acquisitions Incorporated franchise needs to be ready to travel at a moment’s notice, with franchisees always rushing headlong into the next amazing opportunity. As a Horizon Walker, you’re a master of travel, blazing trails into unknown realms by passing through the even-more-unknown realms of the planes. Whatever path your franchise walks, your combat and magical skill helps ensure a safe journey for you and your companions. Moreover, the unknown reaches of the world are the best places to find new resources, and no one knows more about the unknown than you do.</p>
<h4 id="Hunter" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="409b3ee8-16d1-4ae5-964f-990f72be7fd5"><a href="#Hunter" data-content-chunk-id="a55f797e-0cf7-4315-ab5b-db82d52a5c8d"></a>Hunter</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="61afd540-5668-4bdb-ae15-5ddf68cf3edb">Whether in the wilds, in the cities, or in the wide expanses in between, your specialized combat training as a Hunter ranger makes you a stalwart defender of your franchise and your party. On a mission, you take a lead role in dispensing with threats. In a social encounter, you stand at the back of the room and look dangerous. Just focus on a bit of sensitivity training to counter your predator’s instincts and you can be the definitive Acquisitions Incorporated employee — looking smart in a business suit one day, and hacking up enemies the next.</p>
<h4 id="MonsterSlayer" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="056a8d28-3f54-4186-9faa-101997789729"><a href="#MonsterSlayer" data-content-chunk-id="6febbb78-3242-477c-be63-7ab8b600e351"></a>Monster Slayer</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b0e4415f-1e96-4aa1-9b28-4da107837beb">The nightmare creatures that haunt the world are more of a threat to an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise than they are to other people. Because frankly, other people have less to lose. Sometimes monsters guard vast amounts of treasure just waiting for acquisition. Other times, they’re in the employ of a business rival looking to acquire your wealth, your blood, or your soul. No matter how dark the adventure gets, your role as a Monster Slayer makes you the best offense and defense against whatever stands in your franchise’s path to success.</p>
<h3 id="Rogue" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="60bf1d0c-e750-4300-aa8a-5cf0c6f5208e"><a href="#Rogue" data-content-chunk-id="9bbf6c33-c0a1-4403-8ea1-32f6e3a4770b"></a>Rogue</h3>

<p data-content-chunk-id="22313a30-a3a8-4328-bcbe-44339e1154a7">A rogue is often the backbone of any successful adventuring party, providing an ample amount of martial prowess, a diverse skill set, and a pat on the back for a job well done (with or without a dagger in it). In an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, a rogue’s talents are even more in demand. Not only is the rogue the first one into the dragon’s lair and the last one out (after securing away the choicest bits of treasure first), but their keen eye for details and their practiced social skills make them equally invaluable in the boardrooms, the taprooms, and the back alleys where business gets done.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="96375a60-bf08-460b-87ec-da18af4b5e8b">In the world of Acquisitions Incorporated, dangers are as likely to be contractual as physical. Avoiding a trap’s pressure plate in a dungeon is good. Avoiding an awkward social situation might be even more important. Explosive runes warding a treasure chest go off once, maybe no one spotted them, big deal. But a rogue who notices a carefully worded legal trap in a contract can save their franchise from lasting harm — and a rogue who can insert such details into someone else’s contract is worth their weight in performance bonuses.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7f5cd676-4b1a-48b3-80c4-c2e1b5a97899">Every rogue has a story about that one big score. With enough ales and a bit of prompting, you can easily be convinced to tell the tale, highlighting all the drama and derring-do. But the tale is so much better for the telling if you can highlight it with visual aids.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0847caf2-8833-4f6b-bbb9-a178a05a6688">You carry a trophy from that big score, which you pull out when the occasion demands or when you need a reminder of your own skill and luck. Sure, if anyone found the item on you, there’s a good chance you could be arrested and convicted of the crime that procured it. But that’s part of the excitement, right?</p>

More advanced talents, however, are generally taught through one of the many criminal guilds that crop up in towns and cities throughout the land. As an Acquisitions Incorporated rogue, you definitely left your guild in order to join a franchise, for no rogue can serve two masters. At least not officially.</p>

<h3 id="RoguesofaDifferentFeather" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="2bbc4ec2-a070-47ca-b794-912d4c7b64c4"><a href="#RoguesofaDifferentFeather" data-content-chunk-id="e398dd04-fa26-46d1-9883-3a94763c1492"></a>Rogues of a Different Feather</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ffafa08f-a781-4325-97fa-6043e0e1c699">Each of the many archetypes of the rogue offers a variety of features that can prove a boon to any Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. You might enjoy making a scene, or you might prefer to pass unseen. You might eliminate your foes in the most public way possible, or prefer to deal with all problems behind closed (and preferably soundproofed) doors. Either way, your talents make you the invaluable linchpin of your franchise’s operations.</p>
<h4 id="ArcaneTrickster" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="04ae2ca9-07a8-4e64-aec5-5c3d4801ce50"><a href="#ArcaneTrickster" data-content-chunk-id="3455a9a5-d0b3-46d1-9254-7f8fc30aa799"></a>Arcane Trickster</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db73e95c-d471-4e3b-ae63-50c44a38a659">What does an adventurer who has all the tricks of a rogue need? Even trickier magic! As a rogue of the Arcane Trickster archetype, you supplement your dexterous abilities with spellcasting derring-do. Especially against competitors and enemies who don’t know the full extent of your abilities, you make a most daunting foe.</p>
<h4 id="Assassin" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="814ccc67-cc05-4065-a726-bbf536cb1053"><a href="#Assassin" data-content-chunk-id="284ce046-b866-480c-bfb1-4a4b6ecb46c9"></a>Assassin</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fb47e727-4c0c-4def-af48-142d334a818b">Working as an assassin within an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise can be rewarding. Because even as good as the rest of your franchise mates are at killing things, you take that art to the next level. Your top-notch infiltration and disguise skills mean that you’ll always be keeping busy. But if you’re one of those “You know too much, I have to kill you now, it doesn’t matter that I was only asking for directions”-type assassins, you might find that your inherent bloodlust needs to be focused to the subtle enterprises undertaken by the best franchises. So keep calm. Or if you can’t, at least keep the killing quiet.</p>
<h4 id="Inquisitive" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="fb88e2f6-f46b-4692-9252-e3a50f66f120"><a href="#Inquisitive" data-content-chunk-id="a17fee51-e1b3-41b3-832b-e897e2be22e2"></a>Inquisitive</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="27239459-1265-48b8-9c58-32a59b666cdf">As an inquisitive, your eye for detail and insightful demeanor complement the skills of the more martial members of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. Your powers of deduction make it clear that you’re the obvious choice to lead your franchise, and you are an able operative in the field as you provide valuable information for ongoing operations. You also have a knack for finding weaknesses in enemies — not only in combat, but in a rival’s business plans as well.</p>
<h4 id="Mastermind" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="8bc4cd9b-4dae-4b6f-8981-8994bab7eb7d"><a href="#Mastermind" data-content-chunk-id="42b89869-e857-463f-b559-2894d68a615c"></a>Mastermind</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1af587ec-3e48-47b5-a132-907e2d1b326f">Planning, tactics, misdirection, intrigue, sneak attack: it’s like the rogue mastermind was specifically built for an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign. Your formidable social skills translate perfectly well from the street to the boardroom, and your ability to read your foes and rivals clearly makes you the best choice for franchise leader. Unfortunately, your equally practiced ability to read your allies means you’ll know which of them see themselves as leader. Good thing that’s a problem you’re perfectly equipped to handle.</p>
<h4 id="Scout" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="562ec6a0-7b8b-46fe-84d6-38125bc2aa38"><a href="#Scout" data-content-chunk-id="d7806d4c-8c79-4cec-9bcc-89be58813739"></a>Scout</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4cc4e144-6fd6-47e7-a014-b0377c8a1907">Though many scouts are more comfortable in the wild, the lessons you’ve learned in the wilderness offer a surprising amount of utility when you’re working in cities and towns. Whenever the party needs to go out and engage in some acquisition work, you’re at the front of the group, literally and figuratively. Your skills in survival and ensnarement translate nicely to the civilized world, where it’s just as much of a challenge to ambush a competitor’s caravan as it is to deal with a goblin raiding party.</p>
<h4 id="Swashbuckler" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f47df221-ea04-4a50-a975-567928cbb1f4"><a href="#Swashbuckler" data-content-chunk-id="9911d00c-2164-4851-941f-c2b47bede57d"></a>Swashbuckler</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f4ec7de4-e471-440e-aeff-a3157ed6830a">The one-on-one fighting style of a swashbuckler is a perfect fit for the stylish bravado that befits an Acq Inc franchise. Your mobility, audacity, and charm offer versatility in any number of situations, from infiltration, to theft, to fleeing the city guards when the infiltration and theft goes bad. Moreover, your social skills make you equally effective in and out of combat. However, your love of showing off means that you might have to work at not turning every social encounter into a combat encounter just because you can.</p>
<h4 id="Thief" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="aa53761a-675b-47c7-b442-747cf27cf2a6"><a href="#Thief" data-content-chunk-id="38822aab-ec6f-4e47-a1b3-861fb3b76682"></a>Thief</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a04c4dc0-88d4-4cd9-bd52-c2a1fe926510">For most people, to be called a thief is among the gravest of insults. For an Acquisitions Incorporated rogue, it’s a compliment. You’re able to look out for yourself in combat, but are smart enough to instead style yourself as the expert who gets out of trouble just as easily as the rest of the party gets into it. Whether you’re picking locks at speed on the way out of a noble’s estate or mastering the operation of a strange magic device before it burns your headquarters to the ground, your fellow franchise members always know how lucky they are to have you around. And with your special skills, you’ll be able to make sure they show their appreciation financially — whether they know it or not.</p>
<h3 id="Sorcerer" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="dd03c850-3e90-4c51-ad21-09c2c307edaa"><a href="#Sorcerer" data-content-chunk-id="2a9ef32a-9ed1-4994-87c3-ce8c75e2e678"></a>Sorcerer</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f39f2607-061e-42ea-96f3-2a0237575d4c"><em>Yes, that’s a fine idea. We should totally put that to a vote. Hey, that’s weird — my hands are starting to glow. Is anyone else seeing that?</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bf3a5a1d-d30c-43fe-88ee-b42e39b8d022">A sorcerer’s use of magic runs the range from chaotic to catastrophic — which suits the style of many Acquisitions Incorporated franchises alarmingly well. When a loud and emphatic marketing statement needs to be made using magic, trust a sorcerer to do the talking. And with natural charisma powering their magic, a sorcerer also makes a good public face for a franchise, with their darker or more chaotic tendencies either hidden or amplified depending on need.</p>
<h4 id="TheBurdenofLeadership" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="cd48c4d3-04ad-41c9-bf21-a1a06626d7c4"><a href="#TheBurdenofLeadership" data-content-chunk-id="1feabf7b-ab9b-4b3a-8f15-1b1eaeca675f"></a>The Burden of Leadership</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f6a78883-b19f-41c4-bbc1-7f7d433157f6">Your natural charisma makes you the obvious choice to be the leader of your franchise. Others look to you constantly for inspiration, even if they’re afraid to show it. And that’s a good fit for you, because if you can tell others what to do and have them listen to you, it’s easier to give the most dangerous frontline tasks to them while you cast from the back and reap the rewards.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dc3c2490-3397-4fab-874a-d7438e4c5d98">With great profit comes great responsibility, however, and it’s important to let the other members of your franchise know that they have a place where their opinions matter. It’s a place beneath you, sure, but good ideas often trickle upward. It’s surprising how often a suggestion made by an underling turns out to be exactly what you were planning on thinking all along. And your understanding of chaos tells you it’s easier by far to deal with the so-called law when you have a strong team at your back. Or, even better, at your front, so they’re the ones drawing attention to themselves if things go bad.</p>
<h4 id="FocusingwithFlair" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="c2ba89b5-4264-436c-8442-b8717559a717"><a href="#FocusingwithFlair" data-content-chunk-id="ebc18a24-fe14-4a8d-806b-7d1f546393c1"></a>Focusing with Flair</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5a9e5250-9367-4b12-bdf7-3685edda763a">All sorcerers rely on an arcane focus through which they channel their magic, but traditional focuses lack a singular style. Staffs, orbs, wands, blah, blah. You like to do things differently.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="dba299af-ba42-45a9-bc80-8f458af07885">When you cast a spell, you go all in, channeling that magic through body and soul. Often, leftover magic from a casting manifests as a residual effect that can build up over repeated uses of your spells and cantrips. Some residual effects are subtle. Others are obvious to the point of distraction. But any such effect might eventually become a kind of spellcasting signature, ensuring that everyone knows the tenor of your magic as well as they know your name.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="371beee1-a84c-4b59-8515-d7d1f4e2d5ba">Each sorcerer draws their power from different sources, based on their lineage or their connection to the multiverse. Your own lineage defines much about your place in the world and your approach to magic, and can help you establish your connection to your Acquisitions Incorporated franchise.</p>
<h4 id="DivineSoul" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="890fab4b-4ad7-4e71-b1fb-796d451ca76b"><a href="#DivineSoul" data-content-chunk-id="5dd30bae-0d99-412f-b992-abbbeef95e93"></a>Divine Soul</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="97c8d730-3301-49a0-9430-910d84ed3599">As a divine soul, you have a special place in your franchise. Just as with the child of a wealthy business owner or an heir to a noble throne, your lineage and breeding demand respect, and it’s your job to make sure your franchise mates understand that. Your success is ordained by the gods themselves, and you embrace that destiny by mastering the ways of business and adventuring, becoming the best you can be.</p>
<h4 id="DraconicBloodline" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="bd37a72e-6187-4fbf-87fe-b869964b9d27"><a href="#DraconicBloodline" data-content-chunk-id="43467be8-3fdc-4b76-b03b-a1a24139e3bf"></a>Draconic Bloodline</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c15c5d0a-333e-40ca-809e-db274296e43e">You know those people who seem to just automatically succeed at everything they do, tearing through life like it might be cheap parchment? Of course you do — because you are one. As the scion of mighty dragons, you are the master of everything you set your mind to. Adventuring, espionage, taking credit for your franchise’s success — you do it all. And if you ever find yourself out of your depth, you’re quick to establish that you’re not actually out of your depth at all. You’ve totally got this!</p>
<h4 id="ShadowMagic" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="47c62a19-da5d-483d-bf98-30f51b1c4f01"><a href="#ShadowMagic" data-content-chunk-id="40bd9a5b-8ba5-4c66-8351-13e275c0a3d5"></a>Shadow Magic</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d0e048ee-3c14-4c60-9955-1585119ed9d4">As a shadow sorcerer, your mysterious connection to the Shadowfell makes you a master of social encounters. The sinister laugh, the glowing eyes — nothing makes a clutch negotiation session go quicker. And when negotiations reach an impasse, your connection to the shadow world makes you a valuable tool for spying, infiltration, security, and, of course, killing.</p>
<h4 id="StormSorcery" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="6fcf81a3-24a9-4ef7-8ae7-57679cd97a88"><a href="#StormSorcery" data-content-chunk-id="911a5edc-f41c-4ad4-8925-141bd5be06e3"></a>Storm Sorcery</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="873bf7b1-2fd6-41e8-ac33-5732647bd729">Harnessing the energy of wind and lightning makes you great fun in combat. But as a storm sorcerer, you have even greater utility when your franchise travels overland or across water for business, as you shield allies and important cargo from inclement or dangerous weather. And sure, those allies harp sometimes about your occasional bouts of rage and your proclivity for blowing things up first and asking questions later. But you take it all in stride, because it’s not like you have a temper or anything.</p>
<h4 id="WildMagic" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="09af5cd7-2c50-4a04-9e57-d19f3b1bb08b"><a href="#WildMagic" data-content-chunk-id="d8fe6cf7-1517-49b2-a6bb-3ee41b193226"></a>Wild Magic</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="85c089f5-3c20-4dd8-bdc9-7c8736b74f2f">In business, an element of unpredictability is the best means of keeping your franchise one step ahead of the competition — and nobody brings unpredictability like you do. Business plans and long-term strategies are all good, and kudos to your teammates for all their hard work on that stuff. But when a plan needs subtle refinement based on unexpected developments in the marketplace, you’re the one who’ll thoughtfully tear that plan up, burn it to ash, and just wing it.</p>
<h3 id="Warlock" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="377f74e4-66d2-42a3-893e-1cb575a33622"><a href="#Warlock" data-content-chunk-id="ddcc0d58-6b68-4985-9a3d-b17fedcb5d81"></a>Warlock</h3>

<p data-content-chunk-id="392863a3-f1cd-44dd-b469-6b272bd45775">A warlock can be an authoritative asset to an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, as their known association with powerful otherworldly forces makes for a great starting point in tough business negotiations. Likewise, a warlock’s pact is the definitive binding contract, providing a unique insight into matters of debt and obligation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="61158a40-ec5f-4b3c-8c63-ee7e8b6b2b19">The only thing you need to watch out for is making sure your work-life balance is in order. You want to be seen by your staff as the suave, fashionable master of your franchise’s occult services, not the creepy weirdo with the glowing eyes always chuckling maniacally to yourself. As convenient as it might seem, remember that interns are not automatically potential sacrifices. Always check the individual contract first.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6036c18b-ef50-4dec-98e3-955a27b2597a">Many folk think of the fey as mysterious sylvan creatures that occasionally get up to harmless pranks. As a warlock of the Archfey, you know better — and are perfectly suited to lay the truth down whenever you can. You and your magic exemplify the duality of light and dark, and your motivations are often as inscrutable as those of your fey master. This can be an advantage when rivals are trying to suss out your plans. But it can be frustrating when allies start harping about, “What are you up to?”, and “Why won’t you talk to us?”, and “Why did you kill those people?” Just tell them anything. It keeps them happy.</p>
<h4 id="TheCelestial" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="c9a159eb-f4b1-4d9f-8b1c-a9b48b53eeb3"><a href="#TheCelestial" data-content-chunk-id="ab799fdf-bd0a-4e2d-a3d7-226dceec247d"></a>The Celestial</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0b2edaf1-b430-4e2f-9bb8-20d87de976ca">As a warlock of the Celestial, you meld the powerful magic of your class with the heavenly attitude of the Upper Planes. Your light-infused, radiant-based power makes it easy to establish trust among franchise mates and customers alike. That false sense of security then comes in handy whenever it’s necessary to remind people that being good doesn’t necessarily mean being lawful — and that even being lawful leaves a lot of wiggle room.</p>
<h4 id="TheFiend" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="da404afe-d36c-4743-b135-d461abc25665"><a href="#TheFiend" data-content-chunk-id="9688e322-5a6f-4318-a7a6-af5194674a23"></a>The Fiend</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d3c3f0ca-70c2-45a5-b0f1-1f8ecae85c05">When people speak of doing deals with the darkness, you know just what they’re talking about. As a warlock of the Fiend, you have a ton of experience walking the fine line between light and shadow. Or, you know, walking the shadow but being pretty sure the light is over there somewhere. As such, you’re the perfect person to take point when your franchise needs to get down and dirty to succeed.</p>
<h4 id="TheGreatOldOne" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="a07709e6-0c1d-41dd-8416-53b4056de665"><a href="#TheGreatOldOne" data-content-chunk-id="efa22d03-7a62-4003-b483-b10fc3785b92"></a>The Great Old One</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0638e7f6-72fd-4240-bee3-4855b777d130">Everybody’s met that one mind-addled poet at the end of the bar spouting all kinds of nonsense. But only you can really appreciate the truth of what they’re talking about. As a warlock of the Great Old One, you harness the power of unreality and madness for the benefit of your franchise. You are known for consistently offering up plans and advice that go outside the box. Way, way outside. And when your plans turn to profit, your franchise partners are thankfully there to take care of all that balance-sheet-and-coffer practical stuff. You’re more about the big insane ideas, really.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="52c1b702-d0c7-476e-b2f1-678bb8dae08c">As a warlock of the Hexblade, you dwell always within the realm of the disturbing and the unknown. But wow, is it worth it. Your ability to focus power through your weapons makes you a perfect franchise enforcer. Your aptitude for cursing, hexes, and dark magic makes you a skilled negotiator. And your ability to create spectral interns makes you a personnel manager’s dream.</p>

I can get you out with no collateral damage. I’m fine if you care less about the “no collateral damage” thing. Now let’s get down to business.</i></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b95ee796-c82f-4b2f-bfe1-6b229bb3cdeb">The utility that a wizard brings to an Acquisitions Incorporated operation is obvious to franchise members, staff, clients, and rivals alike. Defensive spells, arcane travel rituals, eldritch utility magic — a wizard does it all. Plus, they’ll blow things up when needed. And not surprisingly, things in an Acq Inc campaign need to get blown up a lot.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a4f04daf-a138-4479-a5ed-4d3eab8a153f">It’s easy to make the case that arcane magic is the most valuable component in any franchise business plan or strategic road map. And as a wizard, you’re the premium vendor of advantageous arcane services. Just make sure that staff and intern contracts have strong language regarding the risk of friendly fire. But in the small print, way down there at the bottom.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3da842eb-20aa-4b4c-ad8b-a216d4a01dea">Though wizard encompasses a single class, the study of arcane magic lends itself to a broad range of specialization. As such, it’s not enough to simply dedicate yourself to being the best wizard you can be. It’s about figuring out which wizardly path best addresses your franchise’s potential needs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bf1cdde0-9c02-4c95-9dce-504704551237">Enchanters and illusionists in the service of a franchise can boggle the minds of enemies and allies. Transmuters, conjurers, and necromancers ensure that franchise members always have the right tool or monster for the job. Abjurers and diviners can help avoid catastrophic events before they happen. And evokers and war mages? No one needs to be reminded of the simple yet devastating majesty of a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="185be974-d1b5-41eb-8ca5-ef539190dc98"><a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2102-fireball" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2102-tooltip">fireball</a></span> spell.

<p data-content-chunk-id="f83d4e58-f8ec-4c0c-a5f5-3304152343c7">With so many schools of magic available to wizards, each type of specialization brings a different set of skills and strengths to a franchise. Your chosen school can help define your role in the business, as well as your fellow franchise members’ expectations for you.</p>
<h4 id="Abjuration" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="ab2bdae3-8ced-490a-91ec-cc981cf1cea3"><a href="#Abjuration" data-content-chunk-id="c1321342-5846-4de9-b4e0-14355da70bdc"></a>Abjuration</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5f3b2212-5553-4b9e-810c-6887af424e86">Protective magic is often underappreciated by the members of the lesser character classes, with their focus on dealing the most damage in the flashiest way possible. But in an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, where property and real estate need protection as much as the party members, your role as an abjurer is always greatly appreciated. Just don’t make the rookie mistake of protecting everybody else before you take care of yourself and the goods. And if you need to reserve some spell slots before the rest of the party has been made sufficiently invulnerable? Hey, that’s what potions are for.</p>
<h4 id="Conjuration" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="eae5c6a4-899f-44d9-aea5-dad4127f878f"><a href="#Conjuration" data-content-chunk-id="93edf676-80f0-4962-bd13-0bd67c6e9ab2"></a>Conjuration</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7a8f6741-92a5-472c-b132-19ba1f6f0a71">The ability to make something from nothing is the greatest business plan ever developed — and that plan has your name all over it. As a conjurer, your utility to your franchise knows no bounds, whether you’re creating the right tool for the job, summoning creatures for scouting or guard duty, or using <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="fb7a9783-6164-4a70-8864-918ffd568f35"><a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2068-dimension-door" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2068-tooltip">dimension door</a></span> to slip away from a deal gone bad. The hard part of that last one is always figuring out which of your franchise mates you’ll bring with you. Who’s been particularly nice to you lately?</p>
<h4 id="Divination" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="49ef2ac7-1cd7-49d8-80c7-0974747ef213"><a href="#Divination" data-content-chunk-id="ef1231f7-893b-4d76-83ee-2368752d3011"></a>Divination</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b87b5461-a491-4f40-9b7c-dada1903e964">Seers and soothsayers abound in the world, but most ply their trade only to take advantage of the credulous and the desperate. You possess the true gift of the diviner, able to tap into the flow of time to read portents of the future. Your divinations help negate the risks for your franchise, whether in business deals or dangerous treasure extractions. And sure, working on the credulous and the desperate is sometimes part of the plan. But when you do it, it’s done with professional flare.</p>
<h4 id="Enchantment" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="10e830a1-f1c7-4c93-b357-4d334cc0e2e8"><a href="#Enchantment" data-content-chunk-id="1265af95-b288-4362-af14-2b11b922fbc3"></a>Enchantment</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1d2add1b-9cb1-45e7-85f8-31c77fe3e7b2">Trust. Community outreach. Social awareness. These things are important to every business, and as an enchanter, it’s your job to ensure that your Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is synonymous with these concepts. Whether they’re actually present in the franchise or not. When it comes down to it, having friends is an equally valuable asset in adventuring and business, and being able to turn enemies, rivals, and angry mobs into friends even for a short while can make a difference.</p>
<h4 id="Evocation" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="868f6fb2-9225-4d85-b5ed-6abfbdc68631"><a href="#Evocation" data-content-chunk-id="7fc497ad-a7a2-45bc-b09d-2cf3740b5ba9"></a>Evocation</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a2f6d1a3-1c5f-4aec-bb03-11a1470f01f8">As an evoker, you understand the wisdom of the adage, “Speak softly and carry a big wand.” As a member of Acquisitions Incorporated, you also know that the speaking softly part is entirely optional, contractually speaking. When your franchise needs firepower, you bring the damage and spread it in flashy, dramatic fashion. This works out great in the dungeon, and sometimes even at outdoor social events that don’t feature a lot of flammable buildings nearby. In the boardroom or the council chamber, your skills are likely in less demand, but just knowing you’re there can help keep the noble or the business magnate across the table fully engaged. Because as long as you are there, they know they’re safe from having you burning their holdings to the ground.</p>
<h4 id="Illusion" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="379343de-2e17-4841-8881-d5ac81534298"><a href="#Illusion" data-content-chunk-id="ddbce9e7-3345-456d-b7f4-6b979f5c87f2"></a>Illusion</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d6282d2d-09d8-4fb9-959d-25436bfba7b4">Success in business, as in combat, can often hinge on split-second decisions. As an illusionist, you have mastered the art of confounding the senses, leaving enemies, rivals, and customers uncertain as to what’s real and what isn’t. Once you convince those around you that they can’t trust what they see or hear, that’s a perfect opportunity to give them your preferred version of what’s going on. Whether it’s obscuring contracts, concealing incursions, or manifesting imaginary staff members to take the fall for your partners’ misdeeds, your magic helps put the best possible illusory face on your franchise.</p>
<h4 id="Necromancy" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="09add6f1-310e-427a-b7a1-7d7f8bfa6b81"><a href="#Necromancy" data-content-chunk-id="db33d162-bd51-461f-be44-2f5d112a1d7d"></a>Necromancy</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="55a995ea-7f7d-4c93-8979-b0c986dcd51c">As a necromancer, you’ve always had an easy time making friends. Hah! That’s hilarious because your friends are undead. But not everyone else in your franchise sees the lighter side of your magical craft. Clearly, the labor-to-paid-benefits ratio of undead interns can’t be beat, but you need to be cognizant of the potential public-relations nightmare of franchise-branded zombies running amok. Still, if things get bad, there’s nothing like a general marketing campaign reminding local folk that necromancy means <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="a0b15dd9-94b5-426d-8080-92cd91474225"><a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2224-raise-dead" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2224-tooltip">raise dead</a></span>. Even if you can’t cast it.</p>
<h4 id="Transmutation" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="d7160762-ed6b-4bb8-b00f-d6d978676842"><a href="#Transmutation" data-content-chunk-id="261a7cec-b122-4059-8273-d0624b032b22"></a>Transmutation</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b372f98b-3e8b-48b5-a29b-66a5b8ecc5e4">As a transmuter, you practice one of the most subtle forms of magic — the transfiguration of one material substance into another. But let’s be honest, your role in your franchise is going to be mostly about combat and ability buffs, and, “Hey, why haven’t you learned how to turn lead into gold yet?” You take it in stride, though, because you understand that the long game is entirely about you. This franchise needs to be transformed from a chaotic mishmash of dysfunctional personalities and clashing goals into a well-tuned engine of commerce. And no one does transformation quite like you do.</p>
<h4 id="WarMagic" class="compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f9874219-bc66-43c1-bfce-65512c5925f4"><a href="#WarMagic" data-content-chunk-id="1ffeedf8-3189-49dd-b57c-2826dfe11b86"></a>War Magic</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="68511bfc-2c8a-4961-a76e-29dc0f6ac680">Success in business requires prudent caution and take-charge offense in equal measure. As a war mage, your focus on abjuration and evocation is thus a good fit for success. Many war mages feel it their duty to waste their lives (sometimes literally) on the battlefield. But you specialize in the more subtle conflicts of the marketplace, where you can take your skills to a whole new level. You cast spells under pressure, never blinking in the face of death or financial ruin. And when it’s necessary, you can blow up an adversary like nobody’s business. Just make sure your franchise’s collateral damage insurance is all up to date.</p>
<h2 id="NewRaceVerdan" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="0ba1876a-0646-4c65-ab76-33417ea8825c"><a href="#NewRaceVerdan" data-content-chunk-id="da81ac6d-bd71-42cf-b416-7ad0637fc0da"></a>New Race: Verdan</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e654f8d4-9ec7-4c18-8048-b9f2ed201975">The verdan owe their existence to chaos. Descended and transformed from a large clan of goblins and hobgoblins, those who became the verdan were simply living their lives, doing goblinoid things. But then passing through the shadow of That-Which-Endures changed them forever. Now the newest race to call Faerûn home, the verdan do their best to find their way in an unfamiliar world.</p>
<blockquote id="_idContainer395" class="Call-Out-Box ddb-ai-quote-purple" data-content-chunk-id="1e71ce78-8656-41ec-8208-d10826adaea4">
<p class="Call-Out_Call-Out" data-content-chunk-id="b11cfd06-9b6f-4c9f-a65c-9e54730553f5">Reality is a descent into chaos punctuated by brief flashes of order, whence we arose and so imagine it to be the norm rather than a distant outlier. That-Which-Endures held entropy back for a mere instant, and the Verdan emerged. I’m sorry, was that the question?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7b95c508-f27b-4adf-a6bf-1a3dc04e6113">When the power of That-Which-Endures mutated the verdan, their skin was turned the color of jade and their blood began to flow black. Their ears grew pointed, and they gained a limited form of telepathy — but at the cost of forgetting their history. The underground homes of the goblins were places of terror to the new creatures those goblins became, and the verdan quickly fled to the surface and into the sunlight.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db33df1d-c54d-44d1-85e3-860a0d3d65fa">When they arrived in the new lands of the surface, the verdan found that they were often mistaken for smaller, green-skinned half-elves. Attracting curiosity but no real questions, they have thus been able to make their way reasonably freely in the world.</p>

<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="cf954ee4-a9f2-47ec-ad40-14d94fafcdc0">That-Which-Endures is a nameless, faceless, mysterious entity, something between a multiverse-spanning primordial spirit and an over-god. It represents the amoral and all-encompassing power of entropy — the force that unknowingly and uncaringly changes order into chaos, and that breaks matter and time down into its component parts so that all can be rebuilt. Some who study this entity claim that it is clearly evil and destructive. Others call it simply a necessary part of the cycle of death and rebirth. In the end, though, That-Which-Endures shows precious little interest in what people say about it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6f4d7257-98de-4bdb-b8e9-e64825f4c780">Because the verdan have not dwelled long in the world, they are still discovering new things about themselves. Chief among these discoveries is that their physical forms change as they age, signifying that the mutative power of That-Which-Endures is not done with them. The first verdan emerged from the Underdark as creatures of goblin stature. But they soon learned that their kind were fated to eventually undergo a dramatic, painful, and random growth spurt that sees them transformed to hobgoblin size over a period of days.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="45793441-8f67-4d09-ae01-fc750b97bfa0">At the same time, many verdan undergo changes in coloring as they age. Male verdan typically have little to no hair, while females sport shocks of wiry hair that they try to tame in a variety of styles. But the color of any verdan’s hair, skin, and eyes can transform from their original jade tones to pale white, deep ebon, or any other shade in between. A verdan’s ears also undergo numerous spontaneous alterations over their lifetime, from the typical range of point and peak seen among the elves, to huge ears that sweep back from the head like wings, and which are often pierced behind the head with a single ring to keep them from flapping about.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d496c818-665c-4e6c-90cd-06607fee42a1">Changes in gender are also a known and accepted part of verdan life. These fluid aspects of form and identity are seen as blessings, allowing an individual to experience more of the world and grow in empathy and understanding. There is no pattern to any verdan’s mutations, as verdan from the same family can shift in drastically different ways. The verdan assign no cultural or biological relevance to any particular coloration, physical features, or gender.</p>
<h3 id="CulturalChameleons" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="712021a2-3455-4fbc-9e26-333a485f9440"><a href="#CulturalChameleons" data-content-chunk-id="7b613102-2cfe-4cee-b5e4-e6add68b6780"></a>Cultural Chameleons</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="052afca9-a861-40b9-8308-4aae984009fd">The clan homes of the Underdark goblinoids who became the verdan covered an enormous area. As the verdan fled to the surface world, they emerged in culturally diverse locations. Some found themselves near dwarven strongholds, others near elven enclaves, and others near the widespread human settlements of Faerûn.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5b855595-ba13-4bda-82e4-e56f2b6613b1">Without a cultural identity or memory of their own, the verdan quickly adopted the cultural practices of the areas into which they migrated. Still, a sense of not truly belonging is felt even by verdan who have been welcomed into other cultures. They are often stricken with wanderlust, keeping their possessions limited and easily portable. It is not unusual to see individual verdan or whole families trooping along the roads of the world with their tents and belongings strapped to their backs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="178230b9-766f-4703-a914-b7d818ebdb7c">Even when they are happily steeped in a culture, the verdan remain on the lookout for oppression and curtailment of freedoms. They understand the need for laws that protect, but they rail against laws that restrict and oppress — especially those designed to protect the power and wealth of the elite. When living among enlightened folk, verdan are still the first to speak out against cultural restraints on individuals, particularly those based on physical characteristics such as gender, race, or appearance.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="127f4fa4-8d72-4584-ab12-a0fb2d8c2046">Verdan are hungry to undertake new challenges and absorb new experiences. When they meet other verdan who have traveled to different parts of the world, they drop everything to spend as long as possible sharing stories and observations from their respective travels. However, their inexperience in the world and their racial amnesia sometimes lends the verdan a kind of innocence that works against them. Some are credulous and easily fooled by hucksters, but most verdan have an intuition bred by empathy that helps them eventually sort out those who are sincere from those who are not.</p>
<h3 id="VerdanNames" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="dc530f1e-302e-4e64-95a8-b53a44be0bd3"><a href="#VerdanNames" data-content-chunk-id="8b813f02-f39e-4265-a3cf-1b73b46b32fe"></a>Verdan Names</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2f1c5876-99ad-47dd-81ff-6532e7781b95">The oldest verdan names spring from goblinoid traditions, but more recent names reflect the character of the different cultures these folk have encountered since coming out into the sunlight. When a group of verdan live near dwarves, they might take on more dwarven-sounding names, only to change those names when they wander into a human area. A verdan is also not hesitant to change their name as their physical appearance changes — or, indeed, whenever the mood strikes them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="536ad5fe-be25-4e16-8a1d-3b7b90a19b37">Verdan make no differentiation between male, female, and family names, and often eschew family names altogether.</p>

But at some point after reaching maturity, each verdan undergoes a sudden growth spurt of 2 feet or more. At 1st level, you are a Small creature. When you reach 5th level, you become a Medium creature.</p>

Magical research and development is a big part of day-to-day operations at Head Office, whose spellcasting staff toil day in and day out to come up with the very latest in eldritch improvements.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7a0bec1b-95a9-443e-9f3f-e523e21351a6">Many of their developments remain closely guarded secrets, known only to the company’s highest-ranking employees, and ready to be whipped out at a suitably dramatic moment. But every once in a while, a unique spell makes its way through the ranks of the company’s casters and into the world at large. Some of these spells are alterations of old classics, while others bend the magical energy of the multiverse in new and exciting ways.</p>

Certain personal secrets no doubt drive Portentia’s single-minded focus for Dran Enterprises, but those have yet to be revealed. (To most people, at least. DMs can check out appendix A for more information.) In the meantime, the organization focuses on besting Acquisitions Incorporated at its own game while growing ever more powerful — and eventually reaching the point where a corporate takeover of Acq Inc can no longer be thwarted.</p>

Being acquired ourselves is definitely not on brand, and I have definitely refused this offer. But I would like to know what the dental plans are like at Dran Enterprises, for a completely separate and unrelated reason.</p>

Having made such engagements, the loyalists of the Noble Knife are watchful for signs of leaders and power brokers making the first transition to tyranny — at which point, those newly minted tyrants are quickly assassinated for the greater good. The organization doesn’t “take jobs” as such. Rather, its leadership assesses the moral and political landscape of the realm and selects targets thusly.</p>

Additionally, the act of creation takes twenty or more years off the lead artisan’s life. It goes without saying that the Noble Knife is chock full of true believers.</p>

Though that seems pretty suspect if you ask me. They often work in pairs, with an assassin or observer paired with a “tame mimic.” Those mimics can take any object shape, as is normal for their abnormal kind, but are also able to transform into strange dogs that say “woof.” Not that they bark. They say “woof” like a person would. Unless you were a member of the faction, you’d almost never see two teams in the same place at the same time — unless they had been given opposite tasks for some reason. If that’s the case, get out of there quick, because whatever happens next isn’t going to be pleasant.</p>

Defeated foes, unhappy or jealous allies, disillusioned associates or hirelings — it’s a long list. And a group as storied and reckless as Acquisitions Incorporated was always destined to break more than a few eggs while making their delicious brand of adventuring omelet.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ac84edc3-860a-4593-96c9-ce3dc8a89892">The Six is a group of just such enemies — characters who were left hurt, underappreciated, or even dead in the wake of Acq Inc’s magnificent achievements. Whether the Six are really six, or fewer, or more, remains to be seen. The organization’s primary public goal appears to be revenge in the form of the downfall of Omin Dran and Acquisitions Incorporated, but who or what is truly behind the group — and what other sinister vendettas they might cling to — remains a mystery. Still, there’s a good chance it’s got something to do with destroying the world by unleashing the power of the Far Realm. (Sorry; “Spoilers!”)</p>

I know that because they hand out pamphlets with my face on them, and there’s one of those circles with the slash through it. Seems bad. Also, there’s something about their logo I don’t like … but I can’t put my finger on it. People are saying they’re weird and gross, and who am I to say otherwise?</p>

Episode 1 is for players using shiny new 1st-level characters. They’re ready to take on the world and hoping to become part-owners of a share in a valuable, prestigious Acquisitions Incorporated franchise — or at least gain a coveted internship with the organization.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d7ee26a8-faf0-4171-87a1-6078e4450c4e">At the end of each episode, characters gain a level. Each episode is an appropriate challenge for a party of four characters of the indicated level, but that challenge can be modified to accommodate your group. At the end of the sixth and final episode, the characters attain 7th level. But even more importantly, they will be fully vested in an operational and maybe even profitable Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. After that, the players and characters can take their treasure-hunting activities in any direction that you and they desire.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="03d51c39-7ac4-4d55-a967-b0801c6c234f">Between episodes, characters will use downtime to undertake a variety of activities to better themselves or their franchise. By later episodes, choices of downtime activities might alter the flow and challenge of the story. After all, there’s no rest for the wicked, so there shouldn’t be rest for heroes either. (Logically then, wicked heroes would need to work twice as hard. Budget the time.)

<p data-content-chunk-id="937a57a5-20ba-4cc5-a8bc-6f26c84e7d0b">The grand buffet that is an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign features plenty of the exciting locations and high adventure common to all great fantasy campaigns. But an Acq Inc game adds a unique helping of humor and corporate intrigue to the mix, creating a rich narrative familiar to anyone who’s watched an Acquisitions Incorporated livestream game. To take full advantage of the potential of an Acq Inc campaign, keep the following concepts in mind.</p>
<h3 id="FamiliarFaces" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="a74590ba-2aec-4b35-9f34-237165105f1b"><a href="#FamiliarFaces" data-content-chunk-id="7b37a601-6cab-46b9-a27b-b3162b4b0f3a"></a>Familiar Faces</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="31e874b7-8576-445a-a4cd-684e2bfe35d4">This campaign provides many NPCs for you to do with as you please. They all have roles to play in the encounters and events of the adventure, but what happens to them after that is up to you. Every NPC could be a potential ally, enemy, or foil later in the campaign. If the players take a shine to one, bring that character back — or better yet, make the NPC an integral part of the ongoing plot. All franchises need servants and hirelings to do mundane jobs, and NPCs the characters already know are a great fit for these roles. Employ these NPCs to make the world feel more familiar and real to the players and characters alike.</p>
<h3 id="RightandWrong" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="a828eb15-2215-495b-8b33-ab40dc1046e3"><a href="#RightandWrong" data-content-chunk-id="1b07c1c2-70c5-4fd8-aad4-f1b4d1628aff"></a>Right and Wrong</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5a2054a2-3c57-4a90-b908-923af72abdec">Even the most heroic heroes sometimes fall short. And in many cases, adventurers aren’t even within longbow range of “virtuous” in their motivations. As such, what the characters fail to do, do poorly, or do wrongly can be just as important as what they accomplish. Don’t let failure and setbacks derail an adventure or a campaign. Rather, look for ways that failure or partial success might lead to new ways to reach a campaign goal.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8e330dfb-46c0-485d-a152-17bf71a2fcd8">You might be absolutely confident that the characters will save those townsfolk and earn their trust, letting you use the townsfolk to reveal an important quest goal. But if the town burns down despite the heroes’ best intentions — or because they had better things to do — let them be mistaken for local authorities come to lend a hand in the aftermath. Or let them be unexpectedly arrested after being mistaken for the evil forces that burned the town down, and given the dangerous quest out of animosity. Humor plays a big part in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so make use of unheroic irony whenever the players and characters provide it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6585ac9e-f9c6-4066-ad25-842887216741">By its most basic nature, a roleplaying game campaign focuses on the actions of the characters. However, it’s important to remember that the world goes on without them. The heroes can’t be everywhere at once. If they establish a base in one town but spend a lot of time away, anything could happen to that base. Hirelings might grow disenchanted in the characters’ service if abused, neglected, or left to their own devices for too long. Ramp up the drama and the humor of a campaign by occasionally focusing on what the characters neglected or left behind.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d14dab9d-aaeb-44e6-b174-8f8aa62db417">An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is like a newborn baby that the characters all had a hand in conceiving, delivering, and raising. It needs constant care and feeding as it grows to its full potential, but there’ll be a lot of risks, drama, and dirty diapers along the way. (Okay, that might be taking the analogy too far, but you get the idea.) Running a franchise can be difficult, but the potential rewards for the characters are tremendous. And for the players, making the franchise the focal point of the campaign provides a joint goal and a shared vessel of creative input.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cace33b9-518b-4313-a56d-7a64347a325f">This adventure touches on a number of classic tropes in its setup and execution. Artifact of incalculable power accidentally stumbled upon? Check. Evil faction with plans to end the world? Got it. But even against potentially world-shattering events and plots, an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is always centered around humble characters making choices — including one unfortunate NPC whose choices have set the adventure in motion.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="63c2b5b3-04a6-4596-a620-eb24a2c742c2">A year ago, a group of adventurers led by a dwarf named Caerhan Coalsmith found a strange object buried in the remains of a ruined tower. The relic appeared to be a golden orrery housing, missing its geared clockwork components. It was obviously a magic item of some kind, but arcane lore wasn’t the party’s strong suit, so the orrery was set aside while Caerhan investigated its provenance and history.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb734f73-34fc-4544-a274-df54dd1e1edd">The dwarf heard a few tales about devices that matched the relic’s description. Though he never learned the full scope of its powers, rumors told of how those powers would increase if a magic orrery’s missing components were collected and placed within it. Unfortunately, Caerhan also never learned about the curse the orrery carried — and his party paid the price.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ce1ff64b-70d9-4f7a-bbab-6404d2debb23">As an artifact, the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="498f6aac-bfba-441e-b631-17a45a752606"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705876-tooltip">Orrery of the Wanderer</a></span> comes with a random major detrimental property (see the “<a title="Artifacts" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts" data-content-chunk-id="c9142fd9-6924-4f1d-afa9-6e85b3ab87a5">Artifacts</a>” section in chapter 7 of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="1728f6c2-5334-48a2-8760-21a711fbdc9c"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i>)</span>. The specifics of that property when the orrery housing was found are left up to you, but whatever it was (compulsion to evil for someone in the party, hostile life force, imprisoned death slaad, yadda yadda), Caerhan returned from a research trip to Candlekeep to find his fellow party members all dead.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="412d29ff-8cbb-47d1-a6ae-c8875b76bae6">Recognizing too late that the orrery housing channeled dark power, the grieving Caerhan decided that the relic must be destroyed. However, its artifact-level magic made it seemingly impervious to harm. More research was undertaken with the help of Caerhan’s goblin sidekick, Gorkoh. In the end, Caerhan concluded that the best place to ensure the orrery’s end was a secret shrine to destruction beneath Waterdeep, rumored to be able to destroy even powerful magic relics. So the pair packed up and headed for the City of Splendors.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="75b6128e-e020-46a9-80c7-195cada593f7">The veteran dwarf adventurer located the underground tunnels leading to the shrine easily enough. He and Gorkoh braved those dangerous passages, but were separated during an encounter with a carrion crawler. Caerhan pressed on. But when he activated the shrine, he caused a minor earthquake that opened a sinkhole in Waterdeep’s Dock Ward, and which cracked walls and sidewalks across the city. In the end, the orrery housing was too strong even for the destructive power of the shrine, and Caerhan died during his heroic attempt to rid the world of the dangerous device. Now, the orrery waits for someone else to take possession of it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="09299cf1-ceb9-4581-8b50-d924579b9a44">As the characters will learn in time, the orrery and its components were intentionally scattered long ago. But the pieces of the orrery maintain a connection, and have been steadily making their way toward each other for years. With one piece permanently held by the orrery’s creator in the Greypeak Mountains, the other components and the orrery housing have ended up scattered across the Sword Coast, falling into the hands of different adventuring groups. One of those groups is the evil faction known as the Six, whose members have become aware of the orrery’s existence — and have a full understanding of its potential for destructive power. That power is described in the orrery write-up in <a title="appendix D" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/orrery-and-components" data-content-chunk-id="8298d186-12ba-4f1d-8603-037d2e6acff9">appendix D</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="053530b1-7310-4ce1-b17a-f249f1ca0ab5">As the characters are drawn into contact with the orrery, they discover that two of the artifact’s components have been claimed by Acquisitions Incorporated franchises that have come under recent attack by unknown foes. The rival faction of Dran Enterprises becomes a prime suspect, with its agents found on the scene for both attacks. And all the while, the shadowy members of the Six pull together a tangled plot to gain control of the orrery to destroy Acquisitions Incorporated — and bring ruin to Faerûn.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9febfef6-e1b5-4855-8ca0-3b11f3f97e2b">As the adventure unfolds, the characters travel hither and yon across the Sword Coast and the North, checking in on some classic adventure locations and exploring a number of brand-new sites.

He might have intercepted the experienced adventurers Omin called for, then sent them off on a secret personal mission on his own behalf. Or he might have accidentally set them on fire when they arrived at Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office. Whatever the case, he needs the players’ group to attempt Omin’s mission, and he’s keen to get them on their way.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7ad6d8ba-b6bf-4f99-947b-eeee5db3f043">Omin’s assignment takes the characters to Dock Ward in Waterdeep, a maze of seedy tenements, rough streets, and even rougher alleyways. If the characters have spent time in the city, they might have heard that much of this ward is set up as safe houses, meeting places, and fronts for a variety of criminal organizations, including the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim. None of these groups are particularly happy right now, since the sinkhole caused by the earthquake opened up smack dab in the middle of their territory. The sinkhole also brought the Waterdeep City Watch to the ward, a move welcomed by no one — least of all the members of the Watch, who must now stand guard over the site until it can be investigated and closed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="43efd157-ad20-40ad-b2af-4dbcb0328409">A character whose background entails knowledge of the ward knows the general layout of its streets and alleys, but finding Jolly’s Lamp Emporium and the abandoned warehouse requires asking for directions at some point. Use the following encounters as a general setup, but you can add additional encounters as the characters make their way through the ward as you see fit.</p>
<h4 id="MapsandPoshuns" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="00280a8a-a922-4849-8dd5-8b4e5a5fe669"><a href="#MapsandPoshuns" data-content-chunk-id="ad78d9bd-9a63-4655-9a27-34fab9c2b892"></a>Maps and Poshuns</h4>

Several pieces of parchment are on display in the stall, with six small ceramic pots placed next to them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6e4dfb5f-9c4c-4f9d-a3cf-08d0b5b227fb">The rapscallion is Jerronimous “Jerr” Burntberry (CN male gnome <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="d3df9cfa-9de5-4fe2-ba2f-314b9cdae4b4"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoner</a></span>) who is quite a bit older than he looks. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check tips the characters off that the adult gnome is disguised to look like a youngster. Jerr hopes to join the Zhentarim one day, but he needs a little more experience. In the meantime, he makes a living by scribbling on pieces of parchment he scrounges from garbage heaps, selling them as maps to unwitting fools searching for places in Dock Ward. He also collects fetid rainwater in small, red clay pots, which leach out just enough color that he can pass the water off as <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="3c8bdc85-ef72-45a0-9979-3070d2de56c8">potions of healing</span>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5409791d-2f86-48ee-aa41-e856bbc04bf2">The potions have a faintly fruity aroma.

Each day, a kindly druid who thinks Jerr is an honest soul gives the gnome a goodberry for his health. Rather than eat the berry, Jerr crushes it up and adds a drop of juice to each pot. Jerr sells maps for 1 gp and the potions for 10 gp. He also tries to sell other useless or counterfeit objects at your discretion.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1e5c0072-3ef8-4ad0-b9ce-5e43aa5df76b">If the adventurers ask Jerr to be a guide, he happily takes the job for 1 gp. He then leads the characters straight into an ambush by a gang working for the Zhentarim (see the “Skeleton Crew” encounter below). A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check is needed to see through the skilled lies of the gnome.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a232561f-1e84-40a4-8a4b-e565faa14484">If you wish, Jerr can become a recurring character in the campaign. He might keep tabs on the characters as they grow famous, showing up in cities where they travel, trying to sell more useless goods, or eventually spying on them for the Zhentarim. Or if paid and treated well, he could become a valuable source of information for the characters when they need someone to infiltrate tough areas.</p>

These thugs need to earn some quick coin, then lay low until the Watch leaves the ward.

No one else is on the street, except a seemingly inebriated halfling who stumbles toward you.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="66c22f56-f028-4c60-af38-0cca3618cf17">The stumbling figure is Otis Adalgrim (NG male halfling <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="a0ae9952-328e-4343-af2c-72859f102cbe"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17021-spy" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17021-tooltip">spy</a></span>). Otis works for the Gray Hands — members of the City Watch or the City Guard invited to join a special security force working directly for Vajra Safahr, the Blackstaff of Waterdeep. The Blackstaff fears that some evil faction might have been involved in the earthquake, and she has tasked Otis with watching the area in disguise to see who comes to investigate.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d698c4bf-ce80-47a3-9bfb-1672dae1b580">Otis pretends to ignore the group, although he makes note of their presence as he staggers by. Any character who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check gets the feeling that the halfling is only acting the part of a drunken passerby. If confronted, Otis does his best to maintain the facade. He moves away from the adventurers as quickly as possible, but he circles back to watch them as they interact with the City Watch and enter the sinkhole fissure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c473b531-948c-4471-98b3-2eae9feb218c">Otis can be used as a wild card later in this episode of the adventure. For example, if the characters are faring poorly during the encounters under the warehouse, the halfling could follow and intervene on their behalf, healing <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a> party members or dragging them away from danger. Later in the campaign, Otis might act as a recurring NPC who crosses paths with the characters while they’re in Waterdeep, making sure they have information they need and don’t run afoul of the law.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c21eaf36-c075-4edc-b19d-6b3f3564c46f">The leader of the trio is Captain Mergen Truff (NG female elf <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="289d78ed-d920-444e-b954-53fb24462871"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17045-veteran" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17045-tooltip">veteran</a></span>), a laconic figure who would rather be doing “real work” than standing here warning off vagrants too foolish to avoid falling into a massive hole in the ground. Her companions are Orvis Torval (N male firbolg <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="7a2bd2a7-6074-4ceb-9c3f-3d5adac8a980"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16915-guard" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16915-tooltip">guard</a></span>) and Rosko Bosh (N male halfling <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="762133dc-494b-4187-b3e3-5ea70671ac9c"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16915-guard" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16915-tooltip">guard</a></span>). Orvis and Rosko are new constables, not the sharpest swords in the armory, and as lazy as wizards who’ve used all their spell slots. Local thieves pay them to look the other way when ordered to do so, which becomes important later in the episode.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6c72a29a-f5cf-42da-9bd2-219bfb0c2b2b">When the characters approach, Captain Truff steps forward, tells them that the area is off-limits, and orders them to move along. When the characters get across the purpose of their presence (most easily by stating that Omin Dran sent them), Truff is clearly relieved, though still not entirely friendly.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d58f9cb4-c458-4f9c-ac8b-dde34c3faf45">To gain access to the warehouse and the sinkhole fissure, the characters must pretend to be the named adventurers. Assume that the City Watch members know the names and reputations of some of the adventurers on the list, but have never met them in person. If a character pretends to be Lord Pompy Fuggelstruck and speaks to the guards, Captain Truff might think it odd that they aren’t speaking with Fuggelstruck’s well-known lisp, or predilection for using rhyming couplets, or what have you. You can let roleplaying determine the outcome, or call for DC 10 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/16-tooltip">Deception</a>) checks for the characters to pass off any outright lies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="65d79721-6eac-4da8-974c-f00d7c6fca00">Captain Truff is eager to get someone — anyone — to investigate the fissure as soon as possible, allowing her to go back to her normal duties. Even if she becomes suspicious that the characters aren’t the adventurers named on the scroll, as long as someone signs as Ozgood, she’s content to allow them to investigate.</p>

The partially collapsed building has been deemed structurally sound, so it shouldn’t fall into the fissure unless someone inside does something foolish, such as knock down a support beam or bang against the remaining walls.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="5f62277c-11ea-42a1-b9a8-3957d6e8add7">The fissure has exposed access to a number of mysterious tunnels beneath the warehouse. It’s not known how long the tunnels have been there, who created them, or what might be lurking within.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="213e142b-57c9-4485-aec3-30c1aa63636c">The contract the characters sign is fulfilled only if they investigate and clear every tunnel the fissure exposed. After they finish, a city surveyor will be assigned to map the area, and an engineer needs to assess the integrity of the tunnels to ensure that no further collapses are imminent. If either professional is injured or killed because of negligence on the part of the adventurers, the party and Acquisitions Incorporated can be held liable.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="57e46991-ded9-48d0-9561-f3a8e66ef083">Two members of the City Watch — Sergeant Ava Teeshe and Constable Yander Boot — descended into the fissure a day earlier to make sure it held nothing dangerous.

<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="190c043b-7bd1-4e39-8792-bc29bf9453ff">Sergeant Teeshe is a tall, strapping female human who has seen her share of scuffles and doesn’t back down from a fight. If something took her out, it must be powerful.</li>

The number of lamps in the so-called Lamp Emporium totals exactly six. From the looks of those wares, it’s not clear that any of the lamps actually work.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="524d65fb-88a1-4331-ba91-207c2dba6628">Stolen coins, valuables, and other black-market goods are stored in a secret room in the back until they are ready to be sold. Guild members use the shop’s other back rooms to hide from the authorities or plan jobs. At the moment, the only person in the building other than Jolly is a Xanathar Guild agent who goes by the moniker Feather (NE female half-elf <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="79cda0a6-247d-4b77-b7f1-11817bb794f5"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16790-assassin" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16790-tooltip">assassin</a></span>).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4a1eb5bf-da5f-400c-9b00-649fa6040ce1">Jolly does his best to get the adventurers out of his shop as quickly as possible.

<p data-content-chunk-id="493d1a42-b091-4591-8888-9be48e09d9a5">When the fissure opened up at the bottom of the sinkhole, it exposed a number of tunnels used for a variety of purposes and by a multitude of people over the years. The first of the tunnels beneath the warehouse were dug as smugglers’ byways. Later, worshipers of That-Which-Endures (see the sidebar in the “<a title="New Race: Verdan" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/player-options#NewRaceVerdan" data-content-chunk-id="f607bff7-b996-499a-b15e-5b7fa068b693">New Race: Verdan</a>” section in chapter 3) excavated chambers beneath the ground to hold clandestine meetings and worship at a secret shrine of destruction. Various thieves’ guilds employed the tunnels to move from place to place secretly. Renegade wizards did terrible experiments there. At one point, part of the Waterdeep sewer system crossed into the tunnel network. Not long after, the subterranean spaces were abandoned.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eb1f5a86-8d18-4b36-a425-aec88d7d9863">As a result of the earthquake, many of the tunnel system’s side passages have been blocked by rubble. The limited zone that is still traversable leads the characters from the fissure to the lost shrine of destruction — and through a number of dangerous areas in between.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="56f82390-c572-4bc6-9a17-405cb7f002f2">Descending into the fissure is easily done by characters using the rope, but requires a successful DC 10 Strength (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/2-tooltip">Athletics</a>) check by anyone climbing down the rough stone walls.

Caerhan and the other members of his adventuring party had spared Gorkoh’s life a few months back when they cleared out a temple to Maglubiyet, the chief of the goblin gods. Caerhan saw potential for the goblin to become a productive member of society, so he became a friend and mentor to Gorkoh, and encouraged him to learn about magic. Caerhan has also encouraged Gorkoh to expand his Common vocabulary, with inconsistent results.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="06a76c5c-14fc-4507-a6d6-9956fe84f94d"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="d83657bc-906e-4f80-be7a-bff0edd8075a">Altar.</span> The altar is made of granite and covered in runes. It accepts offerings by destroying them with the attacks of the entropy guardian, representing the entropic power of That-Which-Endures. However, the ancient altar malfunctioned when Caerhan set the orrery housing on it — or perhaps the orrery channeled its own powerful magic to destroy the altar in self-defense. Either way, that pulse of power caused the earthquake, and saw the entropy guardian slay the unfortunate Caerhan when it took him as a threat to the shrine.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c1096d49-df7b-4cc0-ab0e-7a8aa2e16ea8">A character who touches the altar willingly must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/2-tooltip">charmed</a> by a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures.

If she can be removed from this area, the altar’s power over her ends, and Teeshe comes back to her right mind. If the characters save her, the sergeant offers a <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/71-potion-of-healing" data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/71-tooltip">potion of healing</a>&nbsp;in thanks. She doesn’t remember what happened to her after entering the tunnels with Constable Boot, and is keen to accompany the characters back out.</p>

In its present state, the orrery has been battered by the entropy guardian, though its six-sided form remains intact. Its side plating is mostly missing, but can be collected from the floor nearby. If characters replace any of the shattered side plating, it magically reattaches itself. More oddly, if the characters don’t replace the plating, it begins to regrow, even as the orrery housing magically straightens itself out.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="42e62572-6f2b-4a84-a41c-ad05e053e67d">Within a few days, the orrery housing is a pristine, golden six-sided device with a circular hole in each face. The setup of gears and attachments within the orrery makes it clear that six round components are meant to be placed into the device. Characters will not recall seeing any such devices in the shrine of destruction.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="91e1f8d9-9cd5-4843-ad72-b36847c258ec">With Sergeant Teeshe saved (or with her body in tow and a convenient cover story), the characters can make their way back to the sinkhole. If they left any dangers behind them on their initial pass, those dangers reemerge on the trip back — and will prevent them from fulfilling their contract if not eliminated.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="90aedbfd-9043-49bb-bc35-58903e5e0a07">When the characters climb out of the sinkhole, Captain Truff is waiting for them alone, and is pleased to see them. She’s even more pleased if the characters rescued Sergeant Teeshe. Truff asks the characters to sign an affidavit confirming that they’ve completely investigated and cleared the passages beyond the fissure. If the characters lie about the success of their mission, they risk a fine, imprisonment, or both.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ddcdb077-f625-48b7-97ef-e87a3ef269be">The characters must also agree to have all the goods they found beneath the city inventoried. If anyone later claims to be the rightful owner of any of the loot, a magistrate might rule that the goods belong to the original owner instead of the characters. Who knew adventuring required so much paperwork?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8feabc89-f656-4e7e-9ab0-9c3cdaa98747">While the NPCs and characters are going over their bookkeeping, a group of villains working for the Xanathar Guild tries to take any treasure the party pulled out of the tunnels. The group consists of a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="1a892375-4763-4d58-98df-a9db647e4446"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17035-thug" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17035-tooltip">thug</a></span> called Stork leading three <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="9ffc893c-910a-407a-a6c0-a447e9fe8427"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16798-bandit" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16798-tooltip">bandits</a></span>. Stork believes she has the advantage over the party members, who are probably coming out of the tunnels bruised and bloodied. Plus, she’s already bribed the two City Watch guards, Orvis Torval and Rosko Bosh, to “take a walk,” so neither is on hand during the attack.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="331dd539-1d92-4b8f-a7df-190989db7abc">Captain Truff fights alongside the characters, as do Gorkoh and Sergeant Teeshe if the characters rescued them. Otis Adalgrim might show up too, either during or after the fight.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="09c794bb-9d13-4d34-9267-94c151d4172a">With this first episode completed, the characters attain 2nd level! But even as they get to bask in the warm glow of that achievement, they must return to Acquisitions Incorporated to report. Omin Dran is there to meet with them when they do. If the characters were successful and dealt with Captain Truff in good faith, Omin gives them the promised reward of 400 gp for the group (500 gp minus the Acquisitions Incorporated fee). If the characters were only partly successful, adjust Omin’s reaction and what follows as necessary.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53812a5f-b574-434f-8913-0e8395c55425">Having since learned about the initial mistaken identity when he met the characters, Omin is even more impressed by their success. Or he might be in the mood to demand favors from them if things didn’t go entirely as planned (because that kind of mess makes the whole company look bad). Either way, read:</p>

I can’t say much for your relative inexperience and lack of skill. But it looks as though you’ve got enough moxie to cover for that. And a willingness to do what it takes to get ahead. Those are traits we hold in high regard here at Acquisitions Incorporated.”</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="48a38508-ba4f-4f5d-818c-b51a90274f2b">Omin pulls a map from a satchel and places it on the conference room’s oak table. “You know the town of Phandalin? Just off the Triboar Trail? A few months back, we awarded a group a franchise there. We received word that they were taking control of some ruined estate for their headquarters, and everything seemed to be going well. Only they missed this month’s franchise payment, and their secretarian isn’t answering any calls.”</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="efe367e6-ed5e-45e8-9cbc-61866771587a">Omin snaps his fingers, and a paper, a pen, and an ink pot leap from his satchel. “This note gives you the right to travel to Phandalin and investigate the franchise there on my behalf. If you find the franchise in poor standing or otherwise in distress, I want a full report. And depending on how badly the last group botched things, I might look to you to take over. A failed franchise makes the whole company look bad. I’m sure you understand.”</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="1a160e54-fa03-48e3-9f7c-3be2748d23dc">Omin then levels a hard stare. “I want you to appreciate what an incredible opportunity this is for you.

</blockquote>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8e335ec9-d687-402b-bc57-720a7d81e67d">As before, Omin Dran is a busy CEO, and doesn’t have time for a lot of questions. If the characters discuss finding the mysterious orrery housing, he tells them to make researching the relic part of their mission. With the characters all newly minted, official Acquisitions Incorporated employees, Omin trusts that they’ll know what to do.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="24ca221d-105e-4280-a40a-b89fb54461eb">Once the characters formally establish their franchise at the end of episode 2, downtime activities and franchise tasks will play a bigger role in the adventure. For now, though, encouraging the players to engage in downtime activities before heading off for Phandalin can help them get comfortable with the idea of dedicating nonadventuring time to personal and business development.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b401897-a950-4d0d-ab3e-3c66b754f3c0">A few possible downtime activities are suggested below, but the party’s downtime escapades can include anything that you and the players come up with.</p>
<h4 id="TheOrrery" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="a4168262-1de8-4b04-8b4d-8f66b8e926fb"><a href="#TheOrrery" data-content-chunk-id="549e0e2e-e4d2-4e0b-ac24-e60189d93c9a"></a>The Orrery</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4c94b571-8a3a-467e-a3a3-65c8e4255f78">Learning more about the mysterious orrery could be undertaken as basic research, which might lead later to a more thorough investigation with the scrutineering activity (see “<a title="Franchise Tasks and Downtime" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseTasksandDowntime" data-content-chunk-id="d60a9f01-e7ae-42ba-88ec-94afe71983ad">Franchise Tasks and Downtime</a>” in chapter 2). Whatever approach the characters take, remember that learning the full scope of the orrery’s history, the secrets of its creator, and the range of its powers is the goal of the whole campaign. Whatever small bits of information can be revealed at the outset should hint at even more that remains to be discovered.</p>

Helping her fully heal up and regain the use of her fire breath and sleep breath might require research or a customized use of the recuperating downtime activity (both from the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="27c70f72-735e-426e-8358-b540c5961d74"><i><a title="Player’s Handbook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a></i></span>.) If the characters want to arrange for someone else to watch over the young dragon, finding a suitable guardian might require research. Or the characters might decide to sow positive rumors in the area where the dragon wants to settle (using the <a title="sowing rumors" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#SowingRumors" data-content-chunk-id="253081e0-9f54-4daa-a8b9-8286ffc6c51f">sowing rumors</a> activity from the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="412a8e6d-7ff0-4c7a-a2fa-775a674fc1f5"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i></span>), hoping to get the locals used to the idea.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ee9c1de4-fe04-4982-bd00-7e9c734925df">Characters interested in the strange altar under Waterdeep can undertake research to study its mysterious runes, which can lead to information regarding That-Which-Endures (see the sidebar in the “<a title="New Race: Verdan" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/player-options#NewRaceVerdan" data-content-chunk-id="0b3bdbbe-215d-4bc1-a5d7-57ce0606b281">New Race: Verdan</a>” section in chapter 3.) Gorkoh the goblin might assist with this task if the characters keep him around, as a kind of warm-up for the rules for letting NPCs run franchise tasks (which the characters will gain access to at the end of episode 2).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d8bad8b1-d146-4fab-b1ae-199c3c933689">In the long term, Gorkoh could take the lead in the scrutineering activity to research the shrine, or set up a shady business practice to restore part of the altar’s power and arrange clandestine tours into the caverns by those who want other dangerous relics destroyed. See “<a title="Franchise Tasks and Downtime" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseTasksandDowntime" data-content-chunk-id="a90f117f-0358-4f25-bc8c-d374725b4ee3">Franchise Tasks and Downtime</a>” in chapter 2 for more information on those new activities.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4b335dc2-0f08-4fca-806d-51d4217a81cb">In episode 2, Omin Dran sends the adventurers (now 2nd level) to Phandalin to learn the fate of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise that opened there a few months earlier but has recently gone dark. After overcoming hazards on the road, the characters enter the town. There, they learn that the franchise had signed an agreement to purchase the oft-ruined Tresendar Manor, a small estate on the outskirts of town. However, something catastrophic occurred at the manor recently, and no one in town has seen any of the occupants since.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="532af4b4-2ba2-4fdc-8d32-701ac2f03b04">While in Phandalin, the adventurers have the opportunity to interact with the townsfolk, possibly becoming involved in small-town dramas — including a mayoral election. Those events could have a significant impact on the franchise the characters will establish at the end of this episode.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="667874a2-c764-4912-95fc-6c5bf30ab0d5">At the ruins of Tresendar Manor, the characters find clues about what caused the destruction. They locate one of the two surviving members of the previous franchise, the half-orc majordomo Gildha Duhn. Gildha provides details about the attack and the apparent goal of those who struck the manor — retrieving a mysterious magic clockwork device that the characters recognize as part of the magic orrery found under Waterdeep. Investigating where the attackers slipped into the manor’s basement and dungeon, the characters discover signs of recent rituals tapping into the power of the Far Realm — and take on the monsters the attackers left behind.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d3864cba-209c-4c5e-b75f-33ad13e9c59a">After dealing with the threats in the dungeon, the characters run into operatives from Dran Enterprises who have been sent to take control of the site. With the imminent dangers in and around Phandalin neutralized, the characters are rewarded by Head Office with the license to take over the failed Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. From there, they are set to investigate who was behind the attack on Acq Inc, and what connection the mysterious orrery might have to this new threat.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c6bf80c1-0e96-4ab3-ab15-e2283a57fb88">Although the characters have no way to discover this fact at present, the attack on Tresendar Manor was carried out by operatives working for the Six. That dark cabal of dark individuals wants to bring dark forces into the world — and its members have a specific motive of wanting to destroy Acquisitions Incorporated in the process. However, most of the agents involved in the attack had no idea they were working for the Six. All were hired individually and clandestinely by one of its members — the goblin <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/360031-splugoth-the-returned" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/360031-tooltip">Splugoth the Returned</a>, who made no mention of his identity or allegiance.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0c0de019-1f97-4509-9b9b-eb6bcc3e3d41">The appearance of Dran Enterprises at the end of this episode is meant very much to imply that the organization was involved in the attack — and to distract the characters and the players alike from speculating on what other nefarious operators might be involved. The plots of the Six are revealed over the course of the adventure. More information on the Six, Splugoth, and Dran Enterprises can be found in “<a title="Factions and Rivals" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/player-options#FactionsandRivals" data-content-chunk-id="82b77abe-2ca8-4252-9ed5-15fc7e054ce3">Factions and Rivals</a>” in <a title="chapter 3" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/player-options" data-content-chunk-id="4cecbd4d-37c4-48c2-8d85-0027cebda0ce">chapter 3</a>, and in <a title="appendix B" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/monsters" data-content-chunk-id="59f70dd3-8c6c-4569-ac67-bbd83565d666">appendix B</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5eec137f-21a7-4ffa-81ab-ddbed2d51b70">The trek from Waterdeep to Phandalin requires the adventurers to travel north on the High Road, then head east along the Triboar Trail before taking the track south into town. Walking at a normal pace, it takes about 6 days to travel from Waterdeep to the head of the Triboar Trail, 1 day to hike along the Triboar Trail to the track to Phandalin, then another 4 hours to reach the town.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="093c3241-137e-42f5-bb8a-c055d15ed4fd">This first part of the episode features three encounters covering the journey from Waterdeep to Phandalin, all of which offer connections to the rest of the adventure. If you want your campaign to move at a quick pace, run only these encounters. In doing so, you don’t have to worry about random encounters and setting up details of the journey such as who keeps watch when the characters camp.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5b59b745-7f56-4436-a1bd-c58caf0c45f8">If you prefer to emphasize the dangerous nature of the adventuring life for lower-level characters, random encounters can be used to create additional tension along the road. As characters gain levels and access to diverse powers, random wilderness encounters become less of a threat, so this is a great point in the campaign to use random encounters to challenge the party.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c7f6d9e0-583e-4398-98bb-6a83a84115b1">When using the Random Encounter table below, roll once for travel during the day and once while the characters are resting at night. Or if you see an encounter that tickles your fancy, just run it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="21faad12-d7e4-41c6-a7b2-8b5d2f06f04a">A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check can tell that Rasqel seems unsure about the bite behind his threat. His little operation is off the books, with no sanction from his superiors in the Black Network. The bugbear bodyguards know this fact too, and because of it, they are less than enthusiastic about working for Rasqel.</p>

They obey reluctantly, but if it becomes clear that their lives are in danger at any point, or if the characters offer 10 gp or more to each of them, they walk away and leave their boss to his fate. Rasqel, who is indebted to bad people, fights to the death. If the situation looks grim for the adventurers, Thetsis enters the fray.</p>

<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="dedf26bb-f013-4c8c-883c-50cb516c3a87">The “Free-Market Lizardfolk” encounter is just one of the many business opportunities that mark a long-running Acquisitions Incorporated campaign. Forward-thinking adventurers can make a deal with Thetsis and her tribe that might help them corner the market on <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4715-potion-of-water-breathing" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4715-tooltip">potions of water breathing</a>. The terms of the deal are up to you, but it’s best to start small. Once per month, the lizardfolk can meet the adventurers or their agents to sell them algae. As the characters start to hire franchise staff at the end of this episode, this is a perfect opportunity to set up how staff members can conduct franchise business with no direct involvement from the characters — at least not to start.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="6d13500a-7133-4726-81b5-df8e2e3b7582">These kinds of side ventures can easily expand to become adventures of their own. For example, one of the franchise NPCs handling the algae trade might fail to return from the Mere of Dead Men one day. The characters need to find out what happened if they want to keep employee morale from tanking — and to keep the business relationship with the lizardfolk intact. Choices must be made and consequences faced, which are the hallmarks of a great campaign.</p>

The bandit originally worked a fair deal with Thetsis and her lizardfolk tribe, whose members grow and harvest a nutrient-rich algae that is also a key ingredient for creating <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4715-potion-of-water-breathing" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4715-tooltip">potions of water breathing</a>. After earning the tribe’s trust, Rasqel altered the terms of the deal in stages, starting by offering less money in a “slow market,” then taking the algae with a promise to pay later, saying his cash flow was poor. When the lizardfolk began to balk at this arrangement, Rasqel threatened to send mercenaries to their home deep in the Mere of Dead Men, promising to destroy the tribe unless the lizardfolk worked for free. That threat was the cause of the altercation the characters witnessed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="452f4ebd-1d9c-4263-b3c9-28293404d796">The characters might easily recognize that this situation is a prime business opportunity. If not, suggest that realization to a character with a merchant-related background, or one who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/9-tooltip">Nature</a>) or Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/15-tooltip">Survival</a>) check. Thetsis carries algae that she’s willing to sell for 50 gp, but which is worth 100 gp in Waterdeep. More importantly, any character with herbalist or alchemist experience realizes that the algae can be mixed with other reagents costing 150 gp to make a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4715-potion-of-water-breathing" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4715-tooltip">potion of water breathing</a>.

Known as the Lady of Misfortune, Beshaba is Tymora’s twin sister and archenemy. This character knows that Beshaba sends her favored souls out into the world as a focus for bad luck and calamity, and that dealing with a favored soul of the Lady of Misfortune is a risky situation.

She might target more than one character, especially anyone who worships Tymora. While under the curse, a character has disadvantage on saving throws. The subject knows the curse can be ended with <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="bc55d4af-cfbc-40b4-a156-2d564e734d4a"><a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2229-tooltip">remove curse</a></span> or similar magic, or it can be passed to another person.</p>

If the cursed victim wins, the curse transfers to the new target. If unsuccessful in transferring the curse, the victim takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage. A target who resists the transfer is immune to the curse of Beshaba for one year. Passing the curse on to an innocent person is an evil act.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4207ac92-e9df-42d6-8401-b5d427698032">An NPC victim of the curse has a chance to die of a terminal case of bad luck. For each day that passes, roll a d20 and a d12. If both dice show a 1, the NPC dies in a freak accident. The curse is gone, but if word of the death reaches the character who transferred the curse, the consequences might live on.</p>

Farms and an apple orchard mark the outer edge of town, with houses and shops closer in. Townsfolk are milling about in the central square and on the adjacent green. Two people stand on a stage on the green, addressing the crowd, but the distance to them — along with a steady chorus of cheers, boos, and shouts — obscures what’s being said.</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="0b313aa9-a2b3-430f-ba2f-69963169dbda">Rising from a small hill overlooking the town is an old manor house — or at least it was an old manor house.

However, the recent abdication of one councilor and the town’s growing size have prompted the townsfolk to decide that it’s time to expand the council to five persons, and to incorporate a mayorship to handle increasingly important decisions about Phandalin’s future.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="efa833bf-ec88-4e10-8f42-91de9fcd5803">Two people, both current councilors, are running for mayor. One is Harbin Wester, a male human with the integrity and unctuous personality of&nbsp;… well, a career politician. Wester is a former townmaster, and is running against Sildar Hallwinter, a male human, member of the Lords’ Alliance, and former adventurer. Hallwinter is a circumspect sort who opposes Wester mostly because of the latter’s corruption. For more information on both, see the “<a title="People of Phandalin" href="#PeopleofPhandalin" data-content-chunk-id="3284d704-fd9b-4d98-a68f-f35bb77a2a90">People of Phandalin</a>” section.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b2225013-9bb7-48de-a1f6-1ebdf6057381">Wester is the town’s banker and a major landowner, so some consider his wealth and power to be ample justification for his greedy, conniving nature. More importantly, a number of monstrous and magical incidents in the area over many years have left Phandalin’s citizens anxious for strong-sounding leadership. Even though adventurers solved many of the town’s problems in the past, Wester has gained much popularity by convincing people that the town’s troubles would have never surfaced if those well-armed wandering busybodies hadn’t gotten involved in the first place. The banker has even gone so far as to suggest that adventurers might have orchestrated some of Phandalin’s past woes for their own gain.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a22da73b-2ad7-48d5-89f5-d07badeef9fa">Sildar Hallwinter isn’t a great orator. He spends most of his time refuting Wester’s “unsubstantiated claims.” The retired warrior also points out that Phandalin needs a leader who knows the dangers of the wilderness, even as its people need a mayor unburdened by scandal and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="64e3338e-78ed-4f8a-94b4-4fb988ceeb98">The Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise previously established in Phandalin. When that group arrived in town a few months ago, they spoke with Harbin Wester about acquiring the ruined Tresendar Manor, since the banker held the property’s title. Wester worked out terms with Head Office and the deal was signed. The members of the franchise soon got to work on restoring the manor, frequently coming to town for supplies. When not slipping off to adventure for a few days here and there, most of their time was spent at the manor.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="61dc9b96-2b5a-4a42-8cd0-3c30c125ef30">A number of days ago (the same day the franchise’s payment was due to Head Office), the townsfolk heard explosions from the manor, with a few people reporting seeing gouts of flame and hearing the commotion of a battle. No one was really keen to investigate, wanting to avoid any trouble that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had brought on themselves. (Adventurers, right?) But after a few days passed and no one from the manor came into town, Sildar Hallwinter braved the walk up the hill to investigate.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c2e7c33-551e-4899-af59-aae036bc9c23">Where the manor once stood, he found only rubble, scorch marks, ruined construction, and bloodstains. He failed to discover the single franchisee left alive in the manor, who was <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a> at the time. The townsfolk have given the ruins a wide berth since then, not wanting to risk awakening whatever mad magic delivered the adventurers of the Golden Mongoose to their final fate.</p>

Quickly realizing the potential power in the component and the orrery it was a part of, they began to scour the Sword Coast for information regarding the artifact. A month ago, their intelligence-gathering resources turned up word that two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises — including the newly minted Phandalin franchise — had been scrutineering for lore about mysterious magic clockwork devices. Wanting to determine what Acquisitions Incorporated might know about the orrery, the leaders of the Six put a plan into motion. (The second franchise was based on the Sword Coast between Neverwinter and Luskan. Its fate will be discovered by the characters in <a title="episode 3" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/darkness-at-the-lighthouse" data-content-chunk-id="451cbadd-fdb0-4477-9f68-300477682eba">episode 3</a>.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7253dc1b-5fb7-483b-9f2b-2e3dddc2f3a8">The Six set up an agent in Phandalin — Ditch Fundi, who first raised and now runs Phandalin’s new Temple of the Coin Maiden. Using Ditch’s intelligence on the activities of the Company of the Golden Mongoose, the Six confirmed that the franchise held an orrery component called the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="02a0979d-3f5e-4f43-89fe-d4eb358f0a88"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705948-timepiece-of-travel" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705948-tooltip">timepiece of travel</a></span> — and that Acq Inc head office was so far in the dark about their discovery. So the Six hired a number of agents — including archmage Hoobur Gran’Shoop — to attack both franchises.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eb0df5dc-9e58-475a-a504-1474fd855c30">Hoobur’s forces snuck into Phandalin and razed Tresendar Manor to the ground. However, the Six operatives were unable to find the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="8a4e7dcd-0331-4bb6-8b52-18d949d58e65"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705948-timepiece-of-travel" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705948-tooltip">timepiece of travel</a></span>. Knowing that one of the franchisees had teleported away from the fight, the agents assumed that the orrery component was gone. Unknown to them, the timepiece stayed behind, and remains in the possession of the survivor still buried alive in the rubble.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ab82b218-247f-48b4-bc7d-73232cbfea45">Only two of the townsfolk have any information regarding the attack on Tresendar Manor. Ditch Fundi, a charlatan priest of Waukeen and agent of the Six, was installed in Phandalin a month ago to watch the franchise’s activities and set up the attack. At the same time, Sister Garaele of Tymora works for Dran Enterprises, and has previously fed much information on the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose to her bosses. She knows no details of the attack, assuming that the Golden Mongoose adventurers either blew themselves up or summoned a monster they couldn’t control. But she knows that Dran Enterprises is sending a team to clean up the mess and claim the manor. For more on these two, see the “People of Phandalin” section.</p>

Brawn came very late to the Redbrands’ operation, and thus did only a little intimidation work with the locals before adventurers defeated the bandits and cleared their hideout in the dungeon of Tresendar Manor. He served a sentence on a work gang for his involvement with the bandits, but his affable personality won over many in town by the time of his release. He thus stayed on in Phandalin, where he works doing odd jobs and keeping a close eye on local goings-on.</p>

He is the wealthiest citizen in Phandalin, owning much of the land, many of the businesses, and a good portion of the wealth in the local area.

However, he is more than capable of stabbing people in the back while keeping a fake grin on his face.

Once they arrived, the dwarf found no mining work to be had, and the jobs they’ve taken to make ends meet were terribly boring.

If the characters set up a franchise in Phandalin, she offers to be their roving representative, procuring goods and services from wherever the characters want to send her. Minghee has a great mind for numbers and a strong head for business, but if the characters take her into their franchise, she becomes restless if denied a regular chance to travel. In the long term, Minghee has the drive and instinct to pick up spellcasting (and use a new stat block of your choice) if any spellcasting character takes the time to mentor her.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="585da5b7-a41d-40dc-94d3-073687a373ef">If the characters take Minghee into their employ, Linene is heartbroken at first, but she soon sees the value in having her daughter working for an up-and-coming franchise. Opportunities might arise for the franchise to enter into an ongoing business arrangement with the Lionshield Coster — which might in turn raise the ire of Sharna Quirstiron at the Miner’s Exchange (see below) if the coster’s success threatens Sharna’s own plans for economic domination.</p>

She took over that position after the former overseer (and third member of the town council) Halia Thornton left Phandalin “to seek other opportunities.” All the locals know that continual problems at nearby mines made Halia’s job difficult, with little to no wealth coming into the exchange for months at a time. Unfortunately for Halia, the downturn in the mining industry was the least of her worries. The Manshoon sect of the Zhentarim saw an opportunity in Phandalin and had Halia killed. Sharna (LE female dwarf <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="30b6691a-00c9-4ce2-84b0-a02f560e247f"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16799-bandit-captain" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16799-tooltip">bandit captain</a></span>) is the sect’s agent.

She has the economic interests of Phandalin at heart, but only because she hopes to have a prosperous town at her mercy when the needs of the Zhentarim become her focus. She ingratiates herself to the characters, hiring them to clear out monsters in the local area that threaten mining interests. She offers to partner up on business deals, sharing the profits of the mines if the characters invest their time or money in such operations. If the characters end up on the wrong side of Harbin Wester, she sides with them against the banker, concealing her goal of usurping his wealth and power. She encourages the characters to actively oppose Wester — or even to kill him if she thinks they might be amenable to the idea.</p>

Some years ago, he worked in the employ of the Rockseeker family, who had hoped to reopen mines in the hills and mountains surrounding Phandalin. After nearly being killed in a goblin ambush while traveling to Phandalin for the first time, Sildar’s faith in himself was shaken. The Rockseeker family moved on after their troubled dealings in the town, but Sildar stuck around.</p>

He was one of the town’s three councilors prior to (as he puts it), “Halia Thornton leaving without even saying goodbye.” By running for mayor against Harbin Wester, Sildar hopes to help Phandalin increase its prosperity — and to put that prosperity into everyone’s pockets, not just Wester’s. What he lacks in charisma, he makes up for in sincerity.</p>

As such, his goals are to bring stability and wealth to the region. He is brave and honest, but nearly losing his life years before caused him to doubt not only his martial skills but also his decision making. He could prove to be a valuable ally to the characters, especially if he’s elected mayor. However, he might also frustrate them with his passivity and indecisiveness — or allow them to take advantage of those same qualities to wield great influence over him.</p>

One of those levels is the business aspects of the characters’ lives, with satire another obvious side of the campaign. But politics can be another driving force in an Acq Inc story, as can the satirical treatment of people in power.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="a3b4decf-3f05-4098-81a6-ff578b0fab39">The political maneuverings taking place in Phandalin will inevitably have an impact on the characters and their franchise. Still, if the players aren’t interested in the political aspect of the campaign story, don’t worry about it. Wester is elected mayor, the players can play nice with him to get what they want, and the story moves forward. But if the characters care about who becomes mayor, they have plenty of opportunity to influence the outcome.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="21694ee9-dc2d-4165-ad87-8888098a1832">Sildar Hallwinter cares about the good of the town but is wishy-washy. His lack of charisma hurts his chances for election. But a clever group of adventurers working behind the scenes might be just what Hallwinter needs to energize his campaign. On the other hand, Harbin Wester controls much of the wealth in Phandalin, including Tresendar Manor. As such, helping Wester get elected — or at least not being too obvious about opposing him — can put the characters on his good side. Even if Wester loses the election, his power and wealth mean that the characters will be interacting with him — and dealing with his ability to make their lives easier or harder — whether they want to or not.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="793bd27d-8751-4f0b-8a83-280680ad59f6">Another possibility is that one of the characters could run for office as a last-minute wild-card candidate. A stranger wandering into Phandalin is unlikely to gain the trust of enough citizens to win the race, and the need to stick around town and run things will eventually get in the way of the characters venturing all over the North being heroic. But don’t discount the narrative possibilities involved in the characters embracing the political side of the story even more wholeheartedly than you expect them to.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b861d844-a68d-4644-a947-552c2cbcacc7">Sister Garaele (CG female elf <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="cac986f1-1f3a-4384-b114-4cd49dff6682"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16985-priest" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16985-tooltip">priest</a></span>) was a zealous and enthusiastic servant in Phandalin’s Shrine of Luck before Ditch Fundi, “the competition,” arrived in town a month ago. Now, she is downright frenetic. She proselytizes for Tymora in the streets, in taverns, and in people’s homes. Garaele is well known for haranguing the folk of Phandalin, claiming that the misfortune of previous years has been due to a lack of devotion to Tymora. Despite this, most locals like the priest, and are likely to help her if she’s in trouble.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4e044e95-d9f2-40c1-8daf-61b670a42da7"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="103fc9ba-1cc7-4e89-8049-55505fdb70e1">Development.</span> Garaele was once an agent of the Harpers, though she has recently broken ties with that group of agents opposing the abuse of power. Since then, she has taken significant donations from Dran Enterprises, whose agents asked her to keep an eye on the members of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose and any other Acquisitions Incorporated operatives in Phandalin. Garaele is happy to pass this information along in exchange for Dran Enterprises’ payments to the temple, and she asks no questions about that organization’s long-term goals for the town. She is a good person, however, so she won’t knowingly allow harm to befall others. She is helpful to anyone willing to offer wealth, goods, or services to her shrine.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2d162429-06bf-4a32-814a-3d99dd4c8005">Though not exactly people and no longer in Phandalin, a neutral <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="167a9acc-daf0-43c1-b18e-5310f1ed8c8f"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogre</a></span> named Stuuzant is another potential source of information for the characters. She was one of the operatives used by the Six in the attack on Tresendar Manor, smashing her way through the site’s walls. When the attack was over, the ogre wandered away. However, she decided to stick around the area to enjoy her proximity to lots of tasty livestock, even as she keeps her distance from anyone who might pester her.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ce33b28b-8575-422d-ab80-9d6cf8ffdfe0">In the days since the destruction of the manor, farmers and herders on the outskirts of Phandalin have reported seeing giant-sized footprints, both humanoid and canine, as well as missing animals. No one has spotted Stuuzant, as the ogre has good instincts for avoiding trouble. She keeps moving, hiding until the time is right to strike. When she attacks livestock, she does so when no one can see her, and she takes only what she needs to survive.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3cfa9410-17a0-43a0-9853-4fc80dcaabae"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="24dd7983-a54e-418f-932b-a3958600ecce">Development.</span> Characters might be asked to look into the missing livestock, or they can do so on their own to get on the good side of the locals. Investigating the disappearances might be used to angle for something the characters want or need, such as supplies, a lower price on Tresendar Manor, citizens favoring one mayoral candidate over another, or whatever else you can think of.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="28de7517-8827-4eb2-bbfa-53d171d41867">Tracking down and defeating Stuuzant is no easy task, however. She is friends with a pair of <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16841-dire-wolf" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16841-tooltip">dire wolves</a>, and is mostly successful at covering her tracks after her raids. The ogre also has yet to establish a den in the area, so she rarely stays in one place for more than a day.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="00659f8f-3930-49c2-83f7-9e7ad770ce06">If the characters locate her, Stuuzant speaks Common quite well, uses smarter tactics than a typical ogre, and tries to bargain with the characters if it looks like they might defeat her. If questioned, she tells the story of being hired to attack the manor. A goblin in hooded robes paid her to help break into the estate and smash everything in sight. Stuuzant never saw the goblin’s face, and knows nothing about the Six (which was never mentioned to her or any of the other hirelings).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="803f48cf-5ad7-4444-8640-5e4230aae35b">Savvy characters might convince Stuuzant to take a position in their franchise, with the ogre making a great sentry or bodyguard. However, the townspeople might need assurances to accept such a creature living so close to their town.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="208e443e-9d1b-492c-8ae3-5027479cd8a1">As they explore Phandalin — and eventually set up their franchise in the town — the characters can engage with many of the town’s businesses, whether as patrons or potential partners. The most prominent of the town’s locations (as well as a few additional NPCs) are detailed in this section. You can come up with details for additional locations and NPCs based on the needs and desires of your players.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="40449793-ac97-4cea-af8e-cba0ab6ef7fc">The apple trees of Edermath Orchard surround a small group of buildings on the edge of town. The smell of fruit is strong around the orchard year round, with the apples grown and picked here processed throughout the winter into juice, cider, and other products.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1329ad7f-f79d-4966-998f-7f629e9a39f0">Daran Edermath (NG male elf <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="42a8133c-46d9-4097-b05b-c622800cd1e2"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17007-scout" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17007-tooltip">scout</a></span>) established the orchard many years before. A former adventurer and one of the oldest people in Phandalin, he remains aloof from town politics and focuses his interest on the traveling merchants and food-related businesses in Phandalin that buy his wares. Daran employs down-and-out miners to do odd jobs and help during harvest, so he’s popular among the town’s working folk.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1faebe1d-ddf2-4163-865a-9499ef843da0"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="3de71b07-f69f-4d1b-9a85-f076a17469c6">Development.</span> Daran’s half-elf daughter Bertice went missing the day before the destruction at Tresendar Manor, and he is beginning to fear for her. Most folk in town know that Bertice recently took up with a human miner named Grovet, who is also missing. If the characters met the couple on the road (see the “<a title="Random Encounters" href="#RandomEncounters" data-content-chunk-id="9d0e1506-6a48-4346-8b8c-c8ca23269c0e">Random Encounters</a>” table earlier in this episode), they can allay at least some of Daran’s fears for his daughter’s safety.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b58c18dd-07bb-4dec-a13f-81c67c0ef1d1">Earning Daran’s full trust is a long-term proposition, and the characters must prove themselves beyond reproach in any dealings with the orchardist. If they do, however, the elf proves a valuable ally. He has more resources and power in town than his humble orchard might suggest. And as a member of the Order of the Gauntlet — an association of vigilant adventurers that seeks to overthrow evil — Edermath has the ear of powerful people up and down the Sword Coast.</p>

Mother to Minghee (see “<a title="People of Phandalin" href="#PeopleofPhandalin" data-content-chunk-id="46fa339b-24f6-42e7-a591-38abd468962a">People of Phandalin</a>” above), Linene works tirelessly to keep the coster operational through good times and bad.</p>

A two-story building, the exchange bears a newly painted sign depicting two crossed pickaxes above a lump of gold. The first story is where business is conducted, while the second story contains living quarters.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="26a0836a-f465-4aa9-9368-99737b14bf9f">Until a month ago, this temple to Tymora was the only shrine in town. With the Temple of the Coinmaiden (see below) newly established, Sister Garaele, the local priestess, works harder each day to keep the attention of the faithful of Phandalin. See “<a title="People of Phandalin" href="#PeopleofPhandalin" data-content-chunk-id="8c043279-c20d-4616-9e58-d545ce9e8343">People of Phandalin</a>” for more information on Sister Garaele.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="80932dff-ae4e-461d-8004-2ab3ce803ef3">This single-story tavern’s better days have seen better days. Its weathered sign probably depicts a prone giant, but whatever paint or carvings once adorned the sign have been all but worn away. Inside, the place shows the same lack of care. It’s dirty, ill kept, and in need of a thorough cleaning. Or burning.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d4000122-20ee-4706-91e5-34b6207373d0">The place is normally occupied by dwarf and human miners, either back from a stretch in the mines or waiting for a mine to reopen. They are not overtly hostile unless provoked, but it doesn’t take much to provoke this unhappy lot. The owner and barkeep is Grista Kettlecopp (N female dwarf <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="73aac3e2-ed1e-48c8-8eeb-59ec5aa7fcd8"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoner</a></span>). Surly to the point of rudeness, she tries to run her business her own way and stay out of the political and personal affairs of other townsfolk.</p>

Currently, Sharna at the Miner’s Exchange has their trust (see “<a title="People of Phandalin" href="#PeopleofPhandalin" data-content-chunk-id="114ecc0d-775b-4499-b80f-1fd793bd7c1d">People of Phandalin</a>”), mostly for her assurances that the mines will soon be more prosperous than ever. If Sharna discovers that the characters are interfering with her and the Zhentarim’s plans, she need only tell the miners that the characters are standing in the way of their gainful employment to inspire them to use their pickaxes for something other than mining. On the other hand, characters who earn the miners’ good will can end up with numerous allies in Phandalin.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6de1a57b-a4bc-4962-ad52-5a0122fbe658">The Stonehill Inn is one of the largest buildings in town. The business is run by Trilena and Toblen Stonehill, assisted by their twelve-year-old son, Pip. (All are human <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="2aca779b-7c1e-4548-a0bc-0bf7ff0a71ff"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoners</a></span>.) The Stonehills have comfortably weathered the changeable times in Phandalin since building the inn more than five years ago. The six-bedroom complex is tidy and clean, the table fare is good, and the company is pleasant.</p>

Although they own and operate their business, they owe a small amount of money to Harbin Wester. The banker wants to take their business, and he keeps an eye out for any opportunity to gain the necessary leverage. He might use the characters to lean on the Stonehills if they end up owing him favors. Alternatively, if the characters befriend the Stonehills, they might become staunch allies in the family’s attempts to keep Wester’s hands off their business.</p>

<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="78229769-49e3-433f-95ad-d5f6a7538ebe">Many fantasy campaigns either ignore questions of law or utilize benevolent authoritarian figures to oversee social and economic justice — the wise monarch, the enlightened town council, the Masked Lords, and so forth. This method means that the law is stable. Higher authorities can be consulted on matters requiring arbitration, with concrete edicts handed down to make the line between right and wrong — in a civil sense, at least — crystal clear.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="00e9f112-d7d6-45ff-a8c1-39a2ceca5fe3">In Phandalin (as with many of the other locations in this adventure), the situation is not that simple. No king or council owns the lands of or around the town. Eminent domain is neither implied nor accepted. In most of the smaller settlements along the Sword Coast, the person with power is the individual who takes and holds that power. Locales still have authorities and laws, but the person who can kill everyone else — or pay someone to do so — is the one who truly rules.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="4e2f269d-97c4-4640-be4a-73d72c35b475">In Phandalin, Harbin Wester is that person. Even if he loses the mayoral election, his monetary resources far outstrip those of anyone else in the town, leaving him in a position of strong economic control. However, part of Wester’s power derives from subtlety. He is wary enough to watch out for anyone with the ability to effectively oppose him, and savvy enough to make sure that such people never have any reason to oppose him. As such, when the characters clean out Tresendar Manor and attempt to use it as the base for their new franchise, a potential for social and economic conflict arises.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="e473b7f1-f706-43a6-920c-a778ede5ded7">Wester holds the mortgage on the manor. The legal entity that was the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the signatory to that mortgage, and unfortunately for Acquisitions Incorporated, the mortgage is now in arrears. The characters can work a deal to take over those payments, but the terms are steep. Fortunately, after the manor is cleared, Head Office is willing to negotiate for the manor’s deed. (See the “<a title="Conclusion" href="#Conclusion" data-content-chunk-id="bbc3215c-f674-4f31-8e65-fb035e7a9b25">Conclusion</a>” section of this episode for more information.) This leaves Harbin Wester bitter, as he recognizes that having the favor of Acq Inc backing them up gives the characters more potential power in Phandalin than he likes.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="53c4a341-378e-47d3-98cc-9f732c1ecac6">As the rest of the campaign plays out, keep track of how Wester might try to take advantage of the characters and their deal. What if operatives of Dran Enterprises or representatives of the Six come to him? More importantly, if the characters directly oppose Wester and bring him low, what happens if a worse power steps in to take his place? The options are limitless.

<p data-content-chunk-id="5bdb02f2-0820-4738-b04a-edd0e7fd7ddd">Half a year past, another general store in Phandalin called Barthen’s Provisions went out of business. The building was purchased a month ago for the church of Waukeen by an unknown benefactor, and quickly renovated with all the fineries necessary to draw the attention of the goddess of wealth. The gnome Ditch Fundi oversaw the temple’s construction and dedication, and she now runs it in Waukeen’s name. (In truth, the benefactor who built the temple is the Six, and Ditch Fundi is their agent. See her entry in “<a title="People of Phandalin" href="#PeopleofPhandalin" data-content-chunk-id="309081b4-a70e-4e03-8fce-c9751d314ed2">People of Phandalin</a>” for more information.)</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="86a6b045-fd2d-48bb-a81e-e0b4a8413003">This one-story hall is the closest thing the people of Phandalin have to a government building. Long used as the town council’s meeting room and the townmaster’s hall before that, it is set to be expanded to include the new mayor’s office after the election. As the two remaining members of the town council, Sildar Hallwinter and Harbin Wester currently share office space here.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="aef126f3-e50b-42fe-9514-338cb2c9b765">After the characters have met some of the locals and heard what’s known about the events at Tresendar Manor and the disappearance of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose, they can investigate the fallen manor and the dungeons beneath it. Once a small but elegant estate, the ruined building sits upon a hill overlooking Phandalin. Years of neglect had already done considerable damage to the structure, only some of which the Golden Mongoose adventurers had restored. But the recent attacks undid all that work, pulling most of the above-ground structure down.</p>

The orrery and its six components are presented in <a title="appendix D" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/orrery-and-components" data-content-chunk-id="b44b20ae-3838-47f6-85d0-0e2223fd5e4b">appendix D</a>, and the powers of these relics are significant.

<p data-content-chunk-id="57b18217-47a0-4e7c-8e38-ad20b1967d33">During the attack, Gildha saw one of the Golden Mongoose adventurers — a female tiefling paladin occultant named Talanatha Three-Coins — activate the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="5d7424b1-be04-4233-b036-6b71b0430c2d"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705948-timepiece-of-travel" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705948-tooltip">timepiece of travel</a></span> and teleport away.

She knows that the manor features subterranean areas more extensive than the cellar, but the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had yet to do a thorough search of those areas. (As a result, Gildha doesn’t know about the secret door that leads to the dungeon.)</p>

A creature drinking this tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the disease. Symptoms strike when a victim starts a long rest or next becomes excited, as during combat. A victim suffers severe cramps, and their bowels make sounds like two ghouls fighting. When the symptoms first strike, the victim takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage. In addition, a diseased victim regains no hit points or Hit Dice from nonmagical sources, including resting or spending Hit Dice. A victim who finishes a long rest can attempt a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the victim shakes off the disease. Failure deals the character another 5 (2d4) necrotic damage.</p>

Whenever an Acq Inc franchise fails, Dran Enterprises swoops in to make a hostile takeover of the assets and expand its own operations. The Phandalin franchise is no exception. As soon as Sister Garaele saw the trouble at Tresendar Manor, the priest of Tymora let Dran Enterprises know. Dran Enterprises then dispatched a crew of hobgoblins to evaluate the area, clean up, and take control of Tresendar Manor as quickly as possible. When the adventurers leave the dungeon for the final time, they see that cleanup crew in any area close to the entrance.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4d4366ae-8c51-423a-9d1c-36050395bf28">With their adventures in Phandalin complete, the characters attain 3rd level! More importantly, after clearing the ruins and dungeon of Tresendar Manor, they are able to officially launch their own Acquisitions Incorporated franchise! The characters need to send a message to <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/359278-omin-dran" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/359278-tooltip">Omin Dran</a> to report their findings. Not long after, Omin contacts them using magic, congratulating them on their success, telling them to rest up, and informing them that a representative of Acquisitions Incorporated will arrive soon to deliver paperwork and any other information a new franchise needs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="49ce696c-2c24-4bfe-8465-f43d4791f51d">Sure enough, well-known Acquisitions Incorporated operative Viari (see <a title="appendix A" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/acq-inc" data-content-chunk-id="330ba120-0e04-4ca6-af16-784e26f19266">appendix A</a>) arrives the next day to deliver the documents and supplies, and to officially christen the new Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. He has each of the characters sign a contract crammed full of legalese and double-talk. Any character who reads the document and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check can decipher the jargon to learn the following, or Viari can explain the highlights:</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="48ea4f78-6a85-4358-8716-cc62e5769066">One of the franchise’s first hires might be right in front of them already. <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/360921-gildha-duhn" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/360921-tooltip">Gildha Duhn</a>, former majordomo for the Company of the Golden Mongoose, is grieving her lost employers and anxious to put her life back together. With previous experience running a franchise (and no fault in that franchise’s destruction), she makes an excellent choice for majordomo, and suggests that role for herself if the characters don’t ask her. The remaining episodes in this adventure assume that the characters selected Gildha Duhn as their franchise’s majordomo. If they chose another NPC to fill that role, simply adjust the text throughout the adventure accordingly.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9b97ad09-b027-47d0-a844-941544a22b7d">With the contract signed, the ruins of Tresendar Manor become the franchise’s starter headquarters! One of the benefits of Head Office negotiating with Harbin Wester for the lease to the manor is that the company can drive a much harder bargain than the characters would ever be able to strike. This beneficial deal might have hidden downsides, though, as the thin profit margins of the lease become a point of ongoing conflict between the characters and the corrupt banker.</p>
<h4 id="CompanyPositions" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="3b216b2f-72d6-4db2-b7ab-e8c56cef96b2"><a href="#CompanyPositions" data-content-chunk-id="eb400aaf-c0e2-4c97-b41f-c5b28a919f8e"></a>Company Positions</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a395f051-d421-44b9-93fe-e237257b97ad">At the signing of the franchise agreement, each character picks one of the positions detailed in “<a title="Company Positions" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise#CompanyPositions" data-content-chunk-id="533b1cd0-df44-4bf6-8cf5-30ab95154715">Company Positions</a>” in chapter 2. When they do so, Viari hands out any special position gear and instructs the characters in how best to fulfill their roles. Chapter 2 has more details on these positions, the benefits they confer, and what they mean to the franchise. Hopefully, the players have already considered what positions are the best fit for their characters and for the franchise as a whole, but if not, give them time. Make sure it’s clear what each position entails and what franchise duties a character with a given position is expected to perform.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="068bbcb8-7096-4c04-9e60-bbc12fb2aaaa">In addition to the characters’ positions, the franchise majordomo can also select a company position if desired. This is especially useful if there’s a key position that none of the players wants to take, or if the party size is small.</p>
<h2 id="FranchiseDowntime" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="7fccc8a0-1289-432a-a8c5-d194e04137d9"><a href="#FranchiseDowntime" data-content-chunk-id="00478164-1e4b-4b66-a47a-bccd332efb38"></a>Franchise Downtime</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b61be485-ad21-418e-8630-6b72bcf7bb84">The process of rebuilding Tresendar Manor will take some time, and as proud franchise owners, the characters need to be around to pitch in and make sure nothing goes awry. At the same time, their newly awarded territory is ripe for exploration and interaction with potential customers and business partners. As the characters take stock of their situation, they can engage in downtime activities and undertake some of the franchise tasks that operate alongside the downtime rules.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d07cfd3-3696-419a-a9e7-7420ecbdfcc6">All the activities mentioned in this section are introduced or talked about in the “<a title="Franchise Tasks and Downtime" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseTasksandDowntime" data-content-chunk-id="dcbcf71f-8cb7-4e6d-ade5-5a3e0e82ca59">Franchise Tasks and Downtime</a>” section in chapter 2. That section notes which books existing activities can be found in.</p>
<h4 id="NewBusiness" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="b95d4f4a-4d54-4bbb-8780-20ec360c6a42"><a href="#NewBusiness" data-content-chunk-id="c2783f30-3167-47b7-a80f-51bd64a91f89"></a>New Business</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e6c44b72-763a-4085-8c9e-1a9739258e69">As the characters spend time establishing their new commercial home turf, the explore territory downtime activity can yield up all kinds of new opportunities and connections. Interesting NPCs might be revealed on a walkabout in the woods around Phandalin, or the characters might locate stands of prime timber or abandoned mines still holding valuable ore. Such resources can become part of the franchise’s ongoing revenue stream.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ae54068-d2b0-4730-af14-a6e36717c398">Commercial connections forged with NPCs could also be formalized and refined. The lizardfolk of the Mere of Dead Men and the Splintfig sisters are just two of the potential business partnerships from this episode, whether the characters engage those NPCs themselves or allocate members of their brand-new staff for those tasks.</p>
<h4 id="ThinkingLocally" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f5e5e676-218a-4765-8d3a-6a1f07149671"><a href="#ThinkingLocally" data-content-chunk-id="e0206c67-2239-4aa3-98a2-775e3225ad8c"></a>Thinking Locally</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2496cd1a-c7dd-41dd-b30a-5bb2bb036b16">In Phandalin, the characters might use the marketeering activity to set up a partnership with Linene Graywind at the Lionshield Coster, or with Sharna Quirstiron of the Phandalin Miner’s Exchange — whether they know Sharna’s true allegiances or not. Depending on how well the characters are getting along with Harbin Wester, the shady business practice activity might let them get more dirt on the banker, or gain his favor by going after some of his rivals.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1e502bd3-2d95-456d-b116-a33f136bd181">Shady business practices might be an even bigger part of the characters’ plans for their franchise. Any number of dodgy NPCs in town might be interested in partnering with characters who want to skirt the law. Smuggling ore without paying taxes, skimming from the coffers of either temple, running illegal gambling at the Sleeping Giant — any of these activities could net a nice profit with relatively limited risk.</p>
<h4 id="StayingontheGoodSide" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="c3d7d120-1811-4673-a5e9-930f163d7fd7"><a href="#StayingontheGoodSide" data-content-chunk-id="74ec71fa-04f2-4236-91c2-fa2034a72add"></a>Staying on the Good Side</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5904cf40-2e02-41a8-9ad8-011706a936a3">If the characters have nobler aspirations for their franchise — or if they’re savvy enough to want to hide their franchise’s ignoble aspirations from the get-go — a philanthropic enterprise can go a long way toward shoring up the party’s reputation. A franchise could work to support the existing charity efforts of either of the local temples, or the characters could create their own fund for out-of-work miners. Doing so makes acquiring ongoing concessions or information from townsfolk much easier, but puts the characters in the bad graces of Sharna Quirstiron at the Miner’s Exchange.</p>
<h4 id="LeadstotheLighthouse" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="7ab13e03-8812-4855-a881-bab008114610"><a href="#LeadstotheLighthouse" data-content-chunk-id="8f68d23a-8b79-4320-8744-441a96c61676"></a>Leads to the Lighthouse</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="80b69f8f-1f14-4edb-aaf4-ba2ac477a135">Even as the characters are setting up their new franchise, you’ll want to work in hooks to lead them to the next stage in the adventure. Based on what they’ve learned during this episode, the characters are aware that the only other survivor of the attack on the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the tiefling paladin occultant Talanatha Three-Coins. Clearly the best source of information regarding the attack on the manor, Talanatha used the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="0f9ff6e1-c6e8-4cc9-8a24-e53e6d25a917"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705948-timepiece-of-travel" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705948-tooltip">timepiece of travel</a></span> to teleport away, but no one knows where she went.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb1a8684-be00-40b8-b715-8ef74371ebd1">Many of the locals had interactions with Talanatha in the three months that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was around Phandalin, and characters can use the schmoozing or carousing downtime activities to learn more about the tiefling. In particular, a number of the regulars at the Sleeping Giant remember drinking with Talanatha. She often grumbled about whether the Company of the Golden Mongoose was the best fit for her, and talked about a good friend named Wizzy who worked for another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. The details on Wizzy’s franchise are vague, but Talanatha spoke of her friend having “an awesome headquarters up the coast.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a3b86c2d-2635-4460-a1a7-f3be9e6d0a3d">Characters can also spend downtime investigating the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="5c966eb3-ee34-4f2b-9278-7a35483db545"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705876-tooltip">Orrery of the Wanderer</a></span> and the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="9f417fd2-65ce-4a3d-a7a6-415a005f5dae"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705948-timepiece-of-travel" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705948-tooltip">timepiece of travel</a></span>, using either the scrutineering or research activities. In addition to revealing more details of the orrery as you see fit (see <a title="appendix D" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/orrery-and-components" data-content-chunk-id="5c54e1a9-3252-4841-91f1-cbff0ce1dd3f">appendix D</a>), such investigation could reveal that the last place the timepiece teleported someone to was a location on the Sea of Swords, north of Neverwinter but south of Luskan. Scrutineering or inquiries through Head Office turns up information on an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise based in that area — the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, which has its headquarters in an old lighthouse along a stretch of coast known locally as Silent Sound.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fbdcca78-6b26-468d-ad75-d4ecbdec1faf">Whatever clues the characters obtain regarding Talanatha’s likely destination, have those hints play out over the full length of the downtime rather than rushing to advance to the next episode. The players should get used to how big a part downtime and franchise activities play in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.</p>
<h2 id="ContinuingtheAdventure" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="b3f8f963-5450-4069-9884-a68097f9eb89"><a href="#ContinuingtheAdventure" data-content-chunk-id="72124318-2dd7-4664-9567-d774f6cf26bb"></a>Continuing the Adventure</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e59e5b3e-210e-459d-8626-12ef62776757">Before the next phase of the adventure, make sure the characters have their franchise and business affairs in order. They should know who their franchise employees are, giving those staff members detailed instructions about what to do while the characters are away. This sort of planning is a common theme in any Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so establish this precedent early.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="545ccf0f-a1f9-44b5-a83d-1dce4f764b12">Speculating that Talanatha Three-Coins might have fled to the Silent Sound lighthouse headquarters of another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, the characters might attempt to make contact with that franchise, either on their own or through Head Office. However, any such attempts yield no response. At some point, Omin Dran contacts the characters if they don’t contact him first. He’s worried about what the lack of contact with the Order of the Stout Half-Pint might mean, and he wants the characters to investigate.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ffd8988e-c45c-4f79-b0d4-bea2ffb98853">The presence of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin is troubling for Omin — especially if the Dran Enterprises hobgoblins were killed without the characters questioning them, leading to the assumption that the organization was behind the initial attack. If the characters aren’t suitably intrigued by the orrery and its newly discovered component, that can be another thing that Omin charges them with investigating. Armed with a solid guess that Talanatha fled to the lighthouse, the characters prepare to head north!</p>

</div>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c4431c8-0454-4b8d-b91f-e83b2225f982">In this episode, the characters (newly enfranchised and now 3rd level) travel to the Silent Sound lighthouse to search for Talanatha, the tiefling paladin occultant of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. On the way, Omin Dran contacts them with a request. He wants them to stop in Neverwinter to check on a cache of Acquisitions Incorporated treasure being stored there. However, the doppelganger who hid the cache has been arrested and is about to be executed. Even if the characters save her, retrieving the treasure where it’s been hidden in the House of Knowledge — Oghma’s temple in Neverwinter — will take more time and effort than Omin predicted.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d66e8ceb-f86f-4be9-90cb-b0cbb5384f94">Leaving Neverwinter, the characters head north in the direction of Silent Sound. But even as the lighthouse comes into view, they spot a small boat under attack by creatures from the deep. If they rescue the crew, the characters might find a business opportunity that involves partaking in a little mutiny against a ruthless captain.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="27b08efc-6423-4ef8-bec4-8470d98cbf77">At the lighthouse, the characters confirm that the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise headquartered there — the Order of the Stout Half-Pint — was attacked, and that most of its members have been killed. Moving up through the different levels of the lighthouse tower, the franchisees find more and more evidence that the same spellcaster whose creations they’ve previously faced has wrought havoc there. That spellcaster, Hoobur Gran’Shoop, is found working in a grisly laboratory beneath the tower, to which the adventurers gain entrance through the lighthouse’s magic lens. That laboratory is only part of the lighthouse’s secret basement, though, and the characters engage in some dangerous and lucrative dungeoneering after dealing with — or doing a deal with — Hoobur.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="358265d8-afa0-4f67-9e0b-ccd6ff2d1524">With the threats in the lighthouse dispensed with, the characters learn that its franchise members had also recently collected one of the clockwork components of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="8cb6c727-b639-484e-aa02-4ac9ef7f3624"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705876-tooltip">Orrery of the Wanderer</a></span>. They also have evidence in hand pointing to the involvement of Dran Enterprises in the attack on the lighthouse, building on the sighting of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin. But what does Dran Enterprises want with the orrery? And which band of plucky franchisees will be tasked with finding out?</p>
<h2 id="TotheLighthouse" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="9e100830-a2cc-4274-a846-afb5a1da8ec2"><a href="#TotheLighthouse" data-content-chunk-id="8d615c50-41ea-43ae-b673-0cb8fa3e384d"></a>To the Lighthouse</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c60e83b-ebde-4b3a-be9d-07f0de5542b2">With the franchise headquarters in Phandalin secured and the rebuilding of Tresendar Manor underway, the adventurers have a clear path ahead of them to the Silent Sound lighthouse. However, you get to decide how complicated the journey turns out to be.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee559abe-2dff-4d11-bbc0-445d69a4af03">One big question is whether the characters should travel overland up the Sword Coast, or whether you want to let them teleport directly to Silent Sound using the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="81d5d7ba-de33-4e3a-8c47-e49f438ba5b5"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705948-timepiece-of-travel" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705948-tooltip">timepiece of travel</a></span>. Either option is fine. With an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign often involving access to crazy magic, don’t be afraid to let the characters make use of it. But there are options for holding back on the magic of the orrery and its components if you want to (see the “<a title="Level Inappropriate" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/fun-in-phandalin#LevelInappropriate" data-content-chunk-id="c90888d7-5b5a-4266-abf4-2f8af7c62c8a">Level Inappropriate</a>” sidebar in episode 2), and an overland journey has its own rewards, in the form of additional encounters and side treks that can help build a fun story.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="820643ac-8133-4b25-a66a-25d716c2a9b5">This episode provides one side trek that sees the characters stop in Neverwinter on their way to the lighthouse, which can be made use of no matter what the party’s method of travel. Additionally, if the characters are traveling overland, you can introduce random encounters along the road using the same method and table from <a title="episode 2" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/fun-in-phandalin#TravelingtoPhandalin" data-content-chunk-id="c6f0622f-cb27-440b-829e-38adb1bd03d9">episode 2</a>.

<p data-content-chunk-id="117af69a-0a6f-4cc5-8a72-619f568b5dfe">Before the characters leave for the lighthouse, or while they are on the High Road traveling toward Neverwinter, Omin Dran makes contact with a “small favor.” Neverwinter is located on the High Road on the way to the Silent Sound lighthouse, so is an easy stop for the party to make.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1c040242-5cbe-4251-ad00-7ff29683e7dc">Head Office assignments of this sort can become common in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, especially as the characters’ reputation as troubleshooters grows. You can use such side treks as useful support for a franchise’s main mission, or as an inconvenient interruption.</p>

When he does, read the following to detail his request:</p>
<blockquote class="adventure-read-aloud-text" data-content-chunk-id="05c9561e-6237-4123-b795-224f447f04c0">
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="e1d2bc76-6600-4ea8-ad63-8a94c4b8c547">“Yeah, so I’m going to need you to do a little extra work for me. It shouldn’t be too taxing. I have a contact in Neverwinter who’s secured a cache of treasure. Her name is Oppal DeScart, and you can usually find her in a tavern in the Blacklake District known as the Stable Quiver. She’s a shapeshifter, so I can’t say for sure what she’ll look like when you locate her. You can suss her out with the passphrase “That’s a big hen house,” and she should reply with “Only to a small fox.” When you locate her, tell her that it’s safe to “Move the cargo along the Platinum Road.” And that’s it. She’ll give you the treasure to get out of Neverwinter safely. The whole affair should take a few hours, and then you can be on your way. You can get the goods to me when you return.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-content-chunk-id="886dcbb0-7f7b-4568-9a74-ccec2dbd85eb">Omin’s primary concern is to have Oppal’s treasure secured and removed from the city without drawing the attention of Neverwinter’s tax collectors. He tells the characters that the treasure is small but its container is warded, and that they should be prepared to store and carry it without looking in it. Omin isn’t keen to get into additional details, though, suggesting that the less the characters know, the better. (This is another potentially entertaining hallmark of assignments handed down from Head Office, and plausible deniability is one of the core competencies of any successful Acquisitions Incorporated franchise.)</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="43afbf08-5745-4f9e-a740-bc576aac759c">Either on their way to Neverwinter or while in the city, the characters might want to dig around a bit to find out more about what exactly they’re getting into. They might also assign a franchise task to their staff back in Phandalin, getting them to use scrutineering or research to find out more.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="85557629-cbbd-4063-a92c-275f9da095f2">If you want to make Neverwinter a bigger part of your campaign, more information about the city can be found in the <em><a title="Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/scag">Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide</a></em>. But the following information covers the basics the characters can learn regarding this side trek:</p>

<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="51ebfee6-d772-4d43-97b8-1472fa053ef3">The citizens of Neverwinter accepted the rule of an autocrat who brought peace and stability to a fractious city. With the foundation of his rule solidly established, Lord Neverember cracked down on the nobility and the guilds, whom the lower classes were more than happy to blame for any problems in the city.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted--Extra-Space-After-" data-content-chunk-id="4ad8ca80-52ba-4365-ac38-8a09b2bf5edc">Neverember has levied heavy taxes against wealthy merchants and the aristocracy.

By consolidating caches of treasure and using them to purchase rare diamonds, she’s been able to convert a great deal of wealth into portable form, ready for secure retrieval. Unfortunately for her — and unknown to Omin Dran — Oppal was recently arrested for murder in a case of mistaken identity. She’s currently being held in the dungeons beneath the ruins of Castle Never, awaiting execution.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3db78d83-c58b-46bc-a72e-6085e38a7644">When the characters arrive in Neverwinter, they find themselves in a city divided — quite literally. Part of the metropolis is magnificent, with breathtaking architecture, marvelous spires, and opulent decorations. And amid that beauty is a terrible scar caused by the eruption of Mount Hotenow years before. Citizens are still rebuilding from that disaster, largely thanks to the extra taxes Lord Neverember levies against the wealthy. The city’s poorer residents benefit from the rebuilding work, and live in hope that the artisans and builders in the City of Skilled Hands can turn their home into the Jewel of the North once again.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cb0ee80f-673d-4306-ac92-fa78889db7fe">The Stable Quiver is a nondescript, well-built tavern in the Blacklake District, an area that covers the northwest part of the city. The tavern boasts a mixed clientele of lesser nobles, artisans, middle-class merchants, and skilled laborers. It’s a perfect meeting place for citizens engaged in activities they wish to keep out of the public eye. The low-life element normally eschews the place, except in cases where they meet with the tavern’s regular patrons — who are no less criminal in many cases.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1e1a46d5-3cee-4aa8-aceb-db9be8e44211">If the characters don’t get initial information from Moguhl about the prison beneath Castle Never, they can use whatever means they choose to gather information. This might include employing appropriate backgrounds, digging into rumors spread by the criminal class, talking to city guards, and so forth.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a2d8607b-beae-4140-ab18-4495bb211779">The characters can learn the following details about the castle and the prison beneath it with appropriate roleplaying or ability checks. Easy-to-acquire information comes earlier in the list, while the details that are harder to acquire are provided later. Dispense the following points as you see fit:</p>

<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="96ce5785-35da-4d85-9caf-9d818cef2165">Castle Never was the historical seat of the rulers of Neverwinter. The eruption of Mount Hotenow and various attacks in the years since have reduced the structure to rubble.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="63eac214-8ea6-4fe7-bcf7-ac995af5eb99">Lord Neverember has made rebuilding the castle his top priority. Much of the city’s steep tax income goes to the rebuilding efforts.</li>

<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="fa1ed295-6785-4c31-941b-df2c69d4ee63">During executions, guards are numerous, and powerful people show up to see justice dispensed. Rescuing one of the condemned from the gallows would be a nearly impossible feat.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6eeb3979-0200-4f32-beec-499f086f3fce">The first step to rescuing Oppal is to communicate with her in some way. However, if a plan is hatched that allows the characters to message her indirectly through a third party (a bribed guard or worker, for instance), Oppal’s response makes it clear that she is willing to pass along “the information” only if she is liberated. She understands that the characters’ timely appearance is the only thing that stands between her and certain death.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7b1c764b-8f96-44fe-b6cf-42789ba0f3eb">How the characters navigate this tricky dilemma is entirely up to you. Let the players’ resourcefulness and your imagination combine to create a memorable story of legendary triumph or narrow failure, followed by even narrower escapes. Ideas and plans for getting to and rescuing Oppal can cover any of the following options:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="f58d240d-386c-4266-8b68-2f4bb5e14717">
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="72438ecc-6e99-4e64-a34b-e88acada970e">A corrupt member of the Neverwinter city guard might help get the characters into the holes for a price. But that guard might also charge a higher and previously unmentioned price to get them out again.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="76fa0b4e-7acc-4f25-8399-091bfbc9fe61">The secret entrance offers lots of possibilities, but the characters first need to find it. Then they need to deal with whatever suitable monster is currently lairing in that cave. Moreover, any number of traps, hazards, and monsters might be guarding the passage leading from the cavern to the holes.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="21c9cf87-fffe-440a-b170-28e15ad18337">The characters might also try to keep things entirely legal by tracking down the orc who committed the murder Oppal is accused of. Bringing that villain in might easily clear Oppal’s name — and bring the characters a certain amount of notoriety in the city. But where is that orc now? And who else might the characters need to contend with to capture him?</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="51eded30-0e52-4778-9b09-2e4f9a22beef">Pretending to be Oppal’s friends or family gives the characters easy access to the doppelganger as they bring in a last meal. Then once they’re in the holes, it’s up to you to decide how they might pull off a daring escape — including searching for the rumored tunnel from the inside.</li>
</ul>

<p data-content-chunk-id="338537d1-77a4-4f5a-8d9b-d58867029bca">If the characters rescue Oppal from the holes, she gratefully provides information on the whereabouts of Omin Dran’s treasure cache, which consists of rare black diamonds mined from the rim of Mount Hotenow. The diamonds are held in a silk bag that’s been placed in a false tome titled <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="fc80bb7b-b010-4f8c-ab7a-83ba578d5b23">A Layperson’s Book of Common Knowledge</span>. Oppal hid the book in a vault beneath the Hall of Knowledge — the local temple to Oghma, god of knowledge, invention, and inspiration.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="14882659-8bb3-4a88-8549-7f4b37b91ef9">Like much of the city of Neverwinter, the Hall of Knowledge is currently under repair. Although some of the temple was damaged by the volcano, portions were spared the destruction of the lava flow, including an underground chamber called the Vault of Tomes. That undercroft contains some of the most rare and valuable books in Faerûn outside Candlekeep, and is one of the most secure locations in the city as a result. By disguising herself as an acolyte, Oppal was able to place the false tome in the vault.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f11fed83-64c6-4012-a7d7-91839dc7a31f">On Omin’s instructions, Oppal hired a wizard to place a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="3aa935d7-d242-4ca2-80c3-b75871e403e2"><a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2125-glyph-of-warding" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2125-tooltip">glyph of warding</a></span> (explosive runes) on the false book to keep it from being opened. Also on Omin’s order, she doesn’t know how to bypass the glyph. The doppelganger knows that Omin expected he would be able to access the diamonds once the false tome was in his possession.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="51efcffb-902a-43d2-889d-901249efdd1f">Oppal knows that the vault door has a very good lock, but the door is left open whenever acolytes are moving tomes in and out of the vault (as it was when she hid the book). She also knows that the head priest (known as the grand scribe) at the Hall of Knowledge is a frail and unpleasant elf named Spivey Liethennson (LN male elf <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="ac084c9a-3a16-4ad8-8e50-b975d5398ede"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16966-noble" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16966-tooltip">noble</a></span>). Grand Scribe Liethennson is a strict taskmaster and does not suffer fools gladly.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e7abebf1-875e-4292-ba62-08383fba8255">Once freed, Oppal is unwilling to assist in any further capers, wanting only to get out of Neverwinter alive. No amount of threatening or cajoling can inspire her to assist the characters. She suggests that they acquire the book, seal it inside something else so as to avoid accidentally triggering the glyph, and leave the city as quickly as possible. They can deliver the goods to Omin at their leisure after that.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cde1a919-190d-4bfe-ad45-9eae43613ead">The Hall of Knowledge is a major temple in Neverwinter, acting as a place of learning, a center of socialization, and a repository of government documentation while Castle Never is being rebuilt. Damage to the complex’s outer walls and floors has already been restored, while workers now focus on interior walls and decor.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dbb0878b-90fd-45ed-b2df-9fb103d83b09">Grand Scribe Spivey Liethennson oversees the temple, ruling his limited domain with all the fervor his fragile body can muster. Acolytes and workers freeze in terror when his labored breathing warns of his approach, because he rarely has a kind word to say. Liethennson longs to leave the city and join his fellow Oghma worshipers in the serenity of Candlekeep. In the meantime, he hopes to impress church elders by running the Hall of Knowledge with an iron hand.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="768fc36a-a5d9-471b-a3e5-e832d2750354">Anyone can enter the temple to worship Oghma at a shrine on the first floor. Acolytes and lesser clerics are available to perform rituals for a suitable donation. The first floor also contains books and scrolls of common value, as well as public documents moved here from Castle Never. The second floor holds sleeping quarters and private work areas for staff and clergy, while the basement includes storage rooms, private shrines for generous donors, and the Vault of Tomes.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e4a356f9-5826-4f10-99fe-fccb989c4926">At any opportune moment as the characters are within or approaching the temple, they see Kwarter drop her tools at Liethennson’s feet, make a rude gesture in his direction, and call on her workers to leave. She knows that she and her team can find easier work for more money elsewhere in the city. Quick-thinking characters can seize this opportunity to pretend to be masons, carpenters, or other craftspeople to gain access to the basement level. This doesn’t grant characters access to the Vault of Tomes, but it gets them close.</p>

The door to the vault employs a complex three-stage lock, requiring three successful DC 20 Dexterity checks using thieves’ tools to open. If the characters take too long to open the lock, staff or clergy might notice them, alerting any veterans on watch.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e342621e-18d2-458b-a5aa-9092f90dcada">A successful check determines that while four of the gems are real diamonds (5,000 gp each), eight are actually finely cut smoky quartz (10 gp each). Omin knows that Oppal mixed the fakes with the real diamonds to throw off would-be thieves, allowing her to offer them the quartz while she used legerdemain to retain the valuable ones. Characters who don’t know this might sweat a bit as they try to figure out how to explain the situation to Omin.</p>

If the lighthouse is supposed to act as a beacon, though, something is seriously wrong. Its top is hazy and indistinct, as if a fog was obscuring the lantern room.

<p data-content-chunk-id="cbb3daae-fba8-4701-88df-038882cba040">If the characters care to help, they can challenge Captain Athgar.

For at least two tendays, the normally reliable light has been dark. She fears that some sort of magic is in play, because it isn’t just the case that the light is out. Rather, it appears to radiate some kind of dark energy. Moreover, she’s heard that sightings of spectral figures and will-o’-wisps in the area are on the rise.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="daf5db98-da9e-45ed-8da1-7a544ada7048">In the end, the sailors must return to their ship or risk the captain’s wrath against their friends. The characters are left to explore the lighthouse on their own.</p>

The captain berates Belle for bringing back useless chum such as the characters, and demands that they leave his ship immediately — without the use of the boat.

<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="ecd56ba4-1652-482e-8f4b-fd60ffa1e0a0">Perhaps the ship is in sad shape after years of neglect. Can the characters spare 1,000 gp (a tenth of the sailing ship’s worth) for repairs? And what happens if the ship gets into trouble and the characters are constantly called upon to rescue the crew and protect their investment?</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="216d0b57-5bb3-4ffe-97fa-e7c5fb4b2a18">Authorities across the Sword Coast might also want to arrest the crew for Captain Athgar’s misdeeds. If any crew members are caught, the authorities might learn about the ship’s business relationship with the franchise, creating potential trouble for the characters.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d444d764-645e-4025-b138-82de8ca70a42">On the beach behind the lighthouse, three large tents are set up as temporary lodgings. The members of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint and their staff were living here while preparing the lighthouse for a new round of franchise renovations. Evidence of a fight from many days ago is spread across the grounds, including slashed canvas and broken weapons. Mundane furniture and gear fills the tents, along with kegs of ale, casks of fresh water, boxes of rations, and bundles of arrows. All the tents feature the Dran Enterprises logo scrawled onto them in chalk.</p>

A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools opens the chest. Smashing the chest open requires a successful DC 10 Strength check, but doing so breaks 1d4 of the potions within. The chest contains 500 sp, gems worth 250 gp, three <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/71-potion-of-healing" data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/71-tooltip">potions of healing</a>, and a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4709-potion-of-heroism" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4709-tooltip">potion of heroism</a>.</p>

Two lanterns full of oil hang within each level on the east and west walls. Window slits stand 3 feet above the floor on each level, at the center of the north and south walls. These slits are 3 feet high but only a few inches wide, so they’re too small to allow passage or let much more than a little dim light in.</p>

This custom-built franchise defense system is rigged to release a rain of arrows from turrets up higher on the lighthouse.

Or it can be disarmed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. If the check to disarm fails by 5 or more, the trap is triggered.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5c64fadd-1dcf-44fd-8d7f-c617cb296cd0">If the trap is activated, each creature within 10 feet of the door must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) piercing damage from the rain of arrows on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap does not reset itself automatically, but it will be restocked with arrows and reset manually by Hoobur Gran’Shoop’s undead minions if the characters are away from the lighthouse for more than a few hours.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f4344138-2ca2-49fd-8fb0-505f1ef2606b">Once the trap is disabled or triggered, the lock on the door can be picked with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. The sturdy stone door can also be smashed open with a successful DC 20 Strength check, or it can be battered down (AC 13, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4656cd96-9dee-46a1-90f1-ea21c5f96966">The original builder of the lighthouse was a kindly old wizard who enjoyed the romantic idea of living rustic by the sea in his final years. He wanted a laboratory inaccessible to the prying eyes and wandering feet of normal folk. He therefore created the magic lens that allowed him to teleport directly from the top of the lighthouse to his underground workshop.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="97df21b5-b2cb-4de8-8045-e673cf5fb007">When the Order of the Stout Half-Pint took over the abandoned lighthouse two years ago, Wizzy quickly discovered the teleporting power of the lens. However, renovating the disused basement laboratory had long remained just another item on the franchise’s to-do list, and no one ever discovered the super-secret basement beyond.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5cd16a3d-e932-45d4-813e-c1aa0392dc64">After Hoobur Gran’Shoop led his undead minions in the attack on the lighthouse, the gnome archmage used the teleporting lens to inspect the secret basement laboratory, and soon discovered the super-secret basement beyond. Though he didn’t explore the super-secret basement, he was delighted to find that most of the equipment he needed to do his work (minus the victims) was already set up for him in the lab. The place was even dark and dreary, just the way he liked it. Not wanting to pass up an incredible opportunity, the archmage decided to make the Silent Sound lighthouse his new home.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="df00c38f-e40c-45ec-9e2e-dbfd59b646f9">During his attack on the lighthouse, Hoobur made sure that his troops captured rather than killed Wizzy Fotz, the gnome leader of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint. When the tiefling Talanatha appeared out of nowhere in her flight from the attack on Tresendar Manor, Hoobur’s minions took her alive as well. He later brought these two prisoners to his lab and has been performing magical rites on them, draining their vitality and will to keep them in a state between life and death.</p>

When your vision clears, you find yourselves in the corner of a stone chamber filled with laboratory and arcane equipment. Tall bookcases filled with tomes line two walls, while the other walls feature long tables covered with alembics, flasks, cauldrons, beakers, and containers holding weird reagents and components. An iron cage is set against one wall, its door open.</p>

A gnome dressed in garishly colorful clothes sits on a stool nearby, his eyes blank. Another gnome sits next to the first, but this one is most lively and chipper. He wears dark robes and a red fez bearing the Dran Enterprises logo — apparently scrawled in white chalk.</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="38bddb37-8135-4e2a-b3e1-38b1b5acc886">“See Wizzy?” the chipper gnome says to the other. “I told you we would have visitors. I felt their presence in the lantern room.” He sips from a cup of tea as he beckons to you. “Would you like to have a seat? And can I get you some chamomile tea? My name is Hoobur Gran’Shoop, by the way. Pleased to meet you.”</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="06619ee5-ba34-4a27-9d81-10480644292d">Hoobur Gran’Shoop is a far more powerful foe than the characters can handle at their current level. Fortunately, he doesn’t want to kill them. In fact, the archmage is a big fan of the plucky, can-do attitude that’s brought them this far. He was hired — and given a great deal of magic and money — by the Six to wipe out a couple of Acquisitions Incorporated franchises, here and at Tresendar Manor. His instructions were to make it look like Dran Enterprises was responsible. Other than that, he has no dog in this fight.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3fdf8268-d68e-46ea-b6dd-d1712aa58e5a">Hoobur attempts to establish a sincere dialogue with the characters, chatting about the serenity of the area surrounding the lighthouse, the importance of good friends, the relaxing qualities of a good cup of tea, or any other topic that catches his fancy. During the conversation, he drops as many references to Dran Enterprises as possible, implying that the organization is the characters’ true enemy. He reinforces any rumors the characters have heard about Dran Enterprises, or spins those rumors if they haven’t. This includes the speculation seen on the map on the lighthouse first floor that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters — and thus a sinister presence — in Luskan.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5e8a20c8-efd3-4b05-9d28-aba9f787ccd1">When the talk becomes serious, Hoobur tells the characters he’s willing to let them walk away right now, taking Wizzy and Talanatha with them, if they leave him to his work here. The laboratory is such a great space, and the archmage is making incredible strides in understanding the thin veil between the worlds of the living and the dead.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4b2ae487-2c57-45c9-b560-5794ff54386d">If the characters are quick to accept Hoobur’s offer (even just to avoid a fight they know they can’t yet win), you get to decide how the freed Wizzy and Talanatha feel about that. You can also decide how to handle the super-secret basement. If you have a sense that the characters will return to the lighthouse at some point to take on Hoobur, you can leave the areas beyond this one to be explored at a later date. Alternatively, if the players and characters seem keen on making Hoobur a lifetime ally, you can have the archmage offer them a first job for friendship’s sake — exploring the super-secret basement and clearing out any threats there. See “<a title="Secret Door" href="#SecretDoor" data-content-chunk-id="9edd0c47-f5e1-4da9-b6cb-38258202f667">Secret Door</a>” below.</p>

But just because a gnome is a tiny bit on the dark side doesn’t mean he can’t be a useful ally! Make note of the terms on which the characters part ways with Hoobur, whether they leave him in control of the lighthouse or throw down against him. The archmage could turn up later in the campaign with an interesting business proposition, or might work with the characters in an “enemy of my enemy is my friend” scenario. Alternatively, if Hoobur was forced to flee, he might decide that the franchisees are a threat to his livelihood and reputation that need to be eliminated.</p>

By the point at which he decided it was time to slow down a bit, he was simply called Screve. However, he had more than a few other names throughout his career as a slinger of magic, including Brutar the Bloody, Murst the Merciless, and That Wizard Who Fried All Those People in Suzail. Screve was an edgy sort, in other words.</p>

Please help us go home.” Wrapped in padlocked chains in that corner is a creature consisting of five mechanical arms, like those of a starfish, and which stands on five spindly mechanical legs.</p>

The pentadrone, known as 57EV1E (or “Stevie” to its friends), has been disconnected from the axiomatic mind of Primus, making it a rogue modron. (See the “<a title="Variant: Rogue Modrons" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/monsters-m#Modrons" data-content-chunk-id="8b1d3da9-89c8-4116-8b17-075015a48f8d">Variant: Rogue Modrons</a>” sidebar in the modron section of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="c4d09922-369b-4f30-8b9f-907be4242ff9"><i><a title="Monster Manual" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a></i></span>.)

One locked chain secures each of the modron’s five arms. A successful DC 13 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools opens one lock and removes the attached chain. The chains can also be severed (AC 10, 15 hit points, immune to poison and psychic damage) or broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The manner in which Stevie is tightly bound prevents the modron from attacking or trying to break the chains.</p>

The wizard held the pentadrone prisoner and used it as a model to create replica modrons. (If none of the characters speaks Modron or has some alternative means of communication with the construct, Stevie picked up enough Common from Screve during its years of imprisonment to get by.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ccb2f696-1ebb-44d5-bc59-e52a8e233db3">Stevie isn’t sure how long it has been separated from the mind of Primus, but it wants desperately to return to Mechanus. You can decide whether the characters can help Stevie with this plight as a side trek or a downtime activity. Alternatively, the modron might have been disconnected from Primus for too long, keeping it a rogue modron that might become a recurring villain or allied NPC.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7db10351-0e78-423e-91ae-ed145738d948">Talanatha would be keen to work with a franchise whose members are clearly as cool and capable as the characters.

<p data-content-chunk-id="58d6b249-b5c2-4671-a2bd-176ff0fa9808">As a paladin and an iconic occultant franchisee (see “<a title="Company Positions" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise#CompanyPositions" data-content-chunk-id="a3f47624-6d12-4ce6-b740-9d94ee5fbd89">Company Positions</a>” in chapter 2), Talanatha would also make an excellent replacement character if a fight against Hoobur Gran’Shoop went badly for the party.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="109bdc2e-7623-41f3-b245-64b84e0e6cf6">The most important piece of information the characters take away from this episode is the “evidence” that Dran Enterprises was involved with the attacks on both Acquisitions Incorporated franchises, back in Phandalin and at the lighthouse. The rumor that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters in Luskan can be repeated by both Wizzy and Talanatha, setting the stage for the next episode. If the characters need further prodding to think about heading for Luskan, you could also have the orrery housing provide a mental hint that at least one more of its components has recently been sensed north of the lighthouse, and relatively close.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c0fd523f-2e19-4b61-9dfe-539913b66990">Making use of scrutineering, research, carousing, or schmoozing during downtime can all yield up hints confirming that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters in the city of Luskan — and adding rumors suggesting that the organization has recently been engaging in conduct even more secretive than usual. Such activities can also preview some of the information on Luskan presented in <a title="episode 4" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/dran-enterprises" data-content-chunk-id="a233e615-f43f-4c54-ae44-b921c8344e59">episode 4</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b472e893-d4f4-4404-847a-ab394caf6903">The <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17179-pentadrone" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17179-tooltip">pentadrone</a> Stevie wants to travel back to Mechanus, and the characters could assist by using downtime or franchise tasks to make that happen. Research or schmoozing might gain information from knowledgeable sages regarding existing portals to Mechanus, or unique rituals that can open a temporary portal.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="000d8269-edae-4ea5-af71-8545e23e38f2">If the characters are successful in helping Stevie get home, the pentadrone thanks them by removing components from itself that reassemble to function as an <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="a846eb67-bc33-473c-a179-916d25b8ae27">axiomatic weapon</span>, a rare magic item that requires attunement.

<p data-content-chunk-id="212ac338-d77c-477b-b5e5-ffb0cd5efc43">Having a small castle estate in Phandalin is cool. But having a lighthouse on the Sword Coast might be even cooler. If it seems like the thing to do, the characters could use the franchise restructuring or headquarters modification activities to officially ask permission to relocate their franchise to the Silent Sound lighthouse. (This assumes that Hoobur Gran’Shoop was driven from the basement, and that the characters are prepared to deal with the possibility of him coming back.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="071baf59-5ef6-4bc6-b067-47261e26cdc1">Even if the characters don’t want to officially change territories, nothing prevents them from quietly checking out the commercial landscape in the area. Characters searching the sea caves along the cliffs near the lighthouse might find that a variety of ne’er-do-wells use them as places to hide from naval pursuers, stow contraband, secure prisoners held for ransom, and engage in other nefarious activities. Joining in on (or getting a percentage of) such activities could be set up with the shady business practice activity — possibly connecting to any deal the characters have recently struck with the newly installed captain of a fast ship.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7f9894c3-5e35-4292-8bd0-4a59361e461f">Characters not wanting to flout the law (or at least not to do so outside their own territory) could instead clear out smugglers and other riffraff along the coast. Doing so as part of a philanthropic enterprise could get them in good with the authorities in Neverwinter or Luskan.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ba9f1472-b19f-44c2-9f95-9fa34591985b">Taking over the lighthouse also provides the opportunity for a philanthropic enterprise. The light is a warning beacon for ships traveling the coast between Neverwinter and Luskan, but it needs someone to keep it running. Before the Order of the Stout Half-Pint moved in, the authorities in Luskan and Neverwinter struggled to entice anyone to live at the remote lighthouse, given the amount of dangerous bandit and pirate activity in the area. If the characters take over the lighthouse or arrange for it to be staffed, they’ll earn the favor of Neverwinter, Luskan, and possibly even the Lords’ Alliance for their generosity.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ee36aa97-52d3-4ba7-80d8-744806cb1e4b">While the characters are engaged in downtime and franchise activities, Omin Dran makes contact. He embraces the characters’ reports from Phandalin and the Silent Sound lighthouse as proof that Dran Enterprises is involved in the attacks against Acq Inc franchises, and that its agents are willing to kill to claim the components of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="c79f8637-e4a7-4c29-bc0b-9b5d473b92b8"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705876-tooltip">Orrery of the Wanderer</a></span>. However, something about that approach feels inconsistent with Dran Enterprises’ normal approach to acquisition. A ruthless attitude and wanting Acquisitions Incorporated taken apart and absorbed into its own corporate space is one thing, but doing it one franchise at a time seems odd. As such, Omin wants more information before committing to reprisals or confrontation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="daf81741-5840-4025-885a-206e92c17d20">The characters are directed to go to Luskan to confirm that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters in that lawless city.

<p data-content-chunk-id="b3b8285a-11b6-44ab-91cf-65dc53ca8730">The search for the headquarters takes the characters first to the rough-and-tumble Fishbone Tavern, then to Arla Razortongue, a disgruntled Dran Enterprises ex-employee running a well-known peg and hook shop. After dealing with thugs sent to quiet Arla, the characters learn the location of Dran Enterprises’ secret headquarters, and can plan their infiltration.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e11ee03-94dc-4d08-9e5e-10d8d015d672">That headquarters is a seemingly small and unimportant ship at the Luskan docks. But Dran Enterprises’ magic has filled the ship with portals leading to some of the faction’s many franchises, ships, and business locations. When the characters visit, those portals lead to:</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="957b3914-6e70-4f32-9cfc-22aa707fc4c0">The City of Sails is located far to the north of the Sword Coast, and the journey there can be as eventful as you desire. If the players are hankering for random encounters, the wild lands of the North can certainly oblige them. Or you might wish to have the journey pass in relative peace while the players coordinate franchise tasks left over from the previous episode.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="21e321db-1f34-468c-89da-ce2bb48844f8">Luskan rests upon stone escarpments on either side of the icy River Mirar. Three bridges, named Upstream Span, Dalath’s Span, and Long Span, cross forty feet above the river to connect the two sides of the city. The Open Shore docks sit on the northernmost edge of the river, while Dragon Beach holds docks to the south. As they seek out Dran Enterprises’ secret headquarters, the characters start in the south and work their way to the Open Shore docks.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c17b97f8-0990-4d12-9181-cb8df9ec9b1c">A key aspect of Luskan life is its rule by groups known as Ships. Five High Captains each rule a Ship made up of pirates and other Northlanders. Ship Kurth, under High Captain Beniago Kurth, is the First Ship, which controls the city’s docks and trade. Ship Baram is the Second Ship, operating the fishing industry. Third Ship Suljack leads piracy and raiding, handing down less-desirable opportunities to Fourth Ship Taerl. Fifth Ship Rethnor acts as the city’s guard — an unprofitable enough duty that many of its members look for other ways to earn coin.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5e879af4-7b37-4e40-9f67-2fec6ead9275">The order of mages known as the Arcane Brotherhood is the other major power group in Luskan. Though its members include ambitious arcanists of any and all genders, the newly restored order maintains its original name as a reflection of its past power — and as a sign that it seeks to restore that power once again.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="323918c2-05fe-4bbd-8cc2-0b484d35e7dc">If you want to make Luskan a bigger part of your campaign, more information about the city can be found in the <em><a title="Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/scag" data-content-chunk-id="5a7531b6-727a-469b-9d92-daa43f65fa1a">Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide</a></em>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="bbd09492-a860-4b5e-a6f0-1632084d7147">The characters’ main goal in this episode is to find Dran Enterprises’ secret headquarters. However, owing to that organization’s habit of breaking the legs of anyone who talks about company business, this information is hard to come by. Thankfully, the characters are able to learn that Dran Enterprises employees often frequent a specific tavern in Luskan, giving them a starting point for seeking the information they need.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bc07cfff-ca54-4aad-8a23-de71316cfc0d">The characters can learn the name and location of the Fishbone tavern in any number of ways, including talking to other tavern owners, seeking out merchants and mercenaries who’ve done business with Dran Enterprises, and the like. Two example encounters are provided to help the characters find the tavern. You can add similar encounters to increase the complexity of the search as desired.</p>

The shops and taverns lining the main thoroughfare of the City of Sails are as battered and weathered as the grim customers entering them.

The elderly human driver calls out for help, but passersby ignore her. As she calls out once more, the tavern door behind her opens and two guards toss a young male human in bright clothing out into the street. He tumbles into the old woman, sending both of them sprawling to the ground. The door closes, then opens once more as a mandolin comes flying out of the tavern.</p>

<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="74ae27b9-43e6-4d81-bfe9-104e3747479b">At some point before the party arrives in Luskan, ask the players whether their characters are bringing the orrery housing and any components with them, and if so, who carries the relics. If they plan instead to secure them elsewhere, ask about that location and their security measures. For the purpose of the adventure, it’s best if the characters keep the orrery components with them, rather than leaving them at headquarters.

An impressionable (and starving) teenager, he faithfully serves anyone who takes him under their wing, and can provide comic relief as desired.</p>

A formal presence in this far-flung territory is far beyond the scope of their charter of operations, naturally. And savvy franchisees might have heard rumors that Head Office is working to open a franchise in the City of Sails. However, clever players could work to increase their own franchise’s notoriety and add a few more customers without unduly violating the terms of their contract. You might tie such attempts to future franchise tasks or downtime incorporating the shady business practice activity, as the characters try to keep an official distance from any Luskan opportunities.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0b2453c0-8384-49d4-a959-e9dcbfcb9ead">With a couple of initial clues at hand, the characters can start the search in earnest for the tavern frequented by Dran Enterprises employees. Unfortunately, most folk in Luskan are smart enough to not talk about Dran Enterprises too openly, and the characters are rebuffed or ignored during their initial inquiries. Eventually, though, the party is referred to Eriss (N female gnome <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="847e1907-9d30-426b-a347-7a1149d6f182"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoner</a></span>), said to broker deals between guilds and other organizations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5516e220-f1f5-467b-a6d3-53e7882324f5">Eriss works with Ship Taerl, and can be found in a small but well-maintained curio shop on a busy street just north of the city’s central bridge, Dalath’s Span.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check suggests that this story isn’t worth a ship-in-a-bottle’s 100 gp sale price.

A desire to help Noriel could lead to helping the bard land a paying gig at a tavern, or seeking out one of the Ships or the loremasters of the Arcane Brotherhood to learn of his father. Helping Dabahl could lead to an encounter with a guild of teamsters or a disgruntled repair shop employee.

<p data-content-chunk-id="f3227054-954a-4d0e-9fae-76b584c73132">When the characters decide to enter, Zurb opens the door for them. If the characters have befriended him, Zurb announces them as “really nice people that talked a lot.” This causes Fryer to shake her head in weary disbelief.</p>

Only two of the eight tables are occupied, one by two fishers and another by a lone figure in a dark, leather-patched cloak. One wall holds a small, smoky fireplace, while a long bar of dark-stained wood stands along the opposite wall. Standing behind the bar under oval plaques set with yellowing fish skeletons is a heavyset human bartender. She pours ale for a half-elf seated at the bar, quietly engaging him in conversation.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="aa76a81e-4099-4cf8-803a-b357c152b57c">Fryer (N female human <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="83e8a76e-d546-4634-9b61-e022646b5b08"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoner</a></span>) is the owner of the Fishbone Tavern. Any character with a passive Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) score of 12 or higher might hear her refer to the half-elf as Rakeem as she talks to him. She is in the service of Dran Enterprises, receiving payment for keeping an eye on the organization’s employees and reporting any lack of loyalty to their management.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="385a9b8e-13b9-4739-bea0-e191efaa9961">Although Fryer is tight with Dran Enterprises, she carries a certain amount of guilt over an incident from a few months ago. She reported a former friend and Dran Enterprises operative named Arla Razortongue to her bosses for speaking out about the organization’s unethical practices. (See “The Peg and Hook” below for more on Arla.) Recent word on the street is that Arla continues to be a thorn in Dran Enterprises’ side — and that she’s been marked for exile or elimination. A character might sense Fryer’s remorse over having sold Arla out with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check, and could encourage her to share what took place and where to find Arla with appropriate roleplaying.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e8ff3c46-4799-4000-a1b9-ef45aefca12c">Rakeem (N male half-elf <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="d3e0c3ad-5a6f-473a-bc0c-5edbc5e138fc"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17021-spy" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17021-tooltip">spy</a></span>) is a regular drinker at the Fishbone, a friend to Fryer, and a professional snitch. Though not in the employ of Dran Enterprises, Rakeem tries to sell any information he overhears regarding the organization. If the characters talk openly about Dran Enterprises while Rakeem is anywhere in the tavern, he overhears them and alerts company operatives as to the characters’ intentions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9843c9a7-20f0-4639-bc28-2fb5f6169109">A character notices Rakeem spying on the group with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check. Rakeem is not eager to fight, though, and once confronted, he can be persuaded or intimidated into keeping anything he heard to himself — at least until the party leaves town. He might also be convinced to share what he knows with appropriate bribes or well-worded threats.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5b8549a7-4a1f-4fef-a471-2d3db5f5f80c">Word on the street is that Dran Enterprises has “turtled up,” retreating into wherever they hide due to some trouble known to the company’s higher-ups. Rakeem doesn’t know what that trouble is, but one person who keeps her ear to the ground about Dran Enterprises is Arla at the Peg and Hook (<a title="The Peg and Hook" href="#ThePegandHook" data-content-chunk-id="5e7971de-e4a2-4c45-bd91-2c14b9512d34">see below</a>).

<p data-content-chunk-id="84befa93-3a63-4fc2-abab-6560ed0dfe2b">The two fishers drinking at a central table are Milo and Tortuk (both N male human <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="8d05a9cd-7c76-4cf0-880f-ead19019e4b6"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoners</a></span>). Both are deep into their cups, lamenting their inability to find employment on the better fishing boats owned by Ship Baram. Even inebriated, they know enough to be wary at the idea of talking about Dran Enterprises to strangers. They do offer up, though, that they haven’t seen any Dran Enterprises employees in going on a tenday now. It’s an easy guess that there’s a big operation in progress, but neither fisher knows what that might be.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2d9b8117-5032-489b-a6d3-3cde20d97872">The lone figure sitting at a corner table is Velos (N male human <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="34a08ef2-bdc5-456d-b8cb-4b2ac2bbe971"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16798-bandit" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16798-tooltip">bandit</a></span>), nursing a glass of rum and rubbing his hand. A pirate by trade, Velos tries to conceal that his hand is turning black with infection after an injury during a recent raid. Without treatment such as a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="98c0e1f9-1f1c-4c1b-8c39-057ba51eaddf"><a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2164-lesser-restoration" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2164-tooltip">lesser restoration</a></span> spell, he will lose the hand, and he can’t afford treatment. Velos knows Arla and her story, and knows that he and his hand will be bound for the Peg and Hook shop before long.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ce1470bd-fc22-41e4-992c-648f2cbfa466">If the characters help Velos and mention their interest in Dran Enterprises, he shares that he recently overheard a melancholy employee talking about how a friend “got invited to headquarters but accidentally took a wrong door. They managed to scoop up what was left of him.” His gratitude also makes him a solid potential hire, especially if the franchise has future business in Luskan.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8d556d51-230d-46a5-887c-ab78a5323ebd">If the characters need help connecting the dots, Rakeem could make an obvious mistake such as tipping his stool over from trying to strain to hear the party. Or Velos could fall <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a> from his wound, allowing the characters to see his predicament and win Fryer over to their cause with some beneficial healing. Alternatively, an NPC the characters have previously confided in might appear (perhaps Noriel or Dabahl), asking loudly whether the characters have found Dran Enterprises yet, and provoking a noticeable reaction from Fryer and Rakeem.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a290c0e9-cbe4-4b33-a2ad-732e69716bf8">Once the characters have learned about Arla from any of the possible sources at the Fishbone, they can travel to her shop.</p>

So when she was fired from that organization, the need to start over again in the cutthroat environs of Luskan inspired her to think outside the box. Way, way outside. Given the number of seedy sailors that call the City of Sails their home port, she knew that a shop helping pirates with limb replacements would always make money. However, she felt that a hook was more useful as a replacement for a leg (instead of the traditional peg leg), and that a peg was more useful to replace a lost hand.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d08cae1a-a0fb-4531-89de-4b55b8a40739">Dran Enterprises ignored Arla at first, convinced that she would be a failure. Surprisingly, though, the plucky entrepreneur managed to convince enough pirates to try out her unconventional system that her business thrived. She has since developed a number of unique attachments (hook shoes, peg arm accessories) that provide surprising functionality — and even replaced one of her own hands and a leg to prove her point.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3083e459-c658-4998-b5eb-7e8fb9196537">When the characters approach the Peg and Hook, first decide whether their previous investigation has alerted Dran Enterprises. If they allowed Rakeem to eavesdrop and report their conversations, alerted Eriss the broker of their antagonistic intentions, or asked too many strangers how to find the organization, a strike team is already inside the shop and attacking Arla. Go straight to “<a title="Dran Strike Team" href="#DranStrikeTeam" data-content-chunk-id="787ed530-1762-4290-b066-521917f61222">Dran Strike Team</a>” below and roll for initiative.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="68df2a1b-37df-40a7-a633-f5cb86d58033">If the characters were discreet in their inquiries, Arla is alone in her shop and can be approached in any way they want.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ea61bfb6-4ee3-4d1e-9f5c-1cf5df7d7f29">Arla initially assumes the characters are customers, and points out various arm peg accessories, hook foot options, and other products she has developed. She then whips out a bone saw and asks which of the characters she can help first.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e4599a12-7d2a-4f2b-851a-efcf33195016">When she realizes the characters aren’t customers, Arla is disappointed, but she’s open to their questions. She despises Dran Enterprises, and is willing to help anyone who opposes that organization. Conveniently (for her), she’s also looking for investors to help her expand her burgeoning business. She initially asks for 1,000 gp for her information, or half as much if the characters bring her a paying customer. She can be talked down to 500 gp, or 250 gp with one customer.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="66a1874e-4734-4aa0-9390-1f6511c68681">Velos the pirate (from the Fishbone tavern) is a potential customer for Arla, but many others can be found around the city. Talking a stranger into getting a hook for a leg or a peg for an arm is best left to humorous roleplaying, but could also be accomplished with a successful DC 15 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check.

If Dran Enterprises has been alerted to the characters’ investigations, the strike team is already inside the shop when the party arrives, preparing to take Arla out. Otherwise, the strike team has been sent coincidentally to shake down Arla, as some of the higher-ups at Dran Enterprises aren’t happy with their disgraced employee’s success. In that case, the strike team enters the shop just as the characters start to leave.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d82cf052-9631-46b5-a065-66496a40fa8d">The team’s primary objective is to convince Arla to abandon her business and leave town. If she won’t, they have orders to kill her. Hoffman focuses on attacking Arla, castigating her verbally and physically for being a traitor to Dran Enterprises. In combat, Arla’s short­sword attacks take the form of either her sharpened leg hook or a retractable blade attached to her arm peg.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="35aae105-403c-41ee-9d7d-1db957a762b8">Hoffman is backed up by three operatives named Pieter, Marks, and Molley (each a N male halfling), each using the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="24c29d75-b5a3-473f-bcc8-9c2949e53ccd"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17021-spy" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17021-tooltip">spy</a></span> stat block.

The Six are initially at no more advantage than the characters are in their search for the headquarters, but the characters’ actions might tip that balance one way or the other.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f2a62e28-d176-4da7-a051-78d1725ba14f">During this part of the episode, you’ll track a one-off mechanic called “failure points,” which are used to represent the race against the Six and determine which side finds the headquarters first. The resolution of that search is described in the “<a title="On Board The Maverick" href="#OnBoardTheMaverick" data-content-chunk-id="59474af2-3420-4081-a91d-ea24e1d1553c">On Board <em>The Maverick</em></a>” section, but the characters will have opportunities before that to realize they are competing against the Six. When that becomes clear, you can underscore any situation in which the party earns a failure point, letting the players know that accumulating too many points means that the Six will pass through the final portal and arrive at <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="48d4f4e8-f205-4fea-9e75-c6bd8bda9121">The Maverick</span> first.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="932ad411-7a36-4121-9bd6-0c87abc0ce88">This humorously small ship is watched over by four <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="576de70c-922e-4e30-936c-42d09ba8c6b0"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16915-guard" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16915-tooltip">guards</a></span> that stand a silent vigil around the cabin. The ship can be reached from the main dock or the smaller jetty leading out between <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="cf512c9c-9c26-4eef-aacf-69ff61356a5a">Dangerous Business</span> and <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="e6a87f91-c822-4c9a-b138-9bba9612a3c3">The Rogue</span>. A single door opens up into the cabin.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bec9423a-03bd-4d8d-937d-24ec1f4ac754">The area of the docks around the three ships is patrolled by two groups of Dran Enterprises operatives, each consisting of four <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="4e78012c-cd41-4996-a84f-33f32b7f6c39"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16915-guard" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16915-tooltip">guards</a> </span>and four <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="64e5b651-1d32-4ea6-9059-a27f05ab7531"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16953-mastiff" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16953-tooltip">mastiffs</a></span>. Crates and equipment piled along the docks can provide cover, potentially allowing the characters to make a stealthy approach. Various booms and scaffolding can also grant access to the larger ships, from which the characters can work their way to <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="fa57a4db-398b-48e7-93cf-66c809549534">Dangerous Business</span>. The players might also devise any number of ways to talk their way on board. Dran Enterprises is often hiring, so the characters could pose as expert sailors or specialized consultants. Give the players and characters the freedom to develop a plan, gather information, and fail or succeed spectacularly!</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a6c223f1-e54a-4640-b20c-453dee36d83e">If any of the guards see the characters as a threat, they shout out, raising the alarm and imposing one failure point. The alarm alerts all other guards on the docks, and can draw an endless supply of reinforcements from other ships over time. As such, the characters should realize quickly that a stand-up fight will involve more foes than they can handle.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9bed10c7-d0d7-4ddf-9373-bf5bc828fe2c">The party can retreat and come back when the heat dies down, but this delay imposes another failure point. Or they can push past any threats to get to <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="4fcc0e6c-8e85-402d-8973-fdc92ec89391">Dangerous Business</span> and the portals within.</p>

Crumpled on the floor before an iron door on the far side of the room, the body of a guard lies in a pool of blood. Standing closed between you and the body, six other oval-shaped iron doors are the only features in the room. Each door has a heavy latch that bears the insignia of Dran Enterprises, but no lock is visible. Above each of the iron doors, a differently shaped and colored glowing stone is set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b19536f3-bee9-4bc5-b6de-619919ecaa93">The characters can examine the dead guard or investigate the doors and stones. However, the amount of time they have to do so depends on whether they had other guards in pursuit. If the characters were pursued, give them a round or two to investigate the portal nexus, then have an increasing number of guards burst into the area each round, forcing the characters to enter a portal.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="abd46a29-ff96-4e86-8be1-25e4294ce2ad">If the characters infiltrated the ship without raising the alarm, they have five minutes before they hear a guard patrol approaching. If they leave this area to go back onto the deck of <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="71c4dc75-466b-4c24-9f02-3fd988390fde">Dangerous Business</span> for any reason, they immediately attract the attention of nearby guards.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="90e96653-8870-447a-b9d2-d5770c04d7b6">The dead guard is a male half-orc. Lying on his chest is a black business card bearing unintelligible symbols. More notable is that the unfortunate guard’s brain has been removed from his shattered skull. The guard was killed by the mind flayer leading the Six operatives (see “<a title="Portal 4" href="#Portal4AmidtheRigging" data-content-chunk-id="ca39a7e8-87f4-4895-b193-2ace3c98d26b">Portal 4</a>” and later for more information). The condition of the guard’s head makes it impossible to talk to him with <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="8d639d00-3a12-4e6d-b32f-96e0cef819f3"><a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2259-speak-with-dead" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2259-tooltip">speak with dead</a></span>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="97c08f73-4eed-4aab-94ca-f65b9d9cd8d3">Aside from his grievous head wound, the guard’s body is untouched except where his shirt is torn over his chest. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check confirms that a brooch or pin was ripped from that location. If a character thinks to check, the size of the round metal pin claimed from Hoffman after the fight with the Dran Enterprises strike team matches the size of the torn hole. (If the characters didn’t claim the pin from the strike team and you haven’t already arranged for a replacement to be found, this guard has a second pin in his pocket.)</p>
<h4 id="PortalDoors" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="d72987c6-3688-49a7-9363-ecba5ec53c2c"><a href="#PortalDoors" data-content-chunk-id="ddf94066-7a62-4a25-afe4-4131577cea90"></a>Portal Doors</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3ecea015-6f01-48b4-b99d-edc73abb311c">Each portal door is made of reinforced iron. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check reveals that the doors are mundane, but that each is magically trapped.

If a latch is opened by anyone not wearing the round metal pin bearing the symbol of Dran Enterprises, the trap goes off. Each creature within the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Each trap can be disarmed with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check or a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bea8ffb2-b8cf-4e1a-b587-7ed7e6adaa83">Each of the seven doors has a glowing semiprecious stone above it, carved into a different shape: a green turquoise square, a red feldspar triangle, a white pearl circle, a purple amethyst oval, a blue aquamarine rectangle, a black hematite pentagon, and an orange tiger-eye hexagon. A <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="cc62d5f1-8203-49f4-a98e-6c264c84c8d0"><a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2065-detect-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2065-tooltip">detect magic</a></span> spell reveals an aura of conjuration on the space beyond each door and on each of the stones.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b6d4e78d-5c5b-40dd-b5cc-29e53e80b83c">The stones are coded markers indicating which doors lead to specific portals. That coding is changed regularly, with the portals reassigned to different locations and the stones swapped around to help keep their destinations a secret. As such, a portal still functions if its stone is removed, and a stone can be reattached to a door with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check. Placing a stone over a different door makes it harder for the operatives of the Six to know which doors they’ve already gone through as they make use of the portal network. Swapping one or more stones thus removes one of the party’s failure points. If the players don’t work out that the stones can be moved, a character infers this with a successful DC 14 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d93f90bc-4172-40ee-9280-279a6f463726">Each portal door leads to a different encounter. Opening any door transports all characters in the portal nexus into the area beyond, with the entrance portal disappearing behind them. The characters must navigate the scene that takes place in the new location, then find an exit portal (another iron door identical to the doors in the nexus) to return to the portal nexus. (Portal 1 is an exception, bringing the characters back automatically.) Eventually, the characters find the portal leading to Dran Enterprises’ headquarters in this way.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="732848fb-ddab-49e8-b63b-49d7b5cb1f88">As an advanced security measure, the magic of the portal network prevents a creature from gaining access to the headquarters on board <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="948772a0-121d-4423-89bf-c1e90ed9557f">The Maverick</span> without a certain amount of experience traversing the network. As such, the first three portals the characters access will never lead to the headquarters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fd8fb216-4b26-4838-8e2a-e52f88086119">The current destinations of the portals are noted on the Portals table. You can choose encounters you favor, or roll on the table to see where the characters end up, rerolling any locations already visited. For the first three destinations, roll a d6 to prevent the characters from reaching <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="1caeff0d-6988-45f2-8248-3b21d607a2dc">The Maverick</span>. For subsequent destinations, roll a d8. Alternatively, you can allow the characters to reach the headquarters ship (see “<a title="On Board The Maverick" href="#OnBoardTheMaverick" data-content-chunk-id="8f95ca38-e474-42a5-baf7-91614e799269">On Board&nbsp;<em>The Maverick</em></a>” below) any time after they’ve returned from three other destinations.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0353d651-1085-4f92-9e53-d30b9855c4da">A month ago, an encounter with operatives of the Six led Dran Enterprises to try to fight that group using its own dark magic. Sadly, that attempt failed, and this portal now remains tied to a pocket dimension channeling the power of the Far Realm. Danger lurks on the other side of the door, whose stone has been marked as off limits for Dran Enterprises employees. If a character opens this door, read:</p>

The door vanishes and you stand within an impossible scene. The deck of a ship opens up around you, but the shifting sea to all sides is the color of bruised flesh, roiling beneath a clear sky filled with unfamiliar constellations. Suddenly the door to the ship’s main cabin explodes out in a pulse of sickly ethereal light. With a horrid slurping sound, writhing tentacles spill forth through the open doorway and lash toward you.</p>

A grassy slope leads down to the banks of a slow-moving river. A number of barges decorated in bright colors move up and down the river, bearing merchants crying out to attract customers. Those customers move from the river bank to the nearest barge, then carefully hop from barge to barge until they reach the merchant they want. On the opposite bank, you can see a small outhouse set with an oval iron door.</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="7be95aa0-3c96-4052-94a9-62e2c402a805">A flash of light draws your attention to the right, where some fifty feet away from you, another group exits a portal that vanishes behind them. The group consists of five humans and a tall, purple-skinned creature. That creature’s face has tentacles where its mouth should be — with those tentacles oddly tied into a stylish handlebar mustache. The creature wordlessly looks at two archers accompanying it, who draw their bows. Its three other companions break into a run toward the riverbank as the creature vanishes with a popping sound.</p>

At the start of each round, a barge moves either left or right 1d4 × 5 feet, either drifting with the current or being poled against it. The movement of the barges adds an unpredictable element to the characters’ attempts to get across the river.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="88db7ccc-1be9-432f-8989-5a4a94552945">Each barge holds a merchant and 1d4 − 1 customers, and all its area counts as difficult terrain. Characters in one barge can jump to a barge within 5 feet without an ability check. However, each barge is filled with different wares, so that some of the barges require checks by both the characters and the Six operatives to successfully cross them. See the Barge Contents table for more information.</p>

</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a37199b4-3670-4e8e-952e-3a23839dc8ff">Bracus takes the characters’ measure during the conversation. However, as long as the characters stop short of killing the lizardfolk immediately, the imminent appearance of the Six convinces him that the enemy of his enemy is now his friend. Reaching into his hoards­person <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/703697-living-loot-satchel" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/703697-tooltip">living loot satchel</a>, Bracus retrieves the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="a7c9916f-a40e-4909-a745-72e026c0c600"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705889-chronolometer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705889-tooltip">chronolometer</a></span> and the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="9bab1d0c-5c66-490d-bd68-34cb98580d46"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705903-dimensional-loop" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705903-tooltip">dimensional loop</a></span>.

Szorrulax prioritizes killing Bracus during the fight, forcing the characters to try to save the Dran Enterprises employee. If Bracus is killed, Szorrulax flees with his <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/703697-living-loot-satchel" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/703697-tooltip">living loot&nbsp;satchel</a>&nbsp;and the orrery components at once. If the characters save Bracus, defeat the Six operatives, and force Szorrulax to flee, they gain the components and the information noted above.

<p data-content-chunk-id="3aff069d-1b5f-4d0e-b429-9d48f61b7fc7">If the Six operatives arrive at the headquarters first, Szorrulax easily defeats and kills Bracus. When the characters arrive, Szorrulax is claiming Dran Enterprises’ two components, having destroyed the lizardfolk’s <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/703697-living-loot-satchel" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/703697-tooltip">living loot&nbsp;satchel</a>&nbsp;to empty its contents.

<p data-content-chunk-id="0c7aea1e-e35f-48d1-bf25-4ca8178fc4af">All is not lost, though. Once the characters defeat the remaining foes, they can investigate the cabin.

It mentions the dwarves of Horn Enclave as being noted for their work of securing items of great value. Written in the margin is the note: “The wheel of stars, hidden by its creator.” They also find the treasure noted below, since Szorrulax doesn’t have the time to take it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a864843c-4c12-4fff-91ef-b1d6efc7bcb3">In battle, Szorrulax uses Mind Blast on as many characters as possible, making sure that Bracus is in the blast if the lizardfolk is alive.

Just as importantly, they’ve learned that Dran Enterprises isn’t the real villain behind the attacks on Acquisitions Incorporated franchises. If the characters spoke to Bracus or obtained the book from the lizardfolk’s satchel, they also have a solid lead indicating that Horn Enclave holds the final orrery component. If they failed to talk to Bracus and have not yet deciphered the book, see “<a title="Enter Flabbergast" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/hide-and-seek#EnterFlabbergast" data-content-chunk-id="98677b50-3809-45d3-80ac-256dfd492893">Enter Flabbergast</a>” in the next episode to bring them up to speed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3e0cd725-470f-4019-b845-9a239e043fca">When the characters complete the journey from Luskan back to their headquarters, they find their half-orc majordomo in a great mood.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="dc8df17e-c0b7-4aee-8bc1-96de2b4db761">As the characters attain 5th level, the franchise attains rank 2! You and the players should all spend some time in the “<a title="Franchise Advancement" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseAdvancement" data-content-chunk-id="f02e1ddf-8791-4d8f-97ba-0e2b7b789c20">Franchise Advancement</a>” and “<a title="Company Positions" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise#CompanyPositions" data-content-chunk-id="6ca71ed1-0c57-4123-85b5-07cdce7bc5a8">Company Positions</a>” sections of chapter 2 to read up on the exciting improvements for the franchise, for its headquarters, and for the characters as their company positions yield even more powerful benefits.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e0191299-0dcb-4a8a-b689-7cf084803f08">All the characters’ hard work and luck to date is about to pay off in the form of headquarters upgrades! The “<a title="Franchise Advancement" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseAdvancement" data-content-chunk-id="38326ca2-03ca-4458-bb3a-a9ad446ba7e5">Franchise Advancement</a>” section in chapter 2 has details of the cosmetic, expansion, transportation, and weapon options available to the characters for their headquarters. The available upgrades can cover literally any features that you and the players decide on, but always keep in mind the ways in which the events and developments of the adventure might drive those upgrades.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="98dac58d-fcd1-4bd9-9ad1-feb82a6e4ba6">For example, the expansion option available to the headquarters might amount to simply digging out more space beneath Tresendar Manor. But it also might arise as a result of the franchise moving its headquarters to the Silent Sound lighthouse — or even claiming both sites as a joint headquarters. That latter option is even easier to set up if the characters’ possession of the orrery and its components allows them to channel teleportation magic into their headquarters as their transportation option.</p>
<h4 id="HiringStaff" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="9ca41e78-4ef6-4329-848a-54273feed383"><a href="#HiringStaff" data-content-chunk-id="d272545d-cb0f-4f6c-97d0-701005e75d8e"></a>Hiring Staff</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="98e1139c-d6cd-4cc7-ad9c-4ad69625e0b4">At rank 2, the franchise gains four additional untrained hirelings and one skilled hireling, allowing the characters to hire new staff to meet their needs. Such hires can be done in-character if the players enjoy those kinds of scenes — and the franchise could even set up a job fair for potential employees at a local market or tavern. If the characters have made any allies or hired NPCs during preceding episodes, those NPCs might be taken on as official staff members at this time. This is also an excellent time to bring in an NPC the characters enjoyed interacting with, making that character an official part of the franchise family.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6d96467b-25db-4464-853f-131694321d8d"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="6a7fdf75-4cd0-4064-9281-167daa6c76d2">Crew.</span> In addition to staff, ten crew are hired to help with the franchise. In addition to working on the upkeep of the franchise headquarters, these NPCs might be part of the team necessary to operate a mobile headquarters (sailors for a sailing ship or airship, arcane engineers for a walking statue or teleporting tavern, and so forth).</p>
<h4 id="MakingFranchiseAdvancementRewarding" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="04cbb3e0-db45-4fad-9b2f-59754e11d659"><a href="#MakingFranchiseAdvancementRewarding" data-content-chunk-id="577ef511-6f4c-4c28-8eff-4da497d281d9"></a>Making Franchise Advancement Rewarding</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1a50d226-04f8-48d8-8793-89b2c839e259">Advancing a franchise is meant to be a major accomplishment for the players and their characters. This is a moment to celebrate and reward the party’s deeds and to help the players get excited about designing and selecting their franchise upgrades. Some players might focus on mechanics, while others enjoy the creativity of dreaming up how a franchise headquarters looks and feels. There is no wrong way to approach the process.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="105e4f82-ff37-4cf0-8224-0fc02526e221">Headquarters customization is deliberately open-ended to allow for creativity. This might create some work for you as the DM, since you adjudicate the characters’ customization choices. A good rule of thumb is to allow the players full creative freedom while sticking to the mechanics (however loose) presented by the rules in chapter 2. If the characters want their headquarters to be a giant bouncing rubber ball, let them go for it! In the end, that option can still make use of the general idea and mechanics of a walking statue headquarters, even if the description of the headquarters’ appearance and movement is vastly different.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c9d66886-6a64-456a-80c0-7876dc85af2e">Once the characters are done planning their upgrades, Gilda the majordomo takes over the mundane task of hiring contractors and starting construction. The length of time it takes for upgrades to be completed is up to you, but one to two months is reasonable. During that period, the characters have plenty of opportunity to engage in downtime activities and franchise tasks.</p>
<h2 id="FranchiseDowntime" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="e778a898-f9fd-480b-9b83-974165f747ac"><a href="#FranchiseDowntime" data-content-chunk-id="41eacfc0-1972-45b2-b9d1-2d98addf8ccd"></a>Franchise Downtime</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="007b7ab2-4f3b-4cb4-bf23-79ab89c17189">During the break between episode 4 and episode 5, the characters are likely to be focused on deciding their next move. The urgency of seeking out the final orrery component at Horn Enclave depends on whether the party successfully claimed the two components held by Dran Enterprises, or whether they watched the mind flayer Szorrulax vanish with the components in hand. Moreover, knowing that the Six are behind the attacks on Acquisitions Incorporated, the characters can learn everything Head Office knows about that faction — but what is known about the Six amounts to little more than rumors and their somewhat-trademark-infringing logo. You can tease any of the information from “<a title="Factions and Rivals" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/player-options#FactionsandRivals" data-content-chunk-id="08955c2f-fe71-4677-988f-8fd15b4ff4bd">Factions and Rivals</a>” in chapter 3 as you see fit.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d1de91b9-9880-4bfa-9b04-b0d0ef80f4e2">Since the characters are now running a rank 2 franchise, they can assign two franchise tasks to be run by staff in addition to any personal downtime activities they wish to engage in. If those downtime activities or franchise tasks involve actively seeking connections to and information about Horn Enclave, that information can be revealed in any number of ways.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0f24785a-8f0f-487c-a823-088d8b9fbf53">All the activities mentioned in this section are introduced or talked about in the “<a title="Franchise Tasks and Downtime" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseTasksandDowntime" data-content-chunk-id="f72d6405-ecaf-4086-9f89-aaa6fe732ab7">Franchise Tasks and Downtime</a>” section in chapter 2.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="46a40a09-a3a2-45dd-9101-99f0fa057976">Characters or staff engaging in the research, marketeering, or scrutineering activities can uncover all kinds of connections to the dwarven Clan Horn and its fabled fortress. The characters might connect with customers or allies who know of caravans that make regular runs to the enclave, or who have heard rumors about local nobles or mages who have left relics there to be safeguarded.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b00dfdd-57c5-451b-acd7-4e9bdce4147b">The carousing activity can bring the characters into closer contact with merchants or nobles connected to Horn Enclave. One of those is a company called Dhargun Ironworks, who are sending a caravan to the enclave within the next month for the unlikely purpose of celebrating a wedding. <a title="Episode 5" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/hide-and-seek" data-content-chunk-id="8aedb311-403d-44d3-afef-5fbca9b67b2e">Episode 5</a> has much more information on the Dhargun wedding — and the unique opportunity it offers for the characters to gain access to the enclave.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="14e26edc-b3d7-45b3-b94d-40f78baba6d2">You can use the following guidelines to give the characters a quick overview of Horn Enclave. And as they learn about the enclave, they’ll also discover its storied and problematic (for them) connections to Acquisitions Incorporated:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="12842666-ac4a-4685-843c-17415541f712">

<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="e22da004-ae87-4bb0-b1a8-5fe126ad48ff">The dwarves of Horn Enclave are no friends to Acquisitions Incorporated.

</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6653d4d2-c6a9-4514-8c84-04e3b4158e9c">If the characters double down on research, you can share additional specific details from the “<a title="Horn Enclave" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/hide-and-seek#HornEnclave" data-content-chunk-id="1405d0e5-585a-4321-8894-246e45399fb8">Horn Enclave</a>” section of episode 5 if you like.

Thankfully, Head Office has some assistance it can offer in that regard as the characters plan their incursion!</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="59429321-1ff4-46d1-b5a9-f14c82b03487">The characters (now 5th level) know that Horn Enclave is the hiding place of the last unclaimed clockwork component of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="cc09fcc1-83be-4d44-90ee-c71910376050"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705876-tooltip">Orrery of the Wanderer</a></span>, called the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="202bd45f-824a-4a09-898e-6f1a4ed6595c"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705976-wheel-of-stars" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705976-tooltip">wheel of stars</a></span>. They also know that Horn Enclave is all but impossible to get into. Thankfully, Acquisitions Incorporated has the party’s back.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4b995ec0-5fae-4b57-b176-5a20d0421f61">With the help of Acq Inc fixer Flabbergast, the characters make use of a unique ritual that lets them swap bodies with a group of dwarves heading to the enclave for a wedding. This gives the characters access to the vaults, but the deception creates complications as they struggle with the deep secrets of their possessed dwarves and must try to keep the wedding on track.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7494d442-a101-41a9-b13e-8774b9f28b97">Accessing the orrery component vault reveals valuable information from the clockwork creatures that guard the vault. But the characters are ultimately chagrined to discover that the component isn’t there, with the vault set up as a ruse to distract anyone attempting to rebuild the orrery. Still, the orrery’s creator — a wizard named Lottie — wishes to meet anyone savvy enough to have come this far, provided they share her interest in ensuring that the orrery’s power is never used.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8b380ebf-9b3b-4763-907f-55fd1f72b111">Traveling in style in a borrowed <a class="tooltip-hover vehicles-tooltip" href="/vehicles/battle-balloon" data-tooltip-href="/vehicles/7-tooltip">battle balloon</a>, the characters journey to Lottie’s sanctum in the Greypeak Mountains. But en route, the franchise is intercepted by airships belonging to the Six. The characters get their first glimpse of Splugoth the Returned, one of the Six’s mysterious members, and the point goblin for the plan to claim the orrery. In fact, the attack is only a distraction, providing cover for an attempt to steal the orrery housing and the components the characters have obtained.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="390c6b2e-f6a0-4137-a753-ad7a5e8a09e4">Continuing across the Greypeaks, the characters reach the ruined town of Fortune and the casino resort known as Lottie’s Palace. There, they discover that Lottie is a lich whose exclusive retreat holds secrets and deadly threats in equal measure. With no hope of winning a fight against Lottie and her numerous lich allies, the battle must be one of wits as the characters attempt to convince her to help Acquisitions Incorporated, tell the orrery’s origin story, and provide the final orrery component.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="23d8a883-3961-483f-8f6d-f992b22d5a68">While the characters sought out information on Horn Enclave, word of their investigations reached Head Office. Alternatively, if the characters couldn’t figure out the connection between the orrery and the enclave, word of that mystery reaches Head Office instead. Either way, the characters receive an unexpected visitor, offering some unexpected assistance.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="49953696-f6a3-4a76-8e9c-ccecf2a4a04b"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/359358-flabbergast" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/359358-tooltip">Flabbergast</a>, wizard and majordomo to Head Office (see <a title="appendix A" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/acq-inc" data-content-chunk-id="12a23e3f-0983-4b17-ba07-5707d2c89460">appendix A</a>), has been dispatched to assist the characters with the goal of gaining the final orrery component from Horn Enclave. Mister Snibbly has no agenda, beyond making it clear that he thinks the characters leave much to be desired. If the characters haven’t yet figured out that the enclave is where the component is stored, Flabbergast can fill in the missing bits of what they know, all the while chiding the characters for missing important clues. If the characters haven’t yet heard about the Dhargun Ironworks caravan’s imminent trip to Horn Enclave (see “<a title="Dhargun Ironworks" href="#DhargunIronworks" data-content-chunk-id="c45aab3b-3f8f-4ef8-a7f4-6c32592f81e7">Dhargun Ironworks</a>” below), he can relay that information as well.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="88c10083-14bc-4039-83d5-3d4f781d03b5">Flabbergast can also provide or reinforce the backstory regarding Acquisitions Incorporated’s well-known incursion of the enclave. In response to any discussion of that past mission, the wizard sums up the party’s position as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="adventure-read-aloud-text" data-content-chunk-id="d6597a5e-a5e2-4929-86f6-176379419a41">
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="f0d81835-30bd-48d3-9427-0d7575a7dd4c">“As you might well guess, gentlepersons, infiltrating Horn Enclave by traditional means would be difficult at best. And if you were discovered, then your status as agents of Acquisitions Incorporated would place you in grave peril. Though likely not for long.” Flabbergast sighs. Mister Snibbly spits up a hairball in disgust. “The dwarves of Clan Horn would kill you immediately, is what I’m saying. As such, Omin Dran has requested that I offer my assistance. Have you ever heard of the <span class="Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="437e275d-fa02-4e38-91e1-1723bb8c1a59">ritual of astral transmogrification</span>?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b2b838a0-1b31-4356-81f8-29f597c2902d">The characters will not have heard of the legendary ritual Flabbergast names, which has long been lost to history. Its magic allows characters to enter a dreamlike state, leaving their bodies safely behind while their souls temporarily possess other bodies. Flabbergast explains that the ritual’s creator died long ago, and its components are now unknown. But if the characters can help him determine and track down those components, Flabbergast can provide them the perfect means to infiltrate the dwarven stronghold. By taking possession of some other group with legitimate business in the enclave, the characters can wander its vaults at their leisure without arousing suspicion. Well, maybe just a little suspicion. But it’ll all be fine.</p>
<h4 id="SeekingtheRitual" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="1f531353-dd67-436b-8fac-7e62846f68c2"><a href="#SeekingtheRitual" data-content-chunk-id="6953efae-2488-419f-ab77-0f4f687804b8"></a>Seeking the Ritual</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c80942a8-e6ea-45d5-8291-0d91ba6fcd16">You decide what form the ritual’s components might take, from ancient verses and arcane inscriptions, to rare herbs and alchemical reagents, to any other obscure bit of magical paraphernalia in between. You also decide how much time and what specific effort is necessary for the characters and Flabbergast to determine and track down those components. This might involve short side quests of your own devising, or having NPCs conveniently turn out to be a source of some components. The Splintfig sisters from episode 2 are good candidates, as is Hoobur Gran’Shoop if the party stayed on good terms with the psychopathic gnome.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da1a1f4c-b99f-4d09-b2ea-452a29a5c4ae">If the characters take more downtime to seek out the ritual’s components, they might use marketeering to find customers or brokers of magical supplies and rare spell components. The shady business practice activity could alternatively turn up connections to those who dabble in more dangerous and secretive magic.</p>
<h4 id="DoesAnyoneHaveaBetterIdea" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="fc05eead-9933-4e21-bc59-382122a4979e"><a href="#DoesAnyoneHaveaBetterIdea" data-content-chunk-id="7e1677bb-103a-449b-b132-5e8ab9dafc08"></a>Does Anyone Have a Better Idea?</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5fbe4024-168c-4d54-bc84-fbe8b0f0c1a8">This episode assumes that the characters make use of Flabbergast’s ritual to enter Horn Enclave, but the information presented on the enclave is easily adaptable to other approaches. As such, the players and characters are absolutely free to come up with other methods of seeking the final orrery component. Even though the dwarves of Clan Horn remain furious at Acquisitions Incorporated and the enclave’s defenses are formidable, the players should always have the last say regarding the characters’ actions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="456d67ed-eba0-443f-89d0-5488baac32c6">Workable alternatives include such plans as the characters secreting themselves aboard the Dhargun Ironworks caravan, posing as last-minute wedding guests, or masquerading as others making a vault deposit. They might attempt to convince the guards that their appointment time was somehow overlooked, pay someone off to learn the song of the day that is the password into the enclave, or any other plan they dream up.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9b62a2e3-63df-4f23-8f96-0da7a0fd6149">If another plan is hatched, Flabbergast successfully seeks out the components for the astral transmogrification ritual by himself, strictly as a backup plan for the characters. He’s been ordered to journey to the enclave with the party and watch over the operation, and provides one of the characters with a small stone token bearing the symbol of Acquisitions Incorporated.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="641111d8-000f-446f-8499-c77804191c1b">If the characters need the ritual performed in an emergency, they can activate the token by speaking the command word “Whippoorwill.” Flabbergast then uses a crystal ball to locate them and perform the ritual. By possessing the bodies of dwarf guards and Clan Horn operatives, the characters should be able to successfully defend their own magically slumbering bodies and get them out of the enclave safely. And possessing the token also puts the characters in a position where the ritual might be cast accidentally if they don’t use it to enter the enclave, strictly for your amusement.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b7adef6c-b590-4e03-b2af-825a60480e46">The Dhargun Ironworks caravan bound for Horn Enclave is set to reach the main gates in the morning, then depart again that evening. With the characters able to enter the enclave in the bodies of the caravan’s wedding party, they can locate the vault, secure the orrery component, and leave when the caravan departs at the end of the day. Should be easy, right?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="73d45b06-fd64-41b6-9adf-06082fe22af3">With their mobile headquarters, the characters should have a straightforward time traveling from Phandalin to the mountains northeast of Silverymoon. Or if the players are dying for some action, you can use wandering monsters to liven the journey up. Once close enough, the characters can set their franchise down in a safe location away from prying eyes, then approach the wide dirt road leading to Horn Enclave. From the safety of cover alongside the road, Flabbergast casts his ritual when the Dhargun Ironworks caravan is spotted. See “<a title="Flabbergast’s Ritual" href="#FlabbergastsRitual" data-content-chunk-id="d6177fb6-4ee7-4611-946f-2e7a038e6e10">Flabbergast’s Ritual</a>” in the “<a title="11:00 AM" href="#1100AMArrival" data-content-chunk-id="ad4917e3-7d7e-437b-8067-4145a22c8acb">11:00 <span class="Body-Time-Faux-Small-Caps" data-content-chunk-id="c6b551f5-dd76-4c0f-a8ce-a2dbcc8d7478">AM</span></a>” section below.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="671cb889-eeeb-4616-b293-49b5e0720707">The challenges in this section of the adventure arise from the goals of the caravan members and how they intersect with those of the characters. Once Flabbergast’s ritual is activated, each character possesses one of the NPCs in the caravan. However, each NPC has a secret goal that remains dormant until the goal is triggered during a specific scene. When the secret is triggered, the DM tells the player the secret and informs them that their character is compelled to fulfill that secret goal. For maximum entertainment value, wait until the triggering scene to tell the players about any secret goals.</p>
<h4 id="TheCaravan" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="5b3e71a6-f3e5-4cc7-be08-7684812a3e7b"><a href="#TheCaravan" data-content-chunk-id="e4bb642b-a9dd-419c-84a2-4e91e6e6cdd0"></a>The Caravan</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a0ba6dab-a8b9-4a7d-b3e2-4eba35dda50c">The caravan is made up of three horse-drawn carriages and bears sixteen dwarves to Horn Enclave for a wedding that will unite the Dhargun and Thunderwind clans. Both dwarven families are quite different, with the Dharguns favoring commerce and the Thunderwinds dedicated to warfare. But the unlikely love between Gwendolyn Dhargun and Tannus Thunderwind has brought them together.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53cabd1f-834b-4e47-8229-24d1ad6b9027">The reason for holding the wedding at Horn Enclave is that the caravan also bears valuable gifts provided by both families, which will be placed in a vault until Gwendolyn and Tannus complete their honeymoon and decide where they’ll spend their lives as a couple. (The pressure from both families to choose one clan over the other is huge.) Gifts include furniture, art pieces, and other large items, along with adamantine bars worth 5,000 gp, a suit of <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/722094-mithral-half-plate-1" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/722094-tooltip">+1 mithral half plate</a> inscribed with the insignia of Dhargun Ironworks, and a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="59fb5a8a-d05c-4e2f-9bb4-6360572b8828"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4584-belt-of-dwarvenkind" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4584-tooltip">belt of dwarvenkind</a> </span>bearing the insignia of the Thunderwind Clan.</p>

Gwendolyn is an excellent metallurgist and runs the business with superb aplomb. She worries that her professional success overshadows her betrothed, Tannus, who until recently was a raving barbarian bent only on war. She believes that Tannus has changed. Her goal is to convince him that she believes in him and is proud of the person he has become. Gwendolyn carries no weapons with her for the wedding.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e1ad187a-e27c-46d4-a709-9591623c4417">Gwendolyn’s secret revolves around wanting to prove that she believes that Tannus has truly changed, but that she still respects his past.

His only love used to be the battlefield, but that changed when he met Gwendolyn. Everything about her was peaceful, tranquil, and better than him. He has since sworn to give up violence, become a partner to Gwendolyn, and help grow the ironworks. His goal is to convince Gwendolyn’s family that he is good enough for her, and that he has given up his violent ways. Tannus carries no weapons with him for the wedding.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="04a6ec19-45c6-471b-9191-9f9ff5880d5b">Tannus’s secret involves wanting to prove himself to Gwendolyn. He must abstain from violence all day long, no matter what happens.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="603c16dd-d91e-4683-8b05-23778769f344">Gorat’s secret involves his goal to deliver a toast during the dining hall celebration that will call Tannus to battle, to see once and for all whether his friend has changed.

However, these secrets can still be relevant factors in the episode. While the characters are in Horn Enclave, they will likely interact with members of the wedding party, and might even be invited to join the festivities or ride in the caravan when the group departs. At opportune moments, an NPC might befriend a character and ask them for help with their secret goal. And, of course, if things start going badly at any point, the characters can say “Whippoorwill” into the stone token given to them by Flabbergast to have him perform the ritual — or they might have the ritual cast for them whether they want it or not.

Clan Horn is led by Lady Kira Horn and Lord Zardak Horn. Zardak is getting on in years, nearly blind, and increasingly defers to Lady Kira’s decisions. Rizwin Horn, their daughter, is a capable diplomat and negotiator who greets all guests to the enclave.

The doors are opened by iron golems, who do so only when they hear a set of bagpipes play the song of the day that is the passphrase into the enclave. A dwarf outside the main doors plays this song each time an approved caravan arrives. The doors lead to the Hall of War, a large room containing a terrifying construct — the aptly named slaughterstone eviscerator — ready to defend the enclave in times of need.

<p data-content-chunk-id="1a04c6a4-62ba-4b53-acc8-4fabf8c13b76">The Wedding Itinerary table provides an overview of the day’s events, which are part of your recipe for hilarity and disaster. At the appointed times, guests move from one location to another and begin a specific event. If an NPC has a secret, it activates during the appropriate event. Take the player of an NPC aside and inform them of their secret goal, and explain that the importance of the goal to the body they inhabit means that they are compelled to try to accomplish this goal. Players can share their secret goal with other individual players once they learn it, as long as sharing it would not contradict that goal. For example, the player running Gwendolyn should not share their goal with the player running Tannus, because the whole point is for Gwendolyn to surprise her new husband with the gift. Likewise, the player running Rala does not share her goal with anyone having an interest in what’s in the vaults.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91acecd1-8832-410a-ae58-6c12ef17c1ae">In any free time between events, or by sneaking away from events, the characters can try to realize their primary goal of finding the final orrery component. The time of each event in the itinerary is known to all members of the caravan, so the characters can plan when to perform their heist. Of course, the secret goals of the wedding guests might impact those plans.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ecb1b50e-66f2-4088-83ac-e0875af312cb">Unlike a typical dungeon infiltration, the layout of the enclave is not as important as the itinerary. Players are not expected to turn this into a dungeon crawl, if only because Horn Enclave is teeming with guards and other dwarves. Any wedding guests seen in private chambers or away from the events of the wedding itinerary are given a warning the first time, then questioned more carefully and searched each time thereafter. Evidence of theft or other lawbreaking could result in a guest being supervised by a guard until the caravan departs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37dab2c2-3d08-4f3c-960c-7ee758e4a037">If the dwarves of Horn Enclave somehow find out that the characters are members of Acquisitions Incorporated, permanent incarceration or execution are among the best possible outcomes. Ideally, the players coming up with hilarious ways to escape will allow them to prevent such fates. Even if the characters have not used Flabbergast’s ritual, it should be clear to them that paying attention to the wedding’s schedule makes it easier to find times when they can more easily reach the vaults.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b2af0367-9bb3-417f-8d98-635c6eb913fe">The Dhargun Ironworks caravan rolls up the mountain and approaches the gates to Horn Enclave. Excitement runs high among the dwarf wedding guests, both for the coming events and for their first trip to the storied enclave. Read or paraphrase the following:</p>

<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="efef0df2-72bc-4ff1-b529-adf94c2a56cd">On a gray morning with cloudy skies, three horse-drawn carriages roll up the mountain, heavy with cargo. Dwarves can be seen steering the carriages and peering out of windows, and their voices carry a sense of excitement and wonder as they approach Horn Enclave.</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="523132c6-03dd-4dfd-b77b-ff5075411a17">The stronghold is indeed awe-inspiring. A massive arched stone entrance — a marvelous work of art in and of itself — leads into the mountain. Four sets of heavy iron portcullises stand fast before the caravan’s approach, with a set of stone doors taller than a giant set behind them to mark the interior entrance to the enclave. The caravan stops and waits as a dwarf with bagpipes steps forward before the portcullis gates.</p>

As the magic takes effect, each character’s consciousness departs its normal body and enters that of a named caravan NPC. Go down the list of caravan NPCs in the order presented in the “<a title="Wedding Guests" href="#WeddingGuests" data-content-chunk-id="973b6691-e062-4e76-9f05-8a3e87b702ed">Wedding Guests</a>” section above, assigning each guest to a random player until each character has an NPC. (If your group has more than seven players, you’ll need to come up with additional NPCs and secrets.) Describe the NPCs and their relationships to all the players, but do not divulge any NPC’s secret until it is triggered as described in each itinerary section.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="95c2c436-5846-4fbb-af9e-e29b7ce0cdfe">While the ritual is in play, characters have full control of their host bodies and enjoy all capabilities of their new forms, including weapon and skill proficiencies, vision, languages, and spellcasting. They can also apply proficiency bonuses or expertise for skills their characters have, albeit using the ability scores of their new form. However, any spellcasting characters discover that they have left their original magic in their original brains.</p>

However, several NPCs have secrets triggered by events rather than a specific time. For example, you would provide Tannus’s player with the groom’s secret if at any time Tannus is about to swing a weapon to damage a creature. (You can decide whether to allow Tannus to fight to protect himself or others, but should encourage the player running him to think about creative nonattack ways to influence the fight.) Provide Amara her secret if she sees her daughter Gwendolyn in danger. Provide Jormun his secret if he sees Gwendolyn or Tannus in danger.</p>

Downplaying a secret goal can feel like the best path to securing the orrery component and winning, while some players might blurt out their secret goal with the excuse that their character would try to do so.</p>
<p class="Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body" data-content-chunk-id="5f9699f8-1336-4edb-a697-d11c4a436a35">Encourage players to embrace the roles and enjoy the concept of momentarily placing their NPC’s secret goal as a top priority. Players might be more willing to take this on if you let them know that the scenario takes their conflicting priorities into account. Indeed, these scenes place an emphasis on situational comedy over numerical challenge. So players should think of the role as their challenge — can they succeed at playing someone they’re not?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c29fcdc1-67c2-4f08-827e-f77003889fce">The caravan is met in the Hall of War by Rizwin Horn, daughter of Lady Kira and Lord Zardak. Rizwin is a capable diplomat and negotiator, and she expects the wedding guests and caravan servants to stick to the areas indicated by the itinerary. She despises Acquisitions Incorporated, and brings the full force of the enclave down upon the characters if she learns they are members of a franchise.</p>

Every surface of the walls, floor, and ceiling is exquisitely carved with runes and bas reliefs depicting dwarves at war. Grand pillars shaped like stone dwarves hold up the ceiling.</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="66581690-7e26-4a0b-98e8-b211ebaeb727">The floor is intricately carved and appears to be inset with stone tiles that can shift, lift, and rotate. Five dwarves are in the process of moving tiles around, as if shaping a massive mosaic. Not far from the dwarves is a large metallic construct with a terrifying number of appendages ending in blades and saws. It is thankfully unmoving.</p>

She reviews the itinerary with all members of the group (see the Wedding Itinerary table) and makes sure everyone understands that they are not free to wander the enclave at will.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="02a70bed-e2e3-4d96-971a-b5f11b186b34">If asked about the construct, Rizwin calls it the slaughterstone eviscerator, and explains that it’s there to protect Horn Enclave. “Moradin help anyone who crosses us,” she says, laughing. The construct can be activated by Ironbeard or Rizwin, or by anyone who accesses the control panel in its belly and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. If the check fails by 5 or more, the construct animates and attacks.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="088474eb-a5b7-4ee6-af6d-e5944908f73a">The slaughterstone eviscerator is a deadly wild card, which might serve as a frightening distraction or be woven into the characters’ outrageous plans.

<p data-content-chunk-id="6f9547e7-0f24-4645-95d7-7e3b1e511815">When all other business is done, Rizwin addresses the wedding party one last time.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="368862dc-50b5-40e7-9ca0-e62669c18a85">Rizwin leads the wedding party through the double doors to the north, through the corridor leading past the barracks where dwarf guards can be seen lounging and training, and to the vaults. The double vault indicated with an “X” on the map is the vault for the wedding gifts, the largest and most valuable of which are deposited at this time. (Characters with a solid background in company history might recall that this is the same vault that the core members of Acquisitions Incorporated once robbed.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ecd137fb-07c6-4518-8c5b-bffe934ae855"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="61d1deb6-5a42-4fdc-a570-6cda63052a31">Vault Doors and Keys. </span>Each vault door is covered in iron bands, lined with lead to prevent scrying, is air- and watertight, and features layers of locks that make opening a vault without its keys nearly impossible. Two keys are required to open a vault door, with one typically held by the enclave and a second by the owner of the vault’s contents. When both keys have been turned in multiple locks, the door opens. While the wedding is in progress, Gorat and Thoman each have one of the keys for the wedding vault.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9177efe6-8b52-4882-879e-6457dcc630ec">The vault holding the orrery component has one of its keys held by Ironbeard. The other key is with Lottie at the end of this episode.

Failing any check requires restarting the process. After three overall failures, the door to the vault gives off a loud ringing noise and four guards come to investigate. The DC is reduced to 10 if the character has one of the vault’s keys. Any character who has read the vault records (found in Ironbeard’s quarters or Lady Kira and Lord Zardak’s quarters) has advantage on checks to open a vault door.</p>

Dealing 40 bludgeoning or force damage to an inner wall creates a hole wide enough for a character to enter another vault. (What kind of attention doing so attracts is left to your determination.) Other means of entering might be possible, including some of the scrolls carried by Two Dry Cloaks the tabaxi (see “<a title="11:30 AM" href="#1130AMTheTavern" data-content-chunk-id="b4526163-949a-40a1-aec0-7ab6e0bed493">11:30 <span class="Body-Time-Faux-Small-Caps" data-content-chunk-id="fb063d15-b04a-4f64-8f20-54f2b263c51a">AM</span></a>”).</p>

The wedding vault is a double vault, with the password set as seen at “Ironbeard’s Entrance” below.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6b30f132-ba4b-48ac-9887-6f58f674513b"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="7d02c1a4-d800-4b8a-b2a4-0f6cf53f88cc">Orrery Vault. </span>The single vault holding the orrery component is immediately northeast of the vault marked “X.” This vault is further detailed in the “<a title="Orrery Vault" href="#OrreryVault" data-content-chunk-id="c51842f5-250f-49d7-895d-c14515434593">Orrery Vault</a>” section below. Discovering which vault holds the component is an important bit of business that the characters must accomplish at some point during the day. Rizwin knows the location, as does Ironbeard, Lady Kira, and Lord Zardak. The contents of all vaults are also noted in the vault records, a copy of which is kept in Ironbeard’s quarters, with another copy in Lady Kira and Lord Zardak’s quarters. A character who has studied the records has advantage on checks to open any vault door.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="950928fc-3f80-48ba-882c-8cd61341e260">When he’s convinced that all is well, Ironbeard asks the couple to set the password they wish to use for the inner door. For the duration of the wedding, the inner door will remain open so that Gorat and Thoman can access the vaults. But Ironbeard explains that afterward, even someone with both keys cannot open the inner vault unless Gwendolyn or Tannus speaks the password.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a5528ba0-1865-41a8-8307-d2490374d28e">If the characters are running Gwendolyn and Tannus, they can set the password as they wish. If the characters are not possessing the wedding guests but are present in the vault, things can get potentially interesting.</p>

Ask any characters within earshot (as they will be if they’re acting as tag-along wedding guests) to make Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) checks, with the highest check overhearing the password. That character gets a moment’s warning of what’s coming.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="28b4f109-d2d6-469f-9d4a-bdd2a2c56d85">In an amazing coincidence, “Whippoorwill” is the phrase Flabbergast set on the stone token to trigger casting the ritual. If the players have come up with a savvy approach to entering the enclave that didn’t make use of the ritual, you don’t need to use this option. But if your group will have fun with it, Flabbergast hears the word spoken and casts the ritual, so that the characters’ bodies slip into a state of slumber as they possess the bodies of the wedding party. What approach the possessed dwarves — now run by the players — might take to explain the characters’ sudden unconsciousness, then safely hide those slumbering bodies away, is up to the players and you.</p>

The northern wall behind the bar is formed entirely of kegs of ale, all of them tapped. Busy servers pour frothy mugs and serve them to the multitude of dwarves already here. As Rizwin steps into the tavern, she claps her hands once and several dwarves quickly clear two central tables for the wedding party and guests. Tall mugs of amber beer are served, while platters loaded with skewers of roasted meat and root vegetables are brought to the table. Drinks and food are on the house!</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="57358612-1a36-4ea9-9ef5-ead6c183a745">For the next two hours, the caravan party enjoys ale and food, toasts Gwendolyn and Tannus, and swaps tall tales. Guests can visit other tables to meet Clan Horn dwarves, so the characters can move around without drawing attention to themselves. Ironbeard and Rizwin are both here, and the characters can speak to them to try to pick up clues as to the location of the orrery component. (Attempts by any characters to hit on Rizwin are made with disadvantage.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8a6ee4af-8275-42b9-ad32-c936eb2bfe14">Many of the Clan Horn dwarves have been drinking heavily. Targeting the heavier drinkers can grant advantage on checks made to pry information from them. While in the tavern, the dwarves are relaxed and won’t react negatively to a failed Charisma check. However, continued failures result in guards being called. Those guards issue a warning against bothering folk not in the wedding party, and might eventually search or incarcerate any individual who continues to cause trouble.</p>

Zardak is half-blind and periodically confers with his wife to make sure he is speaking to the correct person. Both are pleased to have a wedding in their halls, and they engage in small talk to ask polite questions of their guests. Many of those questions involve the business operations of Dhargun Ironworks and the military history of Clan Thunderwind. Thankfully, neither Kira nor Zardak appear to mind if a character isn’t too sure about the answer.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d9e8668f-90e6-4835-8422-ff684411c04d">At a time of your choosing, Lord Zardak appears to notice something odd about one of the characters or the body they inhabit, but this ends up just being his bad eyesight.

Stealing Gorat’s key requires a Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/4-tooltip">Sleight of Hand</a>) check contested by Gorat’s Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check. Gorat has disadvantage on the check from the distraction of the festivities — or, if controlled by a character, he could decide to just hand over the key. Rala must then decide whether to also try to steal Thoman’s key (if he isn’t possessed by a character inspired to give it to her). Having two keys makes opening the door effortless, but the security chief is a cagey and suspicious sort.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fe3f4019-3622-4160-9460-f6127d5c2db8">Once she has at least one key, a DC 10 Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/5-tooltip">Stealth</a>) check allows Rala to exit the tavern without being drawn back into the general merriment by one of the guests. She must then succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/5-tooltip">Stealth</a>) check to make it past the barracks without notice and reach the vaults. Rala could instead do away with stealth and attempt to talk her way past the guards, given that she’s a known member of the wedding party and has the vault key in her possession. Combat is a poor option, however. Each barracks room holds ten dwarves (use the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="3202e16f-8be9-4465-85a0-46eb9c6cdf61"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16915-guard" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16915-tooltip">guard</a> </span>stat block, with the modifications noted for dwarf members of the wedding party).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9089e700-de1b-4932-8e09-6b267a067a36">Rizwin directs the guests out of the tavern and to the guest quarters. Here they can relax, take a nap (and sober up as necessary) before changing into the formal wedding attire waiting for them in their rooms.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a498def9-3a03-402b-b839-5817f95df22e">This time off is a perfect opportunity to figure out where the orrery component is stored and make a move on the vault. Rala’s disappearance might complicate things, but she can reappear just as everyone is entering their chambers. Depending on how the player handles the scene, Rala might not admit to having already been in the wedding vault (and likely has the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="6eb36c4f-6065-4922-9024-ed04867824a0"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4584-belt-of-dwarvenkind" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4584-tooltip">belt of dwarvenkind</a> </span>hidden upon her person). It takes a number of successful ability checks (possibly group checks) to leave the guest quarters, cross the barracks, and reach the vault. Use the same DCs and options provided for Rala in the previous itinerary section as guidelines.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a1f0f314-dc23-43de-bea2-c609e632386e">Once the characters reach the vaults, they must decide how to proceed.

<p data-content-chunk-id="06d3ec81-e7d1-4c5d-ada5-7ad68a594b7e">Dressed in their finest, the members of the Dhargun and Thunderwind families head to the temple. Rizwin leads them south through the Hall of War and east past dwarven residences. Ironbeard exits his quarters to join them, revealing the location of that area if the characters haven’t sussed it out already. The temple is beautifully carved to depict the Mordinsamman (the dwarven pantheon), including fine statues of Moradin, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Berronar Truesilver, and Haela Brightaxe.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="247d16bb-09cd-4f89-b05b-a14141e95ce5">After initial pleasantries, Rizwin indicates to Jormun that he may climb the steps to the dais to begin the ceremony. At this time, Thoman’s secret triggers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e391b2b0-4dfa-40a4-9736-daa0ebf0675a"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="2942ab0a-e694-4211-8c53-fe758cb747e0">Thoman’s Secret. </span>As the ceremony begins, Thoman gets an odd feeling as he recalls hearing Amara worrying about the vault and what might happen to the still-fractious relationship between the families if anything were stolen from it. To appease Amara, he wants to check the vault and report to her if all is not well. This requires borrowing Gorat’s key, which Gorat lends willingly (whether run by a player or not). The mercurial Thunderwind has no concerns that a Dhargun lackey would dare do anything to jeopardize the wedding. However, if Gorat’s key is still missing after being stolen by Rala, the doppelganger will need to quickly arrange to have it found to avoid a sudden catastrophe.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="07c3fe11-cdf5-4eee-bb01-b94e0260e0c6">Thoman won’t return in time to see the vows, so he plans to meet everyone at the celebration in the dining hall. He feels compelled only to report missing items (such as the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="872b5dc5-1ebd-4bbe-b173-958e0f8028de"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4584-belt-of-dwarvenkind" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4584-tooltip">belt of dwarvenkind</a> </span>or anything taken by the characters). If under a player’s control, he need not mention anything else amiss (such as a hole in the wall) as long as the vault’s contents are intact.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f1fb10a3-52b1-4fc1-a5be-68a6f001528a"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="cd85ddc6-27f4-4bcc-a920-2bd6e08a5634">The Ceremony.</span> Jormun would normally provide a fiery ceremony on the virtues of the Mordinsamman, with an emphasis on Clangeddin’s battle prowess. If a character is controlling him, that character can be put on the spot to describe the ceremony and how the dwarves reconcile the different elements of the pantheon (in particular, the balance between gods of war such as Clangeddin and those of marriage and home, such as Berronar Truesilver). Clan Dhargun is pleased by an emphasis on the hearth, while Clan Thunderwind appreciates an emphasis on battle.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5819afa5-ae0a-4a31-9b5c-a1d1ebee5016">The hall then grows quiet. Look to the characters inhabiting the wedding couple, letting them know everyone is staring at them. If they don’t guess what’s happening, one of the guests leans forward and reminds the couple to join Jormun on the altar. The guests have a good laugh at the couple forgetting the ceremony details, chalking it all up to the pair being nervous.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ce9c6404-a27a-4843-8198-0befabf7a25b">Once at the altar, Jormun asks for the couple’s vows. This is a fun opportunity to see if the two players want to improvise vows, since they were supposed to have memorized them. After the vows, Jormun pronounces them a married couple and the hall erupts in cheers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="66fe5812-dc62-4d8d-b7fd-770ceb9e8a33">After allowing everyone to receive the couple, Rizwin thanks Jormun for the wonderful ceremony (even if it left much to be desired) and leads everyone back the way they came and north to the dining hall. Characters could try to make their way to the vault at this time, though anyone doing so runs into Thoman, and are likely to be noticed arriving late to the celebration.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2425c8a2-3619-4750-85a1-925a73dee55c">The dining hall has been festooned with colored streamers and lit with huge braziers. Long tables in the center include platters of food and seats for guests, while a table nearby holds gifts from attendees (including a few from Clan Horn). Servers bring ale and spirits, and the mood is festive. Ironbeard, Rizwin, and even Two Dry Cloaks are all here, though Lady Kira and Lord Zardak are not.</p>

His goal is to come up with a toast that calls Tannus to battle, to see once and for all whether his friend has changed. Encourage the player whose character possesses Gorat to make up a toast that urges Tannus to tell a story of his prowess at war. Secretly, Gorat hopes that Tannus turns down the challenge. How Tannus responds could determine whether his clan has an easier or harder time calming down once chaos erupts. A good battle tale leaves them eager to fight!</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6a4cf663-0eeb-4e2a-99ed-0570951b821b">As the challenge is being resolved, Thoman returns from checking the vault and heads to Amara to report his findings.</p>

Chaos erupts! Thankfully, the guards of Horn Enclave know that any dwarven wedding comes with a certain amount of chaos, and are keen to let the two families sort their problems out before getting involved. As such, this scene is a great opportunity for the characters to explore their NPCs’ personalities and backstories as things get heated. By focusing on the humor of potential conflicts, you can avoid having the guards rush in as a first response.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1fb3a37c-d21c-4023-b907-e987ddcac943">The characters have many options here. They could use the opportunity to escape (or head to the orrery vault if they haven’t already). More than likely, they’ll be inside NPC bodies and need to defuse the situation so they can reach the caravan departure phase in one piece.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="363a35f0-3ca9-4a6d-bf8c-f4e32ea364fd">The characters could try to save the marriage, perhaps resolving the crime by pinning it on one person (or convincing Rala to take the fall). Let the players develop a plan and add reactions from the crowd (including Clan Horn NPCs) as needed. Accusations and turmoil prompt Ironbeard and several guards to inspect the wedding vault, which could lead to the discovery of any breach into the orrery vault.</p>

His actions could help bring the warring families together by example.</p>

In this case, take the events directly to them so that they’re encouraged to react. An effective technique is to couple an NPC approaching them with a surge of emotions within one of the controlled NPCs. For example, Ironbeard could call for everyone to be searched, just as Amara (and the character controlling her) begins to contemplate what might befall her daughter if the families decide the wedding is invalid.</p>

Rizwin, Ironbeard, Lady Kira, and Lord Zardak all come to say appropriate goodbyes.

The Six’s airship keeps more than 60 feet away from the characters’ battle balloon to allow it to fire all weapons. In this round, the Six operatives don’t reel in the lines of their airship’s harpoon guns, content to attack at range and entice the characters to make counterattacks against the enemy ship.

When the needle makes contact, it automatically deals sufficient damage to the balloon to create a slow-leaking puncture. This doesn’t cause a sudden crash, but the battle balloon begins to descend slowly to the ground. To prevent this from happening, the characters must destroy the needle (AC 10, 75 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage).</p>

The hobgoblin captain rides her hippogriff into battle. The mephits assume that the strongest magic they detect on the battle balloon is the orrery components the characters have collected, and they undertake any combination of attacks and ability checks you determine to claim those components. One mephit flies away with each component claimed, attempting to blind characters trying to follow it with its Cinder Breath.</p>

By the same token, the characters need to repair their borrowed <a class="tooltip-hover vehicles-tooltip" href="/vehicles/battle-balloon" data-tooltip-href="/vehicles/7-tooltip">battle balloon</a>. A few hours’ work (including salvaging parts from the Six’s airship if applicable) makes the Acq Inc battle balloon airworthy again for the continued journey.</p>

To one side of the hall is a stage where three harpists play, surrounded by a lounge with comfortable chairs and small tables. Beyond that is the bar, and a door presumably leading to a kitchen. A sign to your right indicates the “Powder Room,” while another to your left indicates “Tokens.” To the far left is a fortified iron door sealed with a large lock.

A character can play any game for a cost of 3 tokens (available from the cashier). You can use any combination of checks and roleplaying you like to represent a character’s attempts to gamble, but each game should involve at least three checks of DC 12 or higher. An Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/7-tooltip">History</a>) or Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check might allow a character to suss out the rules of a game or analyze the opposition, while an Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) or Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/16-tooltip">Deception</a>) check can represent careful play or cagey bluffing.

<p data-content-chunk-id="74cba7d7-3354-49ce-b935-6af1e5aa1efd">If a character fails all the checks for a game, they lose their 3 tokens and owe another 3. If the character fails more than half their checks, they lose their 3 tokens and owe 1 token. If they succeed on all checks, they keep their tokens and gain 2 tokens. This is a great way to lose money, but if a character beats the odds and wins more than three times in a row, the dealer for the game declares that it needs to go on its dinner break (despite being a skeleton).</p>

However, two liches lounging on couches are bored to the point of seeking any distraction, and they urge Lottie to let the characters speak. Allow the characters to explain why they have come, and to plead the case for receiving the information they need and the last orrery component. You can ask for Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) checks to carry the conversation, or let good roleplaying rule.</p>

Some of the other liches have heard rumors of the Six’s plots, and that the Six have seemingly bargained with terrible powers to learn how to use the orrery components to open a portal to the Far Realm. The commercial interests of these liches means that all understand how destroying the world is bad for business, so the Six must be stopped.</p>

Lottie underscores the importance of the characters stopping the Six and preventing that group from opening a portal to the Far Realm. The means by which they do so are entirely up to them. But whatever the outcome of the battle with the Six, Lottie insists that the orrery must be broken up and never used again — and sets a very real threat of dark destruction on the characters if they fail to permanently disable the relic.</p>

Like Lottie, all these undead are focused on the limitless commercial aspects of immortal evil, and might be talked into partnerships with the franchise. The potential for such deals (and the potential risks in dealing with such powerful entities) is left to your imagination.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="77ce6f54-dbf9-4e70-a0be-312dab849343">Much of the break between episode 5 and 6 will be focused on determining the location of the Six’s ritual site. The key clue to doing so is knowing that the ritual needs to be undertaken in a location where the planar boundaries are already thin, and where an existing planar portal is likely already in operation. Still, though the end of the world might be nigh, on the off chance that the characters are successful in stopping the Six’s plans, they’ll have bills to pay.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="275a1bf0-c8c6-4bef-b7cb-6e7956605c5a">As the endgame approaches, the time the characters have spent with the orrery and its component pieces can grant the necessary insight to build a detector that can sense portals or planar disturbances. A portalometer, if you will. The research or scrutineering activities can help the characters uncover the necessary information or tools, while the crafting a magic item activity can cover the construction of the portalometer.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2d724519-0c14-4cb2-802f-8c9652aa083c">The details of the portalometer are left to the imaginations of the players (including coming up with a better name if they like). The detector might take the form of a magical receptacle allowing one or more orrery components to function as a compass, a divination window tapping into planar disruptions to show brief glimpses of possible locations, or any other device channeling suitable magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1b7228ee-e165-4f25-b8e3-1bca30462f9d">If you really want to dig deep, you could experiment with the idea that the orrery’s power gives it a kind of consciousness (or you could even make it a sentient magic item, as detailed in <a title="chapter 7" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts" data-content-chunk-id="de1d6faa-3fc9-4eba-bb76-63171c18d31e">chapter 7</a> of the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="19684682-8e1c-4193-9721-65ceca4f1983"><i><a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></i></span>.) In that scenario, the orrery’s consciousness might be what the portalometer taps into. Or the orrery components possessed by the Six might begin to call to the components held by the characters, as the artifact seeks to be made whole once more.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="041b58e3-3d0f-4411-adb2-2a4a69e92e64">The time necessary to locate the ritual site is left to your determination. If the characters are anxious to cut to the chase, you can have a successfully created portalometer lead them straight to the site. In a pinch, you could even say that any orrery components the characters still possess become attuned to the ritual as Splugoth prepares it, allowing the characters to triangulate the ritual site’s location. For more build up, you can set up a search involving side treks, which might cover the length and breadth of the Sword Coast as the characters make use of their mobile franchise headquarters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="560afd42-936c-4019-9319-8fb01697eb38">These side trek missions might tie in to improving the magic of the portalometer and involving tracking down lore or components. Or the characters could discover several possible locations for the Six’s ritual, then investigate and eliminate false leads before finding the real site. One such side trek is detailed in “<a title="The Moon Glade" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/showdown-with-the-six#TheMoonGlade" data-content-chunk-id="adcb3583-d7b3-48a9-be65-ca0293061f7f">The Moon Glade</a>” in <a title="episode 6" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/showdown-with-the-six" data-content-chunk-id="1cb37da5-b7ea-4287-9352-c530f176a923">episode 6</a>, and you can add similar events as you wish.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="86a3c55b-6ca0-4f05-aeb2-87da93a0ca25">Any number of downtime and franchise activities — from research to schmoozing to shady business practices — can be used by characters seeking to learn more about the ritual or how best to take the fight to the Six. For any tasks in which the outcome includes a complication due to a rival, the Six could be attempting to undermine the characters’ franchise to eliminate their threat.</p>
<h4 id="BusinessasUsual" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="dc4aa6bc-58ee-4f14-bbac-9444948e7f9c"><a href="#BusinessasUsual" data-content-chunk-id="72033bb3-3cbd-4ee4-8cba-7f1190cdf1bc"></a>Business as Usual</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb179e60-4b37-4c7f-92c6-013b152f9f23">Even as the characters are working on locating the ritual site, they might use the explore territory franchise activity to interact with local customers and allies to strengthen the franchise. A group of merchants might want to sell branded gear manufactured by the liches the characters met at Lottie’s, creating additional business opportunities or allowing the characters to follow up on previous negotiations with the liches.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f9b3efe5-e936-4e8b-931b-61cbbe7a4f47">Having recently interacted with several powerful organizations — including Lottie’s lich alliance, the Six, and Dran Enterprises — the characters might be bursting with ideas for fine-tuning their franchise and headquarters before the final showdown. This might involve organizational restructuring, headquarters modifications, upgraded magic, and other activities meant to grant the franchise an edge in the coming fight.</p>
<h4 id="MeetandGreet" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="d23ed3b0-a1de-4aff-a9b0-451dd1cbedd3"><a href="#MeetandGreet" data-content-chunk-id="1b0619bd-412e-46d3-90ff-a0c0f4cd4e3f"></a>Meet and Greet</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a436ace1-852c-4d1f-97ba-f98a6f8a5a3d">Engaging in shady business practices or outright crime during downtime might result in more than financial reward for the characters. With a suitable degree of success, such activities can bring the characters into contact with agents of the Six. Likewise, the characters might use the cover of criminal activity to infiltrate or expose the Six, or they could use carousing or other social activities to contact an ally or operative of the organization.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="113c1e2a-a855-4cae-95d2-f21cae0bbe6f">Any such interactions should automatically create complications to be resolved, with those complications revealing useful information concerning the Six’s plots, the ritual site’s possible location, and the defenses around the site.</p>
<h2 id="ContinuingtheAdventure" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="874a4ab1-9b5f-4ee1-996e-81519a5055df"><a href="#ContinuingtheAdventure" data-content-chunk-id="dc4a217e-fb40-480d-b8b6-6bec5d218d32"></a>Continuing the Adventure</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3914f7e4-a931-4a3b-af73-2f3e3e33f9ee">If the characters communicate with Head Office at any point during their downtime, it should be made clear that Acquisitions Incorporated is impressed by the franchise’s success. Omin Dran does whatever he can to backstop the characters’ efforts to find the ritual site, even as he directs other franchises and operatives to seek the site as well. (In the end, the characters will conveniently be the ones to locate the ritual site, but it should be clear that the entire organization takes the impending end of the world as seriously as they do.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fbbd4760-54ed-4131-9b05-8858dc9e232b">Omin is also troubled because he’s lost contact with the members of the “C” Team (see <a title="appendix A" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/acq-inc" data-content-chunk-id="0c8f16bd-41f9-4286-b6d5-566f6b03e958">appendix A</a>). The members of that franchise have been actively seeking the Six, and Omin hopes that they might simply be in the midst of an operation with no chance to report in. But just in case, he asks the characters to keep an eye out for them. The fate of the “C” Team — and the possible fate of all Faerûn — will be revealed to the characters as they charge toward the grand finale of the adventure!</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="19d48a2e-6c14-4437-82f7-4cb195cea357">The characters (now 6th level) have learned that the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="bef44c61-e50e-4861-9dfe-f005df77108d"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705876-tooltip">Orrery of the Wanderer</a></span> channels magic even more powerful than intended by its creator, the lich Lottie. As such, Lottie broke the orrery into parts and scattered those parts far and wide, hoping that no one would discover their secret. But the enigmatic group known as the Six has collected at least one orrery component (perhaps more, depending on events in <a title="episode 5" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/hide-and-seek" data-content-chunk-id="2739a5d6-fcf5-4ce5-b1f5-6178ea496c00">episode 5</a>), and its agents now attempt to use those components to open a portal to the Far Realm.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f1eaff89-294a-40ea-9eec-53b7a5cb1595">After a suitable amount of questing and research, the characters locate the ritual site, which they learn is in the small town of Red Larch. That settlement is the childhood home of Omin Dran and the stomping grounds of the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise known as the “C” Team, whose members have recently gone missing.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36f97b28-86c7-418e-ae69-f31111b44706">The characters speed toward Red Larch, where they find foes allied with the Six guarding the Dran &amp; Courtier inn. That otherwise quiet establishment has always possessed unusual magical qualities, but these have been warped by the slowly opening portal to the Far Realm. The characters can interact with the local townsfolk, learning that the members of the “C” Team entered the inn but have not returned. Likewise, the inn’s co-owner and proprietor, Propha Dran, has not been seen since the planar strangeness suffusing the inn started.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4cc48745-f09d-4b46-924c-1b373c8cfcc6">When the characters enter, the Dran &amp; Courtier appears normal at first. But opening any of its interior doors causes the entire site to transform under the watchful eye of an agent of the Six known as the Keymaster. A nightmare version of the Dran &amp; Courtier is revealed, filled with aberrant horrors. Defeating the horrors of this incarnation of the inn returns the characters to the actual inn.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2c478d3c-cd05-43ce-b8b8-0c1acf0b75cf">A second transformation turns the characters into miniature heroes as they are greeted by Splugoth the Returned. On behalf of the Six, the wily goblin asks the characters to surrender their orrery components — and then releases Onyx, the giant (relative to the characters) inn’s cat, upon them. Successfully fleeing from Onyx transforms the inn once more.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c649583a-25a1-41a5-b18e-2a5684dae650">In the final stage, the characters discover the members of the “C” Team fallen in combat and must fight the horrid Far Realm creature that slew them. Doing so brings those NPC heroes back to life. Once the Keymaster has been subsequently bested, the characters can open a final door leading to a dark series of dimensional caverns — and the lair of an ancient deep crow. That terrible creature is sure to defeat the characters, unless they can determine that it’s suffering from a deep depression and desperately seeks a mate. Successfully playing the part of deep crow relationship counselor allows the characters to continue on, finally reaching the portal site.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ae5b3220-ddba-438e-b865-be114ca34112">Splugoth is in control of the ritual and has defenses in place to prevent the meddling characters from thwarting his plans. As the characters face off against a mutated Far Realm goblin horde, Splugoth’s control of the orrery components that fuel the ritual lets him summon forth twisted, evil versions of some of Acquisitions Incorporated’s most famous members. Oh, and there’s a thing where the ritual keeps resurrecting Splugoth every time the characters kill him.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dfabe230-0940-4e3f-83f9-e8b34572b835">In the end, clever thinking and a measure of luck might allow the heroes to keep Splugoth dead, seize control of the orrery components, and end the ritual. If victorious, the characters will earn accolades from Head Office for a job well done!</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="567027de-8274-4e86-9523-bda944030eac">And the world will be safe from destruction. That’s always a plus.</p>

If you want to set up a prolonged search for the site, any of the following iconic locations along the Sword Coast might make an interesting stop for the characters. Each location offers the potential to gain information regarding sites known for planar disturbances or strange magic, or to seek lore and materials to refine the operation of the characters’ portalometer.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7b8c0424-5635-41f5-b30a-7a53f10bc38d">The many towers of the largest and most storied library in all Faerûn are the perfect place to search for clues leading to the location or nature of the ritual site, or to find instructions for crafting a portalometer. Gaining lore or befriending the monks of the library could reveal that someone else recently came to Candlekeep to inquire into the nature of portals to other dimensions. In fact, this representative of the Six was studying the very tomes the characters are now investigating!</p>

A deep gnome sage named Lunicifer dwells in the city, living in a crumbling home on the shores of the Darklake. A half-mad servant of a forgotten deity named Azmekidom, Lunicifer has been researching planar disturbances for more than a century and can provide the characters with insight or research — if the party helps him with his dangerous errands.

The waters of the Moon Glade rest upon an intersection of magical ley lines, tied to the weave of the world. The glade’s waters are thick like mercury and said to have powerful properties of divination. The characters might also learn that the glade is protected by a powerful natural guardian.

Garalel became tainted by the Six when Splugoth and other members of that organization recently used the pool to seek out their ritual site.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="99815dd1-dd4f-488b-ac90-ce02e1c6b7f7">Garalel initiates combat by animating trees, following up with her Glimpse of the Beyond feature. Characters can see that her bark is covered in dark, foul-smelling moss. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/9-tooltip">Nature</a>) check identifies the bark as magically tainted. Dealing damage to Garalel harms her but also breaks off large pieces of the tainted bark and moss. When she is reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, enough corrupted bark has been sloughed off that the treant regains her senses and stops fighting.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="14d0feae-f6b3-466a-92be-b82b6bbee24e">A character can also use an action to throw water from the pool onto Garalel. Each time she is splashed so, it helps cleanse the dark magic binding her and increases the hit point total at which she regains her senses by 10.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fcc3f622-bc74-4d37-8cc0-28527b200cd0">If Garalel regains her senses, she apologizes profusely. She allows the characters to approach the pool and tells them how the members of the Six used its waters to determine the ideal location for a dark ritual. Knowing that their actions contaminated the pool, she drew that corruption into herself instead.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="057f473a-323e-411a-b497-73df21cda244">What the characters get out of this side trek depends on where it fits in the longer process of perfecting a portalometer or eliminating possible ritual sites. Depending on the goal, Garalel can allow the characters to use the pool’s divination power to seek the ritual site, to take a sample of the glade’s magical waters for use in their portalometer, or what have you.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d90d4ca0-ba73-48ac-82b1-55a6df79866b">At whatever point in the search process you deem appropriate, the characters narrow down the search for the ritual site to a final location: the settlement of Red Larch on the western side of the Dessarin Valley. This small town services passing caravans and has a large quarry from which local folk mine marble favored by the wealthy of Waterdeep. A wagon can reach Waterdeep from Red Larch in seven days, and the town of Phandalin is six days away on foot.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ebc4aa17-553a-4d86-85f7-060f7e2aa31e">Red Larch is also the hometown of Omin Dran and the location of the Dran family business — the Dran &amp; Courtier inn and restaurant. As the characters soon discover, this is not a coincidence.

<p data-content-chunk-id="90fc0959-49c2-49a0-987b-9b23cd424a06">How the characters arrive in Red Larch is likely determined by what they suspect or have learned regarding the defenses the Six have set up around the ritual. They might choose a stealthy incursion in the dead of night, to roar straight in aboard a mobile franchise headquarters at midday, or any approach in between. But however they first enter the town, the characters quickly confirm that the Six’s ritual is already underway.</p>

The Dran &amp; Courtier inn can be seen at the crossroads near the center of town easily enough. But the beams of purple energy emanating from the establishment are decidedly unusual, as is the presence of frightened townsfolk corralled in a pen nearby. Then, of course, there’s the small force of bugbears guarding the pen and the gnolls surrounding the inn. That doesn’t look right at all.</p>

Even the fearless gnolls are weirded out by the strange lights emanating from the inn. The characters can engage the gnolls head-on or attempt to take them out stealthily.

The incursion of the inn and restaurant plays out as four distinct stages, each channeling a unique version of the establishment — and forcing the characters to face off against the effects of the dark magic churning within.</p>
<h2 id="Stage1TheDranCourtier" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="15169e81-1e4a-4eaa-b1b0-6f67a037ea25"><a href="#Stage1TheDranCourtier" data-content-chunk-id="a4e11696-1c4b-4426-9d1a-5c3a5c0af213"></a>Stage 1: The Dran &amp; Courtier?</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="af9f177f-78a3-4bc5-80fa-abcdc4610c36">The Dran &amp; Courtier is normally a fine inn run by Prophetess “Propha” Dran, who happens to be Omin Dran’s mother, and her wife, Audra Courtier. The inn is a favorite of locals and travelers alike, but it also serves another purpose. When someone carrying an acorn whose cap is dipped in gold (usually given to them by Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office) passes through the door, they end up in an extradimensional version of the inn known as the Test Market.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cc9f20ba-6aa0-4136-86c1-0fbde52bff14">The Test Market is meant to test new recruits to Acquisitions Incorporated, and it has several known versions. The multifaceted extradimensional nature of the Dran &amp; Courtier makes it an ideal location for the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="f11611c4-4a3c-48a6-9559-b9f65fac4c10"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705876-tooltip">Orrery of the Wanderer</a></span> to channel the extraplanar magic of the Six’s ritual. A convenient number of days before the characters discovered the portal site, Splugoth accessed the extradimensional space and began the process of opening the portal. Energy from the Far Realm has infused several versions of the Test Market, making them even more dangerous than usual — including one version that has already defeated the “C” Team.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f1f7c157-291c-4485-a7ec-124c0a5922df">One of the seemingly ordinary inhabitants of the inn is an agent of the Six. Known as the Keymaster, the agent is a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16843-doppelganger" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16843-tooltip">doppelganger</a> presently posing as Prophetess “Propha” Dran (see <a title="area 3" href="#3Bar" data-content-chunk-id="0f47d1d2-6ffe-4cf0-b74c-e68923416926">area 3</a>). The doppelganger holds a portal key that allows it to select which version of the Test Market the characters access when they open one of the inn’s interior doors. It does so in the hope of destroying anyone attempting to interfere with Splugoth’s ritual.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="39d94334-24c8-430a-84bf-f2ec845004d1">The Keymaster runs the characters through new versions of the warped Test Market until its identity is discovered. Once caught, the Keymaster can be forced to open the inn’s basement door — revealing the dimensional caverns leading to the ritual site.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c39f6608-1d80-4060-b700-9b82120a3f0f">Until the characters confront the Keymaster, they advance to the next stage of the Test Market every time they open a door within the default version of the inn. Opened doors remain open, so the characters can explore the rooms beyond when they return from whatever stage is triggered by opening the door. Any treasure or other objects claimed in a stage stay with the characters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ea0434a6-311b-446b-9972-2d99d9420c21">The Test Market is not advanced when NPCs open the doors, since the Keymaster has control of the inn’s magic. As such, the NPCs stuck in the main stage (see below) wander around the inn as they please. If calculating characters think to have an NPC open a door for them, it advances the Test Market to the next stage for them only, plus any NPCs that appear in the next stage.</p>

If awakened, she thanks the characters for their rescue, listens to any explanation of how they got there, then shares the following information:</p>

She was tied up and left in this version of the Test Market, presumably to keep her out of the way. Thankfully, Audra Courtier was out of town when the Six’s agents attacked.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="425aec90-b70b-434b-a09e-a76142fc1c64">She has no idea who the “Propha” in the default version of the inn is.

<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="826a40b8-b600-4d0d-8d44-e93bfc8ac4fd">Propha overheard Splugoth talk about the ritual being undertaken in some location called the dimensional caverns. He also bragged that the caverns are guarded by a monster known as an ancient deep crow. Propha can fill the characters in on deep crow lore if they’re unfamiliar with those creatures (see <a title="appendix B" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/monsters" data-content-chunk-id="74d8b450-5839-4c06-87e6-50eeab91d9e0">appendix B</a>), and makes it clear that even one ancient deep crow is a threat the characters cannot expect to overcome by normal means.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="098209e6-c4be-4048-80b3-28758f237fc1">Propha heard the voices of the “C” Team once while fading in and out of consciousness.

<p data-content-chunk-id="61dde464-e5cb-460e-a6c5-4cd89d33642b">Shortly after finding Propha, reality shimmers around the characters and they are returned to the default inn of stage 1. The characters are once again their normal size, though the only Propha in the room is the doppelganger behind the bar, wearing her blank medallion. The false Propha claims to have no idea what the characters are talking about if they recount their meeting with her.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="92eb094c-2900-4e43-bd17-fc45f84d9417">As before, the characters stay in this default scene until they open another of the inn’s interior doors.</p>

All four members of the “C” Team lie dead on the floor of their individual bedrooms.</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="b01c13e4-5c63-47bd-ba6d-9f568768a8f9">The purple light that radiates out from each room pulses out around the edges of the closed interior doors, all of which lead to the shared study beyond.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="51e5334c-0a90-4ef7-bd9c-ad70415f7c82">Investigation of the members of the “C” Team confirms that they are truly dead. No magic available to the characters can return them to life, and any magic carried by those adventurers is mysteriously inert. If the characters want to loot the bodies, any treasure they might be carrying is left to your determination. There is nothing of value in any of the bedrooms.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a2ce0711-9f8a-4707-8ff5-8fb7cb47225b">If the characters defeat the eldritch horror, a pulse of magic radiates outward as the maw collapses and vanishes. The members of the “C” Team wake up, freed from the magic that had vanquished them in this version of the Test Market. The characters have a chance to share their story with the NPCs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5f4e4caa-dc88-4c6a-ab5c-94821ef49edc">The members of the “C” Team know Splugoth well, and can fill the characters in on any information the goblin didn’t get around to mentioning in stage 3 (see “<a title="Splugoth’s Bargain" href="#SplugothsBargain" data-content-chunk-id="63449271-d162-4b72-8ab0-8e5c2cac47a0">Splugoth’s Bargain</a>”). They have faced different versions of the Test Market than those seen by the characters, which they talk about if asked (see “<a title="Additional Stages" href="#AdditionalStages" data-content-chunk-id="67a1cd71-ae38-4244-8479-fa0335dd0a7e">Additional Stages</a>” below for inspiration). If they don’t presently return to the same version of the Dran &amp; Courtier as the characters (as will prove to be the case), the “C” Team members promise to continue trying to free the inn from the Six’s magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="55532fa9-5170-49b4-878f-46a8e804f301">As thanks for the rescue, K’thriss gifts a pair of <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="6e5594fb-83b1-41f6-a7b7-0d3eff9d9d1a"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4755-slippers-of-spider-climbing" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4755-tooltip">slippers of spider climbing</a></span>&nbsp;to the party.

<p data-content-chunk-id="440c5e9b-6a1e-455f-b150-92adfb2260d5">The “C” Team members do not accompany the characters as they are returned to the stage 1 version of the Dran &amp; Courtier, but end up in other stages of the Test Market until the ritual is ended.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b6366add-e46b-4be6-8c6c-5e5034c3501b">You are free to add additional stages to the Keymaster’s version of the Test Market if the players are having fun with these off-the-wall challenges. Use the following setups, or use them as inspiration for creating your own.</p>
<h4 id="Flashback" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="bdd15c74-050f-4738-a3a8-fda87a78f360"><a href="#Flashback" data-content-chunk-id="a7da892d-fed0-4cd5-ab51-eb0579ec61b4"></a>Flashback</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4ce17bb3-2be0-4f2c-80c3-898abc050a2d">The inn changes to resemble one of the other inns or taverns the characters have been to previously during the adventure (the Stonehill Inn or the Sleeping Giant in Phandalin, the Fishbone Tavern in Luskan, and so on). The patrons are people the characters have met before, but one of those patrons tells the characters that someone in the establishment is not who they appear to be. Finding the impersonator reveals a powerful monster of your determination, whose defeat ends the stage.</p>
<h4 id="InanimateTrauma" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="d2294a1c-f1c0-4a6b-bb95-6dc4cb68a715"><a href="#InanimateTrauma" data-content-chunk-id="de4e3565-00d8-4177-86f1-d27ea0ae3d98"></a>Inanimate Trauma</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="06388e6c-96e7-4290-bf2f-f01c2152bc88">No people are found in the Dran &amp; Courtier, but a number of inanimate objects are sitting in chairs where people once were. Written on a chalkboard that would otherwise announce the inn’s meal of the day is the phrase: “The names of things must be arranged and spoken.” The first letter of each word in the clue is underlined.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8e8c71a2-7a5d-49a3-bdfd-220109834767">This Test Market is a puzzle in which the first letter in the name of each object that was formerly a person must be scrambled to determine a password. You choose the password, then choose the nature of the objects so that their names provide the needed letters. For example, the password “lamp” could be created from a lock, an arrow, a mirror, and a piton. When the password is spoken, the stage ends.</p>
<h4 id="BattleattheHeadquarters" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f95a5678-5e27-4897-a23f-4744ff2a5b88"><a href="#BattleattheHeadquarters" data-content-chunk-id="b843c397-1eee-4b0b-a681-1f75caa2f8f1"></a>Battle at the Headquarters</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7ccaf6f6-bb26-46ae-8456-acac8504c8b7">The tavern becomes the franchise’s headquarters, which is under attack by agents of the Six! For even more chaos, each of the characters temporarily transforms into a franchise staff member using an NPC stat block, so that the players must use those NPCs to repel the attackers. When the battle is over — one way or the other — the stage ends.</p>
<h4 id="TooManyProphas" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="31c60630-f0be-421e-90e9-2ad6a0094cc6"><a href="#TooManyProphas" data-content-chunk-id="2cfe172f-9b5e-42ce-9f30-96d7a33b6e06"></a>Too Many Prophas</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f34a9c9f-95cb-4205-a866-ca3ee0c4e582">The tavern appears normal, but it holds three people who look exactly like Propha Dran and none of them are behind the bar. Each time a Propha touches a character or another patron, the person touched turns into a Propha in body and mind, with the players roleplaying that development as they see fit. Whether as themselves or as Propha, the characters must determine which is the original Propha (still secretly the Keymaster) and get it to touch the other Prophas, which turns them back to normal. Once everyone is their former self, the stage ends.</p>
<h4 id="NeedtoFeed" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="536d8fb0-f99a-4b5c-b469-f3e4062b106c"><a href="#NeedtoFeed" data-content-chunk-id="92385b9f-6a83-4b17-b21c-9abd6cae2432"></a>Need to Feed</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="09f0dcbd-c324-4f74-8791-9170db4f6c72">Every patron seen previously in the inn has a head resembling a fleshy ball surrounded by tentacles and a gaping maw where a face should be. These otherworldly creatures are tearing the inn apart and attempting to eat everything they can get their hands on — including the characters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="40e5c1e9-bf49-49d9-8429-e9e6cb9ceb44">Fighting the patrons is difficult (use the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="ab714aa8-854e-4569-8cd2-f96970b61539"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16841-dire-wolf" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16841-tooltip">dire wolf</a></span> stat block for each to underline their fierce bite). But if two of them are forced together (by a character shoving one of them, a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="76d0f895-d927-4dc9-858a-03dd436f4960"><a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2278-thunderwave" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2278-tooltip">thunderwave</a></span> spell, and so forth), they immediately attack and wholly consume each other. When only one patron remains, it transforms into Propha (the Keymaster) and the stage ends.</p>
<h4 id="FoodFight" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="d3eaf8ba-5dbc-48c3-8542-5892ca164c10"><a href="#FoodFight" data-content-chunk-id="eb6509ba-4021-424a-8bb0-1454f4feaad7"></a>Food Fight</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef0b59d5-4f6a-4337-889a-c8742f2eec48">The characters appear behind the bar, with every patron in the inn shouting furiously at them regarding poor service. The patrons begin to hurl food at the characters: +4 to hit, 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage. The patrons are immune to damage from any of the characters’ normal attacks and spells. However, each patron is vulnerable to one type of food currently being hurled around the inn. If that type of food hits a patron, they immediately vanish. When all the patrons have been vanquished in this way, the stage ends.</p>
<h2 id="ConfrontingtheKeymaster" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="050cb471-80e0-4453-8cd7-e2d4009319fe"><a href="#ConfrontingtheKeymaster" data-content-chunk-id="eb68aa86-109d-4d25-8c55-089ca6ad2da9"></a>Confronting the Keymaster</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3d5efe37-ceb5-4299-b7f9-ee54827a27b7">Whether as a result of information gathered during stages of the Test Market, magic brought to bear while talking to “Propha,” or simply adventurers’ instinct, the characters eventually become aware of the Keymaster’s identity. If this happens before the characters have triggered all the presented stages of the Test Market, that’s fine. You can have the Keymaster flee through an interior door to generate a new stage (see below). Or you can ignore the later stages and let the characters capture the doppelganger (especially if the players are anxious to get to the ritual site as quickly as possible).</p>

The canyon narrows, then opens again into a cavern, where a broad sandstone rise is lit by sheets of green flame that scour the ceiling. Thin shelves of eroded rock emerge from the center of the rise to create a large central mesa. Ten other goblins stand guard around this promontory, which has twisting steps leading up to where Splugoth stands.</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="ea70824c-8afd-4e24-9aa9-16c15bacb6d5">A sandstone pillar rises from the mesa before the goblin. Floating above it is the orrery, its clockwork components spinning rapidly, glowing with power. Behind Splugoth is a rift in reality — a purple wound in the world, beyond which you can see goblins with purple eyes, extra limbs, and other strange mutations. The Far Realm goblins push forward, trying to press through the portal and into your world.</p>
<p class="Boxed-Text-Style_Boxed-Text" data-content-chunk-id="80ed1526-dfc4-417b-a481-290e8d66d0ef">Splugoth laughs. “You are too late! The ritual is under my control, and now you must hear my most villainous speech! Oh, who am I kidding? Goblins, kill these meddlesome fools! And just to sway the odds, how about some ironic assistance for my minions?” With a flourish, Splugoth manipulates one of the orrery’s clockwork components. Four purple-black outlines begin to form before the rift — slowly taking the shape of characters you recognize.</p>

While the ritual is in progress, the normal magic of the orrery components and housing does not function in the ritual cavern, even if a component is not being used in the ritual.

<p data-content-chunk-id="db21d5c5-bf86-4835-a5c9-35425dd967be">As long as Splugoth survives, his connection to the ritual prevents the characters from shutting down its magic, even if they are in control of the orrery components fueling the ritual. If Splugoth is dead and one of the characters controls the orrery components, any character on the top of the mesa can use an action to attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check. A successful check ends the ritual and saves the world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="131c4bda-138e-4f8b-83fa-a8335197de78">If the battle goes poorly for the characters, they can end it at any point by&nbsp;… well, dying. Alternatively, they can retreat and allow Faerûn to be taken over by Far Realm horrors, with either event leaving the fate of the world — and more important, the franchise’s future — to be determined by you.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5a8359c2-f129-4ee1-ae86-90edc2289702">With the present threat of the Six and the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="3c5eb74a-1b52-4320-ab44-cf69a07ceaaa"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705876-tooltip">Orrery of the Wanderer</a></span> ended, the characters attain 7th level! Or maybe they’re dead! When the fate of the world hangs in the balance, there’s always a chance that the heroes will be defeated. In which case, congratulations! You get to start a new campaign — perhaps one in which another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise plays a part in undoing all the mistakes made by those losers from the last franchise.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ce01c878-f519-47d1-939f-1381887124d4">If the characters were victorious, you can all celebrate a job well done! When the ritual ends, any remaining goblins surrender and beg for mercy (and jobs). Where the rift once opened, a temporary portal now leads back to the Dran &amp; Courtier, which has returned to normal. The freed (and real) Propha Dran thanks the characters for saving the establishment and promises that they will always drink for free while in Red Larch. The members of the “C” Team are likewise indebted to the characters, promising them “just heaps of money” at some time in the future.</p>
<h4 id="OrreryoftheWanderer" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="55fa6809-9686-4dc5-8704-5c1def0c7e7a"><a href="#OrreryoftheWanderer" data-content-chunk-id="7a556c8f-4f63-4481-9819-e36dbd52734e"></a>Orrery of the Wanderer</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36bdd110-1423-4ef7-83e0-0c77da0ea7cf">The final state of the orrery depends on what happened during the ritual. If a significant number of mishaps occurred while the characters and Splugoth fought for control of the components, the orrery might develop even more random properties, or it might lose some of its more potent powers. Either way, it remains a powerful artifact, as detailed in <a title="appendix D" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/orrery-and-components" data-content-chunk-id="b7d99975-be9e-470f-8520-4d4f6ed0930e">appendix D</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ba34e03d-b7f3-4ab6-955f-66d246d8cc12">In keeping with their promise to Lottie, the characters are obliged to break the orrery up again and scatter its components far and wide. But hey, sometimes adventurers are forgetful. In the end, Omin Dran might have to announce that Head Office is taking charge of the orrery’s final fate — though the franchise might certainly be entitled to keep a favorite timepiece. (Or two. Really, who can keep track of these things?) And wherever its pieces end up, the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="ab4c9f8c-abec-4185-b354-85d19eced35d"><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/705876-tooltip">Orrery of the Wanderer</a></span> still has a will of its own, and might spawn additional adventures in the future.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fad8f668-7b7b-4ab0-be0f-4e88d990231f">At an appropriate time, Omin Dran summons the characters to Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office in Waterdeep for a special dinner to thank them for a job well done. The cost of admission is even reduced for the characters and their guests! Whatever reward you think is appropriate can be bestowed upon the characters — including magic or contracts that provide convenient hooks for upcoming adventures.</p>
<h2 id="FranchiseDowntime" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="6af7e40d-9011-4cf1-86dc-fa25b9c2e682"><a href="#FranchiseDowntime" data-content-chunk-id="395cb8ad-5515-462f-88d2-620d0adbea65"></a>Franchise Downtime</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4ded9bab-f131-4c6c-8ce8-687f78555e85">Even though “The Orrery of the Wanderer” is at an end, the characters should run downtime activities, both as a celebration of their victory (or to lessen the sting of a partial defeat) and to set the course for the campaign to come. The characters might enjoy changing cosmetic elements of their franchise headquarters to reflect their recent victories, spread their reputation as heroes, cement recent alliances, wrap up open plot hooks, or deal with debts or obligations incurred while saving the world.</p>
<h4 id="FriendsandEnemies" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="1bec9e1c-48c9-46a7-9700-6a185f682e64"><a href="#FriendsandEnemies" data-content-chunk-id="d752a84f-679c-4e32-a10c-04a56e67727a"></a>Friends and Enemies</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="15070a1d-7dbe-452c-b0ae-6b585cd93670">The characters’ heroics might have changed the dynamic between Acquisitions Incorporated and Dran Enterprises, for good or ill. Likewise, a failed ritual deals the Six a severe setback, though Jeff Magic (Splugoth’s lich boss) is still out there somewhere. But whether the Six seek immediate revenge or decide to bide their time, things don’t stay quiet for long for an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. New rivals, new allies, and new opportunities are sure to make their presence known.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a51251e0-119b-4ade-a1d6-f25ed6ad6632">So what’s next? Only you and the players know for sure. You can extend this campaign by allowing the characters to resolve plot hooks left open from previous episodes, or you can build on this adventure with new hooks like the following:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="f74b1ed8-43e6-4fe6-aca7-2d31a955916f">
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="7801b5cc-47b4-4375-9a70-17f694367391">If the characters were successful in giving relationship advice to Raah the ancient deep crow, it might ask for (or, you know, demand) their assistance to locate and assess potential mates, involving combat or matchmaking as you determine.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="98ec4635-b13d-463d-b093-cef5afc7436c">Acquisitions Incorporated has been working to open a franchise in Luskan, and the characters’ experience in that city makes them the perfect people to lead the operation. Because they’re totally on the best of terms with Dran Enterprises!</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="455efec1-2b71-4d1f-9e2e-b291f052a959">Lottie the lich calls in her favor of not killing the party to hire the characters as troubleshooters. She might need someone to help her out with difficulties in her expansive business operations, or to take care of rivals trying to shoehorn their way into the Greypeaks casino trade. Sure, she’s evil. But is she really “evil”? It’s a fine line.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="f8f15650-695f-4daa-9845-3fb38881b6e6">When the characters left the bodies of the dwarf wedding party at the end of <a title="episode 5" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/hide-and-seek" data-content-chunk-id="f75c63ce-1a0b-423b-8868-92fe941ffab6">episode 5</a>, the dwarves immediately understood that they’d been possessed. Through divination magic or incriminating evidence accidentally left in the caravan on the way out of Horn Enclave, Clans Thunderwind and Dhargun know that the characters were the ones responsible. Clan Dhargun might want to hire the characters as operatives for their business operations or engage in commercial agreements with the franchise on the basis of the characters’ extraordinarily clever ruse. Clan Thunderwind might want them all dead.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="7a17a1b4-c73a-4124-a3b6-c7407d7800f3">If the characters didn’t defeat him, evil archmage-for-hire Hoobur Gran’Shoop is still out there somewhere. The crazed gnome might be spoiling for revenge. Or he might have forgotten all about the characters, only to accidentally cross their paths again on completely unrelated business. Seriously, he’s a little out of it.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted" data-content-chunk-id="f7e2d05b-0fab-42ab-8878-5c43d55449a9">As word of their triumph over the Six spreads, characters returning to Waterdeep for business will be sought out by Otis Adalgrim, who wants them to meet the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr. The characters could be asked to join the Gray Hands, and might have an opportunity to work with Force Grey — an elite group of specialist adventurers drawn from the Gray Hands.</li>
<li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted--Extra-Space-After-" data-content-chunk-id="559725ec-8475-46e3-9e9f-6cd0ca875712">Rumors begin to spread of purple-and-black versions of famous Acquisitions Incorporated members robbing treasure vaults up and down the Sword Coast. That can’t be real, right?</li>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="8be2991c-b855-4744-92b0-5b38b5347120">Ominifis Hereward Dran spent his formative years in the small waystop of Red Larch, where his mother, Prophetess, ran a popular inn and restaurant. In the brief periods of respite afforded by working the family business, Omin and his sisters, Auspicia and Portentia, were wont to wander the hills and trails around town, dreaming of adventure. But adventure of the wrong kind came calling for the trio one day, when an underground ruin they had often explored — actually a creature called the Wandering Crypt — took Auspicia from the world.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="52945a1f-db55-4c5e-a33e-53a6e7000163">Omin Dran built the organization called Acquisitions Incorporated to facilitate and expand his quest to find his true sister, at least in part. For despite his unprecedented success in establishing the market for franchised adventuring across the Sword Coast and beyond, Omin’s full measure eludes most people. He is known to be a worshiper of Tymora, ruthless in matters of business, feckless in matters of love, and hopeless in games of chance. Omin is also often accused of being one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep, though this bit of fancy earns little more than a chuckle in response. And even if the rumor were true, Omin would never leverage such a position for greater financial gain and power. Because that would be wrong&nbsp;…</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="c619da95-3056-44af-829e-bb658b5a8174">James Winifred Darkmagic III is the scion of a mysterious, multiplanar wizarding family. Jim’s arcane pedigree has long preceded him, incorporating equally healthy amounts of magical training and innate eldritch prowess. However, despite a natural talent that could have allowed him to make a name for himself as a court wizard, or perhaps “that strange old man in the village,” Jim’s original penchant was not for the magic of scroll or spell, but for the stage.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="85a30279-e6ae-4627-97eb-8f35499eb9ea">As an entertainer and purveyor of the “Jim Darkmagic Experience,” the legendary mage can often be found in markets and town squares, performing feats of mundane legerdemain. The renown he has earned for these feats is nearly equaled by the reputation that follows him as chief arcanist (and occasional arsonist) for Acquisitions Incorporated. And although his skills as an adventurer and real wizard remain highly sought after, Jim looks forward to a well-earned retirement, at which point he hopes to become a “real wizard” — by which he means a fake wizard — full time.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="91b6be52-7fa7-4f4b-8331-7f5293e761ca">A product of life on a small-town farm, the rogue known as Viari carries fond memories of those childhood days and his loving family. (Well, except for that thing where his parents insist on thinking of his older brother as the successful one.) But he can be quick to show self-consciousness when talking of where he came from, and he never speaks of the name he bore in that former life.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="d6b321d8-5e3b-409e-8529-e12d4c15a122">After quickly rising in the ranks of Acquisitions Incorporated since joining that august team, Viari has come to head what’s known as the organization’s Stabbing Department. A potent threat in both dueling and earnest debate, he demonstrates an equal flair for planning and forethought, mad combat moves (involving leaping off high places whenever possible), and dark vengeance.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="baee26c0-4a3c-487a-873b-ec8521d963b1">Viari’s career as an adventurer was nearly cut short during a battle of which the bards still sing.

Although Viari was made bodily whole again in an equally dramatic magical fashion, some of those closest to him have noticed that those miraculous events weigh on him still, perhaps suggesting consequences that only he foresees.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="5ec486d0-654c-4dca-bd10-8c381aad57a2">The ranger Môrgæn is a renowned tracker and hunter, able to pinpoint-target foes at any range, then vanish into the woods with no one the wiser. Her legendary ability with the longbow and the custom arrows she crafts instills fear into the hearts of her many enemies — and more than a few of her coworkers. Famously, she is the only member of Acquisitions Incorporated known to be paid in advance, lest a missed invoice lead to dire repercussions.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="a2afabbd-5e45-4c23-acbd-5d7f4d08e372">A child of the forest, Môrgæn defends the natural world with singular ferocity and an impressive rate of sustained fire. Her core philosophy is that one should shoot first and then ask no questions later. Because what’s the point of asking questions when the person you’ve shot first is already dead? Still, when the situation calls for it, this protector of the woodlands is equally at home on missions of subterfuge and social interaction in the big city, provided her well-known love of ale, wine, and other intoxicants doesn’t get the better of her.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="c7f626ac-49d3-4213-b409-98a1c2fc451f">Not much is known of the mysterious and aloof majordomo of Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office, the mage known as Flabbergast. It’s said that he hails from Neverwinter, and that his wealthy family helped erect and carve the famous Dolphin Bridge in that city. Although he detests physical labor, Flabbergast is a bit of a bridge builder in his own way, always striving to bring people together and flexing his diplomatic muscles. A pacifist bureaucrat, he abhors violence, and rarely puts his magical prowess on display.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="f634007d-e6b3-4a2a-997b-a82fc38235b2">One thing that is known (though it’s seldom spoken of) is that Flabbergast once worked for Dran Enterprises, and specifically for Portentia Dran. He carries a certain amount of guilt around being complicit in certain Dran Enterprises’ dealings, and helped Acquisitions Incorporated on the side even before taking up an official role with the company. Though Head Office certainly trusts him, others might wonder where his true loyalties lie.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="a3064818-8020-447e-9fda-83d3b9da503f">The Acquisitions Incorporated “C” Team is an up-and-coming adventuring franchise whose members have proven themselves able to handle the most dire threats — and equally able to fully capitalize on the resultant marketing opportunities. Tales of the group’s adventures are well known across the North and the Sword Coast. But less well known to many is that the “C” team did not come together by mere chance.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="b0d2c617-4c15-42e9-8dcd-924ea1c3eae0">Walnut Dankgrass, Rosie Beestinger, Donaar Blit’zen, and K’thriss Drow’b were all hand-selected for membership in Acquisitions Incorporated by founder Omin Dran, based on an experience he’d had as a young man. Upon entering a creature called the Wandering Crypt, Omin saw a vision of the heroes who would deliver his sister from that same creature years hence — and later created the “C” Team as a manifestation of his lifelong goal of seeing Auspicia Dran returned to the world.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="d8244d71-df83-4245-ae58-d02c485477ea">The “C” team is headquartered in the small town of Red Larch, residing at the Dran &amp; Courtier inn. The fact that the proprietor of this inn is one Prophetess “Propha” Dran, mother of Omin Dran, is entirely coincidental but a totally excellent strategic and cost-saving move.</p>
<h3 id="DonaarBlitzen" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="77e437a5-c542-4472-a0b5-172ca55d80c9"><a href="#DonaarBlitzen" data-content-chunk-id="496ab963-8290-43f0-b78c-36c696a82150"></a>Donaar Blit’zen</h3>
<p class="Epigraph-Styles_Epigraph--Space-After-" data-content-chunk-id="d266c2ac-76c8-4ef9-b4ed-896fb10cddb7"><i>Everybody cooooool out!</i></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="bef6201b-8394-4e8f-8081-4d782fe17d5e">The hulking dragonborn decisionist of the “C” Team, Donaar Blit’zen is an icon of brash confidence and warrior chill. He is known for his furious skill in battle, and for his propensity to fall asleep as soon as a fight is done (as well as countless other inopportune times). More immediately notable is the unique physical trait that all members of his clan bear — a stylish tail that is rare and often considered a deformity among dragonborn.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="3a276fdc-d718-4035-941c-0cd25f559710">As with his tail, an odd quirk of heritage makes Donaar’s acid breath more of a signature vomiting, giving rise to a driving paranoia that this regurgitation might damage his teeth. As testaments to his obsession with dental hygiene, Donaar named his greatsword Toothbrush and calls his whip Floss. He carries an actual toothbrush (named Percival) and actual floss at all times.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="09ea1b32-5882-41d0-93fd-046ebd9ca9af">Those who know Donaar quickly come to recognize that the braggadocio that defines him involves a certain amount of artifice. When the young dragonborn left his clan and family to adventure in foreign climes, he realized that doing so provided the perfect opportunity to reinvent himself for folk who had no idea what he was once like. As such, Donaar has learned that no amount of bravado and compensation is too much — provided he leaves no openings for strangers to call him on it. By the same token, strangers quickly come to realize that reinforcing Donaar’s self-congratulating sense of draconic entitlement makes it remarkably easy to win his favor.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="ce5c8407-b2cf-4a74-be0a-80a166804fe9">Despite his easily massaged vanity, the dragonborn sometimes shows the occasional streak of selflessness. Most notably, Donaar serves in his off-hours as part-time godfather to a young dragonborn named Chronaar, who had inadvertently imprinted on Donaar as a parental figure while he watched over her while she was in her egg.</p>

<p class="Epigraph-Styles_Epigraph--Space-After-" data-content-chunk-id="bb75fb09-6ecd-4d42-b5f4-950201c0dd4a"><i>All things are divided into meat and mouths — but even a mouth is just meat.</i></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="22f8368f-c5e2-445f-b92a-35132e126829">The drow warlock K’thriss Drow’b cuts a dashing figure as the worldly representative of the Ur — a ravenous, inscrutable, and largely indifferent elder entity from beyond reality. Tapped into this dark power, the “C” Team’s hoards­person sees all existence as a puzzle to unlock, and he is obsessed by the essential lack of meaning and purpose in the structures of so-called “reality.” Still, all things considered, he is most often polite and affable. Because after a long adventuring career, he understands that he can’t afford to make more enemies.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="bdbe72df-4e3f-4fa4-b390-d17472620283">Given his blue skin tone, rumors suggest that K’thriss is of mixed heritage, but no one knows for sure. As a young and doubting adherent of Lolth, he stumbled upon fragments of a relic known as the Black Altar, exposing him to their infinite truths and shocking the drow’s hair jet-black. His matching “beard” is actually a slow-growing colony of inert spores that K’thriss believes makes him look distinguished. Possessed of alarming and asymmetric crystalline eyes, he often wears a blindfold to spare others his visage, seeing through the eyes of his familiar while he does.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="f99a2677-7f1e-4422-8adc-ecb8e9e0c094">Tentacles play a big part in K’thriss’s spellcasting, whether wrenching him through the sky when he uses magic to fly, or manifesting in dark, suckered form when he casts spells such as <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="e12c432b-5570-4ce6-a786-67c1b5933ab2"><a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2309-thorn-whip" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2309-tooltip">thorn whip</a></span>.

<p class="Epigraph-Styles_Epigraph--Space-After-" data-content-chunk-id="3376fb4c-bad4-47c8-aaa4-51b025ed407d"><i>Well, I have this jar of eyeballs&nbsp;…</i></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="480ba474-f311-4481-a94c-b483a81b3d9a">Weighing in at just under 30 pounds and with a grandmotherly demeanor befitting her advanced age, Rosie Beestinger is easily mistaken for someone on the wrong side of the “aggressor/victim” relationship. But this is a mix-up that few people make more than once. Patient and studious, Rosie has schooled more than one malcontent with what the halfling refers to as “the sauce” — a whirlwind of kicks and punches to one or the other haunches that can inspire even the toughest half-orc to sprint toward anyplace Rosie isn’t. As an increasing number of folk hear the tales of her prowess, the “C” Team cartographer’s fame among her fellow halflings has become nothing short of legendary. Still, this adoration might be augmented by the sheer number of halflings related to Rosie. She has a daunting number of natural and adopted children, many of whom have followed their mother along the adventuring career track.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="323ce9e2-eafa-4bbc-8240-2dfb43ca551c">Rosie’s goals have always been more complex than merely seeking after adventure. She has long sought for ultimate meaning in the stars, and to seek justification for her belief that her bonds to her expansive family are reflected in the endless movements and intricate patterns of the sky. However, the Beestinger clan has a less metaphysical reputation in the eyes of many people, as constantly swirling rumors attempt to connect the family to various and nefarious halfling criminal enterprises. Naturally, Rosie knows nothing about any of that. Sure, her nickname is “Grandmother Night,” but that probably doesn’t mean anything.</p>

<p class="Epigraph-Styles_Epigraph--Space-After-" data-content-chunk-id="3eecc03e-4eab-46ad-9925-0943ded35f78"><i>The war ever rages.</i></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="815bb5d7-65cf-45b1-ad79-e5e86fb81126">Growing up in an all-female clan of druids, healers, and rangers, Walnut Dankgrass was drawn to the role of protector from her earliest years. Dedicated to Mielikki, the matriarchal clan known as the Enclave Panax Anima defended the unspoiled wild by word and blade (with the latter option more prevalent by far). But when tragedy struck the enclave, Walnut’s clan was destroyed to the last — leaving her with nothing but the all-consuming desire to seek out and destroy those responsible.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="510080e1-674f-4e0d-8383-011db8918463">As a guardian of the wild, Walnut has long held an antipathy toward civilization and anything urban. However, understanding that civilization was the source of the evil that destroyed her people, she makes the city her home now. She embraces her role as the “C” Team’s documancer, knowing that the city’s power — and its weaknesses — can be fully gleaned only from within.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="9d2211a6-41da-47af-8296-21240939a1f0">Walnut distrusts most folk she meets, except for those whose bearing reflects the matriarchal structure she was once part of. No matter what shape her struggles take, she knows instinctively that her beliefs are right and true — and that she will follow those beliefs to the bitter end.</p>

(It’s a long story.) Those who know him acknowledge his confidence, his arrogance, and his odd ability to engage with others by somehow saying exactly what each listener wants to hear. Whether this is some subtle magical ability or simply grifter’s charm, he makes good use of it either way.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="39bf0e56-ceee-4fc0-a68a-9c20dc17ffdb">Oak becomes a radically different person with each of his reincarnations, flipping between neutral good and neutral evil. His memories of past lives have been fractured by his many deaths, but he spends each new life accounting for the previous life in a karmic-ledger kind of way. His current incarnation embraces the good side. Mostly. Except for that occasional toxic bitterness. Oh, and the misanthropy. Actually, if you end up hating this guy, it’s probably not your fault.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="0bf8055c-558b-4357-8b9d-3debbfb3a8d7">Able arcanist Pendragon Beestinger took over as “B” Team cartographer after Brahma Lutier left the group. In fact, his first assignment was to assist in the team’s attempts to apprehend the wandering bard. An adopted child of the “C” Team’s Rosie Beestinger, Pendragon is his mother’s foil in almost every way — including his goal of wanting to mainstream some of the family’s rumored criminal interests. Pendragon has, in fact, attempted to kill his mother — and been killed himself in the process. Despite his having been resurrected at Rosie’s request, things remain cool between the two.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="c27c5f2d-a43a-467b-afaf-536fc0a5a96e">Pendragon was kicked out of wizarding school as a result of the dark rumors following the Beestinger clan. Now a self-taught mage, he specializes in making use of the dangerous spells and weird trinkets he often comes across in his role as a kind of arcane archaeologist. Seeking out the family feeling that an adventuring group provides keeps him in the “B” Team, even if that unfortunately comes with Oak Truestrike as a kind of father figure.</p>

Like, he talks so infrequently that even he might not recognize his own voice. Phoenix comes from the streets, where he grew up a fighter until a job sweeping the steps of a small temple of Waukeen showed him a new path. His hunger for coin as an adventurer is thus guided by his knowledge of what it is to do without.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="f0241f9f-704f-4ad4-9aef-867e9e23dbe4">More of an object individual than a people person, Phoenix is obsessively dedicated to the franchise’s assets and accounts. Thankfully, he includes his fellow members among those assets, making him fiercely loyal. However, Oak Truestrike is the only team member he’s ever really warmed to, which doesn’t do either of them any good.</p>

But those who know the story of Omin’s rise to power know the importance of his family to that story — and the complicated relationships that continue to bind Acquisitions Incorporated to the women of House Dran.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="84aee91a-57c9-479a-9ef5-9777b0eb1f63">The youngest sister of Omin Dran, the half-elf Auspicia Dran had her life torn apart as a child when she was seized by a mysterious creature called the Wandering Crypt. Having spent long years in a kind of dark dream within the crypt, she was saved in the end by her brother Omin’s tireless efforts and the valor of his handpicked “C” Team. Now returned safely to the world — and with the false Auspicia of the crypt’s creation slain — she focuses on trying to discover her own identity and to work through the ongoing complications arising from her ordeal.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="d4099d8d-518e-415c-89b8-4e824581ef81">When Auspicia emerged from the Wandering Crypt, she carried within her a growing level of psionic power. She can’t help but read others’ minds, but finds that wearing a diamond earring helps tamp that unwitting ability down. This magic has also left her connected to the crypt in a way she doesn’t understand, even as it grants her occasional memories of others still trapped there and an awareness of faraway places. In combat, she manifests an instinctive knowledge of events before they happen, often making use of this ability to bring a fight to a standstill that encourages parley. But she has only just begun to explore her full precognitive potential.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="96f1b733-b1ab-42d6-b69b-fc22090896ee">Now the owner and driving force behind Dran Enterprises — perhaps Acquisitions Incorporated’s most notable rival in the adventuring-for-profit-and-power biz — Portentia Dran is more than she appears to be. Quite literally. The person known as Portentia is actually a changeling, who took the place of the real Portentia before her fifth year.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="118a574a-fd5a-4848-90cc-1f70df59ca0d">The changeling Portentia can affect a range of disguises, and has spent long years engaged in a mission of manipulating the members of the Dran family. Years ago, it was Portentia who tricked her sister Auspicia into exploring the depths of the Wandering Crypt. And she would have been successful in arranging for Omin to be claimed by that creature as well if he hadn’t fled immediately in search of a weapon to aid his captured sister. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="ea65a14a-661c-41bb-be73-07061f69779b">Whether in combat or social encounters, Portentia shifts frequently between different forms and mindsets, only some of which are fully humanoid. She fights to maim, with a cruel combat style that emphasizes surprise and painful instruction. She is willing to affect any appearance or attitude to achieve her goals. But what those goals are — for herself and Dran Enterprises alike — remain a secret known only to her.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="2a3edf92-f541-41f5-9240-7ad495b95b8d">The elf matriarch of the Dran clan, Prophetess is a retired paladin of Tymora who now runs the inn known as the Dran &amp; Courtier. Formerly owned by her parents (and once called the Omindran), the inn has been a central feature of the village of Red Larch since before there was a Red Larch.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="ca0f3979-e644-4d71-a8df-5617f15a19a3">Prophetess spent long years haunted by the fate of her daughter, Auspicia. She never fully believed Omin’s stories about the strange creature that had seized his sister, then created a false Auspicia in her stead. Having long attempted to simply make her peace with the loss, she was overwhelmed by the real Auspicia’s dramatic and unexpected return to the world. Through all that time and currently, Prophetess has maintained a challenging relationship with her faith.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="cd65ad92-160e-4d24-94bc-e7a496aa152f">Though retired from active service to her deity, Prophetess can call on her spells and abilities in times of need, and remains in constant practice with Confessor, her maul. At her core, she believes that the gods help those who help themselves, and that people have a responsibility to their community. A practical sort who prefers to do things on her own, she doesn’t like to fuss with prayer if she doesn’t need to, as if bothering Tymora with trifles might seem rude.</p>

For by the time those glowing red eyes fix on you, it’s far too late to run&nbsp;…</em></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="487de11f-883d-4817-8e1b-d52224e695f6">Some adventurers and sages whisper that deep crows were first spawned as the familiars of evil arcane casters, abandoned in the subterranean depths and left to grow to enormous size. Others claim these creatures were once normal crows transmuted by vile essence and viler powers. But one thing all agree on is that ending up a meal for one of these monstrosities is a too-real threat for those who stumble into their deadly lairs.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="00732b55-c607-49c3-85f7-0934846efb56">Though the deep crow most immediately resembles a massive version of its namesake bird, this creature is a unique form of avian insect. Seen up close, it can easily be discerned from any other giant bird by its insectoid maw, its four-clawed feet, and the cluster of red eyes that are the most unsettling part of its appearance.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="eadf5d09-0387-4805-9086-ec17511613b4"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="03430e4b-fc8e-4a8c-8c1f-d6e0e848defe">Terror from Above.</span> The deep crow’s most fearsome attack is the bite of its mandibles, which can seize and hold almost any creature. Their preferred attack is a snatch-and-grab that sees a deep crow flying off with a living victim before its companions have any chance of counterattack. Provided the doomed prey doesn’t struggle, the deep crow takes it back to its lair to be devoured at leisure. Creatures that do struggle might be repeatedly dropped from a height to soften them up a bit.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="ff2dd69a-a2ee-4ad9-bf2b-698772593acc"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="f945aeaf-d907-4b4b-8859-d50c8ade85e6">Family Ties.</span> Deep crows live alone for an unknown length of years, emerging from the lair only to hunt, to look for potential threats, and to mate. Mating is a once-in-a-lifetime urge that sees each deep crow involved in the pairing produce a cluster of four to eight eggs. Incubation lasts a year, followed by a year during which the fledgling deep crows stay close by their parent’s side. The young then set out to establish lairs of their own.</p>

For years. Of even greater importance, they can teach their chicks to harbor the same resentments, instilling a cross-generational hatred of chosen foes that can last for centuries.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="06c5fd67-1948-42c6-9367-eabc65a68748">A keg robot is a stout wood-and-metal construct, vaguely reminiscent of a dwarf wearing a horned helm and possessing a barrel for a body. These constructs are another achievement of the Heuristic Arcane Research and Development (HARD) department of Acquisitions Incorporated. These devices have a number of practical purposes, including the ability to be filled with a variety of substances of use to an adventuring party. Specific models are nominally named for their primary function, including “ambulatory fermenter,” “mobile alchemical dispensary,” and so forth. But their prominent use as portable beer dispensers has placed the name “keg robot” firmly into public consciousness.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="995c9429-ef5f-440a-a582-4656b0bc6c03">A keg robot can hold up to three different kinds of liquid in its body cavity, from water and other potables to alchemical substances and lamp oil. Its individual storage compartments can leak, providing drinkable liquids with a unique but mostly safe flavor. These constructs have a rudimentary intellect that allows them to operate independently and discern friend from foe — and which sometimes causes them to operate with a crass sense of humor that has never been fully explained.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="3b3adf76-15c5-443d-96d3-3f5b86f13f08">Sometimes a goblin can’t catch a break. First, you fall in with a cult that works for the release of a death god. Then you get taken prisoner by a group of sociopathic adventurers who end up letting you die after you save their sorry lives. One minute, you’re a dead goblin named Splug. And then you’re alive again, and it seems like a really good idea to play up the drama of resurrection with a cool new name — and a master plan for cold, cold revenge against those who betrayed you.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="80e18470-29de-412b-a476-102bdb0cee45">Every once in a while, the (accidentally) capricious and (totally unintentionally) self-centered nature of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise might incur some collateral damage among followers, hirelings, and staff. When that happens, the collateral damage sometimes inspires some collateral damage of its own. No one is entirely sure how many times Splugoth the Returned has actually returned from the dead. But as the point goblin for the group known as the Six (see “<a title="Factions and Rivals" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/player-options#FactionsandRivals" data-content-chunk-id="261dfadc-8290-48d2-936b-c570ed676874">Factions and Rivals</a>” in <a title="chapter 3" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ai/player-options" data-content-chunk-id="f448459b-24c6-4dd5-9ce2-e78228764724">chapter 3</a>), he’s made vengeance against Acq Inc and Omin Dran his life’s work. And then the work of his next life. And the one after that.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="6879b77d-b089-4472-b01f-a5c44acf41ac">An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign frequently pits the characters against rival franchises and enemy factions. This section provides iconic features that can be added to any monster or NPC stat block to make that stat block representative of a specific faction, allowing employees of organizations such as Dran Enterprises or the Six to show off specific training or tactics endemic to those organizations.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="1a288b63-9924-4d72-b0d8-d258b5f302d8">Not all monsters or NPCs in the employ of a faction need to have faction features. Lower-ranked members of an organization might have only one iconic feature, with that feature replacing some other aspect of their stat block. Faction leaders and specialist field operatives might have all the iconic features, in addition to the regular features of their stat block. Each set of iconic faction features comes with a list of NPCs that work well as members of that faction, but those are only suggestions.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="7307b717-88e5-4746-aaf9-7c653f2da419">Many faction features increase the relative challenge of a creature, and thus can increase the threat level of an encounter. Be especially aware of this if you add faction features to multiple foes in a combat encounter, and think about decreasing the number of foes to keep the encounter balanced.</p>

Some say battle balloons were an original design created by the Heuristic Arcane Research and Development department of Acquisitions Incorporated. But the wizards of Halruaa developed similar skyships in ages past, and the Cult of the Dragon has been seen with flying ships of its own. Still, among the small number of factions and organizations known to possess or build airships, Acquisitions Incorporated might be the best known for its high-profile aerial escapades. It’s certain that neither the mages of Halruaa nor the members of the Cult of the Dragon ever crewed a battle balloon with keg robots, or used one to squash a tyrannosaurus flat.</p>

Trailing lines connect the balloon to the vessel of metal and wood suspended below. In the center of the deck, directly below the balloon, sits a large magic furnace, whose formidable lifting power is rumored to involve trapped elementals. The airship’s captain controls the arcane furnace and directs forward thrust by way of a propeller located at the back of the ship, helming the craft with a wheel positioned in the bow. Metal runners below the ship allow a battle balloon to land on the ground.</p>

Most pertinently, a vehicle has the six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and the corresponding modifiers. The Strength of a vehicle expresses its size and weight. Dexterity represents its ease of handling. A vehicle’s Constitution covers its durability and the quality of its construction. Vehicles usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. If a vehicle has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score. How a vehicle is crewed and what actions it can take on its turn are described in the stat block for the vehicle.</p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body" data-content-chunk-id="4a8d408c-3734-44c0-b326-59b047980b77">A mechanical beholder takes the form of an oversized eye tyrant whose central eye is a viewport window. Part conveyance, part laboratory, and part siege engine, the vehicle can transport up to six humanoids through any terrain or medium, including underwater and through solid stone. A complex and often dangerous manipulation of gears, levers, and buttons controlled the original mechanical beholders, but more recent models feature magical controls that respond to voice commands — though not always accurately.</p>

Its range of armaments includes a disintegration ray modeled after that of its monstrous namesake (which for reasons of liability is advertised as being designed exclusively for waste removal). Portholes and hatches allow characters inside the beholder to make ranged and magical attacks from within it.</p>

She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.</p>

But the orrery’s instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again — and moving closer to each other all the time.</p>
