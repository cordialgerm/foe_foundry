<p data-content-chunk-id="85bdbe63-8b8f-4618-b1d5-54e972677520">It’s good to be the Dungeon Master! Not only do you get to tell fantastic stories about heroes, villains, monsters, and magic, but you also get to create the world in which these stories live. Whether you’re running a D&amp;D game already or you think it’s something you want to try, these rules are for you.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bf7df66a-6923-4bea-93e2-c5cfaf1725fa">The <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> assumes that you know the basics of how to play the D&amp;D tabletop roleplaying game. If you haven’t played before, the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Starter Set</em> is a great starting point for new players and DMs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ea3cce2f-f531-49c8-84fa-bf83b1f13a2e">These rules have two important companions: the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="ba58217e-7067-4872-813d-c941faea4c10">Player’s Handbook</a>, which contains the rules your players need to create characters and the rules you need to run the game, and the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="b25c7f4f-d5de-48b3-bec8-654504d5d262">Monster Manual</a>, which contains ready-to-use monsters to populate your D&amp;D world.</p>
<h2 id="TheDungeonMaster" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="3a543fbe-a7f8-4672-bf23-5ecbeea29ba4"><a href="#TheDungeonMaster" data-content-chunk-id="bc8c077d-c379-4c9c-b0df-a76abbc513d4"></a>The Dungeon Master</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a4fca780-abf8-4631-b7c0-ece9b306189d">The Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force behind a D&amp;D game. The DM creates a world for the other players to explore, and also creates and runs <strong>adventures</strong> that drive the story. An adventure typically hinges on the successful completion of a quest, and can be as short as a single game session. Longer adventures might embroil players in great conflicts that require multiple game sessions to resolve. When strung together, these adventures form an ongoing <strong>campaign</strong>. A D&amp;D campaign can include dozens of adventures and last for months or years.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="af8e76fd-b8ce-479d-8280-e9a17925da5b">A Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As the architect of a campaign, the DM creates adventures by placing monsters, traps, and treasures for the other players’ characters (the <strong>adventurers</strong>) to discover. As a storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize what’s happening around them, improvising when the adventurers do something or go somewhere unexpected. As an actor, the DM plays the roles of the monsters and supporting characters, breathing life into them. And as a referee, the DM interprets the rules and decides when to abide by them and when to change them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db5aea48-af2d-4af0-852d-9b1a12983b28">Inventing, writing, storytelling, improvising, acting, refereeing — every DM handles these roles differently, and you’ll probably enjoy some more than others. It helps to remember that Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a hobby, and being the DM should be fun. Focus on the aspects you enjoy and downplay the rest. For example, if you don’t like creating your own adventures, you can use published ones. You can also lean on the other players to help you with rules mastery and world-building.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fe82a5ec-6723-4667-abbb-e23282d40598">The D&amp;D rules help you and the other players have a good time, but the rules aren’t in charge. You’re the DM, and <em>you</em> are in charge of the game. That said, your goal isn’t to slaughter the adventurers but to create a campaign world that revolves around their actions and decisions, and to keep your players coming back for more! If you’re lucky, the events of your campaign will echo in the memories of your players long after the final game session is concluded.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="35031301-c407-4e05-95ce-dc4e30bfcd49">These rules are organized in three parts. The first part helps you decide what kind of campaign you’d like to run. The second part helps you create the adventures — the stories — that will compose the campaign and keep the players entertained from one game session to the next. The last part helps you adjudicate the rules of the game and modify them to suit the style of your campaign.</p>
<h3 id="Part1MasterofWorlds" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="98a1fae0-8611-4f11-ae8b-f683847b590d"><a href="#Part1MasterofWorlds" data-content-chunk-id="fca72b50-ee77-4cbd-9dbe-9578b82d6a8f"></a>Part 1: Master of Worlds</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6392edc6-4cb7-4a84-b199-08f6c5841ab7">Every DM is the creator of his or her own campaign world. Whether you invent a world, adapt a world from a favorite movie or novel, or use a published setting for the D&amp;D game, you make that world your own over the course of a campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="60808233-e368-4fbb-b2f4-181e71e0d74c">The world where you set your campaign is one of countless worlds that make up the D&amp;D <strong>multiverse</strong>, a vast array of planes and worlds where adventures happen. Even if you’re using an established world such as the Forgotten Realms, your campaign takes place in a sort of mirror universe of the official setting where Forgotten Realms novels, game products, and digital games are assumed to take place. The world is yours to change as you see fit and yours to modify as you explore the consequences of the players’ actions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="77ac2afd-4fa7-4cf8-99fd-0eb1ecce8e16">Your world is more than just a backdrop for adventures. Like Middle Earth, Westeros, and countless other fantasy worlds out there, it’s a place to which you can escape and witness fantastic stories unfold. A well-designed and well-run world seems to flow around the adventurers, so that they feel part of something, instead of apart from it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fefad58f-20aa-47f0-9ea9-c9b33088b2a5">Consistency is a key to a believable fictional world. When the adventurers go back into town for supplies, they should encounter the same <strong>nonplayer characters</strong> (NPCs) they met before. Soon, they’ll learn the barkeep’s name, and he or she will remember theirs as well. Once you have achieved this degree of consistency, you can provide an occasional change. If the adventurers come back to buy more horses at the stables, they might discover that the man who ran the place went back home to the large city over the hills, and now his niece runs the family business. That sort of change — one that has nothing to do with the adventurers directly, but one that they’ll notice — makes the players feel as though their characters are part of a living world that changes and grows along with them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="67ede4c4-409a-40f9-bbc0-5265ad4281fd">Part 1 of these rules is all about inventing your world. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/a-world-of-your-own" data-content-chunk-id="72005e62-9603-4061-980c-845072c81089">Chapter 1</a> asks what type of game you want to run, and helps you nail down a few important details about your world and its overarching conflicts. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-a-multiverse" data-content-chunk-id="20c40963-35e2-4738-a789-875dca4c3110">Chapter 2</a> helps you put your world in the greater context of the multiverse, expanding on the information presented in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="7eadbf28-2084-4e46-b71f-8238757fe44e">Player’s Handbook</a> to discuss the planes of existence and the gods and how you can put them together to serve the needs of your campaign.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fbabaf31-79a7-4182-95d7-47254130858d">Whether you write your own adventures or use published ones, expect to invest preparation time beyond the hours you spend at the gaming table. You’ll need to carve out some free time to exercise your creativity as you invent compelling plots, create new NPCs, craft encounters, and think of clever ways to foreshadow story events yet to come.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="44fe798a-309d-4fb6-95b8-e51610cac50f">Part 2 of these rules is devoted to helping you create and run great adventures. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="be636e9c-75e7-4d63-8c61-0b5a278a5138">Chapter 3</a> covers the basic elements of a D&amp;D adventure, and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters" data-content-chunk-id="b0493691-e6fd-4af6-b1a5-42aa7b50a4da">chapter 4</a> helps you create memorable NPCs. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments" data-content-chunk-id="80f146b1-ef11-4f75-8297-605273e5bf1b">Chapter 5</a> presents guidelines and advice for running adventures set in dungeons, the wilderness, and other locales, and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="42535db3-ab8a-48ab-b78a-edd1f5f03ddb">chapter 6</a> covers the time between adventures. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure" data-content-chunk-id="20e7d2af-ccc4-4f1c-9f22-8f3fd5392386">Chapter 7</a> is all about treasure, magic items, and special rewards that help keep the players invested in your campaign.</p>
<h3 id="Part3MasterofRules" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="64e7458a-372e-4eea-be90-7f0bde469c07"><a href="#Part3MasterofRules" data-content-chunk-id="83abf4df-6683-4944-b4c0-4d260130a2f2"></a>Part 3: Master of Rules</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d658fe73-e18e-4c7c-b9a3-e78c6c71ca22">Dungeons &amp; Dragons isn’t a head-to-head competition, but it needs someone who is impartial yet involved in the game to guarantee that everyone at the table plays by the rules. As the player who creates the game world and the adventures that take place within it, the DM is a natural fit to take on the referee role.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="65053570-3441-4109-8c4e-1e1dfe2df4bd">As a referee, the DM acts as a mediator between the rules and the players. A player tells the DM what he or she wants to do, and the DM determines whether it is successful or not, in some cases asking the player to make a die roll to determine success. For example, if a player wants his or her character to take a swing at an orc, you say, “Make an attack roll” while looking up the orc’s Armor Class.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fcc6111d-4bc4-44a6-a2a7-657be8be710f">The rules don’t account for every possible situation that might arise during a typical D&amp;D session. For example, a player might want his or her character to hurl a brazier full of hot coals into a monster’s face. How you determine the outcome of this action is up to you. You might tell the player to make a Strength check, while mentally setting the <strong>Difficulty Class</strong> (DC) at 15. If the Strength check is successful, you then determine how a face full of hot coals affects the monster. You might decide that it deals 1d4 fire damage and imposes disadvantage on the monster’s attack rolls until the end of its next turn. You roll the damage die (or let the player do it), and the game continues.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8dda0eec-617c-4f4a-9fbb-12749f9b492e">Sometimes mediating the rules means setting limits. If a player tells you, “I want to run up and attack the orc,” but the character doesn’t have enough movement to reach the orc, you say, “It’s too far away to move up and still attack. What would you like to do instead?” The player takes the information and comes up with a different plan.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="10022a4e-b3b1-4171-a1f3-6c841a9f78d0">To referee the rules, you need to know them. You don’t have to memorize these rules or the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="29a76b6d-3c8d-47e9-ade4-0e162b89e373">Player’s Handbook</a>, but you should have a clear idea of their contents so that, when a situation requires a ruling, you know where to find the proper reference.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e24af178-4764-49b5-a41b-c4f4cd0d3cad">The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="1dbbb511-6ef1-4b35-86c3-958507fc3df0">Player’s Handbook</a> contains the main rules you need to play the game. Part 3 of these rules offers a wealth of information to help you adjudicate the rules in a wide variety of situations. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game" data-content-chunk-id="da039e7b-0678-4acb-9e9e-4f971df387f3">Chapter 8</a> presents advice for using attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. It also includes options appropriate for certain play styles and campaigns, including guidelines for using miniatures, a system for handling chase scenes, and rules for madness. If you like to create your own stuff, such as new monsters, races, and character backgrounds, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop" data-content-chunk-id="6aeafa8b-7eb1-4acb-81a3-e360270b8ad4">chapter 9</a> shows you how. That chapter also contains optional rules for unusual situations or play styles, such as the use of firearms in a fantasy setting.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="585c98ab-8e71-4110-8022-1aad246fd947">The success of a D&amp;D game hinges on your ability to entertain the other players at the game table. Whereas their role is to create characters (the protagonists of the campaign), breathe life into them, and help steer the campaign through their characters’ actions, your role is to keep the players (and yourself) interested and immersed in the world you’ve created, and to let their characters do awesome things.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="874f54c0-0bbc-4dfe-a52c-2fef3eec6412">Knowing what your players enjoy most about the D&amp;D game helps you create and run adventures that they will enjoy and remember. Once you know which of the following activities each player in your group enjoys the most, you can tailor adventures that satisfy your players’ preferences as much as possible, thus keeping them engaged.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7f763836-6613-456c-ae2b-9fa97e237f0c">This book, the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="d7f05716-fc7a-4b01-bf7b-bc11165b1658">Player’s Handbook</a>, and the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="9eb0d23c-e8fd-456b-bebf-721878674f93">Monster Manual</a> present the default assumptions for how the worlds of D&amp;D work. Among the established settings of D&amp;D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Mystara don’t stray very far from those assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, Ravenloft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further away from that baseline. As you create your own world, it’s up to you to decide where on the spectrum you want your world to fall.</p>
<h3 id="CoreAssumptions" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="019d87de-8589-4bae-bd1c-11b1a56341d1"><a href="#CoreAssumptions" data-content-chunk-id="e5b6567f-4e43-429f-84e6-c6855592de6e"></a>Core Assumptions</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ed01cc29-0945-41a6-bd2a-5e3c1bc9d76b">The rules of the game are based on the following core assumptions about the game world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1a1f2400-573f-4c46-8a52-f73895efe11b"><strong><em>Gods Oversee the World.</em></strong> The gods are real and embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, forests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world by granting divine magic to their followers and sending signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its rivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, none can deny their existence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c35ce1e0-cb03-4f5c-bf92-23430e5595fa"><strong><em>Much of the World Is Untamed.</em></strong> Wild regions abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms of various sizes dot the landscape, but beyond their borders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they live in well. They’ve heard stories of other places from merchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless they’ve been there themselves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a99fcd30-d0ad-4228-b40e-ad3b601a9664"><strong><em>The World Is Ancient.</em></strong> Empires rise and fall, leaving few places that have not been touched by imperial grandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations and their knowledge survive in legends, magic items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an empire’s collapse.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d70bc74-0932-4791-a3a4-03af5104a326"><strong><em>Conflict Shapes the World’s History.</em></strong> Powerful individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and factions of like-minded individuals can alter the course of history. Factions include religions led by charismatic prophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic. The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as they compete with each other for power. Some seek to preserve the world and usher in a golden age. Others strive toward evil ends, seeking to rule the world with an iron fist. Still others seek goals that range from the practical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation of material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god. Whatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide, creating conflict that can steer the world’s fate.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="41966563-8b1c-4d5c-8416-a4346022d6b7"><strong><em>The World Is Magical.</em></strong> Practitioners of magic are relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of their craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous and commonplace as a potion that heals wounds to something much more rare and impressive, such as a levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates of a city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with magical abilities.</p>
<h3 id="ItsYourWorld" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="53aa2804-4c86-4393-8411-85a42522095a"><a href="#ItsYourWorld" data-content-chunk-id="d32c2b9b-64bf-4119-b60b-4b5b11b5a369"></a>It’s Your World</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="89685b18-65b9-4bdd-a9f9-b6782c08b39f">In creating your campaign world, it helps to start with the core assumptions and consider how your setting might change them. The subsequent sections of this chapter address each element and give details on how to flesh out your world with gods, factions, and so forth.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e0480c2a-9cf9-42d4-9a0e-f87b5c3522b5">The assumptions sketched out above aren’t carved in stone. They inspire exciting D&amp;D worlds full of adventure, but they’re not the only set of assumptions that can do so. You can build an interesting campaign concept by altering one or more of those core assumptions, just as well-established D&amp;D worlds have done. Ask yourself, “What if the standard assumptions weren’t true in my world?”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8e7b18dd-c0f9-401c-9452-c663c99a4444"><strong><em>The World Is a Mundane Place.</em></strong> What if magic is rare and dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no access to it? What if your campaign is set in a version of our own world’s history?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dfd78167-8d86-46c4-8e13-69f1b251dab6"><strong><em>The World Is New.</em></strong> What if your world is new, and the characters are the first of a long line of heroes? The adventurers might be champions of the first great empires, such as the empires of Netheril and Cormanthyr in the Forgotten Realms setting.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dbe00424-9faa-4272-b403-d04592d70068"><strong><em>The World Is Known.</em></strong> What if the world is completely charted and mapped, right down to the “Here there be dragons” notations? What if great empires cover huge stretches of countryside, with clearly defined borders between them? The Five Nations of the Eberron setting were once part of a great empire, and magically aided travel between its cities is commonplace.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="936220b1-f742-400c-b277-4bd1869ed740"><strong><em>Monsters Are Uncommon.</em></strong> What if monsters are rare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft setting, horrific domains are governed by monstrous rulers. The populace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords and their evil minions, but other monsters rarely trouble people’s daily lives.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0ee5bd45-e73a-45b0-8e84-bcf6dd37847e"><strong><em>Magic Is Everywhere.</em></strong> What if every town is ruled by a powerful wizard? What if magic item shops are common? The Eberron setting makes the use of magic an everyday occurrence, as magical flying ships and trains carry travelers from one great city to another.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e414bc3e-a563-4a04-ac6e-214ec9bf857d"><strong><em>Gods Inhabit the Land, or Are Entirely Absent.</em></strong> What if the gods regularly walk the earth? What if the characters can challenge them and seize their power? Or what if the gods are remote, and even angels never make contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun setting, the gods are extremely distant — perhaps nonexistent — and clerics rely instead on elemental power for their magic.</p>

You can adopt one of these pantheons for your campaign, or pick and choose deities and ideas from them as you please. See “<a href="#ASamplePantheon" data-content-chunk-id="eac3b29b-4fb3-4a3a-a286-fdafcce9e515">A Sample Pantheon</a>” in this section for an example.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="06a8ca9b-c434-466f-b885-4da8c4f4f100">As far as the game’s rules are concerned, it doesn’t matter if your world has hundreds of deities or a church devoted to a single god. In rules terms, clerics choose domains, not deities, so your world can associate domains with deities in any way you choose.</p>
<h3 id="LoosePantheons" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="13a1471a-0664-4e2e-a968-f0e59e16de00"><a href="#LoosePantheons" data-content-chunk-id="c5e540eb-f44a-42ed-a035-4e412d3478ac"></a>Loose Pantheons</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b64e1efd-c75e-4a44-b8fa-611130852f24">Most D&amp;D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods. A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of existence, variously cooperating with and competing against one another to administer the affairs of the universe. People gather in public shrines to worship gods of life and wisdom, or meet in hidden places to venerate gods of deception or destruction.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="94b708a8-27a2-4fd2-88d9-95cb1f9434c7">Each deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is responsible for advancing that portfolio. In the Greyhawk setting, Heironeous is a god of valor who calls clerics and paladins to his service and encourages them to spread the ideals of honorable warfare, chivalry, and justice in society. Even in the midst of his everlasting war with his brother Hextor, god of war and tyranny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: war fought nobly and in the cause of justice.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01449ed5-9383-460c-98eb-50504576d4c3">People in most D&amp;D worlds are polytheistic, honoring deities of their own and acknowledging pantheons of other cultures. Individuals pay homage to various gods, regardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a person might propitiate Umberlee before setting out to sea, join a communal feast to celebrate Chauntea at harvest time, and pray to Malar before going hunting.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="759b46e0-5885-420a-8b99-ae9bed17515c">Some individuals feel a calling to a particular deity’s service and claim that god as a patron. Particularly devoted individuals become priests by setting up a shrine or helping to staff a holy site. Much more rarely, those who feel such a calling become clerics or paladins invested with the responsibility of true divine power.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="34aa71b6-0b3d-4d89-ba05-6f4492bc5262">Shrines and temples serve as community gathering points for religious rites and festivals. Priests at such sites relate stories of the gods, teach the ethics of their patron deities, offer advice and blessings, perform religious rites, and provide training in activities their deities favor. Cities and large towns can host several temples dedicated to individual gods important to the community, while smaller settlements might have a single shrine devoted to any gods the locals revere.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="41210c80-2d15-4051-8c25-de8df2850ef1">To quickly build a pantheon for your world, create a single god for each of the eight domains available to clerics: Death, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, and War. You can invent names and personalities for these deities, or borrow deities from other pantheons. This approach gives you a small pantheon that covers the most significant aspects of existence, and it’s easy enough to extrapolate other areas of life each deity controls. The god of Knowledge, for example, might also be patron of magic and prophecy, while the god of Light could be the sun god and the god of time.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8cdd059e-5966-4a21-9214-ae43c3bea749">The pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a pantheon assembled from mostly preexisting elements to suit the needs of a particular campaign. This is the default pantheon in the fourth edition <em>Player’s Handbook</em> (2008). The pantheon is summarized in the Dawn War Deities table.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="003555f4-7f33-4042-81e8-736b767556f9">This pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities and establishes them as universal gods. These gods include Bahamut, Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth, Moradin, Sehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and Corellon as gods of their respective portfolios, rather than as racial deities. The pantheon also includes the archdevil Asmodeus as god of domination and tyranny.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c9d564fc-fdbd-4cf5-a93f-598e8b534c01">Several of the gods are drawn from other pantheons, sometimes with new names for the gods. Bane comes from the Forgotten Realms. From Greyhawk come Kord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the Greek pantheon come Athena (renamed Erathis) and Tyche (renamed Avandra), though both are altered. Set (renamed Zehir) comes from the Egyptian pantheon. The Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon’s Hel and Greyhawk’s Wee Jas. That leaves three gods created from scratch: Ioun, Melora, and Torog.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7300bce2-7072-4754-b9fb-582477701ba8">In your campaign, you can create pantheons of gods who are closely linked in a single religion, monotheistic religions (worship of a single deity), dualistic systems (centered on two opposing deities or forces), mystery cults (involving personal devotion to a single deity, usually as part of a pantheon system), animistic religions (revering the spirits inherent in nature), or even forces and philosophies that don’t center on deities.</p>
<h4 id="TightPantheons" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="273e39ac-2df9-46d3-a1e0-044aa48cd284"><a href="#TightPantheons" data-content-chunk-id="a62e1c42-1e25-4e38-9bac-074cd6b37162"></a>Tight Pantheons</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e9fd76d6-50ac-487f-932e-59072e11efb3">In contrast to a loose pantheon, a tight pantheon focuses on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace a small group of deities. Followers of a tight pantheon might favor one of its member deities over another, but they respect all the deities and honor them with sacrifices and prayer as appropriate.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d15c53d0-f8df-456b-a298-a4bca0712a2a">The key trait to a tight pantheon is that its worshipers embrace a single ethos or dogma that includes all the deities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to protect and guide their followers. You can think of a tight pantheon as similar to a family. One or two deities who lead the pantheon serve as parent figures, with the rest serving as patrons of important aspects of the culture that worships the pantheon. A single temple honors all members of the pantheon.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d73dc1e-6f25-4a6a-8982-08a861bc393d">Most tight pantheons have one or more aberrant gods — deities whose worship isn’t sanctioned by the priests of the pantheon as a whole. These are usually evil deities and enemies of the pantheon, such as the Greek Titans. These deities have cults of their own, attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship. These cults resemble mystery cults, their members strictly devoted to their single god, though even members of aberrant cults pay lip service in the temples of the tight pantheon.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="012edf8d-4810-4890-b404-d2bccd846dcd">The Norse deities serve as an example of a tight pantheon. Odin is the pantheon’s leader and father figure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr, and Freya embody important aspects of Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki and his devotees lurk in the shadows, sometimes aiding the other deities, and sometimes working against them with the pantheon’s enemies.</p>
<h4 id="MysteryCults" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="ea8a7a94-69fa-4a20-b5f4-89a769734c01"><a href="#MysteryCults" data-content-chunk-id="8bd95831-6bcb-4f3e-aabf-f0dedddfd7b8"></a>Mystery Cults</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08bffbff-cf2c-431e-8ea7-9c60a5bd4461">A mystery cult is a secretive religious organization based on a ritual of initiation, in which the initiate is mystically identified with a god, or a handful of related gods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, concerned with the initiate’s relationship with the divine.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bce75c18-4247-46f5-83c1-a07682cd5d68">Sometimes a mystery cult is a type of worship within a pantheon. It acknowledges the myths and rituals of the pantheon, but presents its own myths and rites as primary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might immerse themselves in a mystical relationship to a god who is part of a broadly worshiped pantheon.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e8d983ee-6170-4125-b4a1-896edb2c6bde">A mystery cult emphasizes the history of its god, which is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual. The foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple and often involves a god’s death and rising, or a journey to the underworld and a return. Mystery cults often revere sun and moon deities and agricultural deities — gods whose portfolios reflect the cycles of nature.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="46e6ee50-ef94-4344-8444-234adfe3dbb9">The cult’s ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its foundation myth. Neophytes retrace the god’s footsteps in order to share the god’s ultimate fate. In the case of dying and rising gods, the symbolic death of the initiate represents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth into a transformed existence. Initiates are born into a new life, remaining in the world of mortal affairs but feeling elevated to a higher sphere. The initiate is promised a place in the god’s realm after death, but also experiences new meaning in life.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6f86c032-3958-497d-90aa-9624c67b1265">DIVINE RANK</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="27a9c285-9f81-4262-b9ea-87ed60e8cf9b">The divine beings of the multiverse are often categorized according to their cosmic power. Some gods are worshiped on multiple worlds and have a different rank on each world, depending on their influence there.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8754ff8f-24ee-4a81-9acc-c37246cb2537"><strong>Greater deities</strong> are beyond mortal understanding. They can’t be summoned, and they are almost always removed from direct involvement in mortal affairs. On very rare occasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities, but slaying a greater god’s avatar has no effect on the god itself.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f63c8168-ba32-43e6-9596-a0944a601096"><strong>Lesser deities</strong> are embodied somewhere in the planes. Some lesser deities live in the Material Plane, as does the unicorn-goddess Lurue of the Forgotten Realms and the titanic shark-god Sekolah revered by the sahuagin. Others live on the Outer Planes, as Lolth does in the Abyss. Such deities can be encountered by mortals.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="79ddb052-8fc5-4bc2-ab02-7caaa4c6c384"><strong>Quasi-deities</strong> have a divine origin, but they don’t hear or answer prayers, grant spells to clerics, or control aspects of mortal life. They are still immensely powerful beings, and in theory they could ascend to godhood if they amassed enough worshipers. Quasi-deities fall into three subcategories: demigods, titans, and vestiges.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0201f6e5-13ff-4a5f-ae0b-63a28756f84d"><em>Demigods</em> are born from the union of a deity and a mortal being. They have some divine attributes, but their mortal parentage makes them the weakest quasi-deities.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a7398983-bea8-4466-81e5-d63364ce2090"><em>Titans</em> are the divine creations of deities. They might be birthed from the union of two deities, manufactured on a divine forge, born from the blood spilled by a god, or otherwise brought about through divine will or substance.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d40c0be-550b-41f4-99a7-47837bd252ef"><em>Vestiges</em> are deities who have lost nearly all their worshipers and are considered dead, from a mortal perspective. Esoteric rituals can sometimes contact these beings and draw on their latent power.</p>

<h4 id="Monotheism" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="73edd46b-426f-440b-a522-ca195cf14d57"><a href="#Monotheism" data-content-chunk-id="f80a3051-4206-41db-bef1-c5d91bce3b5c"></a>Monotheism</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="baa83cfa-e4c6-41d8-9257-3a3de9763fda">Monotheistic religions revere only one deity, and in some cases, deny the existence of any other deity. If you introduce a monotheistic religion into your campaign, you need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if they don’t, other religions can exist side by side with the monotheistic religion. If these religions have clerics with spellcasting ability, their spells might be powered by the one true deity, by lesser spirits who aren’t deities (possibly including powerful aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends, or elementals), or simply by their faith.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9deb2721-6dad-4a72-a4f1-8619b18aff47">The deity of a monotheistic religion has an extensive portfolio and is portrayed as the creator of everything, in control of everything, and concerned with every aspect of existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers prayers and sacrifices to the same god regardless of what aspect of life is in need of divine assistance. Whether marching into war, setting off on a journey, or hoping to win someone’s affections, the worshiper prays to the same god.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b8c6c073-a2a2-4d39-91a1-3b1dffdeb98d">Some monotheistic religions describe different aspects of their deity. A single god appears in different aspects as the Creator and the Destroyer, and the clerics of that god focus on one aspect or the other, determining their domain access and possibly even their alignment on that basis. A cleric who venerates the Destroyer aspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while one who worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life or Nature domains. In some monotheistic religions, clerics group themselves into distinct religious orders to differentiate clerics who choose different domains.</p>
<h4 id="Dualism" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="35d3bc79-f94a-4ae7-869f-e97c2b184139"><a href="#Dualism" data-content-chunk-id="af381cdd-c129-453c-a223-88106edd1c2c"></a>Dualism</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="54a12bd6-473f-45e7-b5d5-c130afe2fda0">A dualistic religion views the world as the stage for a conflict between two diametrically opposed deities or divine forces. Most often, the opposed forces are good and evil, or opposed deities representing those forces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law and chaos are the fundamental opposites in a dualistic system. Life and death, light and darkness, matter and spirit, body and mind, health and illness, purity and defilement, positive energy and negative energy — the D&amp;D universe is full of polar opposites that could serve as the foundation for a dualistic religion. Whatever the terms in which the dualism is expressed, half of the pair is usually believed to be good — beneficial, desirable, or holy — while the other half is considered bad, if not explicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is expressed as the opposition between matter and spirit, the followers of that religion believe that one of the two (usually matter) is evil and the other (spirit) is good, and so seek to liberate their spirits from this material world and its evils through asceticism and contemplation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e4351459-7898-41a7-86c2-f2310991a56e">Rare dualistic systems believe that the two opposing forces must remain in balance, always pulling away from each other but remaining bound together in creative tension.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7acd8532-924d-4bb4-9dba-3eecb25cfc58">In a cosmology defined by an eternal conflict between good and evil, mortals are expected to take sides. The majority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship the deity or force identified as good. Worshipers of the good deity trust themselves to that god’s power to protect them from the evil deity’s minions. Because the evil deity in such a religion is usually the source of everything that is detrimental to existence, only the perverse and depraved worship this god. Monsters and fiends serve it, as do certain secretive cults. The myths of a dualistic religion usually predict that the good deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the forces of evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn’t predetermined and work to promote their deity’s victory.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7ee189a2-940d-4f8f-864b-d144b775b1f5">Deities in a dualistic system maintain large portfolios. All aspects of existence reflect the dualistic struggle, and therefore all things can fall on one side or the other of the conflict. Agriculture, mercy, the sky, medicine, and poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and famine, hatred, disease, and war belong to the evil deity.</p>
<h4 id="Animism" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="6286560d-9679-43cc-bcf1-799aafc21ad4"><a href="#Animism" data-content-chunk-id="46b4b605-a307-4479-a5e7-f5fbcc9aafa3"></a>Animism</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0cc7f5a1-ecb8-4224-9302-454f1bdbd711">Animism is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of the natural world. In an animistic worldview, everything has a spirit, from the grandest mountain to the lowliest rock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook, from the sun and moon to a fighter’s ancestral sword. All these objects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient, though some are more aware, alert, and intelligent than others. The most powerful spirits might even be considered deities. All are worthy of respect if not veneration.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee365bec-dbe0-4470-827c-89c275378df2">Animists don’t typically pay allegiance to one spirit over the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices to different spirits at different times, as appropriate to the situation. A pious character might make daily prayers and offerings to ancestor spirits and the spirits of the house, regular petitions to important spirits such as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional sacrifices of incense to location spirits such as the spirit of a forest, and sporadic prayers to a host of other spirits as well.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dfb9f58e-5ade-44c3-a7ef-c3492f8f7dcf">An animistic religion very tolerant. Most spirits don’t care to whom a character also offers sacrifices, as long as they receive the sacrifices and respect they are due. As new religions spread through animist lands, those religions typically win adherents but not converts. People incorporate new spirits and deities into their prayers without displacing the old ones. Contemplatives and scholars adopt complex philosophical systems and practices without changing their belief in and respect for the spirits they already venerate.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="29b9d025-f2d4-497b-b40a-b5c2174f0085">Animism functions as a large tight pantheon. Animist clerics serve the pantheon as a whole, and so can choose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for that cleric.</p>
<h4 id="ForcesandPhilosophies" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="1470861b-562c-4dd8-a99e-1d83c11e57f5"><a href="#ForcesandPhilosophies" data-content-chunk-id="f91f4d3e-8198-4f53-a282-bd3979726768"></a>Forces and Philosophies</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f1cc1feb-ad56-4400-8cee-85df4548edc3">Not all divine powers need to be derived from deities. In some campaigns, believers hold enough conviction in their ideas about the universe that they gain magical power from that conviction. In other campaigns, impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods by granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as druids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the force of nature rather than from a specific nature deity, some clerics devote themselves to ideals rather than to a god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and chivalry rather than a specific deity.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="73a7e54c-f47f-460f-a4fb-5a715b6ba351">Forces and philosophies aren’t worshiped; they aren’t beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept sacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn’t necessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can be devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship to various good deities, or revere the force of nature and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might be seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal force. In a world that includes deities with demonstrable power (through their clerics), it’s unusual for a philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a common philosophical belief states that the deities are more like mortals than they would have mortals believe. According to such philosophies, the gods aren’t truly immortal (just very long-lived), and mortals can attain divinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the ultimate goal of some philosophies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b5cef398-72ab-4822-9388-5eab8cedb831">The power of a philosophy stems from the belief that mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person believes in isn’t strong enough to bestow magical power on that person.</p>

</figure>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f61b8924-31ff-4728-b9d0-4f013d5456fe">When it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider range of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In many D&amp;D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves, goblins, and other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected that an orc will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces a staggering variety of deities. Each human culture might have its own array of gods.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b007f268-11d9-4209-bd41-fd3e631ae889">In most D&amp;D settings, there is no single god that can claim to have created humanity. Thus, the human proclivity for building institutions extends to religion. A single charismatic prophet can convert an entire kingdom to the worship of a new god. With that prophet’s death, the religion might wax or wane, or the prophet’s followers might turn against one another and found several competing religions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cb7505e0-a83c-47b1-a836-120e9c248513">In comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in stone. The dwarves of the Forgotten Realms identify Moradin as their creator. While individual dwarves might follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are pledged to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His teachings and magic are so thoroughly ingrained in dwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic shift to replace him.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a5fb0c6b-fe0d-4348-b0d1-b5062ce4a970">With that in mind, consider the role of the gods in your world and their ties to different humanoid races. Does each race have a creator god? How does that god shape that race’s culture? Are other folk free of such divine ties and free to worship as they wish? Has a race turned against the god that created it? Has a new race appeared, created by a god within the past few years?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4c09f533-6e18-4f07-b438-ec84a19b5134">A deity might also have ties to a kingdom, noble line, or other cultural institution. With the death of the emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine portents sent by the deity who protected the empire in its earliest days. In such a land, the worship of other gods might be outlawed or tightly controlled.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fab2ec56-c934-429e-9617-7bf0fcc67461">Finally, consider the difference between gods who are tied to specific humanoid races and gods with more diverse followers. Do the races with their own pantheons enjoy a place of privilege in your world, with their gods taking an active role in their affairs? Are the other races ignored by the gods, or are those races the deciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor of one god or another?</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d0af17a9-3f25-4d1a-8d45-dea4869a2b72">When creating the world where your campaign takes place, you’ll want a map. You can take one of two approaches with it: top-down or bottom-up. Some DMs like to start at the top, creating the big picture of the world at the start of the campaign by having a map that shows whole continents, and then zooming in on smaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the opposite direction, starting with a small campaign area that is mapped at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming out as adventures take the characters into new territory.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="42d4ba93-f46c-418f-a128-c1cba1904a2a">Whichever approach you take, hexes work well for mapping outdoor environments where travel can go in any direction and calculating distance might be important. A single sheet of hex paper with 5 hexes to the inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale for your map that’s best suited to the level of detail you want. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments" data-content-chunk-id="e6388325-5350-40e3-a832-c8df51215ae2">Chapter 5</a> offers more information about creating and mapping wilderness areas.</p>
<h3 id="ProvinceScale" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="86ab8315-d006-488f-a26e-d9b6f24fd566"><a href="#ProvinceScale" data-content-chunk-id="f55d92de-e93a-4a64-b9c6-cbece831d8d8"></a>Province Scale</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aed19397-825c-4a93-ab5e-d088d185a58a">For the most detailed areas of your world, use a province scale where each hex represents 1 mile. A full-page map at this scale represents an area that can be covered in one day’s travel in any direction from the center of the map, assuming clear terrain. As such, province scale is a useful scale for mapping a campaign’s starting area (see “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/Creating-a-Campaign" data-content-chunk-id="59135217-bdbf-49f6-babf-5afff998346a">Creating a Campaign</a>,” later in this chapter) or any location where you expect to track the adventurers’ movement in hours rather than days.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="95c3b279-06da-46ae-8808-254578f1a4e6">The ground cover of an area this size will include broad stretches of one predominant terrain type, broken up by other isolated terrain types.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="20ed3c2f-a803-4d1b-afa0-db4e6cc7d41d">A settled region mapped at this scale might have one town and eight to twelve villages or farming hamlets. A wilder region might have only a single keep, or no settlements at all. You can also indicate the extent of the cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town. On a province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few hexes wide surrounding each town or village. Even small villages farm most of the arable land within a mile or two.</p>
<h3 id="KingdomScale" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="1bbb4317-ec05-4bc2-a07f-07c777ae26aa"><a href="#KingdomScale" data-content-chunk-id="d23cb18a-3adf-4500-bb87-defb9fcd36d5"></a>Kingdom Scale</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0de6bf53-b654-44f1-8e9b-c34d49249e92">On a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles. A map at this scale covers a large region, about the size of Great Britain or half the size of the state of California. That’s plenty of room for adventuring.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7402875a-2788-4cce-8b6a-b52c41c12174">The first step of mapping a region at this scale is to sketch out the coastlines and any major bodies of water in the area. Is the region landlocked or on a coast? A coastal region might include islands offshore, and a landlocked area might include an inland sea or major lakes. Alternatively, the region could consist of a single large island, or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple coastlines.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c9a2c81-4d53-45f5-825f-8f0edebdd748">Next, sketch in any major mountain ranges. Foothills form a transition between the mountains and lowlands, and broad patches of gentle hills might dot the region.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="51b7e0f2-7804-40e5-aeb0-df6c72eaf91b">That leaves the rest of your map for relatively flat terrain: grasslands, forests, swamps, and the like. Place these elements as you see fit.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="73ee7746-c09f-4d2a-9414-c686465a31bb">Map out the courses of any rivers that flow through the area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas that see a lot of rainfall, winding down to the nearest major body of water that doesn’t require the river to cross over higher elevation. Tributaries join rivers as they grow larger and move toward a lake or the sea.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d36a1fb-fac9-4fb2-baf8-1adc531c054f">Finally, place the major towns and cities of the region. At this scale, you don’t need to worry about small towns and villages, or about mapping every belt of farmland. Even so, a settled region this size might easily have eight to twelve cities or towns to put on the map.</p>
<h3 id="ContinentScale" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="3e3083d7-5315-445f-a171-3ef8b012dbc1"><a href="#ContinentScale" data-content-chunk-id="387eb205-cf13-4260-ad54-b3020ad889c1"></a>Continent Scale</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08092d96-61f4-4aa5-a691-5bde8d6ec358">For mapping a whole continent, use a scale where 1 hex represents 60 miles. At this scale, you can’t see more than the shape of coastlines, the biggest mountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political boundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how multiple kingdom-scale maps fit together, rather than tracking the movement of adventurers day by day.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d4c78fdf-314e-4602-8046-6bb51ee857c6">The same process you use for mapping a region at kingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent. A continent might have eight to twelve large cities that deserve a place on the map, most likely major trade centers and the capitals of kingdoms.</p>
<h3 id="CombiningScales" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="274b895b-f244-4584-9b68-ee43a3c0d6c0"><a href="#CombiningScales" data-content-chunk-id="b11cecdc-3308-45f7-8a28-4cdbb1466c55"></a>Combining Scales</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ab4202f-8b70-44a2-a49d-1b6a5ddc6561">Whichever scale you start with, it’s easy to zoom in or out on your maps. At continent scale, 1 hex represents the same area as 10 kingdom-scale hexes. Two cities that are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent map would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map, and might define the opposite ends of the region you’re detailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex equals 6 province-scale hexes, so it’s easy to put the region covered by your province-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale map and create interesting areas around it.</p>
<h2 id="Settlements" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="19ff386f-a886-41d8-a0fb-12543630d10c"><a href="#Settlements" data-content-chunk-id="d38e5e7d-eafc-4fd0-b84b-733b720d3729"></a>Settlements</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f43630b6-072d-41aa-990b-3264bb8828e7">The places where people live — bustling cities, prosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among miles of farmland — help define the nature of civilization in your world. A single settlement — a home base for your adventurers — is a great place to start a campaign and begin your world building. Consider the following questions as you create any settlement in your world:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="47194417-f569-490e-8524-56850d7e829a">
<li data-content-chunk-id="36247655-813d-4546-8170-5f27334961a8">What purpose does it serve in your game?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="8308fc16-e5bb-490a-ac79-e46cf275d961">How big is it? Who lives there?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="1779be1b-4dcc-47c0-a728-31ff56227674">What does it look, smell, and sound like?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="feb0c6d6-1797-4a23-a613-08c5e404904a">Who governs it? Who else holds power? Is it part of a larger state?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="e8064627-1b74-4dd7-911c-a5bfe01b6162">What are its defenses?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="f46cc210-1bb1-4867-9e32-b9b0f51f556d">Where do characters go to find the goods and services they need?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="1328410d-0d47-4a66-a520-8fe599feefb7">What temples and other organizations feature prominently?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="354199ea-9b82-4273-ac5b-2df371186244">What fantastic elements distinguish it from an ordinary town?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="b85dda71-0d47-47c6-b2b9-f31b1024fc55">Why should the characters care about the settlement?</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5246001a-a45b-4dab-a56a-24f7575c989c">The guidelines in this section are here to help you build the settlement you want for whatever purpose you have in mind. Disregard any advice here that runs counter to your vision for a settlement.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ffc424e3-fbac-47b7-8255-b4be88075112">A settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story and fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the settlement’s purpose determines the amount of detail you put into it. Create only the features of a settlement that you know you’ll need, along with notes on general features. Then allow the place to grow organically as the adventurers interact with more and more of it, keeping notes on new places you invent.</p>
<h4 id="LocalColor" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="3e25d48c-54cb-4288-a2ee-07bf6e9651da"><a href="#LocalColor" data-content-chunk-id="c2a57cc7-23d2-4e88-87f8-71b50f4aca06"></a>Local Color</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="82b08680-2eae-4d4d-84c4-2cf06b461fcf">A settlement might serve as a place where the characters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement of this sort needs no more than a brief description. Include the settlement’s name, decide how big it is, add a dash of flavor (“The smell of the local tanneries never lifts from this town”), and let the adventurers get on with their business. The history of the inn where the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the shopkeeper they buy supplies from — you can add this level of detail, but you don’t have to. If the characters return to the same settlement, start adding these local features so that it begins to feel a little more like a home base, albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop as the need arises.</p>
<h4 id="HomeBase" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="3c82c715-8c9e-412b-8702-fdc5c8918015"><a href="#HomeBase" data-content-chunk-id="bbe24b39-c1b7-47ff-ae18-7a35fd19c94e"></a>Home Base</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="21b1bc50-94d9-41ac-8697-7bedb8254955">A settlement gives the adventurers a place to live, train, and recuperate between adventures. An entire campaign can center on a particular town or city. Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the characters go out into the wider world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b1308b21-d669-4081-9461-2c469972f432">Designed well, a home base can hold a special place in the adventurers’ hearts, particularly if they care about one or more NPCs who live there.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="636e1eba-4b5c-4c01-b1e9-a44f2f785640">To make a home base come alive, you’ll need to invest some time fleshing out details, but the players can help you with that work. Ask them to tell you a bit about mentors, family members, and other important people in their characters’ lives. Feel free to add to and modify what they give you, but you’ll start with a solid foundation of the nonplayer characters (NPCs) who are important to the characters. Let the players describe where and how their characters spend their time — a favorite tavern, library, or temple, perhaps.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cdd43975-4567-4492-965a-9fffc7cdc31e">Using these NPCs and locations as a starting point, flesh out the settlement’s cast of characters. Detail its leadership, including law enforcement (discussed later in the chapter). Include characters who can provide information, such as sages, soothsayers, librarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can provide spellcasting as well as information. Make note of merchants who might regularly interact with the adventurers and perhaps compete with one another for the party’s business. Think about the people who run the adventurers’ favorite tavern. And then add a handful of wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired mercenary, a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a dash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign.</p>
<h4 id="AdventureSite" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="60eae466-cab3-4b79-8e13-799470871a65"><a href="#AdventureSite" data-content-chunk-id="0f77fb3c-c983-483a-94df-299bce2b2d2a"></a>Adventure Site</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c04fcbcc-78b1-47df-8d4a-2dcea2508cd6">A village harboring a secret cult of devil worshipers. A town controlled by a guild of wererats. A city conquered by a hobgoblin army. These settlements aren’t merely rest stops but locations where adventures unfold. In a settlement that doubles as an adventure location, detail the intended adventure areas, such as towers and warehouses. For an event-based adventure, note the NPCs who play a part in the adventure. This work is adventure preparation as much as it is world building, and the cast of characters you develop for your adventure — including allies, patrons, enemies, and extras — can become recurring figures in your campaign.</p>
<h3 id="Size" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="769bfaaa-3eaf-4483-a8c3-c881c3da4380"><a href="#Size" data-content-chunk-id="fa9b22d7-23b4-4f21-9dca-1c0e906903b6"></a>Size</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="32469c23-c316-4e3b-848b-0c4ea50d351f">Most settlements in a D&amp;D world are villages clustered around a larger town or city. Farming villages supply the town or city population with food in exchange for goods the farmers can’t produce themselves. Towns and cities are the seats of the nobles who govern the surrounding area, and who carry the responsibility for defending the villages from attack. Occasionally, a local lord or lady lives in a keep or fortress with no nearby town or city.</p>

<h4 id="Village" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="adfa0841-1dc8-4848-b0b2-451ae6322e91"><a href="#Village" data-content-chunk-id="8ebeed17-5d0f-4c61-a0c2-401e6eb3e30a"></a>Village</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9b30ba23-e45d-46b9-a048-51105eaa6ba1"><strong>Population:</strong> Up to about 1,000</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fb1db8f3-2413-4256-9ad9-4229ae93417d"><strong>Government:</strong> A noble (usually not a resident) rules the village, with an appointed agent (a reeve) in residence to adjudicate disputes and collect taxes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="43024f08-ed0e-4963-a402-5ffc1e7f489d"><strong>Defense:</strong> The reeve might have a small force of soldiers. Otherwise, the village relies on a citizen militia.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fea3ac47-5c0a-4258-8220-858d374b29a8"><strong>Commerce:</strong> Basic supplies are readily available, possibly from an inn or a trading post. Other goods are available from traveling merchants.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b4a3316d-2f31-4811-8d0b-1d50624b195b"><strong>Organizations:</strong> A village might contain one or two temples or shrines, but few or no other organizations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b8b3213e-446a-4803-b8a6-1de0cead3e76">Most settlements are agricultural villages, supporting themselves and nearby towns or cities with crops and meat. Villagers produce food in one way or another — if not by tending the crops, then supporting those who do by shoeing horses, weaving clothes, milling grain, and the like. The goods they produce feed their families and supply trade with nearby settlements.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d35469cf-0a95-4818-af77-ed9b7e87731d">A village’s population is dispersed around a large area of land. Farmers live on their land, which spreads them widely around the village center. At the heart of the village, a handful of structures cluster together: a well, a marketplace, a small temple or two, a gathering place, and perhaps an inn for travelers.</p>
<h4 id="Town" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="7bfa4172-d888-4f1d-aff0-ad82ff118d5e"><a href="#Town" data-content-chunk-id="fc1a6eee-03d4-45c2-be02-f8effcff784a"></a>Town</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="14a5a168-dea1-4d42-bb03-321acc94a050"><strong>Population:</strong> Up to about 6,000</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="76862427-92c1-4b2f-b2fd-afe8dd9ffcf3"><strong>Government:</strong> A resident noble rules and appoints a lord mayor to oversee administration. An elected town council represents the interests of the middle class.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="445e97fb-5d99-4ab7-8347-4f6e7a6f1dc4"><strong>Defense:</strong> The noble commands a sizable army of professional soldiers, as well as personal bodyguards.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="31b4529f-9002-4288-ad6d-dff7e1d5ce52"><strong>Commerce:</strong> Basic supplies are readily available, though exotic goods and services are harder to find. Inns and taverns support travelers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5e1d4e77-6135-43eb-80e2-1212e96202fc"><strong>Organizations:</strong> The town contains several temples, as well as various merchant guilds and other organizations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="389327fb-68a6-4a58-835c-674573151e4f">Towns are major trade centers, situated where important industries and reliable trade routes enabled the population to grow. These settlements rely on commerce: the import of raw materials and food from surrounding villages, and the export of crafted items to those villages, as well as to other towns and cities. A town’s population is more diverse than that of most villages.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="11a42cbd-0dc8-418b-9f41-87ad70bc1a5d">Towns arise where roads intersect waterways, at the meeting of major land trade routes, around strategic defensive locations, or near significant mines or similar natural resources.</p>
<h4 id="City" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="90f46835-ff86-406c-9111-beb9c529f151"><a href="#City" data-content-chunk-id="eee681df-d7e2-4b86-9c82-3ac88836b59b"></a>City</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="523c350e-e12e-4880-ae76-1e6f64e13492"><strong>Population:</strong> Up to about 25,000</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c63fb983-0375-4817-ba0a-79a590478b17"><strong>Government:</strong> A resident noble presides, with several other nobles sharing responsibility for surrounding areas and government functions. One such noble is the lord mayor, who oversees the city administration. An elected city council represents the middle class and might hold more actual power than the lord mayor. Other groups serve as important power centers as well.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="67397433-bb33-4d8e-b207-426f7197ddc2"><strong>Defense:</strong> The city supports an army of professional soldiers, guards, and town watch. Each noble in residence maintains a small force of personal bodyguards.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="713e1553-71db-42e4-b506-0f8a7620cf13"><strong>Commerce:</strong> Almost any goods or services are readily available. Many inns and taverns support travelers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="406b4caf-038a-49ea-a7b0-ad0842a20119"><strong>Organizations:</strong> A multitude of temples, guilds, and other organizations, some of which hold significant power in city affairs, can be found within the city’s walls.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d63d6871-6680-4331-b469-42dcd1e37537">Cities are cradles of civilization. Their larger populations require considerable support from both surrounding villages and trade routes, so they’re rare. Cities typically thrive in areas where large expanses of fertile, arable land surround a location accessible to trade, almost always on a navigable waterway.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ae542542-085f-45a4-8b69-2ac7ae009538">Cities almost always have walls, and the stages of a city’s growth are easily identified by the expansion of the walls beyond the central core. These internal walls naturally divide the city into wards (neighborhoods defined by specific features), which have their own representatives on the city council and their own noble administrators.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="110a3ebf-1f38-4ac1-9ef9-3288f139d564">Cities that hold more than twenty-five thousand people are extremely rare. Metropolises such as Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms, Sharn in Eberron, and the Free City of Greyhawk stand as vital beacons of civilization in the D&amp;D worlds.</p>
<h3 id="Atmosphere" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="125ca9bb-ce62-4cb4-bbe5-5a3bea529929"><a href="#Atmosphere" data-content-chunk-id="481be6af-faa5-4f80-b272-9182b8f8d088"></a>Atmosphere</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3d67150c-afbc-4ee5-8429-2b1f229f1478">What do the adventurers first notice as they approach or enter a settlement? The towering wall bristling with soldiers? The beggars with hands outstretched, pleading for aid outside the gate? The noisy hubbub of merchants and buyers thronging the market square? The overpowering stench of manure?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3eaaa4f9-133f-4ae2-9a45-08ceeabcb077">Sensory details help bring a settlement to life and vividly communicate its personality to your players. Settle on a single defining factor that sums up a settlement’s personality and extrapolate from there. Maybe a city is built around canals, like real-world Venice. That key element suggests a wealth of sensory details: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy waters, the sound of lapping waves and perhaps singing gondoliers, the smells of fish and waste polluting the water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is shrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the tendrils of cold mist reaching through every crack and cranny, the muffled sounds of hooves on cobblestones, the cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense of mystery and lurking danger.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="44515fe4-afc3-4c23-9c9f-6dfad9a33dbf">The climate and terrain of a settlement’s environment, its origin and inhabitants, its government and political position, and its commercial importance all have a bearing on its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against the edge of a jungle has a very different feel than one on the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf cities present a distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to human-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell any hint of dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city fostering an early system of democracy might boast an open-air market where philosophical ideas are traded as freely as produce. All the possible combinations of these factors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of your campaign world.</p>
<h3 id="Government" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="21977ebb-8bf4-4446-9d88-fc4d4fc132d1"><a href="#Government" data-content-chunk-id="de1963e1-118f-45d9-a3f0-85b33a7756e0"></a>Government</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fb882761-f349-4842-9f26-727659f8921b">In the feudal society common in most D&amp;D worlds, power and authority are concentrated in towns and cities. Nobles hold authority over the settlements where they live and the surrounding lands. They collect taxes from the populace, which they use for public building projects, to pay the soldiery, and to support a comfortable lifestyle for themselves (although nobles often have considerable hereditary wealth). In exchange, they promise to protect their citizens from threats such as orc marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving human bandits.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d50cc235-afff-4b68-88b5-53abaf2feedc">Nobles appoint officers as their agents in villages, to supervise the collection of taxes and serve as judges in disputes and criminal trials. These reeves, sheriffs, or bailiffs are commoners native to the villages they govern, chosen for their positions because they already hold the respect of their fellow citizens.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d85ee19e-a49c-456e-b1a0-87cc127d0ec4">Within towns and cities, lords share authority and administrative responsibility with lesser nobles (usually their own relatives), and also with representatives of the middle class, such as traders and artisans. A lord mayor of noble birth is appointed to head the town or city council and to perform the same administrative functions that reeves carry out in villages. The council consists of representatives elected by the middle class. Only foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their councils, since the economic power of the middle class is often more important to the prosperity of a town or city than the hereditary authority of the nobility.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d21bfe3-193a-4ba2-bd6d-3b305784bdb8">The larger a settlement, the more likely that other individuals or organizations hold significant power there as well. Even in a village, a popular individual — a wise elder or a well-liked farmer — can wield more influence than the appointed reeve, and a wise reeve avoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns and cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a prominent temple, a guild independent of the council, or an individual with magical power.</p>
<h4 id="FormsofGovernment" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="af40d7df-e277-4499-8f16-e31f4f10ea30"><a href="#FormsofGovernment" data-content-chunk-id="86abf4c1-c167-4fe1-9722-939918968b93"></a>Forms of Government</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d4fe1ab-503f-49eb-87c6-89a1b4fec72d">A settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city might be a theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city governed by a merchant council. More likely, it’s part of a feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic empire, or a remote realm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how your settlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or region — who rules its ruler, and what other settlements might also lie under its control.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f7a3afa9-cab6-4453-8d04-1959e518b134">Typical and fantastical forms of government are described below. Choose one or randomly determine a form of government for a nation or city from the Forms of Government table.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08fb1d77-d78a-45f6-bb3f-886394487cdc"><strong><em>Autocracy.</em></strong> One hereditary ruler wields absolute power. The autocrat either is supported by a well-developed bureaucracy or military or stands as the only authority in an otherwise anarchic society. The dynastic ruler could be immortal or undead. Aundair and Karrnath, two kingdoms in the Eberron campaign setting, have autocrats with royal blood in their veins. Whereas Queen Aurala of Aundair relies on wizards and spies to enforce her will, Kaius, the vampire king of Karrnath, has a formidable army of living and undead soldiers under his command.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="51793c3a-df74-44b1-bed2-4ce53544c0d6"><strong><em>Bureaucracy.</em></strong> Various departments compose the government, each responsible for an aspect of rule. The department heads, ministers, or secretaries answer to a figurehead autocrat or council.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c9c151f1-b211-4084-80a9-efabb9f87d89"><strong><em>Confederacy.</em></strong> Each individual city or town within the confederacy governs itself, but all contribute to a league or federation that promotes (at least in theory) the common good of all member states. Conditions and attitudes toward the central government vary from place to place within the confederacy. The Lords’ Alliance in the Forgotten Realms setting is a loose confederacy of cities, while the Mror Holds in the Eberron campaign setting is a confederacy of allied dwarf clans.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="96a04804-f092-4097-b715-e521680230cc"><strong><em>Democracy.</em></strong> Citizens or their elected representatives determine the laws in a democracy. A bureaucracy or military carries out the day-to-day work of government, with positions filled through open elections.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6253be46-d02c-41ed-9eea-e6fcd4583037"><strong><em>Dictatorship.</em></strong> One supreme ruler holds absolute authority, but his or her rule isn’t necessarily dynastic. In other respects this resembles an autocracy. In the Greyhawk campaign setting, a half-demon named Iuz is the dictator of a conquered land that bears his name.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="49a9d4db-caaa-40a3-a2ac-d757bc840a23"><strong><em>Feudalism.</em></strong> The typical government of Europe in the Middle Ages, a feudalistic society consists of layers of lords and vassals. The vassals provide soldiers or scutage (payment in lieu of military service) to the lords, who in turn promise protection to their vassals.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53150fd5-7cf8-40c1-bc1e-fbaf94536e89"><strong><em>Gerontocracy.</em></strong> Elders preside over this society. In some cases, long-lived races such as elves or dragons are entrusted with the leadership of the land.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3969398e-3709-48ad-913b-dc9c74f40494"><strong><em>Hierarchy.</em></strong> A feudal or bureaucratic government where every member, except one, is subordinate to another member. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, the dragonarmies of Krynn form a military hierarchy, with the Dragon Highlords as leaders under the dragon queen Takhisis.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="733efa78-50a6-4a0a-9d45-b7d3a2f71e35"><strong><em>Kleptocracy.</em></strong> This government is composed of groups or individuals primarily seeking wealth for themselves, often at the expense of their subjects. The grasping Bandit Kingdoms in the Greyhawk campaign setting are prime examples. A kingdom run by thieves’ guilds would also fall into this category.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f4db1b29-d247-464f-b3d9-b569580ac598"><strong><em>Magocracy.</em></strong> The governing body is composed of spellcasters who rule directly as oligarchs or feudal lords, or participate in a democracy or bureaucracy. Examples include the Red Wizards of Thay in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting and the sorcerer-kings of Athas in the Dark Sun campaign setting.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6f0fea1e-5232-4662-88ca-99fdbb2baff1"><strong><em>Matriarchy or Patriarchy.</em></strong> This society is governed by the eldest or most important members of one gender. Drow cities are examples of theocratic matriarchies, for each is ruled by a council of drow high priestesses who answer to Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cc583b43-ca85-4861-8605-e0eaabdb95ab"><strong><em>Meritocracy.</em></strong> The most intelligent and educated people oversee the society, often with a bureaucracy to handle the day-to-day work of government. In the Forgotten Realms, scholarly monks preside over the fortress-library of Candlekeep, overseen by a master of lore called the Keeper.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d4c032ac-fb0f-488f-9562-775c2d154934"><strong><em>Militocracy.</em></strong> Military leaders run the nation under martial law, using the army and other armed forces. A militocracy might be based on an elite group of soldiers, an order of dragon riders, or a league of sea princes. Solamnia, a nation ruled by knights in the Dragonlance campaign setting, falls into this category.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="55482867-4ce5-4ae1-a71e-b61a502b041a"><strong><em>Monarchy.</em></strong> A single hereditary sovereign wears the crown. Unlike the autocrat, the monarch’s powers are limited by law, and the ruler serves as the head of a democracy, feudal state, or militocracy. The kingdom of Breland, in the Eberron campaign setting, has both a parliament that makes laws and a monarch who enforces them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="000e6752-537b-4c3a-a72b-cd1de4440600"><strong><em>Oligarchy.</em></strong> A small number of absolute rulers share power, possibly dividing the land into districts or provinces under their control, or jointly ruling together. A group of adventurers who take control of a nation together might form an oligarchy. The Free City of Greyhawk is an oligarchy composed of various faction leaders, with a Lord Mayor as its figurehead.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d83351b4-070e-4d0f-abe8-99bcc2f915e2"><strong><em>Plutocracy.</em></strong> Society is governed by the wealthy. The elite form a ruling council, purchase representation at the court of a figurehead monarch, or rule by default because money is the true power in the realm. Many cities in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, including Waterdeep and Baldur’s Gate, are plutocracies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9ffedc87-cb28-4646-903d-b2630f1219e5"><strong><em>Republic.</em></strong> Government is entrusted to representatives of an established electorate who rule on behalf of the electors. Any democracy in which only landowners or certain classes can vote could be considered a republic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4a73eccf-c44c-4364-8920-ca0439e654c5"><strong><em>Satrapy.</em></strong> Conquerors and representatives of another government wield power, ruling the settlement or region as part of a larger empire. The satraps are bureaucrats and military officers, or unusual characters or monsters. The cities of Highport and Suderham in the Greyhawk campaign setting are satrapies controlled by agents of a vicious gang of marauders.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fd409180-8497-4774-a29e-7717198140b4"><strong><em>Theocracy.</em></strong> Rulership falls to a direct representative or a collection of agents of a deity. The centers of power in a theocracy are usually located on sacred sites. In the Eberron campaign setting, the nation of Thrane is a theocracy devoted to the Silver Flame, a divine spirit that resides in Thrane’s capital of Flamekeep.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="72ee41a3-f1ce-4558-a02d-169225876614">Even small villages can provide characters access to the gear they need to pursue their adventures. Provisions, tents, backpacks, and simple weapons are commonly available. Traveling merchants carry armor, martial weapons, and more specialized gear. Most villages have inns that cater to travelers, where adventurers can find a hot meal and a bed, even if the quality leaves much to be desired.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9510b29d-ae05-4c1d-94f2-a0fb62b8ace2">Villages rely heavily on trade with other settlements, including larger towns and cities. Merchants pass through regularly, selling necessities and luxuries to the villagers, and any successful merchant has far-reaching contacts across the region. Traveling merchants pass on gossip and adventure hooks to the characters as they conduct their business. Since merchants make their living traversing roads that might be menaced by bandits or wandering monsters, they hire guards to keep their goods safe. They also carry news from town to town, including reports of situations that cry out for the attention of adventurers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3096fb75-6e30-42dd-90bf-279038b3b681">These merchants can’t provide the services normally found in a city. For instance, when the characters are in need of a library or a dedicated sage, a trainer who can handle the griffon eggs they’ve found, or an architect to design their castle, they’re better off going to a large city than looking in a village.</p>
<h3 id="Currency" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="937edde7-8d29-40d0-8e65-bb1d24fca7c8"><a href="#Currency" data-content-chunk-id="4b5eafc1-c43f-431b-98cb-1655e583450e"></a>Currency</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="54268f3f-2cb8-4b1d-ab87-6451c97aa66d">The straightforward terms “gold piece” (gp), “silver piece” (sp), “copper piece” (cp), “electrum piece” (ep), and “platinum piece” (pp) are used throughout the game rules for clarity. You can imbue these denominations with more interesting descriptions in your game world. People give coins specific names, whether as plain as “dime” or lively as “gold double-eagle.” A country typically mints its own currency, which might correspond to the basic rules terms. In most worlds, few currencies achieve widespread distribution, but nearly all coins are accepted worldwide — except by those looking to pick a fight with a foreigner.</p>
<h4 id="ExampleTheForgottenRealms" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="609d3349-3ce4-4fa8-b93a-d3b988221bcc"><a href="#ExampleTheForgottenRealms" data-content-chunk-id="bd626161-55dd-4881-b01a-2742e325f941"></a>Example: The Forgotten Realms</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="318e2dcd-68e1-485c-b5f4-683c7bf109b4">The world of the Forgotten Realms provides an extensive example of currencies. Although barter, blood notes, and similar letters of trade are common enough in Faerûn, metal coins and trade bars are the everyday currency.</p>
<figure class="compendium-image compendium-image-right" id="Figure5">
<a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-center" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/721/c51.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title=""><img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/721/300/261/c51.png" alt="" class="ddb-lightbox-inner"></a>
</figure>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b12bd9a7-a5ae-4983-89cd-035b4cca87e4"><strong><em>Common Coinage.</em></strong> Coins appear in a bewildering variety of shapes, sizes, names, and materials. Thanks to the ambitious traders of Sembia, that nation’s oddly shaped coins can be found throughout Faerûn. In Sembia, square iron steelpence replace copper coins. Triangular silver pieces are ravens, diamond-shaped electrum pieces are harmarks (commonly called “blue eyes”), and five-sided gold pieces are nobles. Sembia doesn’t mint platinum coins. All coinage is accepted in Sembia, including copper and platinum pieces from abroad.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="06538cbf-652c-4998-9a5d-019c31d834a6">In Waterdeep, the bustling cosmopolitan center of trade, coppers are called nibs, silvers are shards, electrum pieces are moons, gold pieces are dragons, and platinum coins are suns. The city’s two local coins are the toal and the harbor moon. The toal is a square brass trading-coin pierced with a central hole to permit it to be easily strung on a ring or string, worth 2 gp in the city and nothing outside Waterdeep. The harbor moon is a flat crescent of platinum with a central hole and an electrum inlay, named for its traditional use in the docks for buying large amounts of cargo at once. The coin is worth 50 gp in Waterdeep and 30 gp elsewhere.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e8987523-4496-4dc9-b007-04f92559177c">The northern city of Silverymoon mints a crescent-shaped, shining blue coin called an electrum moon, worth 1 gp in that city and 1 ep elsewhere. The city also issues a larger coin called an eclipsed moon, which looks like an electrum moon combined a darker silver wedge to form a round coin worth 5 ep within the city and 2 ep outside it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fe5d2577-ff78-427d-baff-0cab069e6837">The favored form of currency in the kingdom of Cormyr is the royal coinage of the court, stamped with a dragon on one side and a treasury date mark on the other. There, coppers are called thumbs, silvers are silver falcons, electrum pieces are blue eyes, gold pieces are golden lions, and platinum coins are tricrowns.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a39c118-7663-4821-8ce6-231382190d00">Even city-states mint their own copper, silver, and gold pieces. Electrum and platinum pieces are rarer in these lands. Smaller states use coinage borrowed from other nations and looted from ancient sources. Travelers from certain lands (notably the wizard-dominated realms of Thay and Halruaa) use the currencies of other realms when trading abroad because their own coins and tokens are feared to be magically cursed, and so are shunned by others.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3acc9af6-e254-47ce-995d-94065010533d">Conversely, the coins of long-lost, legendary lands and centers of great magic are honored, though those who find them are wise to sell them to collectors rather than merely spending them in markets. The coins of the old elven court of Cormanthyr are particularly famous: thalvers (coppers), bedoars (silvers), thammarchs (electrum), shilmaers (golds), and ruendils (platinum). These coins are fine, numerous, and sometimes still used in trade among elves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="449c6a18-1cb4-43fc-8b17-766cf890da7d"><strong><em>Trade Bars.</em></strong> Large numbers of coins can be difficult to transport and account for. Many merchants prefer to use trade bars — ingots of precious metals and alloys (usually silver) likely to be accepted by virtually anyone. Trade bars are stamped or graven with the symbol of the trading company or government that originally crafted them. These bars are valued by weight, as follows:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="29e4cc83-bda8-472f-8f82-4f65aa050dc7">
<li data-content-chunk-id="557a3a12-ef7c-44d6-83bb-2975e6c83336">A 2-pound silver bar is worth 10 gp and is about 5 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1/2 inch thick.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="25e17812-186f-41e8-a4f4-7474a8842d1d">A 5-pound silver bar is worth 25 gp and is about 6 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="1731f17d-08e3-40e2-8e64-b279597e71f2">A 5-pound gold bar is worth 250 gp and is about the size of a 2-pound silver bar.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="852fba3b-eec5-48c0-a918-774be6034e82">The city of Baldur’s Gate mints large numbers of silver trade bars and sets the standard for this form of currency. The city of Mirabar issues black iron spindle-shaped trade bars with squared ends weighing about 2 pounds each, worth 10 gp in that city, markedly less in nearby trade centers, and as iron is normally valued elsewhere (1 sp per pound).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d54765fa-9876-4ebe-9065-bdee774ff9fa"><strong><em>Odd Currency.</em></strong> Coins and bars aren’t the only forms of hard currency. Gond bells are small brass bells worth 10 gp in trade, or 20 gp to a temple of Gond. Shaar rings, pierced and polished slices of ivory threaded onto strings by the nomads of the Shaar, are worth 3 gp per slice.</p>
<h4 id="CreatingYourOwn" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="e908354b-3762-4eb3-bb7f-4c4a1e76b1a9"><a href="#CreatingYourOwn" data-content-chunk-id="dd25fbeb-ec02-4617-ac1c-46d1f3329398"></a>Creating Your Own</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4c32c152-101c-430e-97cc-4bbcd298292a">As shown in the previous examples, currency doesn’t need to obey a universal standard in your world. Each country and era can have its own coins with its own values. Your adventurers might travel through many different lands and find long-lost treasures. Finding six hundred ancient bedoars from the rule of Coronal Eltargrim twelve centuries before offers a deeper sense of immersion in your world than finding 60 sp.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6eeefc20-94a1-450e-8174-fcf5020753f7">Varying names and descriptions of coins for the major contemporary and historical realms of your world adds an additional layer of texture. The golden lions of Cormyr convey the noble nature of that kingdom. If a nation mints gold coins stamped with leering demonic faces and called torments, that currency expresses a distinct flavor.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9630a498-8914-4dcf-a9ad-79157005c60e">Creating new coins connected to specific locations, like the toals of Waterdeep or the eclipsed moons of Silverymoon, provides another level of detail. As long as you keep the value of these new coins simple (in other words, don’t invent a coin worth 1.62 gp), you add local flavor to key locations in your world without adding undue complexity.</p>
<h2 id="LanguagesandDialects" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="a5c5cd75-598b-4840-b74f-77d76923d278"><a href="#LanguagesandDialects" data-content-chunk-id="afb80910-06c5-41b4-9979-afccf2437da2"></a>Languages and Dialects</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8e5d2eb9-74d7-4bf5-9e24-48a0fec89187">When fleshing out your world, you can create new languages and dialects to reflect its unique geography and history. You can replace the default languages presented in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="59fb081a-5404-4bcf-84ff-fc56c27a7615">Player’s Handbook</a> with new ones, or split languages up into several different dialects.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0d8ac241-0364-4613-bc4a-d44a0d4e1890">In some worlds, regional differences might be much more important than racial ones. Perhaps all the dwarves, elves, and humans who live in one kingdom speak a common language, which is completely different from that spoken in the neighboring kingdom. This might make communication (and diplomacy) between two kingdoms significantly more difficult.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b8cd916e-c19c-4a80-bad6-7f985bfffdea">Widely used languages might have ancient versions, or there might be completely different ancient tongues that adventurers find written in tombs and ruins. Such languages can add an element of mystery to inscriptions and tomes that characters encounter.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aa962f5a-db65-4fdb-be2d-de93a4ee0ff4">You might invent additional secret languages, besides Druidic and thieves’ cant, that allow members of certain organizations or political affiliations to communicate. You could even decide that each alignment has its own language, which might be more of an argot used primarily to discuss philosophical concepts.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="72e43f97-5174-447a-8e7a-71934323f531">In a region where one race has subjugated another, the language of the conquerors can become a mark of social status. Similarly, reading and writing might be restricted by law to the upper classes of a society.</p>
<h2 id="FactionsandOrganizations" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="56881934-5dd2-402d-944f-f292b906462b"><a href="#FactionsandOrganizations" data-content-chunk-id="147bb660-c15d-44f1-9d37-f29b6e4319d7"></a>Factions and Organizations</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0a461c55-d74e-49c1-8ef5-83f16723b3e3">Temples, guilds, orders, secret societies, and colleges are important forces in the social order of any civilization. Their influence might stretch across multiple towns and cities, with or without a similarly wide-ranging political authority. Organizations can play an important part in the lives of player characters, becoming their patrons, allies, or enemies just like individual nonplayer characters. When characters join these organizations, they become part of something larger than themselves, which can give their adventures a context in the wider world.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b729356e-a3f0-4222-b3ed-e624dd61e297">At the start of a campaign, backgrounds are a great way to connect adventurers to your world. As the game progresses, though, background ties often become less important.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b801f5d8-ba78-4801-946c-a780d5abeb44">Factions and organizations aimed at player characters are a way to keep higher-level adventurers connected to your world, providing ties to key NPCs and a clear agenda beyond individual gain. In the same way, villainous organizations create an ongoing sense of menace above and beyond the threat of solitary foes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7ddabd47-ae47-4a42-821d-a64ef847bd55">Having different characters tied to different factions can create interesting situations at the gaming table, as long as those factions have similar goals and don’t work in opposition to one another all the time. Adventurers representing different factions might have competing interests or priorities while they pursue the same goals.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b5bfe06-df20-4316-bbeb-dc12dc0f2e1d">Adventurer organizations are also a great source of special rewards beyond experience points and treasure. Increased standing in an organization has value in and of itself, and might also come with concrete benefits such as access to an organization’s information, equipment, magic, and other resources.</p>
<h3 id="CreatingFactions" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="0035ba04-7c91-4569-840a-63761b04336f"><a href="#CreatingFactions" data-content-chunk-id="d27d0c31-b3d6-463d-bd08-8c45608b34b0"></a>Creating Factions</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6272f7c7-f283-4667-a261-80e61d3601d8">Factions and organizations that you create for your campaign should grow out of the stories that are important to the world. Create organizations that your players will want to interact with, whether as allies, members, or enemies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8f5008d7-f4f4-429b-a5e1-166638b84d49">As a starting point, decide what role you want an organization to play in the world. What is it all about? What are its goals? Who founded it and why? What do its members do? Answering these questions should give you a good sense of the organization’s personality. From there, think about typical members. How might people describe them? What are the typical members’ classes and alignments? What personality traits do they tend to share?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f5b2b3cb-eeda-48a6-8b74-97a721d362b3">Choosing a symbol and a motto for the organization is a way of summing up the work you’ve done so far. A faction that uses a stag as a symbol probably has a very different personality from one that uses a winged viper. For a motto, choose not just a message but also a tone and style of speech that fits the organization as you’ve defined it. Consider the motto of the Harpers: “Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all.” The Harpers have a straightforward message of freedom and prosperity. Contrast that with the motto of a group of politically allied cities in the North calling themselves the Lords’ Alliance: “Threats to home must be terminated without prejudice. Superiority is our security.” These are sophisticated people involved in a delicate political alliance, with more emphasis on stability than on fairness and equality.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd3a5a14-91d3-4cec-b6db-cf84ca609a71">Finally, think about the ways that player characters might come into contact with the organization. Who are the important members — not just the leaders, but the agents in the field that the adventurers might encounter? Where are they active, and where do they have headquarters or strongholds?

<p data-content-chunk-id="f396f4e8-4b2f-46e2-95d6-206891383d09">SAMPLE FACTION: THE HARPERS</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="096772cf-42ac-4327-a5a8-6dc70cc01196">The Harpers is a scattered network of spellcasters and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power, magical or otherwise.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="45712d3a-c80b-4d3c-8d74-c10aa851293f">The organization has risen, been shattered, and risen again several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the autonomy of its various members. The Harpers have small cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms, although they interact and share information with one another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers’ ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their ingenuity and incorruptibility. Harpers don’t seek power or glory, only fair and equal treatment for all.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7ce3aba3-6b07-4da9-9cc8-a7584b60a374"><strong><em>Motto.</em></strong> “Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cde5dc81-3a20-4d09-aea6-ca3249ab759d"><strong><em>Beliefs.</em></strong> The Harpers’ beliefs can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="4a3a58f2-db36-4b9f-a3e1-96a1d7a37056">
<li data-content-chunk-id="3a05a181-9945-4592-baa9-d14fe693ab07">One can never have too much information or arcane knowledge.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="49085469-fa01-42d5-9719-cf3e2116b06e">Too much power leads to corruption, and the abuse of magic in particular must be closely monitored.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="e2948b02-cdb9-4ece-a191-8c540a539013">No one should be powerless.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3f27832d-750b-41c1-80ea-8472020e09bf"><strong><em>Goals.</em></strong> Gather information throughout Faerûn, discern the political dynamics within each region, and promote fairness and equality by covert means. Act openly as a last resort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too powerful. Aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9ec370e0-8ebc-4902-8d3a-929ebdb84d37"><strong><em>Typical Quests.</em></strong> Typical Harper quests include securing an artifact that would upset the balance of power in a region, gathering information on a powerful individual or organization, and determining the true intentions of an ambitious political figure or evil spellcaster.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="03119d49-df51-406f-9c81-280a1ed02fef">Renown is an optional rule you can use to track an adventurer’s standing within a particular faction or organization. Renown is a numerical value that starts at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and reputation within a particular organization. You can tie benefits to a character’s renown, including ranks and titles within the organization and access to resources.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4a87580d-22b7-4f8e-9a01-8a46a5270600">A player tracks renown separately for each organization his or her character is a member of. For example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the character’s interaction with each organization over the course of the campaign.</p>
<h4 id="GainingRenown" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c0073804-4a80-416a-8de4-1491264ed2ab"><a href="#GainingRenown" data-content-chunk-id="c4a367f5-d2f7-4a57-baa5-1acd82180647"></a>Gaining Renown</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="931e7b30-c0d4-4ba8-bc5a-c6856245a2b4">A character earns renown by completing missions or quests that serve an organization’s interests or involve the organization directly. You award renown at your discretion as characters complete these missions or quests, typically at the same time you award experience points.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e767b371-bc57-424c-b250-cad3ed33fb18">Advancing an organization’s interests increases a character’s renown within that organization by 1. Completing a mission specifically assigned by that organization, or which directly benefits the organization, increases the character’s renown by 2 instead.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2283ccf5-2487-4026-b2f1-16dba23d0b14">For example, characters with connections to the noble Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might increase each character’s renown within the order by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission given to the adventurers by a senior member of the order, completing the task might instead increase each character’s renown by 2, showing the adventurers as effective allies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="32686a2b-a842-46a4-8f42-8ff4abda0a2f">Meanwhile, the party’s rogue might have looted a box of rare poisons from the dragon’s hoard and sold it to a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might increase the rogue’s renown within the Zhentarim by 2 since this action directly increased that group’s power and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an agent of the Zhentarim.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="81abbdfb-ed0f-403e-a0c1-6968de977393">The benefits of increasing renown within an organization can include rank and authority, friendly attitudes from members of the organization, and other perks.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="28aba088-83c2-4b88-860d-984024cf9882"><strong><em>Rank.</em></strong> Characters can earn promotions as their renown increases. You can establish certain thresholds of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table. For example, a character might join the Lords’ Alliance after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining the title of cloak. As the character’s renown within the organization increases, he or she might be eligible for further increases in rank.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c19e5745-7755-422c-a384-042513267ea4">You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a character affiliated with the Lords’ Alliance might have to be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at least 10th level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level to be a lioncrown.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0486fb82-0e5a-455e-ba36-296bbbc2241f">You can set these thresholds of renown to any numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate ranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="071c264d-a47a-4e9b-8df1-58827ccd2fe5"><strong><em>Attitudes of Organization Members.</em></strong> As a character’s renown within an organization grows, members of that organization are increasingly likely to have heard of the character. You can set thresholds at which the default attitude of an organization’s members toward the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For example, members of the Emerald Enclave — a faction dedicated to preserving the natural order — might be less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming friendly by default only when a character has gained 10 renown within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds apply only to the default attitude of most members of an organization, and such attitudes aren’t automatic. NPC faction members might dislike an adventurer despite that character’s renown — or perhaps because of it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c2b634b2-073f-4011-999a-8e78e84a52f1"><strong><em>Perks.</em></strong> Earning a rank within an organization comes with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked character might gain a follower (see chapter 4, “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters" data-content-chunk-id="05dd0f80-8f50-41a5-843a-9214281ce2ef">Creating Nonplayer Characters</a>”), access to potions and scrolls, the ability to call in a favor, or backup on dangerous missions. A high-ranking character might be able to call on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, gain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special missions to members of lower rank.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="57d6da6b-9bb6-453f-aa25-9ba265b68c4b"><strong><em>Downtime Activities.</em></strong> You might allow characters to spend downtime between adventures building relationships and gaining renown within an organization. For more information on downtime activities, see chapter 6, “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="349d2205-43d8-4209-a60e-4484f7344709">Between Adventures</a>”.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="48420572-c9ed-4372-9d75-a6d7720866e7">Disagreements with members of an organization aren’t enough to cause a loss of renown within that organization. However, serious offenses committed against the organization or its members can result in a loss of renown and rank within the organization. The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is left to your discretion. A character’s renown within an organization can never drop below 0.</p>
<h4 id="Piety" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="8b6ab65d-1381-4ae5-97d3-20707540b2f0"><a href="#Piety" data-content-chunk-id="25fc8074-0f08-4c45-99ba-c70a6cbb17e7"></a>Piety</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a9411245-0783-450e-ba3f-50ad415d8e7e">With a few alterations, the renown system can also serve as a measure of a character’s link to the gods. It’s a great option for campaigns where the gods take active roles in the world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53d4d5d0-8171-457c-ba92-6032e85217d0">Using this approach, you track renown based on specific divine figures in your campaign. Each character has the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any renown he or she earns is called piety. A character gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their commands, and respecting their taboos. A character loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring them, defiling their temples, and foiling their aims.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="625e0cc7-3afb-406f-b302-337e2fb088a6">The gods bestow favors on those who prove their devotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character can pray for divine favor once per day. This favor usually comes in the form of a cleric spell like <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2016-bless" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2016-tooltip">bless</a>. The favor often comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for example, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a spell accompanied by the boom of thunder.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ced8432-7d44-4634-b66f-9f76660cccbe">A high level of piety can also lead to a character gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a blessing or charm (see chapter 7, “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure" data-content-chunk-id="dffaa8d5-4ca3-4cdf-aeb8-ee53c93bb7cd">Treasure</a>” for such supernatural gifts).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1262a9c2-b87c-413a-83e7-5e55d5d81802">The Zhentarim (also known as the Black Network) is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence and power throughout the Forgotten Realms.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5bdd12ec-5abc-4610-97b0-b33cf6116192">The public face of the Black Network appears relatively benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, both legal and illicit, thus destroying its competitors and making everyone dependent on it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="07bc98a1-1acb-4926-a8b4-b8d9dbf6eb5e">A member of the Zhentarim thinks of himself or herself as a member of a very large family and relies on the Black Network for resources and security. However, members are granted the autonomy to pursue their own interests and gain some measure of personal wealth and influence. As a whole, the Zhentarim promises “the best of the best,” although in truth the organization is more interested in spreading its own propaganda and influence than investing in the improvement of its individual members.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="12d48dc1-5f62-4a3a-addb-3224eb9715a0"><strong><em>Motto.</em></strong> “Join us and prosper. Oppose us and suffer.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7ffba136-f01d-4d8f-9211-926f3773aac4"><strong><em>Beliefs.</em></strong> The Zhentarim’s beliefs can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="b7081168-5e38-4fe4-bb51-c69953431416">
<li data-content-chunk-id="77b79238-656a-4011-b1dc-081e8ac108f6">The Zhentarim is your family. You watch out for it, and it watches out for you.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="73547e1e-c50a-493e-bd65-c27a6cc42cc7">You are the master of your own destiny. Never be less than what you deserve to be.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="f3853bd6-0505-4501-bc9f-594950bb829e">Everything and everyone has a price.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="39d38036-6fae-4886-9939-51b93b0922a5"><strong><em>Goals.</em></strong> Amass wealth, power, and influence, and thereby dominate Faerûn.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d5254c91-67bd-4f60-add8-8c2a4f535532"><strong><em>Typical Quests.</em></strong> Typical Zhentarim quests include plundering or stealing a treasure hoard, powerful magic item, or artifact; securing a lucrative business contract or enforcing a preexisting one; and establishing a foothold in a place where the Zhentarim holds little sway.</p>

<h2 id="MagicinYourWorld" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="c52e5e13-f824-488e-af98-2d5163fd4c89"><a href="#MagicinYourWorld" data-content-chunk-id="ec35931f-12dc-4d2a-92b9-50c6ff3fb595"></a>Magic in Your World</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="baf555c4-9ee0-4c87-ac6e-fdae6008f212">In most D&amp;D worlds, magic is natural but still wondrous and sometimes frightening. People everywhere know about magic, and most people see evidence of it at some point in their lives. It permeates the cosmos and moves through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes, the mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched by the gods, creatures born with supernatural power, and individuals who study the secrets of the multiverse. Histories and fireside tales are filled with the exploits of those who wield it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="910e59b1-504f-4232-852e-9c57d2aa4cf6">What normal folk know of magic depends on where they live and whether they know characters who practice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not have seen true magic used for generations and speak in whispers of the strange powers of the old hermit living in the nearby woods. In the city of Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms setting, the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors is a guild of wizards. These arcanists wish to make wizardry more accessible so the order’s members can profit from selling their services.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="67277cb3-dedb-459a-a73e-95bd078eee44">Some D&amp;D settings have more magic in them than others. On Athas, the harsh world of the Dark Sun setting, arcane magic is a hated practice that can drain life from the world. Much of Athas’s magic lies in the hands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of Eberron, magic is as commonplace as any other commodity. Mercantile houses sell magic items and services to anyone who can afford them. People purchase tickets to ride airships and trains propelled by elemental magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c30be9ca-21d8-4d90-92fe-344835c5667b">Consider these questions when fitting magic into your world:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="8ee0615d-6e0c-43d3-acc7-8cf05e3636c2">
<li data-content-chunk-id="4cf75abb-2175-4ee5-8c87-3520f7254009">Is some magic common? Is some socially unacceptable? Which magic is rare?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="d4edc729-1a52-4261-aafd-b5174e4bed04">How unusual are members of each spellcasting class? How common are those who can cast high-level spells?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="0540a64e-c2a4-43d1-9e45-2ea646020bb1">How rare are magic items, magical locations, and creatures that have supernatural powers? At what power level do these things go from everyday to exotic?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="5f559961-e155-499c-8cc1-b9fb838fc3f3">How do authorities regulate and use magic? How do normal folks use magic and protect themselves from it?</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ea440966-cd25-42dc-9e16-8fa1910f74a8">The answers to some questions suggest the answers to others. For example, if spellcasters of low-level spells are common, as in Eberron, then authorities and common folk are more likely to have access to and use the results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic isn’t only possible, but also less expensive. People are more likely to keep well-known magic in mind, and to protect against it, especially in risky situations.</p>
<h3 id="RestrictionsonMagic" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="fb7ee832-b28c-48f1-baa5-2fd47b72c7eb"><a href="#RestrictionsonMagic" data-content-chunk-id="72d0e4aa-add1-44ca-9a91-b2c1ffa76295"></a>Restrictions on Magic</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d4c87755-29d9-4696-a1c0-17724fb47213">Some civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use of magic. Spellcasting might be forbidden without a license or official permission. In such a place, magic items and continual magical effects are rare, with protections against magic being the exception.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aaeecfda-86b5-4db6-9b33-3202090cf2ac">Some localities might prohibit specific spells. It could be a crime to cast any spells used to steal or swindle, such as those that bestow invisibility or produce illusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate others are readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of free will. Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for obvious reasons. A local ruler could have a phobia about a specific effect or spell (such as shapeshifting effects if he or she were afraid of being impersonated) and enact a law restricting that type of magic.</p>
<h3 id="SchoolsofMagic" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="84bb3558-88ae-4862-9a9a-a34e9a4e07e7"><a href="#SchoolsofMagic" data-content-chunk-id="615f4898-1661-45aa-962e-b3d936a67bb7"></a>Schools of Magic</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bbde01a6-1b60-45ae-967d-397c2a8b2d99">The rules of the game refer to the schools of magic (abjuration, illusion, necromancy, and so on), but it’s up to you to determine what those schools signify in your world. Similarly, a few class options suggest the existence of magic-using organizations in the world — bardic colleges and druid circles — which are up to you to flesh out.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f2295fa0-a93c-459b-8676-2db7a4ae2014">You could decide that no formal structures like these exist in your world. Wizards (and bards and druids) might be so rare that a player character learns from a single mentor and never meets another character of the same class, in which case wizards would learn their school specialization without any formal training.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d9b86f0d-d69a-495b-a435-2c53397e0fad">However, if magic is more common, academies can be the embodiments of the schools of magic. These institutions have their own hierarchies, traditions, regulations, and procedures. For example, Materros the necromancer could be a brother of the necromantic Cabal of Thar-Zad. As a sign of his high standing within its hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green robes of a master. Of course, when he wears these robes, his occupation is easily identified by those who know of the cabal. This recognition could be a boon or a nuisance, since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a fearsome reputation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="510739e0-845d-41f3-bb6d-af43a2932ed7">If you go this route, you can treat schools of magic, bardic colleges, and druid circles as organizations, using the guidelines for organizations presented earlier in this chapter. A player character necromancer might cultivate renown within the Cabal of Thar-Zad, while a bard seeks increasing renown within the College of Mac-Fuirmidh.</p>
<h3 id="TeleportationCircles" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="b6b1aaca-5896-4d6f-843e-ad011383e9c5"><a href="#TeleportationCircles" data-content-chunk-id="692edd1b-2cff-4615-acc0-8155b9c321be"></a>Teleportation Circles</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d7526481-8a57-4ddd-9008-e532873a31f0">The presence of permanent teleportation circles in major cities helps cement their important place in the economy of a fantasy world. Spells such as <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2206-plane-shift" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2206-tooltip">plane shift</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2275-teleport" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2275-tooltip">teleport</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2276-teleportation-circle" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2276-tooltip">teleportation circle</a> connect with these circles, which are found in temples, academies, the headquarters of arcane organizations, and prominent civic locations. However, since every teleportation circle is a possible means of entry into a city, they’re guarded by military and magical protection.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="030005a6-2f4b-4780-beeb-908ad7a3c840">As you design a fantasy city, think about the teleportation circles it might contain and which ones adventurers are likely to know about. If the adventurers commonly return to their home base by means of a teleportation circle, use that circle as a hook for plot developments in your campaign. What do the adventurers do if they arrive in a teleportation circle and find all the familiar wards disabled and guards lying in pools of blood? What if their arrival interrupts an argument between two feuding priests at the temple? Adventure ensues!</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="083209cf-bdc0-44a9-912a-20ad4cfbde2e">When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature’s deity resides. If the creature didn’t worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving the soul from that plane and returning it to its body.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9a4b744d-4302-40d0-915e-b94602245870">Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2224-raise-dead" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2224-tooltip">raise dead</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2232-resurrection" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2232-tooltip">resurrection</a> to restore the slain character to life.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e6c03410-32c4-489f-a067-79f2884d9f34">A soul can’t be returned to life if it doesn’t wish to be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and might refuse to return on that basis. For example, if the honorable knight Sturm Brightblade is slain and a high priestess of Takhisis (god of evil dragons) grabs his body, Sturm might not wish to be raised from the dead by her. Any attempts she makes to revive him automatically fail. If the evil cleric wants to revive Sturm to interrogate him, she needs to find some way to trick his soul, such as duping a good cleric into raising him and then capturing him once he is alive again.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fd9bf889-e906-4a21-8b0e-1b55ffaeef08">The world you create is the stage for the adventures you set in it. You don’t have to give more thought to it than that. You can run adventures in an episodic format, with the characters as the only common element, and also weave themes throughout those adventures to build a greater saga of the characters’ achievements in the world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="83450078-acc0-4fed-b8c7-1d50b12d8b17">Planning an entire campaign might seem like a daunting task, but you don’t have to plot out every detail right from the start. You can start with the basics, running a few adventures, and think about larger plotlines you want to explore as the campaign progresses. You’re free to add as much or as little detail as you wish.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cf900850-0156-4ff6-9b14-cd04ee77da30">The start of a campaign resembles the start of an adventure. You want to jump quickly into the action, show the players that adventure awaits, and grab their attention right away. Give the players enough information to make them want to come back week after week to see how the story plays out.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e363380a-8471-409d-bb3f-9d867ee1186e">When you first start building your campaign, start small. The characters need to know only about the city, town, or village where they start the game, and perhaps the nearby dungeon. You might decide that the barony is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a distant forest is crawling with <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16859-ettercap" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16859-tooltip">ettercaps</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16895-giant-spider" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16895-tooltip">giant spiders</a>, and you should note these things. But at the start of the game, the local area is enough to get the campaign off the ground. Follow these steps to create that local area:</p>

A small town or village at the edge of the wilderness serves as a fine home base in most D&amp;D campaigns. Use a larger town or city if you want a campaign with urban adventuring.</p>

Draw a map at province scale (1 hex = 1 mile) with the home base near the center. Fill in the area within a day’s travel — about 25 to 30 miles — of the home base. Pepper it with two to four dungeons or similar adventure locales. An area that size is likely to have one to three additional settlements as well as the home base, so give thought to them as well.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2deddb09-c3d6-4d08-9bea-dbcb2736f894">A single dungeon makes a good first adventure for most campaigns. See chapter 3, “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="6d8c372c-0cd1-43e6-8af9-30d32dfe13dc">Creating Adventures</a>” for guidance.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f208e11d-c4bf-4217-a0e9-166aaa884f16">A home base provides a common starting location for the characters. This starting point might be the village where they grew up or a city that attracted them from points beyond. Or perhaps they begin the campaign in the dungeons of an evil baron’s castle where they’ve been locked up for various reasons (legitimate or otherwise), throwing them into the midst of the adventure.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6d2f1214-94bb-4b88-9f4a-0e8c7c1c8da3">For each of these steps, give the locations only as much detail as they need. You don’t need to identify every building in a village or label every street in a large city. If the characters start in the baron’s dungeon, you’ll need the details of this first adventure site, but you don’t have to name all the baron’s knights. Sketch out a simple map, think about the surrounding area, and consider whom the characters are most likely to interact with early in the campaign. Most important, visualize how this area fits into the theme and story you have in mind for your campaign. Then start working on your first adventure!</p>
<h3 id="SettheStage" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="673d993c-1e15-4f36-b65a-33ab9b192230"><a href="#SettheStage" data-content-chunk-id="4dd87969-18a3-46e6-afc1-4fbf20a86b5a"></a>Set the Stage</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e84218f-2b5e-47ce-a341-84563415aa2b">As you start to develop your campaign, you’ll need to fill in the players on the basics. For easy distribution, compile essential information into a campaign handout. Such a handout typically includes the following material:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="27a0e747-4f6e-4145-a1b6-fa09b237f128">
<li data-content-chunk-id="475d0016-0fe1-4d4e-b87e-cf4fb4dcfb03">Any restrictions or new options for character creation, such as new or prohibited races.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="0cee35c0-893f-4931-9a32-21bf436c20c9">Any information in the backstory of your campaign that the characters would know about. If you have a theme or direction in mind for the campaign, this information could include seeds hinting at that focus.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="9db8a15b-7fc8-4830-a4c0-ac7f3e77a593">Basic information about the area where the characters are starting, such as the name of the town, important locations in and around it, prominent NPCs they’d know about, and perhaps rumors that point to trouble that’s brewing.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="69ee7955-7b68-4676-87ca-320d08fa9bef">Keep this handout short and to the point. Two pages is a reasonable maximum. Even if you have a burst of creative energy that produces twenty pages of great background material, save it for your adventures. Let the players uncover the details gradually in play.</p>
<h3 id="InvolvingtheCharacters" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="55d49c60-45f7-42e4-ad15-84b384be810b"><a href="#InvolvingtheCharacters" data-content-chunk-id="001e09a4-9590-45bc-a18a-2119df7b3e1a"></a>Involving the Characters</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d4da660e-9c27-4c30-8922-ad6cebdcbaa9">Once you’ve identified what your campaign is about, let the players help tell the story by deciding how their characters are involved. This is their opportunity to tie their characters’ history and background to the campaign, and a chance for you to determine how the various elements of each character’s background tie into the campaign’s story. For example, what secret has the hermit character learned? What is the status of the noble character’s family? What is the folk hero’s destiny?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b6cc06c2-9817-40f4-9019-0405de44a5cd">Some players might have trouble coming up with ideas — not everyone is equally inventive. You can help spur their creativity with a few questions about their characters:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="0b0ba6bc-0ee9-4bd3-bad2-0314d9a4767c">
<li data-content-chunk-id="5fb0310d-1dd5-4850-a1e8-5548dabc585c">Are you a native, born and raised in the area? If so, who’s your family? What’s your current occupation?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="1881ff4b-5cfa-43da-b96d-b92f014f8e08">Are you a recent arrival? Where did you come from? Why did you come to this area?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="fd1819cb-b41a-42ed-848a-12656ead3fbe">Are you tied to any of the organizations or people involved in the events that kick off the campaign? Are they friends or enemies?</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eec83cba-cb55-45b3-9e9b-27fc1949e19f">Listen to the players’ ideas, and say yes if you can. Even if you want all the characters to have grown up in the starting town, consider allowing a recent arrival or a transplant if the player’s story is convincing enough. Suggest alterations to a character’s story so it better fits your world, or weave the first threads of your campaign into that story.</p>
<h3 id="CreatingaBackground" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="62e7c12e-bf20-4682-8a35-7d0833e94403"><a href="#CreatingaBackground" data-content-chunk-id="a8864974-4a41-4546-836c-ec118de0006a"></a>Creating a Background</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4554c1e4-5f58-4ddd-b546-7beace8d3bb8">Backgrounds are designed to root player characters in the world, and creating new backgrounds is a great way to introduce players to the special features of your world. Backgrounds that have ties to particular cultures, organizations, and historical events from your campaign are particularly strong. Perhaps the priests of a certain religion live as beggars supported by a pious populace, singing the tales of their deity’s exploits to entertain and enlighten the faithful. You could create a mendicant priest background (or modify the acolyte background) to reflect these qualities. It could include musical instrument proficiency, and its feature probably involves receiving hospitality from the faithful.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="78fbbcf1-013a-43df-a8f8-e06a6d8388b0">Guidelines for creating a new background are provided in chapter 9, “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop" data-content-chunk-id="d9d0b61a-11ef-482a-9e33-74b697e75e3e">Dungeon Master’s Workshop</a>.”</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="bbaefaf6-54ff-4ffb-a604-3facf3109bef">Significant events in the history of a fantasy world tend toward immense upheavals: wars that pit the forces of good against evil in an epic confrontation, natural disasters that lay waste to entire civilizations, invasions of vast armies or extraplanar hordes, assassinations of world leaders. These world-shaking events title the chapters of history.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="753383ff-5fba-47f2-9c45-844f67555a87">In a D&amp;D game, such events provide the sparks that can ignite and sustain a campaign. The most common pitfall of serial stories without a set beginning, middle, and end is inertia. Like many television shows and comic-book series, a D&amp;D campaign runs the risk of retreading the same ground long after the enjoyment’s gone. Just as actors or writers drift away from those other mediums, so can players — the actors and writers of a D&amp;D game. Games stagnate when the story meanders too long without a change in tone, when the same villains and similar adventures grow tiresome and predictable, and when the world doesn’t change around the characters and in response to their actions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="67bcc938-666b-4604-9182-d6d802b2f9be">World-shaking events force conflict. They set new events and power groups in motion. Their outcomes change the world by altering the tone of the setting in a meaningful way. They chronicle the story of your world in big, bold print. Change — especially change that occurs as a result of the characters’ actions — keeps the story moving. If change is imperceptible, the actions of the characters lack significance. When the world becomes reliable, it’s time to shake things up.</p>
<h3 id="PuttingEventsinMotion" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="eb491c0b-58a2-46eb-bb36-0496960acf6f"><a href="#PuttingEventsinMotion" data-content-chunk-id="2466595e-1c2f-42e0-adf0-716561341acb"></a>Putting Events in Motion</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f44feb35-28e0-4fc2-92d8-9bc73e8ba4ce">World-shaking events can happen at any time in a campaign or story arc, but the biggest incidents naturally fall at the beginning, middle, and end of a story.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08341205-b34f-4cb2-8899-4bb8e8a7ea64">That placement reflects the structure of dramatic stories. At the beginning of a story, something happens to shake the protagonists’ world and spur them into action. The characters take action to resolve their problems, but other forces oppose them. As they reach a significant milestone toward their goal, a major conflict disrupts the characters’ plans, shaking their world again; failure seems imminent. At the end of the story, they succeed or fail, and the world is shaken again by the way the characters changed it for good or ill.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="54243862-2c68-4e2f-8e79-5e51df6c0ef6">At the beginning of a D&amp;D campaign, world-shaking events create instant adventure hooks and affect the characters’ lives directly. In the middle, they make great turning points as the characters’ fortunes reverse — rising after a defeat or falling after a victory. Near the end of a campaign, such events serve as excellent climactic episodes with far-reaching effects. They might even occur after the story has ended, as a result of the characters’ actions.</p>
<h3 id="WhenNottoShakeItUp" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="00d5cfaa-f5c6-4efa-92d0-a3a9fba4cb2a"><a href="#WhenNottoShakeItUp" data-content-chunk-id="b975eb73-d117-4b95-9a14-433b52c43ba1"></a>When Not to Shake It Up</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0f8cc605-cb1d-4c8b-a7cf-802b5786a36a">In constructing a narrative, beware of “false action,” or action for its own sake. False action doesn’t move a story forward, engage characters, or cause them to change. Many action movies suffer from false action, in which car chases, gunfights, and explosions abound but do little more than inconvenience the characters and eventually bore the audience with their repetition and dearth of meaningful stakes. Some D&amp;D campaigns fall into the same trap, stringing world-spanning disasters together one after another with little impact on the characters or the world. Thus, it’s probably not in the DM’s best interest to reorder the world every single time there’s a lull in the action, lest world-shaking events become ordinary.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4227026b-05a9-49ed-8651-82f671baa707">As a general rule, a campaign can sustain up to three large-scale, world-shaking events: one near the beginning, one near the middle, and one near the end. Use as many small-scale events that disturb the bounded microcosms of towns, villages, tribes, fiefs, duchies, provinces, and so forth as you like. Every significant event shakes someone’s world, after all, no matter how small that world might be. Let unexpected and terrible events regularly afflict the world’s smaller territories, but unless your story demands it, save the large-scale map-spanning events for the biggest, most important moments of your campaign.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="42f4c660-db27-4f19-bf4a-5eaeec71c757">Political leaders are monarchs, nobles, and chiefs. Religious leaders include deities’ avatars, high priests, and messiahs, as well as those in charge of monasteries and leaders of influential religious sects. Major military leaders control the armed forces of countries. They include military dictators, warlords, and the heads of a ruler’s war council. Minor military leaders include the heads of local militias, gangs, and other martial organizations. At the broadest scale, a criminal or underworld leader wields power through a network of spies, bribes, and black-market trade. On the smallest scale, these are local gang bosses, pirate captains, and brigands. A leader in art or culture is a virtuoso whose work reflects the spirit of the age and changes the way people think: a prominent playwright, bard, or court fool in whose words, art, or performance the people perceive universal truth. On a smaller scale, this might be an influential local poet, minstrel, satirist, or sculptor. A major leader in philosophy, learning, or magic is a genius philosopher, a counselor to emperors, an enlightened thinker, the head of the highest institution of learning in the world, or an archmage. A minor leader might be a local sage, seer, hedge wizard, wise elder, or teacher.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d74683d2-c556-48e3-824a-f22b0f100a38"><strong><em>Rise of a Leader, Beginning of an Era.</em></strong> In dramatic stories, a new leader’s rise often comes at the end of a period of struggle or turmoil. Sometimes it’s a war or uprising; other times it’s an election, the death of a tyrant, a prophecy fulfilled, or the appointment of a hero. Conversely, the new leader might be a tyrant, a fiend, or black-hearted villain, and the era that just ended could have been one of peace, tranquility, and justice.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8790b00d-dcfa-4ff1-8db8-88adb58d4450">A new leader shakes the foundations of your campaign world and begins a new era in the selected region. How does this person or this era begin to affect the world? Here are several things to consider when determining the leader’s impact on the world:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="845914f4-9d01-4457-bce4-07155a121e4c">
<li data-content-chunk-id="c8b07efa-95f6-461b-8623-97c4533f7d3a">Name one thing that has been consistently true about the world, which is now no longer true due to this leader’s rise or influence. This is the biggest change that occurs when the new leader takes power and becomes the prevailing trait that defines the era, the characteristic for which it is remembered.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="8218b8e2-b084-473c-a2ff-541664b1bfdf">Name the person (or people) whose death, defeat, or loss opened the door for this leader to take power. This might be a military defeat, the overthrow of old ideas, a cultural rebirth, or something else. Who died, lost, or was defeated? What weren’t they willing to compromise? Was the new leader complicit in the death, defeat, or loss, or was the opportunity serendipitous?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="6d4e49c7-ecfa-40f6-a6ec-2cb7e1e72bfe">Despite the leader’s virtues, one flaw in particular outrages a certain segment of the populace. What is that flaw? What person or group of persons will do their utmost to foil this leader because of it? Conversely, what is this leader’s greatest virtue, and who rises to the leader’s defense because of it?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a581baaa-9500-4448-bdbb-0c5cb6f2303d">Who believes in this leader now, but still retains doubts? This is someone close to the leader, who has the leader’s trust and knows his or her secret fears, doubts, or vices.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a66d346f-f678-416e-b122-b5ecd08406bf"><strong><em>Fall of a Leader, End of an Era.</em></strong> All that begins must end. With the fall of kings and queens, the maps of the world are redrawn. Laws change, new customs become all the rage, and old ones fall out of favor. The attitude of the citizens toward their fallen leader shifts subtly at first and then changes dramatically as they look back or reminisce about the time before.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="82a65492-6b8e-4258-960d-c452871636b1">The fallen leader might have been a benevolent ruler, an influential citizen, or even an adversary to the characters. How does the death of this person affect those formerly under his or her influence? Here are several things to consider when determining the effects of a leader’s passing:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="76536561-d0d8-4b6f-ba0f-91a3e9af8861">
<li data-content-chunk-id="9a015daa-9f6e-4228-9942-b32d2d427a83">Name one positive change that the leader brought to his or her domain or sphere of influence. Does that change persist after the leader’s death?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="5e57daeb-3108-4870-b8bb-3d8cdc8adaf4">State the general mood or attitude of the people under this person’s power. What important fact didn’t they realize about this person or his or her reign, which will later come to light?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="ce8e0588-bbb2-4c02-81e3-ef6cfb2eb430">Name one person or group that tries to fill the leader’s shoes in the resulting power vacuum.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="7995b97e-c5ac-4b62-af66-286dcf2e9ec9">Name one person or group that plotted against this leader.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="d84ea148-e344-4dd8-a554-84fb68e948f9">Name three things for which this leader will be remembered.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="467de4de-81ec-4260-bf92-83372dd063a9">Earthquake, famine, fire, plague, flood — disasters on a grand scale can eradicate whole civilizations without warning. Natural (or magical) catastrophes redraw maps, destroy economies, and alter worlds. Sometimes the survivors rebuild from the ruins. The Great Chicago Fire, for instance, provided an opportunity to rebuild the city according to a modern plan. Most of the time the disaster leaves only ruins — buried under ash like Pompeii, or sunk beneath the waves like Atlantis.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1ad02e2e-8dd5-451f-9eb4-eb8d4be4a702">You can choose the cataclysm or determine one randomly using the Cataclysmic Disasters table.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9186b171-d15c-4cfe-8a53-3f10d8835765">Some of the disasters on the table might not make immediate sense in the context of your campaign world. A flood in the desert? A volcanic eruption on grassy plains? If you randomly determine a disaster that conflicts with your setting, you can reroll, but the challenge of justifying the catastrophe can produce interesting results.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="223f2974-08af-40f6-ab72-1fc2ed4d0fd5">With two exceptions, the disasters on the table resemble those that affect our own world. Think of planar warps and magic gone awry like nuclear incidents; they’re big events that unnaturally alter the land and its people. For example, in the Eberron campaign setting, a magical catastrophe lays waste to an entire country, transforming it into a hostile wasteland and ending the Last War.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3ee772ef-9639-413f-a446-c078f9f90264">Divine judgment is something else entirely. This disaster takes whatever form you want, but it’s always a big, bold, unsubtle sign of a deity’s displeasure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="faeee33b-79ea-4215-a708-31a82d918caa">You might decide to wipe a town, region, or nation off the map of your world. A disaster ravages the land and effectively eliminates a place the characters once knew. Leave one or two survivors to tell the characters what happened, and ensure that the characters feel the depth of the catastrophe. What are the ongoing effects of this cataclysm? The following points can help you define the nature and consequences of the disaster:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="80caab7e-c954-48cd-8369-b87e3489fc4b">
<li data-content-chunk-id="a324a228-8979-4a22-b9f4-e11f16657680">Decide what caused this cataclysm and where it originated.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="332ac922-4c38-4fb0-a31f-d3af300f3eda">An omen presaged this event, or a series of signs and omens. Describe the omen in detail.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="fd093611-b748-4491-9d1c-559a77d09bf1">Describe or name the creature that warned the populace about the oncoming disaster. Who listened?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="edd3069f-4991-41b8-b413-12d129873782">Who were the lucky (or unlucky) ones who survived?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="8ffd7a92-d5e2-48a5-b2b7-446ab99b6c4f">Describe what the area looks like after the disaster, in contrast to how it looked before.</li>
</ul>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6d5ab769-f940-4430-a2b5-7e8e9b5cd585">One of the most common world-shaking events, an invasion occurs when one group forcibly takes over another, usually by military strength, but also by infiltration and occupation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ec57cdb7-65e1-4efd-92e5-60de935fb2e5">An assault differs from an invasion in that the attacking force isn’t necessarily interested in occupation or taking power. On the other hand, an assault might be the first step of an invasion.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c1f69bdd-41ae-4bcd-a9b1-6e4ad94dc34d">Regardless of the scale, a world-shaking assault or invasion stands out because its repercussions change the characters’ world, and its effects echo long after the initial attack or takeover.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e907a2ba-62b0-4795-8894-a7c0bba7f55b">Imagine that part of your campaign world is attacked or invaded. Depending on the current scale of your campaign, the area might be as small as a section of a city or as large as a continent, world, or plane of existence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0dd6d38b-64a2-4ba9-850b-8f7fe78120d4">Define the aggressor and whether it represents a known enemy or a previously unknown adversary. Select a threat that already poses a danger to the area you’ve chosen, or use the Invading Forces table to determine the aggressor.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="02091313-a830-42bc-b97c-07b6970854f0">Dissatisfied with the current order, a person or group of people overturns the dominant regime and takes over — or fails to take over. Regardless of the result, a revolution (even an attempted one) can shape the destiny of nations.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2df74fca-7aae-4652-9540-ee6374feb044">The scale of a revolution need not involve the common masses against the nobility. A revolution can be as small as a merchants’ guild revolting against its leadership or a temple overthrowing its priesthood in favor of a new creed. The spirits of the forest might attempt to overthrow the forces of civilization in a nearby city that cut down trees for timber. Alternatively, the scale can be as dramatic as humanity rising to overthrow the gods.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3f85066c-e33c-43e0-819e-09950ea26fdb">Imagine that part of your campaign world erupts in revolution. Pick a power group in your current campaign and name (or invent) a group that opposes it, fomenting revolution. Then let the following points help you flesh out the conflict:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="27497334-aaca-48ba-a579-9646a4aa62b3">

<li data-content-chunk-id="fc4ef17e-754e-4674-aa84-bb85929a3ea6">State the cost exacted upon the old order after its fall from power.

<li data-content-chunk-id="3857e3c9-b126-4f59-bedb-40b372c37040">One of the rebellion’s prominent leaders — in some respects the face of the revolution — was driven by a personal reason for his or her part in events. Describe this person and state the true reason he or she led the rebellion.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c8df39d1-56a4-4f0f-ba8c-f5ba2fc93a17">Something that once existed in the campaign world is gone. The lost resource might be a precious metal, a species of plant or animal that held an important place in the local ecology, or an entire race or culture of people. Its absence causes a chain reaction that affects every creature that uses or relies on it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c90491d7-e157-414e-8d7b-bb9fae6885c7">You can eliminate a people, place, or thing that previously existed in a certain location or area in your campaign world. On a small scale, the last of a family dynasty passes away or a once-thriving mining town in the region dries up and becomes a ghost town. On a grand scale, magic dies, the last dragon is slain, or the final fey noble departs the world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ffa17ecf-bf5b-4d9e-9b04-631ee1ca7088">What is gone from the world — or the region of the world you’ve chosen — that once existed there? If the answer isn’t immediately evident, consult the Extinction or Depletion table for ideas.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4659c340-f162-4a90-8f6e-2223ce897846">The foundation of a new order, kingdom, religion, society, cabal, or cult can shake the world with its actions, doctrine, dogma, and policies. On a local scale, a new organization contends with existing power groups, influencing, subverting, dominating, or allying with them to create a stronger base of power. Large and powerful organizations can exert enough influence to rule the world. Some new organizations benefit the populace, while others grow to threaten the civilization they once protected.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2d4c807f-3e69-459c-b02f-2d51a7337d13">Discoveries of new lands expand the map and change the boundaries of empires. Discoveries of new magic or technology expand the boundaries of what was once thought possible. New resources or archaeological finds create opportunity and wealth and set prospectors and power groups in motion to vie for their control.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3c2ae26a-0e06-4f6d-8285-fe6d3c739a5f">A new discovery — or rediscovery — can impact your campaign world in a meaningful way, shaping the course of history and the events of the age. Think of this discovery as a big adventure hook or series of hooks. This is also an opportunity to create a unique monster, item, god, plane, or race for your world. As long as the discovery matters, it doesn’t have to be wholly original, just flavored for your campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d67488c7-3e63-407e-9b8c-2232c327eff9">A discovery is particularly impressive when the adventurers in your campaign are the ones who make it. If they discover a new mineral with magical properties, map a new land that’s eminently suitable for colonization, or uncover an ancient weapon with the power to wreak devastation on your world, they are likely to set major events in motion. This gives the players the opportunity to see exactly how much influence their actions have on your world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="82b7ebdc-1b11-4e91-a73d-8aad08585192">Decide on the type of discovery that is made or use the Discoveries table to generate ideas.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9846e10a-d5d6-463e-997b-d4c33b09618f">Once you have determined the type of discovery, flesh it out by deciding exactly what it is, who discovered it, and what potential effect it could have on the world. Ideally, previous adventures in your campaign will help you fill in the blanks, but also keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="c165485f-1e03-45f9-8d43-cae73427cc70">
<li data-content-chunk-id="80c9e7fe-612c-470c-8e12-ee0e1bd03a0d">This discovery benefits a particular person, group, or faction more than others. Who benefits most? Name three benefits they stand to gain from this discovery.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="7b93e423-0409-49f1-b5eb-cd5bfce6878f">This discovery directly harms another person, group, or faction. Who is harmed the most?</li>

<li data-content-chunk-id="eb679e28-6cca-4806-a45d-b3fd03675f7c">Name two or three individuals or factions struggling to possess or control this discovery. Who is likely to win? What do they stand to gain, and what are they willing to do to control the discovery?</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ba5d195a-942d-4719-8f26-30302319c51b">Sometimes the foretelling of a world-shaking event becomes a world-shaking event: an omen that predicts the fall of empires, the doom of races, and the end of the world. Sometimes an omen points to change for the good, such as the arrival of a legendary hero or savior. But the most dramatic prophecies warn of future tragedies and predict dark ages. Unlike other world-shaking events, the outcome doesn’t happen immediately. Instead, individuals or factions strive to fulfill or avert the prophecy — or shape the exact way it will be fulfilled — according to how it will affect them. The prophecy’s helpers or hinderers create adventure hooks in the campaign by the actions they take. A prophecy should foretell a big event on a grand scale, since it will take time to come true (or be averted).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7eb53133-a05c-4f2e-9350-07b2b46ac068">Imagine that a world-shaking prophecy comes to light. If events continue on their present course, the prophecy will come true and the world will change dramatically as a result. Don’t shy away from making this prophecy both significant and alarming, keeping in mind the following points:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="a8d32ceb-4dde-4052-be74-86f02a25d6f1">
<li data-content-chunk-id="e444addb-895b-46bb-8809-8e9304495211">Create a prophecy that foretells a major change to the campaign world. You can build one from scratch using ideas from the current campaign or randomly determine a world-shaking event and flesh out the details.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="5c176929-be55-403e-96bb-83b13f5dd339">Write a list of three or more omens that will occur before the prophecy comes to pass. You can use events that have already occurred in the campaign so that the prophecy is closer to being fulfilled. The rest are events that might or might not happen, depending on the actions of the characters.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="78dabfca-9d7e-4af6-be37-58db87f57e8b">Describe the person or creature that discovered the prophecy and how it was found. What did this creature gain by revealing it? What did this person lose or sacrifice?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="bafc5c24-461a-49d9-a5fe-4fadfbef8fa2">Describe the individual or faction that supports the prophecy and works to ensure its fulfillment, and the one that will do all in its power to avert the prophecy. What is the first step each takes? Who suffers for their efforts?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="86c9e935-606c-4b59-a8e4-98f4e4284e76">One part of the prophecy is wrong. Choose one of the omens you listed or one of the details you created for the world-shaking event that the omen predicts. The chosen omen is false, and if applicable, its opposite is true instead.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="10MythandLegend" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c3baae73-1a58-49f2-aaf0-aa5459596188"><a href="#10MythandLegend" data-content-chunk-id="2dbb7de8-cfa0-4b14-b051-62877fe2f58d"></a>10. Myth and Legend</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5c80cc04-4376-431c-bfac-db1a89d8794a">If wars, plagues, discoveries, and the like can be called regular world-shaking events, mythic events exceed and surpass them. A mythic event might occur as the fulfillment of an ancient or long-forgotten prophecy, or it might be an act of divine intervention.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="323c37c3-51e0-4381-8f7a-6e6d86793732">Once again, your current campaign probably provides a few ideas for the shape of this event. If you need inspiration, roll a d8 on the World-Shaking Events table, instead of the normal d10. Address the bullet-point notes for that disaster, but magnify the result to the grandest scale you can imagine.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="88d29821-e690-47c4-9b4c-8171a53c6be8">The rise or fall of a leader or era is the death or birth of a god, or the end of an age or the world. A cataclysmic disaster is a world-drowning deluge, an ice age, or a zombie apocalypse. An assault or invasion is a world war, a world-spanning demonic incursion, the awakening of a world-threatening monster, or the final clash between good and evil. A rebellion dethrones a god or gods, or raises a new force (such as a demon lord) to divinity. A new organization is a world-spanning empire or a pantheon of new gods. A discovery is a doomsday device or a portal to eldritch dimensions where world-shattering cosmic horrors dwell.</p>
<h3 id="TrackingTime" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="3d6b102a-6627-4d6b-b706-ea09c4d92664"><a href="#TrackingTime" data-content-chunk-id="801cf84f-8d8d-4177-8070-f6ca6e7e9d5d"></a>Tracking Time</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1bc2242c-ae85-4331-b7e2-14ec0a4b06d6">A calendar lets you record the passage of time in the campaign. More importantly, it lets you plan ahead for the critical events that shake up the world. For simple time tracking, use a calendar for the current year in the real world. Pick a date to indicate the start of the campaign, and make note of the days that adventurers spend on their travels and various activities. The calendar tells you when the seasons change and the lunar cycle. More importantly, you can use your calendar to track important festivals and holidays, as well as key events that shape your campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="512f95db-2331-4acc-ba7b-351b55e5f86d">This method is a good starting point, but the calendar of your world need not follow a modern calendar. If you want to customize your calendar with details unique to your world, consider these types of features.</p>
<h4 id="TheBasics" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="302f0cc2-579f-4929-bef0-b3bd4925c2ec"><a href="#TheBasics" data-content-chunk-id="7300d3ba-cd49-4960-ae4b-bc7a9efdbd6c"></a>The Basics</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee838ede-138e-4f6b-9f20-a55f26532cd2">A fantasy world’s calendar doesn’t have to mirror the modern one, but it can (see “The Calendar of Harptos” sidebar for an example). Do the weeks of a month have names? What about specific days of each month, like the ides, nones, and calends of the Roman calendar?</p>
<h4 id="PhysicalCycles" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="16afc965-cbea-46d0-95d3-4c16833188f6"><a href="#PhysicalCycles" data-content-chunk-id="83819264-591a-4bed-9ee3-df1ad6f98069"></a>Physical Cycles</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3c37ba4f-f7fc-4791-bdde-3e3b050694fc">Determine when the seasons fall, marked by the solstices and equinoxes. Do the months correspond to the phases of the moon (or moons)? Do strange and magical effects occur at the same time as these phenomena?</p>
<h4 id="ReligiousObservances" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="d75ab195-404d-4f82-8e02-ba227ffc7cc8"><a href="#ReligiousObservances" data-content-chunk-id="8eab4776-7706-46f9-919a-a0a603f16807"></a>Religious Observances</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3c10b19f-bdb0-4b98-856e-b9fafd572e5b">Sprinkle holy days throughout your calendar. Each significant deity in your world should have at least one holy day during the year, and some gods’ holy days correspond to celestial phenomena such as new moons or equinoxes. Holy days reflect the portfolio of a deity (a god of agriculture is honored in the harvest season) or significant events in the history of the deity’s worship, such as the birth or death of a holy person, the date of a god’s manifestation, the accession of the current high priest, and so on.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b9932d86-4316-4e5d-9209-6d826e41fd82">Certain holy days are civic events, observed by every citizen of a town where a god’s temple can be found. Harvest festivals are often celebrations on a grand scale. Other holy days are important only to people particularly devoted to a single deity. Still others are observed by priests, who perform private rites and sacrifices inside their temples on certain days or specific times of day. And some holy days are local, observed by the faithful of a specific temple.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="416ff08f-46d4-4236-93a5-787e9049f418">Give some thought to how priests and common folk celebrate holy days. Going into a temple, sitting in a pew, and listening to a sermon is a mode of worship foreign to most fantasy religions. More commonly, celebrants offer sacrifices to their gods. The faithful bring animals to the temple to be slaughtered or burn incense as an offering. The wealthiest citizens bring the largest animals, to flaunt their wealth and demonstrate their piety. People pour out libations at the graves of their ancestors. They spend all-night vigils in darkened shrines or enjoy splendid feasts celebrating a god’s bounty.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a7a31e1e-b267-4a24-9335-178dad5d9f6a">Holy days provide the majority of the special celebrations in most calendars, but local or national festivals account for many others. The birthday of a monarch, the anniversary of a great victory in a war, craft festivals, market days, and similar events all provide excuses for local celebrations.</p>
<h4 id="FantasticEvents" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="6afd56c7-1584-4784-bfaf-2900f28ceee1"><a href="#FantasticEvents" data-content-chunk-id="28658de6-90d8-4f73-b025-34686d7ed1fe"></a>Fantastic Events</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5e995147-8ec9-4f91-8ed7-41bd675a256c">Since your setting is a fantasy world and not a mundane medieval society, add in a few events of an obviously magical nature. For example, perhaps a ghostly castle appears on a certain hill on the winter solstice every year, or every third full moon fills lycanthropes with a particularly strong bloodlust. Also, the thirteenth night of every month could mark the ghostly wanderings of a long-forgotten nomadic tribe.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9084da0e-5593-4fe1-8568-bc4e4cfa2798">Extraordinary events, such as the approach of a comet or a lunar eclipse, make good adventure elements, and you can drop them in your calendar wherever you want. Your calendar can tell you when there’s a full moon for a lunar eclipse, but you can always fudge the date for a particular effect.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b7828922-3212-43dc-a735-278276abef36">THE CALENDAR OF HARPTOS</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b9679ce2-3d34-47e9-901a-bcf8467b29c6">The world of the Forgotten Realms uses the Calendar of Harptos, named after the long-dead wizard who invented it. Each year of 365 days is divided into twelve months of thirty days each, which roughly correspond to months in the real-world Gregorian calendar. Each month is divided into three tendays. Five special holidays fall between the months and mark the seasons. Another special holiday, Shieldmeet, is inserted into the calendar after Midsummer every four years, much like leap years in the modern Gregorian calendar.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="715563e9-64f6-4c07-b969-06b36c849c7f">A campaign’s ending should tie up all the threads of its beginning and middle, but you don’t have to take a campaign all the way to 20th level for it to be satisfying. Wrap up the campaign whenever your story reaches its natural conclusion.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ca575a91-44b2-4fad-90af-e0c175d44d04">Make sure you allow space and time near the end of your campaign for the characters to finish up any personal goals. Their own stories need to end in a satisfying way, just as the campaign story does. Ideally, some of the characters’ individual goals will be fulfilled by the ultimate goal of the final adventure. Give characters with unfinished goals a chance to finish them before the very end.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b0a161c1-4ceb-4f1a-b220-46393054f6be">Once the campaign has ended, a new one can begin. If you intend to run a new campaign for the same group of players, using their previous characters’ actions as the basis of legends gives them immediate investment in the new setting. Let the new characters experience how the world has changed because of their old characters. In the end, though, the new campaign is a new story with new protagonists. They shouldn’t have to share the spotlight with the heroes of days gone by.</p>
<h2 id="PlayStyle" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="83bdc4c7-47eb-48ae-9413-e07a75505df3"><a href="#PlayStyle" data-content-chunk-id="4dd01b0d-a9c0-4214-8cf5-53f9f2a0f15d"></a>Play Style</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb903e5a-3312-4356-9d7b-763d9cc0a4c4">By building a new world (or adopting an existing one) and creating the key events that launch your campaign, you determined what your campaign is about. Next, you have to decide how you want to run your campaign.</p>
<div class="flexible-double-column" data-content-chunk-id="7afbe7c0-bc93-4bc7-a1e6-e19a755510b0">
<div data-content-chunk-id="069820b1-807e-4e89-b558-14760c967ea8">
<p data-content-chunk-id="5113ae1e-bab2-4ea5-a906-8423abcc73ee">What’s the right way to run a campaign? That depends on your play style and the motivations of your players. Consider your players’ tastes, your strengths as a DM, table rules (discussed in part 3), and the type of game you want to run. Describe to the players how you envision the game experience and let them give you input. The game is theirs, too. Lay that groundwork early, so your players can make informed choices and help you maintain the type of game you want to run.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91b69bfc-fe14-467d-8c6d-84c1b9160c6c">Consider the following two exaggerated examples of play style.</p>
<h3 id="HackandSlash" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="1a648344-b48f-4e76-be23-efaa16eee678"><a href="#HackandSlash" data-content-chunk-id="4c09936b-4f31-430a-9409-ced76ce5a5b9"></a>Hack and Slash</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d96a113-af6b-406a-827c-5d50729deb05">The adventurers kick in the dungeon door, fight the monsters, and grab the treasure. This style of play is straightforward, fun, exciting, and action-oriented. The players spend relatively little time developing personas for their characters, roleplaying noncombat situations, or discussing anything other than the immediate dangers of the dungeon.</p>
</div>
<div data-content-chunk-id="654b044b-efa1-41a7-acee-afba39548c80">
<figure class="compendium-image compendium-image-center" id="Figure10">

</div>
</div>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6c6fef33-6c40-490f-be2f-e350223662c9">In such a game, the adventurers face clearly evil monsters and opponents and occasionally meet clearly good and helpful NPCs. Don’t expect the adventurers to anguish over what to do with prisoners, or to debate whether it’s right or wrong to invade and wipe out a bugbear lair. Don’t track money or time spent in town. Once they’ve completed a task, send the adventurers back into the action as quickly as possible. Character motivation need be no more developed than a desire to kill monsters and acquire treasure.</p>
<h3 id="ImmersiveStorytelling" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="c1c31c5b-bd8b-456e-9984-916f9299e726"><a href="#ImmersiveStorytelling" data-content-chunk-id="8ad9fbac-5368-4729-92cd-9ff1cca28e52"></a>Immersive Storytelling</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cc143ad9-93f9-4fea-a11e-b31514fb3a5a">Waterdeep is threatened by political turmoil. The adventurers must convince the Masked Lords, the city’s secret rulers, to resolve their differences, but can do so only after both the characters and the lords have come to terms with their differing outlooks and agendas. This style of gaming is deep, complex, and challenging. The focus isn’t on combat but on negotiations, political maneuverings, and character interaction. A whole game session might pass without a single attack roll.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="02bab0de-7236-4b08-8e2a-9d1b1d0f61dd">In this style of game, the NPCs are as complex and richly detailed as the adventurers, although the focus lies on motivation and personality, not game statistics. Expect long digressions from each player about what his or her character does, and why. Going to a temple to ask a priest for advice can be as important an encounter as fighting orcs. (And don’t expect the adventurers to fight the orcs at all unless they are motivated to do so.) A character will sometimes take actions against the player’s better judgment, because “that’s what the character would do.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="51a09655-7939-442c-a9b7-099b1bbacd68">Since combat isn’t the focus, game rules take a back seat to character development. Ability check modifiers and skill proficiencies take precedence over combat bonuses. Feel free to change or ignore rules to fit the players’ roleplaying needs, using the advice presented in part 3 of this book.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b385a3ce-1556-4d07-ba18-50c134e9c31c">Much of a campaign involves the adventurers traveling from place to place, exploring the environment, and learning about the fantasy world. This exploration can take place in any environment, including a vast wilderness, a labyrinthine dungeon, the shadowy passages of the Underdark, the crowded streets of a city, and the undulating waters of the sea. Determining a way around an obstacle, finding a hidden object, investigating a strange feature of a dungeon, deciphering clues, solving puzzles, and bypassing or disabling traps can all be part of exploration.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0ac8206a-b8ec-47c5-9171-227e7693edd0">Sometimes exploration is an incidental part of the game. For instance, you might gloss over an unimportant journey by telling the players that they spend three uneventful days on the road before moving along to the next point of interest. Other times exploration is the focus, a chance to describe a wondrous part of the world or story that increases the players’ feeling of immersion. Similarly, you should consider playing up exploration if your players enjoy solving puzzles, finding their way around obstacles, and searching dungeon corridors for secret doors.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cea2c2e6-15ba-4532-bdbb-3509ddeff248">The style of play in most campaigns falls between these two extremes. There’s plenty of action, but the campaign offers an ongoing storyline and interaction between characters as well. Players develop their characters’ motivations and relish the chance to prove their skills in combat. To maintain the balance, provide a mixture of roleplaying encounters and combat encounters. Even in a dungeon setting, you can present NPCs that aren’t meant to be fought but rather helped out, negotiated with, or just talked to.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d23a2f9-41ee-4954-afb0-2ea1308b227c">Think about your preferred style of play by considering these questions:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="8dcf50d5-4076-4a2a-a4b9-02d95543459e">
<li data-content-chunk-id="84d551b6-59f3-46a1-8197-20f7b5d31ee2">Are you a fan of realism and gritty consequences, or are you more focused on making the game seem like an action movie?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="839738a3-2bde-4912-8d06-27aa18e2b79c">Do you want the game to maintain a sense of medieval fantasy, or do you want to explore alternate time lines or modern thinking?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="e184f82b-414c-4d29-af5f-9b96cebb2a2c">Do you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor your goal?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="ce12339d-60b8-48a1-9073-199dafe92db3">Even if you are serious, is the action lighthearted or intense?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="25190536-8903-483b-bb6d-8928d82ea683">Is bold action key, or do the players need to be thoughtful and cautious?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="f52e4975-1dd7-4fe7-8599-1476336db4b6">Do you like to plan thoroughly in advance, or do you prefer improvising on the spot?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="9d489c03-a578-4a49-aa8c-e05d93bf335e">Is the game full of varied D&amp;D elements, or does it center on a theme such as horror?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="ccc1da59-0ace-4e94-b9f0-a1f28d121cba">Is the game for all ages, or does it involve mature themes?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="cd6f9ef2-0e7a-499c-b4e9-6b36002a325a">Are you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as allowing the characters to explore whether the end justifies the means? Or are you happier with straightforward heroic principles, such as justice, sacrifice, and helping the downtrodden?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="CharacterNames" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="dc07d0d5-e8fe-4e40-9f70-853abeab6487"><a href="#CharacterNames" data-content-chunk-id="d57ef1bc-0bc7-4598-a8cf-8d40948d9774"></a>Character Names</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a1671932-ed95-4c15-9a50-909ce64fa6a1">Part of your campaign style has to do with naming characters. It’s a good idea to establish some ground rules with your players at the start of a new campaign. In a group consisting of Sithis, Travok, Anastrianna, and Kairon, the human fighter named Bob II sticks out, especially when he’s identical to Bob I, who was killed by kobolds. If everyone takes a lighthearted approach to names, that’s fine. If the group would rather take the characters and their names a little more seriously, urge Bob’s player to come up with a more appropriate name.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="301f3d1c-7227-4d29-8147-aa8ab69d2e1b">Player character names should match each other in flavor or concept, and they should also match the flavor of your campaign world — so should the nonplayer characters’ names and place names you create. Travok and Kairon don’t want to undertake a quest for Lord Cupcake, visit Gumdrop Island, or take down a crazy wizard named Ray.</p>
<h3 id="ContinuingorEpisodicCampaigns" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="5d83ca68-a615-4c7a-80dc-7ff07dda2d64"><a href="#ContinuingorEpisodicCampaigns" data-content-chunk-id="265653bc-49b0-4dfb-b878-26588e2024dd"></a>Continuing or Episodic Campaigns</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="382beb9c-3ce5-470d-abe9-87f82b54d077">The backbone of a campaign is a connected series of adventures, but you can connect them in two different ways.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8dbdeaf8-171d-4f79-849d-8e4c0038528b">In a continuing campaign, the connected adventures share a sense of a larger purpose or a recurring theme (or themes). The adventures might feature returning villains, grand conspiracies, or a single mastermind who’s ultimately behind every adventure of the campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6d2a65bb-36d5-40f3-93f1-16dc3362b922">A continuing campaign designed with a theme and a story arc in mind can feel like a great fantasy epic. The players derive the satisfaction of knowing the actions they take during one adventure matter in the next. Plotting and running that kind of campaign can be demanding on the DM, but the payoff is a great and memorable story.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="22c195b3-a31f-4417-84cf-352e7d84c260">An episodic campaign, in contrast, is like a television show where each week’s episode is a self-contained story that doesn’t play into any overarching plot. It might be built on a premise that explains its nature: the player characters are adventurers-for-hire, or explorers venturing into the unknown and facing a string of unrelated dangers. They might even be archaeologists, venturing into one ancient ruin after another in search of artifacts. An episodic game like this lets you create adventures — or buy published ones — and drop them into your campaign without worrying about how they fit with the adventures that came before and follow after.</p>
<h3 id="CampaignTheme" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="9856a388-1da7-41c6-a817-fd07bb55eeb2"><a href="#CampaignTheme" data-content-chunk-id="5f119e65-02ed-4d8b-a500-3081da6b1e78"></a>Campaign Theme</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c363f97f-ea7c-4772-98c0-0a9c494227ab">A theme in a campaign, as in a work of literature, expresses the deeper meaning of a story and the fundamental elements of human experience that the story explores. Your campaign doesn’t have to be a work of literature, but it can still draw on common themes that lend a distinctive flavor to its stories. Consider these examples:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="2c92ee08-fe6c-46f8-97a5-0e61877bc397">
<li data-content-chunk-id="b8210634-cbc7-489a-b5a8-3d19e8936d80">A campaign about confronting the inevitability of mortality, whether embodied in undead monsters or expressed through the death of loved ones.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="15fa2e83-553a-428f-a587-f5b23f1d547c">A campaign revolving around an insidious evil, whether dark gods, monstrous races such as the yuan-ti, or creatures of unknown realms far removed from mortal concerns. As heroes confront this evil, they must face the selfish, cold tendencies of their own kind as well.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="c618e5da-d44d-4fdf-935e-e2b6c15957d2">A campaign featuring troubled heroes who confront not only the savagery of the bestial creatures of the world, but also the beast within — the rage and fury that lies in their own hearts.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a4bff55f-38c2-480d-bf9a-f09576c39ee2">A campaign exploring the insatiable thirst for power and domination, whether embodied by the hosts of the Nine Hells or by humanoid rulers bent on conquering the world.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b86de8b9-3e37-4ff7-af62-0fcb4fcbc2e6">With a theme such as “confrontation with mortality,” you can craft a broad range of adventures that aren’t necessarily connected by a common villain. One adventure might feature the dead bursting from their graves and threatening to overwhelm a whole town. In the next adventure, a mad wizard creates a flesh golem in an effort to revive his lost love. A villain could go to extreme lengths to achieve immortality to avoid confronting its own demise. The adventurers might help a ghost accept death and move on, or one of the adventurers might even become a ghost!</p>
<h4 id="VariationsonaTheme" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="58796176-1932-458c-b1ca-96b0ace47d8f"><a href="#VariationsonaTheme" data-content-chunk-id="8dc3897f-9380-45df-ae9e-c55d4e6e423d"></a>Variations on a Theme</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="670d9248-4ede-4851-993a-ffbf51d9235b">Mixing things up once in a while allows your players to enjoy a variety of adventures. Even a tightly themed campaign can stray now and then. If your campaign heavily involves intrigue, mystery, and roleplaying, your players might enjoy the occasional dungeon crawl — especially if the tangent is revealed to relate to a larger plot in the campaign. If most of your adventures are dungeon expeditions, shift gears with a tense urban mystery that eventually leads the party into a dungeon crawl in an abandoned building or tower. If you run horror adventures week after week, try using a villain who turns out to be ordinary, perhaps even silly. Comic relief is a great variation on almost any D&amp;D campaign, though players usually provide it themselves.</p>
<h2 id="TiersofPlay" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="eea8569d-91ef-4942-9661-c381f45a88f9"><a href="#TiersofPlay" data-content-chunk-id="8a5cf085-79e8-4d11-9e93-3c7a72aa0505"></a>Tiers of Play</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d373a54-0811-4700-acf6-b22ea86b09b1">As characters grow in power, their ability to change the world around them grows with them. It helps to think ahead when creating your campaign to account for this change. As the characters make a greater impact on the world, they face greater danger whether they want to or not. Powerful factions see them as a threat and plot against them, while friendly ones court their favor in hopes of striking a useful alliance.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ec8f2ce-fcc7-44c6-aa13-557831c99e40">The tiers of play represent the ideal milestones for introducing new world-shaking events to the campaign. As the characters resolve one event, a new danger arises or the prior trouble transforms into a new threat in response to the characters’ actions. Events need to grow in magnitude and scope, increasing the stakes and drama as the characters become increasingly powerful. This approach also allows you to break your design work down into smaller pieces. Create material such as adventures, NPCs, maps, and so on for one tier at a time. You only need to worry about the details of the next tier as the characters approach it. Even better, as the campaign takes unexpected turns in response to the players’ choices, you don’t have to worry about redoing much work.</p>
<h3 id="Levels14LocalHeroes" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="271c4187-25d0-410e-9dfd-802f7e8f487f"><a href="#Levels14LocalHeroes" data-content-chunk-id="68e18066-ce0a-4889-9383-c55ee7bc10cc"></a>Levels 1-4: Local Heroes</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7a514521-bb09-4a9c-8658-d25931c44c8c">Characters in this tier are still learning the range of class features that define them, including their choice of specialization. But even 1st-level characters are heroes, set apart from the common people by natural characteristics, learned skills, and the hint of a greater destiny that lies before them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fcc945f4-f186-405b-bc38-a69d3dbcd468">At the start of their careers, characters use 1st- and 2nd-level spells and wield mundane gear. The magic items they find include common consumable items (potions and scrolls) and a very few uncommon permanent items. Their magic can have a big impact in a single encounter, but it doesn’t change the course of an adventure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d27fd00-b16b-411d-8123-114b71f77c08">The fate of a village might hang on the success or failure of low-level adventurers, who trust their lives to their fledgling abilities. These characters navigate dangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where they can expect to fight ruthless bandits, ferocious wolves, giant spiders, evil cultists, bloodthirsty ghouls, and hired thugs. If they face even a young dragon, they’re better off avoiding a fight.</p>
<h3 id="Levels510HeroesoftheRealm" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="45f19454-8d75-4bff-b91f-d9b4c839d635"><a href="#Levels510HeroesoftheRealm" data-content-chunk-id="f4cc8167-25ed-43ed-87cb-a77bfab079b6"></a>Levels 5-10: Heroes of the Realm</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="84c383e1-a0d6-41ca-aa0d-6ad0a61a1fa4">By the time they reach this tier, adventurers have mastered the basics of their class features, though they continue to improve throughout these levels. They have found their place in the world and have begun to involve themselves in the dangers that surround them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="422191ef-2853-4e56-8187-da8c8c0a91a1">Dedicated spellcasters learn 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier. Suddenly characters can fly, damage large numbers of foes with <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2102-fireball" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2102-tooltip">fireball</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2167-lightning-bolt" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2167-tooltip">lightning bolt</a> spells, and even breathe underwater. They master 5th-level spells by the end of the tier, and spells such as <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2276-teleportation-circle" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2276-tooltip">teleportation circle</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2239-scrying" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2239-tooltip">scrying</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2107-flame-strike" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2107-tooltip">flame strike</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2163-legend-lore" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2163-tooltip">legend lore</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2224-raise-dead" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2224-tooltip">raise dead</a> can have a significant impact on their adventures. They start acquiring more permanent magic items (uncommon and rare ones) as well, which will serve them for the rest of their careers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="10134b02-0da7-4909-af95-89c38d26388a">The fate of a region might depend on the adventures that characters of levels 5 to 10 undertake. These adventurers venture into fearsome wilds and ancient ruins, where they confront brutal giants, ferocious hydras, fearless golems, evil yuan-ti, scheming devils, bloodthirsty demons, crafty mind flayers, and drow assassins. They might have a chance of defeating a young dragon that has established a lair but not yet extended its reach far into the surrounding territory.</p>
<h3 id="Levels1116MastersoftheRealm" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="bfa0e0aa-c450-4e68-94d6-d08411ad7aba"><a href="#Levels1116MastersoftheRealm" data-content-chunk-id="39543392-6604-4ccb-bede-3357cee2e7c3"></a>Levels 11-16: Masters of the Realm</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5062883d-30cd-44f8-a6d3-e951be2ce764">By 11th level, characters are shining examples of courage and determination — true paragons in the world, set well apart from the masses. At this tier, adventurers are far more versatile than they were at lower levels, and they can usually find the right tool for a given challenge.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0dd0e6e3-6766-441b-a059-4dc88792bc0b">Dedicated spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells at 11th level, including spells that completely change the way adventurers interact with the world. Their big, flashy spells are significant in combat — <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2070-disintegrate" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2070-tooltip">disintegrate</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2015-blade-barrier" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2015-tooltip">blade barrier</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2139-heal" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2139-tooltip">heal</a>, for example — but behind-the-scenes spells such as <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2304-word-of-recall" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2304-tooltip">word of recall</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2099-find-the-path" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2099-tooltip">find the path</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2047-contingency" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2047-tooltip">contingency</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2275-teleport" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2275-tooltip">teleport</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2286-true-seeing" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2286-tooltip">true seeing</a> alter the way players approach their adventures. Each spell level after that point introduces new effects with an equally large impact. The adventurers find rare magic items (and very rare ones) that bestow similarly powerful abilities.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8313667d-8ad4-4608-9b50-634f45925028">The fate of a nation or even the world depends on momentous quests that such characters undertake. Adventurers explore uncharted regions and delve into long-forgotten dungeons, where they confront terrible masterminds of the lower planes, cunning rakshasas and beholders, and hungry purple worms. They might encounter and even defeat a powerful adult dragon that has established a lair and a significant presence in the world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a0714fa-a335-4958-a60c-8c1addb4f215">At this tier, adventurers make their mark on the world in a variety of ways, from the consequences of their adventures to the manner in which they spend their hard-won treasure and exploit their well-deserved reputations. Characters of this level construct fortresses on land deeded them by local rulers. They found guilds, temples, or martial orders. They take on apprentices or students of their own. They broker peace between nations or lead them into war. And their formidable reputations attract the attention of very powerful foes.</p>
<h3 id="Levels1720MastersoftheWorld" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="ee52288d-0933-4284-a18c-d4e39f94d149"><a href="#Levels1720MastersoftheWorld" data-content-chunk-id="649a3fd3-d292-4fed-946f-f90dc06f0383"></a>Levels 17-20: Masters of the World</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ebab1481-c59f-4a53-b314-0467e8436c35">By 17th level, characters have superheroic capabilities, and their deeds and adventures are the stuff of legend. Ordinary people can hardly dream of such heights of power — or such terrible dangers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6c88a872-b6b7-487a-9ea1-ead7bc1b0837">Dedicated spellcasters at this tier wield earthshaking 9th-level spells such as <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2303-wish" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2303-tooltip">wish</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2119-gate" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2119-tooltip">gate</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2268-storm-of-vengeance" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2268-tooltip">storm of vengeance</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2006-astral-projection" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2006-tooltip">astral projection</a>. Characters have several rare and very rare magic items at their disposal, and begin discovering legendary items such as a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5397-vorpal-sword" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5397-tooltip">vorpal sword</a> or a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4767-staff-of-the-magi" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4767-tooltip">staff of the magi</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db3c5602-b2bb-431c-b77c-ebb174793c4b">Adventures at these levels have far-reaching consequences, possibly determining the fate of millions in the Material Plane and even places beyond. Characters traverse otherworldly realms and explore demiplanes and other extraplanar locales, where they fight savage balor demons, titans, archdevils, lich archmages, and even avatars of the gods themselves. The dragons they encounter are wyrms of tremendous power, whose sleep troubles kingdoms and whose waking threatens existence itself.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eebde8a0-3c57-425b-8016-8384c6b2365c">Characters who reach 20th level have attained the pinnacle of mortal achievement. Their deeds are recorded in the annals of history and recounted by bards for centuries. Their ultimate destinies come to pass. A cleric might be taken up into the heavens to serve as a god’s right hand. A warlock could become a patron to other warlocks. Perhaps a wizard unlocks the secret to immortality (or undeath) and spends eons exploring the farthest reaches of the multiverse. A druid might become one with the land, transforming into a nature spirit of a particular place or an aspect of the wild. Other characters could found clans or dynasties that revere the memory of their honored ancestors from generation to generation, create masterpieces of epic literature that are sung and retold for thousands of years, or establish guilds or orders that keep the adventurers’ principles and dreams alive.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d4b22c82-2903-4c99-bdfa-ed1e1c1da213">Reaching this point doesn’t necessarily dictate the end of the campaign. These powerful characters might be called on to undertake grand adventures on the cosmic stage. And as a result of these adventures, their capabilities can continue to evolve. Characters gain no more levels at this point, but they can still advance in meaningful ways and continue performing epic deeds that resound throughout the multiverse. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#EpicBoons" data-content-chunk-id="e2d0661e-8c17-47ae-ad0f-f01f30d481f3">Chapter 7</a> details epic boons you can use as rewards for these characters to maintain a sense of progress.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b4cc118e-cb87-4794-84c0-a02a5eff28a0">Experienced players familiar with the capabilities of the character classes and impatient for more significant adventures might welcome the idea of starting a campaign with characters above 1st level. Creating a higher-level character uses the same character creation steps outlined in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="b1bd4938-5713-4c5f-a63e-7bd8ac461936">Player’s Handbook</a>. Such a character has more hit points, class features, and spells, and probably starts with better equipment.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ecc91253-800c-4d4c-a28c-e152372ce4f5">Starting equipment for characters above 1st level is entirely at your discretion, since you give out treasure at your own pace. That said, you can use the Starting Equipment table as a guide.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ca1ecc25-54b4-426c-a2ba-5e86f12ee972">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a fantasy game, but that broad category encompasses a lot of variety. Many different flavors of fantasy exist in fiction and film. Do you want a horrific campaign inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith? Or do you envision a world of muscled barbarians and nimble thieves, along the lines of the classic sword-and-sorcery books by Robert E. Howard and Fritz Leiber? Your choice can have a impact on the flavor of your campaign.</p>
<h3 id="HeroicFantasy" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="06aba437-acac-4754-b698-f43744cfe3ee"><a href="#HeroicFantasy" data-content-chunk-id="59f15a32-7323-44de-a529-09f4c48b7bf5"></a>Heroic Fantasy</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9c477222-ecd9-4799-bcd5-3a682447c139">Heroic fantasy is the baseline assumed by the D&amp;D rules. The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="dc64012a-3675-4eeb-bfe4-ce4295c14697">Player’s Handbook</a> describes this baseline: a multitude of humanoid races coexist with humans in fantastic worlds. Adventurers bring magical powers to bear against the monstrous threats they face. These characters typically come from ordinary backgrounds, but something impels them into an adventuring life. The adventurers are the “heroes” of the campaign, but they might not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for selfish reasons. Technology and society are based on medieval norms, though the culture isn’t necessarily European. Campaigns often revolve around delving into ancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort to destroy monsters or villains.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2592c2f6-a742-4df6-ad66-f1f3d8a90901">This genre is also common in fantasy fiction. Most novels set in the Forgotten Realms are best described as heroic fantasy, following in the footsteps of many of the authors listed in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/appendix-e-inspirational-reading" data-content-chunk-id="4fb3dab2-c15a-46f1-b4fc-f5fd661a455a">Appendices</a> of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="59105fcb-780f-4a26-988b-37862cb8bb89">Player’s Handbook</a>.</p>

<h3 id="SwordandSorcery" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="dc5e354c-b198-43ca-a974-6a868f0141e0"><a href="#SwordandSorcery" data-content-chunk-id="823f9bf4-88a8-448b-bc55-781a3d4e78e3"></a>Sword and Sorcery</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a6ca877f-8562-4512-babf-707cb0268050">A grim, hulking fighter disembowels the high priest of the serpent god on his own altar. A laughing rogue spends ill-gotten gains on cheap wine in filthy taverns. Hardy adventurers venture into the unexplored jungle in search of the fabled City of Golden Masks.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7a81038d-a832-47d3-851e-1e766f339f61">A sword-and-sorcery campaign emulates some of the classic works of fantasy fiction, a tradition that goes back to the roots of the game. Here you’ll find a dark, gritty world of evil sorcerers and decadent cities, where the protagonists are motivated more by greed and self-interest than by altruistic virtue. Fighter, rogue, and barbarian characters tend to be far more common than wizards, clerics, or paladins. In such a pulp fantasy setting, those who wield magic often symbolize the decadence and corruption of civilization, and wizards are the classic villains of these settings. Magic items are therefore rare and often dangerous.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a2065f2-5ca9-42fe-a3e4-6eac7f6efe82">Certain Dungeons &amp; Dragons novels follow in the footsteps of classic sword-and-sorcery novels. The world of Athas (as featured in numerous Dark Sun novels and game products), with its heroic gladiators and tyrannical sorcerer-kings, belongs squarely in this genre.</p>
<h3 id="EpicFantasy" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="056d5986-494d-4fc6-ad28-847b37127364"><a href="#EpicFantasy" data-content-chunk-id="d1e5c8a3-0c25-4b6c-92e5-e90fd07c0d75"></a>Epic Fantasy</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8a3cd504-d09a-49b9-8e83-610d97aee028">A devout paladin in gleaming plate armor braces her lance as she charges a dragon. Bidding farewell to his dear love, a noble wizard sets forth on a quest to close the gate to the Nine Hells that has opened in the remote wilderness. A close-knit band of loyal friends strives to overcome the forces of a tyrannical overlord.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="09afb075-99d5-425f-9742-0e2c457029a4">An epic-fantasy campaign emphasizes the conflict between good and evil as a prominent element of the game, with the adventurers more or less squarely on the side of good. These characters are heroes in the best sense, driven by a higher purpose than selfish gain or ambition, and facing incredible dangers without blinking. Characters might struggle with moral quandaries, fighting the evil tendencies within themselves as well as the evil that threatens the world. And the stories of these campaigns often include an element of romance: tragic affairs between star-crossed lovers, passion that transcends even death, and chaste adoration between devout knights and the monarchs and nobles they serve.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cfe638b8-a93b-4f55-b4aa-a0163705b485">The novels of the Dragonlance saga exemplify the tradition of epic fantasy in D&amp;D.</p>
<h3 id="MythicFantasy" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="08aef6bd-79a9-429a-bfc4-fa07a7c90225"><a href="#MythicFantasy" data-content-chunk-id="07cae6fc-5c4c-496b-82d9-4d7e1d0ec150"></a>Mythic Fantasy</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9f5bb281-9dc6-4bb9-bbf3-9443a2373c9f">While an angry god tries time and again to destroy him, a clever rogue makes the long journey home from war. Braving the terrifying guardians of the underworld, a noble warrior ventures into the darkness to retrieve the soul of her lost love. Calling on their divine parentage, a group of demigods undertake twelve labors to win the gods’ blessings for other mortals.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3d335b70-f3b7-454d-acf1-5ca211ddfd17">A mythic-fantasy campaign draws on the themes and stories of ancient myth and legend, from Gilgamesh to Cú Chulainn. Adventurers attempt mighty feats of legend, aided or hindered by the gods or their agents — and they might have divine blood themselves. The monsters and villains they face probably have a similar origin. The minotaur in the dungeon isn’t just another bull-headed humanoid, but <em>the</em> Minotaur — misbegotten offspring of a philandering god. Adventures might lead the heroes through a series of trials to the realms of the gods in search of a gift or favor.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a69e8b34-73e5-47f7-9d30-ddf55c072057">Such a campaign can draw on the myths and legends of any culture, not just the familiar Greek tales.</p>
<h3 id="DarkFantasy" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="23d5df3e-c8cc-4c37-8589-f74991d39580"><a href="#DarkFantasy" data-content-chunk-id="2c81e638-da2d-4859-991e-dc2855149c5f"></a>Dark Fantasy</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5bc6d455-58cd-4574-a25c-28c28682e66e">Vampires brood on the battlements of their accursed castles. Necromancers toil in dark dungeons to create horrid servants made of dead flesh. Devils corrupt the innocent, and werewolves prowl the night. All of these elements evoke horrific aspects of the fantasy genre.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0da5c852-9e8f-4784-8889-92dbdb872b22">If you want to put a horror spin on your campaign, you have plenty of material to work with. The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="925f7ba2-f27b-4421-9a4b-6a3c07ed5c8f">Monster Manual</a> is full of creatures that perfectly suit a storyline of supernatural horror. The most important element of such a campaign, though, isn’t covered by the rules. A dark-fantasy setting requires an atmosphere of building dread, created through careful pacing and evocative description. Your players contribute too; they have to be willing to embrace the mood you’re trying to evoke. Whether you want to run a full-fledged dark-fantasy campaign or a single creepy adventure, you should discuss your plans with the players ahead of time to make sure they’re on board. Horror can be intense and personal, and not everyone is comfortable with such a game.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8fd4e9cc-84f0-469c-a9c5-9e3822c2730b">Novels and game products set in Ravenloft, the Demiplane of Dread, explore dark-fantasy elements in a D&amp;D context.</p>
<h3 id="Intrigue" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="68542529-a198-4184-ae95-0d20cc6a5ddc"><a href="#Intrigue" data-content-chunk-id="e131b679-bfc6-473b-a4df-9732ec8f3988"></a>Intrigue</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a8657400-ffa0-4f4e-9ec6-52c0643c6feb">The corrupt vizier schemes with the baron’s oldest daughter to assassinate the baron. A hobgoblin army sends doppelganger spies to infiltrate the city before the invasion. At the embassy ball, the spy in the royal court makes contact with his employer.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e0d11525-86bc-4d46-8655-b5e7a7e23df6">Political intrigue, espionage, sabotage, and similar cloak-and-dagger activities can provide the basis for an exciting D&amp;D campaign. In this kind of game, the characters might care more about skill training and making contacts than about attack spells and magic weapons. Roleplaying and social interaction take on greater importance than combat, and the party might go for several sessions without seeing a monster.</p>
<figure class="compendium-image compendium-image-left" id="Figure12">
<a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-center" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/813/c1-12.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title=""><img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/813/300/200/c1-12.png" alt="" class="ddb-lightbox-inner"></a>
</figure>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e9ea29e8-ca08-405c-a277-e90a85d8fe1f">Again, make sure your players know ahead of time that you want to run this kind of campaign. Otherwise, a player might create a defense-focused dwarf paladin, only to find he is out of place among elf diplomats and tiefling spies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d705e4d3-4a3f-41f3-abed-b8c3491d618e">The Brimstone Angels novels by Erin M. Evans focus on intrigue in the Forgotten Realms setting, from the backstabbing politics of the Nine Hells to the contested succession of Cormyrean royalty.</p>
<h3 id="Mystery" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c34b937c-bcb0-43a4-81f3-40d57ead3fd8"><a href="#Mystery" data-content-chunk-id="74faef82-b913-48cf-9507-e4633380ce8e"></a>Mystery</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7238b5b9-03f1-4f7f-aa93-6c449208bf51">Who stole three legendary magic weapons and hid them away in a remote dungeon, leaving a cryptic clue to their location? Who placed the duke into a magical slumber, and what can be done to awaken him? Who murdered the guildmaster, and how did the killer get into the guild’s locked vault?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6f7a67cc-0e66-420a-b2cb-ccdca92bc82d">A mystery-themed campaign puts the characters in the role of investigators, perhaps traveling from town to town to crack tough cases the local authorities can’t handle. Such a campaign emphasizes puzzles and problem-solving in addition to combat prowess.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7e3cc684-1e49-4086-9ddf-d99f34860f8d">A larger mystery might even set the stage for the whole campaign. Why did someone kill the characters’ mentor, setting them on the path of adventure? Who really controls the Cult of the Red Hand? In this case, the characters might uncover clues to the greater mystery only once in a while; individual adventures might be at best tangentially related to that theme. A diet of nothing but puzzles can become frustrating, so be sure to mix up the kinds of encounters you present.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3002576b-71ab-4e16-90fb-32f6d3fd4a6a">Novels in various D&amp;D settings have explored the mystery genre with a fantasy twist. In particular, <em>Murder in Cormyr</em> (by Chet Williamson), <em>Murder in Halruaa</em> (by Richard S. Meyers), and <em>Spellstorm</em> (by Ed Greenwood) are mysteries set in the Forgotten Realms. <em>Murder in Tarsis</em> (by John Maddox Roberts) takes the same approach in the Dragonlance setting.</p>
<h3 id="Swashbuckling" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="4a2d3e18-cb97-480c-83e5-b1816e7be27a"><a href="#Swashbuckling" data-content-chunk-id="39049a89-c136-44b8-b729-f14084786c09"></a>Swashbuckling</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd7ffc47-41e2-4579-bb7c-68e905223211">Rapier-wielding sailors fight off boarding sahuagin. Ghouls lurk in derelict ships, waiting to devour treasure hunters. Dashing rogues and charming paladins weave their way through palace intrigues and leap from balconies onto waiting horses below.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="196a3974-3e5e-4a48-8635-e1cd89ff70da">The swashbuckling adventures of pirates and musketeers suggest opportunities for a dynamic campaign. The characters typically spend more time in cities, royal courts, and seafaring vessels than in dungeon delves, making interaction skills important (though not to the extent of a pure intrigue campaign). Nevertheless, the heroes might end up in classic dungeon situations, such as searching storm sewers beneath the palace to find the evil duke’s hidden chambers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b399f914-9e99-4baa-af4e-061e61502f1a">A good example of a swashbuckling rogue in the Forgotten Realms is Jack Ravenwild, who appears in novels by Richard Baker (<em>City of Ravens</em> and <em>Prince of Ravens</em>).</p>
<h3 id="War" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="faed1a04-eb42-400a-a4a3-d0684b4077e0"><a href="#War" data-content-chunk-id="15e69540-d7fe-43cf-9790-eb6a389219f5"></a>War</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3e8f1ff1-a13a-4eea-a9b6-4cd8ccb75b0f">A hobgoblin army marches toward the city, leading elephants and giants to batter down the stronghold’s walls and ramparts. Dragons wheel above an invading horde, scattering enemies as the raging warriors cut a swath through field and forest. Salamanders muster at an efreeti’s command, poised to assault an astral fortress.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a4b4218f-a2a8-4d8e-a399-818a436158ad">Warfare in a fantasy world is rife with opportunities for adventure. A war campaign isn’t generally concerned with the specifics of troop movements, but instead focuses on the heroes whose actions turn the tide of battle. The characters carry out specific missions: capture a magical standard that empowers undead armies, gather reinforcements to break a siege, or cut through the enemy’s flank to reach a demonic commander. In other situations, the party supports the larger army by holding a strategic location until reinforcements arrive, killing enemy scouts before they can report, or cutting off supply lines. Information gathering and diplomatic missions can supplement the more combat-oriented adventures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b1940841-9f1f-4e86-8e5b-6a5a095d900f">The War of the Lance in the Dragonlance Chronicles novels and the War of the Spider Queen in the novel series of the same name are prominent examples of wars in D&amp;D novels.</p>
<h3 id="Wuxia" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="936eb39e-c80f-41c4-971f-e1053a70e7ba"><a href="#Wuxia" data-content-chunk-id="c20b2940-1b60-48ff-82d6-523dc68c0413"></a>Wuxia</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="76a40c8f-4d65-4334-a2b9-7047685537d8">When a sensei disappears mysteriously, her young students must take her place and hunt down the oni terrorizing their village. Accomplished heroes, masters of their respective martial arts, return home to free their village from an evil hobgoblin warlord. The rakshasa master of a nearby monastery performs rituals to raise troubled ghosts from their rest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91de1eb0-df8c-43b5-beb5-63c7a85d223b">A campaign that draws on elements of Asian martial-arts movies is a perfect match for D&amp;D. Players can define the appearance of their characters and gear however they like for the campaign, and spells need only minor flavor changes so that they better reflect such a setting. For example, when the characters use spells or special abilities that teleport them short distances, they actually make high-flying acrobatic leaps. Ability checks to climb don’t involve careful searching for holds but let characters bounce up walls or from tree to tree. Warriors stun their opponents by striking pressure points. Flavorful descriptions of actions in the game don’t change the nuts and bolts of the rules, but they make all the difference in the feel of a campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2300c901-cde3-4959-a94b-3ada4d11a491">Similarly, a class doesn’t need new rules to reflect a cultural influence; a new name can do the trick. A traditional Chinese wuxia hero might be a paladin who has a sword called the Oath of Vengeance, while a Japanese samurai might be a paladin with a particular Oath of Devotion (<em>bushido</em>) that includes fealty to a lord (<em>daimyo</em>) among its tenets. A ninja is a monk who pursues the Way of Shadow. Whether called a wu jen, a tsukai, or a swami, a wizard, sorcerer, or warlock character works just fine in a game inspired by medieval Asian cultures.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="23d4bc55-8596-433c-8403-89858e976103">Having players refer to a <em>tetsubo</em> or a <em>katana</em> rather than a greatclub or a longsword can enhance the flavor of a wuxia campaign.

<p data-content-chunk-id="c1bd887f-9bbf-4cb7-8b56-69189bd993c6">The renowned paladin Murlynd, from the world of Oerth (as featured in Greyhawk novels and game products), dresses in the traditional garb of Earth’s Old West and wears a pair of six-shooters strapped to his waist. The Mace of St. Cuthbert, a holy weapon belonging to Greyhawk’s god of justice, found its way to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1985. Somewhere in the Barrier Peaks of Oerth, the wreckage of a spacefaring vessel is said to lie, with bizarre alien lifeforms and strange items of technology on board. And the famous wizard Elminster of the Forgotten Realms has been said to make occasional appearances in the kitchen of Canadian writer Ed Greenwood — where he is sometimes joined by wizards from the worlds of Oerth and Krynn (homeworld of the Dragonlance saga).</p>

It’s okay to send your characters hurtling through a magic mirror to Lewis Carroll’s Wonderland, put them aboard a ship traveling between the stars, or set your campaign in a far-future world where laser blasters and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2176-magic-missile" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2176-tooltip">magic missiles</a> exist side by side.

<p data-content-chunk-id="fcafad56-407f-4158-92b3-24d664c9669e">The various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but dimensions formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5fa69189-e69e-425c-817b-0720d77f2ddb">The Outer Planes are realms of spirituality and thought. They are the spheres where celestials, fiends, and deities exist. The plane of Elysium, for example, isn’t merely a place where good creatures dwell, and not even simply the place where spirits of good creatures go when they die. It is the plane of goodness, a spiritual realm where evil can’t flourish. It is as much a state of being and of mind as it is a physical location.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9a68630b-ca46-4d17-a754-0b6dff20cd78">The Inner Planes exemplify the physical essence and elemental nature of air, earth, fire, and water. The Elemental Plane of Fire, for example, embodies the essence of fire. The plane’s entire substance is suffused with the fundamental nature of fire: energy, passion, transformation, and destruction. Even objects of solid brass or basalt seem to dance with flame, in a visible and palpable manifestation of the vibrancy of fire’s dominion.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0ddf6d5a-bf9e-47fe-b414-833cb16791f9">In this context, the Material Plane is the nexus where all these philosophical and elemental forces collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and matter. The worlds of D&amp;D exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="PlanarCategories" data-content-chunk-id="b1d8a145-b2ba-4aa4-aab0-a7364bcf7757"><a href="#PlanarCategories" data-content-chunk-id="e5f8d679-28f8-4b39-9a7b-d85f2a208c5e"></a>Planar Categories</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8cb33a0b-b33b-4756-a368-06f4e53bb2ae">The planes of the default D&amp;D cosmology are grouped in the following categories:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d1ec3779-69d9-4a69-9a3d-ba601e951d31"><strong>The Material Plane and Its Echoes.</strong> The Feywild and the Shadowfell are reflections of the Material Plane.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b6ba8df7-f5bf-4c56-8590-79234c640089"><strong>The Transitive Planes.</strong> The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are mostly featureless planes that serve primarily as pathways to travel from one plane to another.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b06e8595-4965-4e8c-adbf-2a38049c4530"><strong>The Inner Planes.</strong> The four Elemental Planes (Air, Earth, Fire, and Water), plus the Elemental Chaos that surrounds them, are the Inner Planes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="771f6b36-446a-4342-8070-73294725bd52"><strong>The Outer Planes.</strong> Sixteen Outer Planes correspond to the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of philosophical difference between them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9cc11e71-0f03-4431-8895-c0af7a2035f2"><strong>The Positive and Negative Planes.</strong> These two planes enfold the rest of the cosmology, providing the raw forces of life and death that underlie the rest of existence in the multiverse.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="90720d2f-83e3-4166-9bd5-588a86f76fa0">As described in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="139b31b4-36c8-4b14-892a-c95c54338dc1">Player’s Handbook</a>, the assumed D&amp;D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes. For your campaign, you decide what planes to include, inspired by the standard planes, drawn from Earth’s myths, or created by your own imagination.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8bbb5b7f-0936-4605-bfc0-e3714bd3fa70">At minimum, most D&amp;D campaigns require these elements:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="3b9d198b-411c-4231-8ee6-a22f5f46807d">
<li data-content-chunk-id="7e3d3318-8832-48f3-9861-80a1e80c3269">A plane of origin for fiends</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="fd0baac6-630c-48e2-bd57-918f796b01b2">A plane of origin for celestials</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="357bce6d-7718-4434-922f-b9f3c1accff9">A plane of origin for elementals</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="8f075671-fd7d-44d7-a5f2-e9ab78607f10">A place for deities, which might include any or all of the previous three</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="bfcdc585-0add-4196-b118-c7b3ae5aee4f">The place where mortal spirits go after death, which might include any or all of the first three</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="648e94a5-5381-43ac-a7cb-1c27eaddacd0">A way of getting from one plane to another</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="bed0b5b3-1a1f-44fb-9836-45d4f9e29670">A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane to function</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="165a1c63-5c1d-493d-afc0-a98711543505">Once you’ve decided on the planes you want to use in your campaign, putting them into a coherent cosmology is an optional step. Since the primary way of traveling from plane to plane, even using the Transitive Planes, is through magical portals that link planes together, the exact relationship of different planes to one another is largely a theoretical concern. No being in the multiverse can look down and see the planes in their arrangement the same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No mortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched between Bytopia and Arcadia, but it’s a convenient theoretical construct based on the philosophical shading among the three planes and the relative importance they give to law and good.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b555312a-cd2e-4f51-a598-69d392d512a9">Sages have constructed a few such theoretical models to make sense of the jumble of planes, particularly the Outer Planes. The three most common are the Great Wheel, the World Tree, and the World Axis, but you can create or adapt whatever model works best for the planes you want to use in your game.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="TheGreatWheel" data-content-chunk-id="6474fa7a-5ba6-46ea-a38f-6297c2cd577f"><a href="#TheGreatWheel" data-content-chunk-id="337fef4f-d08c-449e-ae9a-e486a7adb352"></a>The Great Wheel</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="09fff66a-0d96-4666-9dcc-9bec6450280b">The default cosmological arrangement presented in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="733c7d30-dcd2-425a-a32e-5d38e5d9f2b3">Player’s Handbook</a> visualizes the planes as a group of concentric wheels, with the Material Plane and its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form a wheel around the Material Plane, enveloped in the Ethereal Plane. Then the Outer Planes form another wheel around and behind (or above or below) that one, arranged according to alignment, with the Outlands linking them all.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="19349a04-31f0-410c-83ea-30b8e1292c21">This arrangement makes sense of the way the River Styx flows among the Lower Planes, connecting Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a string. But it’s not the only possible explanation of the river’s course.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="TheWorldTree" data-content-chunk-id="9a0cdc99-a7a8-4a19-997e-cf0beeed0c7d"><a href="#TheWorldTree" data-content-chunk-id="19eddccc-fd6d-4cdc-b7dc-c21540ba04e0"></a>The World Tree</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9997d728-768c-40c1-b04f-36dc589f2072">A different arrangement of planes envisions them situated among the roots and branches of a great cosmic tree, literally or figuratively.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c50d369d-682b-4954-9491-0a96b05cc91e">For example, the Norse cosmology centers on the World Tree Yggdrasil. The three roots of the World Tree touch the three realms: Asgard (an Outer Plane that includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other regions), Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim (the underworld). The Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, is a unique transitive plane that connects Asgard and Midgard.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="157eb46e-ffa0-493f-b586-355c39c1673a">Similarly, one vision of the planes where the deities of the Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of celestial planes in the branches of a World Tree, while the fiendish planes are linked by a River of Blood. Neutral planes stand apart from them. Each of these planes is primarily the domain of one or more deities, though they are also the homes of celestial and fiendish creatures.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="TheWorldAxis" data-content-chunk-id="10073045-8b1f-4bbf-94fe-2bbc5fcd426a"><a href="#TheWorldAxis" data-content-chunk-id="c5aa16b2-897a-4d61-9adc-ee5797f4566a"></a>The World Axis</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9ff58fb2-73e5-4a33-bc57-0c45be57f79c">In this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its echoes stand between two opposing realms. The Astral Plane (or Astral Sea) floats above them, holding any number of divine domains (the Outer Planes). Below the Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single, undifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements clash together. At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is the Abyss, like a hole torn in the fabric of the cosmos.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="OtherVisions" data-content-chunk-id="26b5c336-8402-4099-b161-b1672fbe5f27"><a href="#OtherVisions" data-content-chunk-id="db49cb2a-a182-4d00-8600-3f96f41279f2"></a>Other Visions</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91a8964c-d45e-4e92-8686-2a518c35d89a">As you build your own cosmology, consider the following alternatives.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3aafc46f-3967-4798-9e77-07416bfa6d7c"><strong><em>The Omniverse.</em></strong> This simple cosmology covers the bare minimum: a Material Plane; the Transitive Planes; a single Elemental Chaos; an Overheaven, where good-aligned deities and celestials live; and the Underworld, where evil deities and fiends live.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="48da52ba-0005-4919-abaf-f10034edf2a6"><strong><em>Myriad Planes.</em></strong> In this cosmology, countless planes clump together like soap bubbles, intersecting with each other more or less at random.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="802dc6e5-ba00-4087-a643-0fa081dec5d1"><strong><em>The Orrery.</em></strong> All the Inner and Outer Planes orbit the Material Plane, exerting greater or lesser influence on the world as they come nearer and farther. The world of Eberron uses this cosmological model.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="88600512-114a-4901-9788-9413f9cb1254"><strong><em>The Winding Road.</em></strong> In this cosmology, every plane is a stop along an infinite road. Each plane is adjacent to two others, but there’s no necessary cohesion between adjacent planes; a traveler can walk from the slopes of Mount Celestia onto the slopes of Gehenna.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="997f7f77-9c12-4664-9cfe-08d28c5ae98e"><strong><em>Mount Olympus.</em></strong> In the Greek cosmology, Mount Olympus stands at the center of the world (the Material Plane), with its peak so high that it’s actually another plane of existence: Olympus, the home of the gods. All the Greek gods except Hades have their own domains within Olympus. In Hades, named for its ruler, mortal souls linger as insubstantial shades until they eventually fade into nothing. Tartarus, where the titans are imprisoned in endless darkness, lies below Hades. And far to the west of the known world in the Material Plane are the blessed Elysian Fields. The souls of great heroes reside there.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3b17dad6-9e5b-4a93-a17d-74ede0f468ec"><strong><em>Solar Barge.</em></strong> The Egyptian cosmology is defined by the daily path of the sun — across the sky of the Material Plane, down to the fair Offering Fields in the west, where the souls of the righteous live in eternal reward, and then beneath the world through the nightmarish Twelve Hours of Night. The Solar Barge is a tiny Outer Plane in its own right, though it exists within the Astral Plane and the other Outer Planes in the different stages of its journey.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e524abe-589e-4d9c-9ce0-5d2ddf235a9a"><strong><em>One World.</em></strong> In this model, there are no other planes of existence, but the Material Plane includes places like the bottomless Abyss, the shining Mount Celestia, the strange city of Mechanus, the fortress of Acheron, and so on. All the planes are locations in the world, reachable by ordinary means of travel — though extraordinary effort is required, for example, to sail across the sea to the blessed isles of Elysium.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a32d6cd0-4d6b-424e-8117-14b0d37274b6"><strong><em>The Otherworld.</em></strong> In this model, the Material Plane has a twin realm that fills the role of all the other planes. Much like the Feywild, it overlays the Material Plane and can be reached through “thin places” where the worlds are particularly close: through caves, by sailing far across the sea, or in fairy rings in remote forests. It has dark, evil regions (homes of fiends and evil gods), sacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits of the blessed death), and realms of elemental fury. This otherworld is sometimes overseen by an eternal city, or by four cities that each represent a different aspect of reality. The Celtic cosmology has an otherworld, called Tír na nÓg, and the cosmologies of some religions inspired by Asian myth have a similar Spirit World.</p>

Each of the five dragon heads surrounding and guarding the Portal must be propitiated with the correct phrase. Each must be spoken to in the proper order. But, once that was done and the White-Robed Cleric had exhorted Paladine to intercede and hold the Portal open, they would enter. It would close behind them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="adb70422-2512-4975-9553-4b31583eb397">“Portal” is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals function like doorways, appearing as a clear window or a fog-shrouded passage, and interplanar travel is as simple as stepping through the doorway. Other portals are locations — circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns — that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another. Some are vortices, joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1ce1a90f-3b6f-44f0-a591-632b56d7e5e2">Passing through a planar portal can be the simplest way to travel from the Material Plane to a desired location on another plane. Most of the time, though, a portal presents an adventure in itself.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e0954ef3-c222-44a3-b2f5-43440c8bb077">First, the adventurers must find a portal that leads where they want to go. Most portals exist in distant locations, and a portal’s location often has thematic similarities to the plane it leads to. For example, a portal to the heavenly mountain of Celestia might be located on a mountain peak.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ca674804-777e-4d82-84ee-4b46b161f2a0">Second, portals often have guardians charged with ensuring that undesirable people don’t pass through. Depending on the portal’s destination, “undesirable people” might include evil characters, good characters, cowards, thieves, anyone wearing a robe, or any mortal creature. A portal’s guardian is typically a powerful magical creature, such as a genie, sphinx, titan, or native of the portal’s destination plane.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="609c533c-fab0-43bf-b16f-0cbddf2d659f">Finally, most portals don’t stand open all the time, but open only in particular situations or when a certain requirement is met. A portal can have any conceivable requirement, but the following are the most common:</p>
<figure class="compendium-image compendium-image-right" id="Figure">
<a class="ddb-lightbox-outer compendium-image-center" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/0/814/c2-02.png" data-lightbox="1" data-title=""><img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/thumbnails/0/814/325/431/c2-02.png" alt="" class="ddb-lightbox-inner"></a>
</figure>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dcd5eca8-91d7-4157-baa6-9da9d3003df9"><strong>Time.</strong> The portal functions only at particular times: during a full moon on the Material Plane, or every ten days, or when the stars are in a particular position. Once it opens, such a portal remains open for a limited time, such as for three days following the full moon, or for an hour, or for 1d4 + 1 rounds.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fe4e63c7-2315-480b-a083-d2db4e17be75"><strong>Situation.</strong> The portal functions only if a particular condition is met. A situation-keyed portal opens on a clear night, or when it rains, or when a certain spell is cast in its vicinity.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aa951766-43ed-49d8-a696-8e4006217a90"><strong>Random.</strong> A random portal functions for a random period, then shuts down for a similarly random duration. Typically, such a portal allows 1d6 + 6 travelers to pass through, then shuts down for 1d6 days.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2d1f9518-ab4d-4d11-bd53-73a141f99c91"><strong>Command Word.</strong> The portal functions only if a particular command word is spoken. Sometimes the word must be spoken as a character passes through the portal (which is otherwise a mundane doorway, window, or similar opening). Other portals open when the command word is spoken and remain open for a short time.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1881b8e3-0bed-4fb4-861d-59a723c9caff"><strong>Key.</strong> The portal functions if the traveler is holding a particular object; the item acts much like a key to a door. This key item can be a common object or a particular key created for that portal. The city of Sigil above the Outlands is known as the City of Doors because it features an overwhelming number of such item-keyed portals.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ff28cb33-9b2a-4133-86e6-5e4af31a627c">Learning and meeting a portal’s requirements can draw characters into further adventures as they chase down a key item, scour old libraries for command words, or consult sages to find the right time to visit the portal.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ddcac18e-3374-46ab-b3f4-714ae1053ea1">Sarya raised her hands and began to declaim the words of a very powerful spell, one of the most dangerous she knew, a spell designed to breach the barriers between the planes and create a magical bridge into another realm of existence. The mythal thrummed in response, the intangible pulse of the old device taking on a new and different note. Sarya ignored the mythal stone’s change and pressed on, finishing her gate spell with skill and confidence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7700f5b1-0e99-4669-b17c-cfa25b5c28fd">“The gate is open!” she cried. “Malkizid, come forth!”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="20aa018a-5ca2-4f1c-988b-8d8b06116748">Before Sarya a great ring or hoop of golden magic coalesced from the air. Through it she glimpsed the realm of Malkizid, an infernal wasteland of parched desert, windswept rifts, and black, angry skies torn by crimson lightning. Then, through the gate, the archdevil Malkizid appeared. With one smooth step he crossed from his infernal plane into the mythal chamber.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="56fdc510-ca24-41f0-9044-bf90b894fdf1">A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2206-plane-shift" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2206-tooltip">Plane shift</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2119-gate" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2119-tooltip">gate</a> can directly transport adventurers to any other plane, with different degrees of precision. <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2087-etherealness" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2087-tooltip">Etherealness</a> allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2006-astral-projection" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2006-tooltip">astral projection</a> spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and from there travel to the Outer Planes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1dda9e58-2bc1-48ed-bb8b-14e58440f9b0"><strong><em>Plane Shift.</em></strong> The <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2206-plane-shift" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2206-tooltip">plane shift</a> spell has two important limitations. The first is the material component: a small, forked, metal rod (like a tuning fork) attuned to the desired planar destination. The spell requires the proper resonating frequency to home in on the correct location, and the fork must be made of the right material (sometimes a complex alloy) to focus the spell’s magic properly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250 gp), but even the act of researching the correct specifications can lead to adventure. After all, not many people voluntarily travel into the depths of Carceri, so very few know what kind of tuning fork is required to get there.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a1b5c4e0-b3e4-40eb-8418-aca45820d377">Second, the spell doesn’t send the caster to a specific location unless he or she has specialized information. The sigil sequence of a teleportation circle located on another plane allows the caster to travel directly to that circle, but such knowledge is even harder to come by than the specifications of the required tuning fork. Otherwise, the spell transports the caster to a location in the general vicinity of the desired spot. Wherever the adventurers arrive, they’ll most likely still need to undertake a journey to reach the object of a planar quest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cbff4c66-2a1d-47a9-add8-ce754cf59394"><strong><em>Gate.</em></strong> The <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2119-gate" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2119-tooltip">gate</a> spell opens a portal linked to a specific point on another plane of existence. The spell provides a shortcut to a planar destination, bypassing many of the guardians and trials that would normally fill such a journey. But this 9th-level spell is out of reach for all but the most powerful characters, and it does nothing to negate any obstacles that wait at the destination.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d2705242-89c5-4ef1-9bc5-029100f1e8f0">The <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2119-gate" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2119-tooltip">gate</a> spell is powerful, but not infallible.

Soft gray clouds moved slowly in the distance, while strange dark streaks twisted violently through the sky, anchored in ends so distant she couldn’t perceive them, their middle parts revolving angrily like pieces of string rolled between a child’s fingertips. She glanced down, wondering what supported her, and saw nothing but more of the strange pearly sky beneath her feet and all around her.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c5470270-c478-4ab5-a783-3832cd2ebfa4">She drew in a sudden breath, surprised by the sight, and felt her lungs fill with something sweeter and perhaps a little more solid than air, but instead of gagging or drowning on the stuff she seemed perfectly acclimated to it. An electric thrill raced through her limbs as she found herself mesmerized by the simple act of respiration.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f5f7af41-bb48-4efe-bbf4-6f91e08384df">The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the Outer Planes. It is a great silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most of the Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors occasionally stumble upon the petrified corpse of a dead god or other chunks of rock drifting forever in the silvery void. Much more commonplace are color pools — magical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant, spinning coins.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="45169dfd-7fc9-4fd9-87b9-2170d4a30706">Creatures on the Astral Plane don’t age or suffer from hunger or thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live on the Astral Plane (such as the githyanki) establish outposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so their children can grow to maturity.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a0ca529e-72bf-4846-b796-652960463295">A traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply thinking about moving, but distance has little meaning. In combat, though, a creature’s walking speed (in feet) is equal to 3 × its Intelligence score. The smarter a creature is, the easier it can control its movement by act of will.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c45b3c49-806b-4f6c-8984-fb1929e5d42b">Traveling through the Astral Plane by means of the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2006-astral-projection" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2006-tooltip">astral projection</a> spell involves projecting one’s consciousness there, usually in search of a gateway to an Outer Plane to visit. Since the Outer Planes are as much spiritual states of being as they are physical places, this allows a character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he or she had physically traveled there, but as in a dream. A character’s death — either in the Astral Plane or on the destination plane — causes no actual harm. Only the severing of a character’s silver cord while on the Astral Plane (or the death of his or her helpless physical body on the Material Plane) can result in the character’s true death. Thus, high-level characters sometimes travel to the Outer Planes by way of <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2006-astral-projection" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2006-tooltip">astral projection</a> rather than seek out a portal or use a more direct spell.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="43789216-04ee-4e91-a84a-3b684ef877d9">Only a few things can sever a traveler’s silver cord, the most common being a psychic wind (described below). The legendary silver swords of the githyanki also have this ability. A character who travels bodily to the Astral Plane (by means of the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2206-plane-shift" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2206-tooltip">plane shift</a> spell or one of the rare portals that leads directly there) has no silver cord.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d24c62f9-7f32-4378-a558-56c896b16fe1">Gateways leading from the Astral Plane to other planes appear as two-dimensional pools of rippling colors, 1d6 × 10 feet in diameter. Traveling to another plane requires locating a color pool that leads to the desired plane. These gateways to other planes can be identified by color, as shown on the Astral Color Pools table. Finding the right color pool is a matter of chance: locating the correct one takes 1d4 × 10 hours of travel.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f8643cba-06b1-425c-9251-3d8aec970baf">A psychic wind isn’t a physical wind like that found on the Material Plane, but a storm of thought that batters travelers’ minds rather than their bodies. A psychic wind is made up of lost memories, forgotten ideas, minor musings, and subconscious fears that went astray in the Astral Plane and conglomerated into this powerful force.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3555b768-2862-4116-ac14-101200236234">A psychic wind is first sensed as a rapid darkening of the silver-gray sky. After a few rounds, the area becomes as dark as a moonless night. As the sky darkens, the traveler feels buffeting and shaking, as if the plane itself was rebelling against the storm. As quickly as it comes, the psychic wind passes, and the sky returns to normal in a few rounds.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6565d6a-7f29-4588-82ea-898e74df6964">The psychic wind has two kinds of effects: a location effect and a mental effect. A group of travelers journeying together suffers the same location effect. Each traveler affected by the wind must also make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the traveler suffers the mental effect as well. Roll a d20 twice and consult the Psychic Wind Effects table to determine the location and mental effects.</p>

Its “shores,” called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the Border Ethereal is limited to 60 feet. The plane’s depths comprise a region of swirling mist and fog called the Deep Ethereal, where visibility is limited to 30 feet.</p>

Ethereal denizens watch the plane as though peering through distorted and frosted glass, and can’t see anything beyond 30 feet into the other plane. Conversely, the Ethereal Plane is usually invisible to those on the overlapped planes, except with the aid of magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a4ca62de-1636-4fd6-9a86-1ee5c54b160c">Normally, creatures in the Border Ethereal can’t attack creatures on the overlapped plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible and utterly silent to someone on the overlapped plane, and solid objects on the overlapped plane don’t hamper the movement of a creature in the Border Ethereal. The exceptions are certain magical effects (including anything made of magical force) and living beings. This makes the Ethereal Plane ideal for reconnaissance, spying on opponents, and moving around without being detected. The Ethereal Plane also disobeys the laws of gravity; a creature there can move up and down as easily as walking.</p>

Distance is meaningless, so although travelers feel as if they can move by a simple act of will, it’s impossible to measure speed and hard to track the passage of time. A trip between planes through the Deep Ethereal takes 1d10 × 10 hours, regardless of the origin and destination. In combat, however, creatures are considered to move at their normal speeds.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="516a15de-13cb-48ba-b790-06250517b1c7">An ether cyclone is a serpentine column that spins through the plane. The cyclone appears abruptly, distorting and uprooting ethereal forms in its path and carrying the debris for leagues. Travelers with a passive Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) score of 15 or more receive 1d4 rounds of warning: a deep hum in the ethereal matter. Travelers who can’t reach a curtain or portal leading elsewhere suffer the cyclone’s effect. Roll a d20 and consult the Ether Cyclone table to determine the effect on all creatures in the vicinity.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2946bd60-62c3-4492-8006-c76c6e4f075e">The most common effect of an ether cyclone is to extend the duration of a journey. Each character in a group traveling together must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If at least half the group succeeds, travel is delayed by 1d10 hours. Otherwise, the journey’s travel time is doubled. Less often, a group is blown into the Border Ethereal of a random plane. Rarely, the cyclone tears a hole in the fabric of the plane and hurls the party into the Astral Plane.</p>

At first everything muted — the roar of the river around the rocks below, the chirping of frogs and crickets on shore, the evening bustle of the town behind him. ...A moment later, the world erupted into vibrant life. Frogs and night birds sang a chorus; the air was awash with autumn scents; the moonlight painted the flowers in iridescent blue, silver, and violet; and the rushing of the river became a complex symphony.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0258362f-3be4-4a35-a5a1-d80129ac0ff6">The Feywild, also called the Plane of Faerie, is a land of soft lights and wonder, a place of music and death. It is a realm of everlasting twilight, with glittering faerie lights bobbing in the gentle breeze and fat fireflies buzzing through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of an ever-setting sun, which never truly sets (or rises for that matter); it remains stationary, dusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas ruled by the seelie fey that compose the Summer Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles and syrupy fens — perfect territory for the unseelie fey to hunt their prey.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bf7f429c-99a3-487d-b171-7870eb07a5ad">The Feywild exists in parallel to the Material Plane, an alternate dimension that occupies the same cosmological space. The landscape of the Feywild mirrors the natural world but turns its features into spectacular forms. Where a volcano stands on the Material Plane, a mountain topped with skyscraper-sized crystals that glow with internal fire towers in the Feywild. A wide and muddy river on the Material Plane might be echoed as a clear and winding brook of great beauty. A marsh could be reflected as a vast black bog of sinister character. And moving to the Feywild from old ruins on the Material Plane might put a traveler at the door of an archfey’s castle.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="926e8b82-5d91-4d69-b0a7-aae4e46e9af4">The Feywild is inhabited by sylvan creatures, such as elves, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16849-dryad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16849-tooltip">dryads</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17005-satyr" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17005-tooltip">satyrs</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17192-pixie" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17192-tooltip">pixies</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17020-sprite" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17020-tooltip">sprites</a>, as well as <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16821-centaur" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16821-tooltip">centaurs</a> and magical creatures such as <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16809-blink-dog" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16809-tooltip">blink dogs</a>, faerie dragons, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17037-treant" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17037-tooltip">treants</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17042-unicorn" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17042-tooltip">unicorns</a>.

<p data-content-chunk-id="6149fa57-85cb-4c41-9743-dda2e822cb44">Two queens hold court in the Feywild, and most fey owe allegiance to one or the other. Queen Titania and her Summer Court lead the seelie fey, and the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court, leads the unseelie fey.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="159d8689-2e48-4465-a92c-08459dd8f8bf">Seelie and unseelie do not directly correlate with good and evil, though many mortals make that equation. Many seelie fey are good, and many unseelie are evil, but their opposition to each other stems from their queens’ jealous rivalry, not abstract moral concerns. Ugly denizens of the Feywild, such as <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17146-fomorian" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17146-tooltip">fomorians</a> and hags, are almost never members of either court, and fey of independent spirit reject the courts entirely.

<p data-content-chunk-id="23dc533e-ac58-4e83-af40-7c327ccb42d3">Fey crossings are places of mystery and beauty on the Material Plane that have a near-perfect mirror in the Feywild, creating a portal where the two planes touch. A traveler passes through a fey crossing by entering a clearing, wading into a pool, stepping into a circle of mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. To the traveler, it seems like he or she has simply walked into the Feywild with a step. To an observer, the traveler is there one moment and gone the next.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5d1a0615-7ee4-4daf-9824-e94183d52fac">Like other portals between planes, most fey crossings open infrequently. A crossing might open only during a full moon, on the dawn of a particular day, or for someone carrying a certain type of item. A fey crossing can be closed permanently if the land on either side is dramatically altered — for example, if a castle is built over the clearing on the Material Plane.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5fedf9fb-5180-4b2c-81b7-c8c7d07ee916">Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures and spirited away to the Feywild, only to return to their parents years later without having aged a day, and with no memories of their captors or the realm they came from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an excursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover upon their return that time flows differently on the Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the strange magic that suffuses the plane.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0c430045-44ab-4740-b0b6-e9f6044f8eb4">A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its time spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the creature’s memories remain intact but are a little hazy. Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature’s lost memories.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9e39b3db-d8b9-4f9c-97c4-6dbd96af840c">While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, characters might spend a day there and realize, upon leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed everywhere else in the multiverse.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2aacb7f3-ebdb-4bde-ad3d-89106d12f73a">Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves the Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane, you can choose a time change that works best for your campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp table. A <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2303-wish" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2303-tooltip">wish</a> spell can be used to remove the effect on up to ten creatures.

<p data-content-chunk-id="34a40828-d3a9-4bf4-900e-032b76bcd0ce">Riven stood in the uppermost room of the central tower of his citadel — a fortress of shadows and dark stone carved in relief into the sheer face of a jagged peak. . . . The starless black vault of the plane’s sky hung over a landscape of gray and black, where lived the dark simulacra of actual things. Shadows and wraiths and specters and ghosts and other undead hung in the air around the citadel, or prowled the foothills and plains near it, so numerous their glowing eyes looked like swarms of fireflies. He felt the darkness in everything he could see, felt it as an extension of himself, and the feeling made him too big by half.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3d7cf2d1-c58d-4071-b8fb-ae40ce93928d">The Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a dimension of black, gray, and white where most other color has been leached from everything. It is a place of darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6d9a5174-7ad7-4c88-b2e4-c62f0cd1929e">The Shadowfell overlaps the Material Plane in much the same way as the Feywild. Aside from the colorless landscape, it appears similar to the Material Plane. Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped — distorted reflections of what exists on the Material Plane. Where a mountain stands on the Material Plane, the corresponding feature on the Shadowfell is a jagged rock outcropping with a resemblance to a skull, a heap of rubble, or perhaps the crumbling ruin of a once-great castle. A forest on the Shadowfell is dark and twisted, its branches reaching out to snare travelers’ cloaks, and its roots coiling and buckling to trip those who pass by.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f674c8c-637c-4d5a-9448-e79a410ea8e8">Shadow dragons and undead creatures haunt this bleak plane, as do other creatures that thrive in the gloom, including <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16826-cloaker" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16826-tooltip">cloakers</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16837-darkmantle" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16837-tooltip">darkmantles</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="566f7c2a-868c-45f5-b4e2-1056e73b4da4">Similar to fey crossings, shadow crossings are locations where the veil between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell is so thin that creatures can walk from one plane to the other. A blot of shadow in the corner of a dusty crypt might be a shadow crossing, as might an open grave. Shadow crossings form in gloomy places where spirits or the stench of death lingers, such as battlefields, graveyards, and tombs. They manifest only in darkness, closing as soon as they feel light’s kiss.</p>

Evernight is a city of cracked stone edifices and homes of rotten wood. Its roads are made mostly of trampled grave dust, and its few cobbled streets are missing enough stones that they appear pockmarked. The sky is corpse gray, and the breeze blows cold and humid, bringing a chill to the skin.</p>

But the living are a minority in Evernight, for the bulk of the population consists of the shambling dead. <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17077-zombie" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17077-tooltip">Zombies</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17059-wight" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17059-tooltip">wights</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17043-vampire" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17043-tooltip">vampires</a>, and other undead make the city their home, all under the watchful eyes of the ruling caste: intelligent, flesh-eating <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16872-ghoul" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16872-tooltip">ghouls</a>.</p>

The best known of these is the valley of Barovia, overlooked by the towering spires of Castle Ravenloft and ruled by Count Strahd von Zarovich, the first vampire. Beings of the Shadowfell called the Dark Powers created these domains as prisons for these “darklords,” and through cruelty or carelessness trapped innocent mortals in these domains as well.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="edb91ab5-ae39-4144-9706-b5df58cc2d28">The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all worlds were made. The four Elemental Planes — Air, Earth, Fire, and Water — form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within a churning realm known as the Elemental Chaos. These planes are all connected, and the border regions between them are sometimes described as distinct planes in their own right.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eb710a13-6508-4bee-8b21-acc5ba0e0f39">At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble places in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. But the dominant element exerts a strong influence on the environment, reflecting its fundamental qualities.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e1ae608b-715e-4367-b169-01f91bc0700c">The inhabitants of this inner ring include <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17100-aarakocra" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17100-tooltip">aarakocra</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16794-azer" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16794-tooltip">azers</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16845-dragon-turtle" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16845-tooltip">dragon turtles</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16868-gargoyle" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16868-tooltip">gargoyles</a>, genies, mephits, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17004-salamander" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17004-tooltip">salamanders</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17066-xorn" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17066-tooltip">xorn</a>. Some originated on the Material Plane, and all can travel to the Material Plane (if they have access to the magic required) and survive there.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9fd359bf-a1a5-476c-9b14-d8308badf9b9">As they extend farther from the Material Plane, the Elemental Planes become increasingly alien and hostile. Here, in the outermost regions, the elements exist in their purest form: great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. Any foreign substance is extremely rare; little air can be found in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Earth, and earth is all but impossible to find in the outermost reaches of the Plane of Fire. These areas are much less hospitable to travelers from the Material Plane than the border regions are. Such regions are little known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means the border region.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0f389b66-f5bf-4571-a657-843970d08523">The outermost regions are largely the domains of elemental spirits barely recognizable as creatures. The creatures usually called elementals dwell here, including the Elemental Princes of Evil (primordial beings of pure elemental fury) and elemental spirits that spellcasters can bind into <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17148-galeb-duhr" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17148-tooltip">galeb duhrs</a>, golems, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16934-invisible-stalker" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16934-tooltip">invisible stalkers</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16949-magmin" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16949-tooltip">magmins</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17208-water-weird" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17208-tooltip">water weirds</a>. These elemental creatures don’t need food or other sustenance on their home planes, because they are sustained by the elemental energies that saturate those planes.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="ElementalChaos" data-content-chunk-id="5ce9ce28-d59e-4d75-88b8-33ccf749036f"><a href="#ElementalChaos" data-content-chunk-id="3cdeb209-9872-462a-8f7a-9a9e46fd72c5"></a>Elemental Chaos</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b7ee8444-05ea-46c1-a49b-019dcc2a14ff">At the farthest extents of the Elemental Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance called the Elemental Chaos. Elementals can be found here as well, but they usually don’t stay long, preferring the comfort of their native planes. Reports indicate the existence of weird hybrid elementals native to the Elemental Chaos, but such creatures are seldom seen on other planes.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4612ab62-c1e8-4dba-8e79-82bc2a933418">The essential nature of air is movement, animation, and inspiration. Air is the breath of life, the winds of change, the fresh breeze that clears away the fog of ignorance and the stuffiness of old ideas.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bf22e184-1e94-431c-9dfe-86da652e17cd">The Plane of Air is an open expanse with constant winds of varying strength. Here and there, chunks of earth drift in the openness — the remnants of failed invasions by denizens of the Plane of Earth. These earth motes serve as homes for the creatures of elemental air, and many motes are covered with lush vegetation. Other creatures live on cloud banks infused with enough magic to become solid surfaces, strong enough to support towns and castles.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f064047c-7f0c-4b6b-9199-60edf414c4a5">Drifting cloud banks can obscure visibility in any direction in the plane. Storms are frequent, mostly on par with a strong thunderstorm but occasionally more like fierce tornadoes or mighty hurricanes. The air is mild, except near the Plane of Water (where it is biting cold) and the Plane of Fire (where it is searing hot). Rain and snow fall only in the part of the plane nearest to the Plane of Water.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91c2db5f-fe7c-4bce-b609-e61f5167d409">Most of the Plane of Air is a complex web of air streams, currents, and winds called the <strong>Labyrinth Winds</strong>. These range from stiff breezes to howling gales that can rip a creature apart. Even the most skilled flying creatures must navigate these currents carefully, flying with the winds, not against them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36678223-9811-4afe-859e-024d785cb5b1">Here and there among the Labyrinth Winds are hidden realms reachable only by following a particular sequence of flowing winds, and thus largely protected against attackers. One such realm is fabled <strong>Aaqa</strong>, a shining domain of silver spires and verdant gardens atop a fertile earth mote. The Wind Dukes of Aaqa are dedicated to law and good, and they maintain a vigilant watch against the depredations of elemental evil and the encroachment of the Elemental Chaos. They are served by aarakocra and a little-known race called the vaati.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e56804c4-5a84-420e-bca9-3a358ec529fd">The region of the Plane of Air nearest the Great Conflagration is called the <strong>Sirocco Straits</strong>. Hot, dry winds scour the earth motes in this area to dry and barren chunks of rock. Gargoyles and their allies from the Plane of Earth gather here to launch raids into the realm of Aaqa.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d29fb2f3-3707-418a-a561-499fd1cffe24">Between the Sea of Fire (on the Plane of Fire) and the Sirocco Straits is a towering firestorm called the <strong>Great Conflagration</strong>, sometimes called the Plane of Ash. Howling winds from the Plane of Air mix with the cinder storms and lava of the Plane of Fire to create an endless storm front — a wall of flames, smoke, and ash. The thick ash obscures sight beyond a few dozen feet, and the battering winds make travel difficult. Here and there, ash clusters into floating realms where outlaws and fugitives take shelter.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fc8cb1c4-7940-4e96-8fed-8fb5dc97fc44">At the other end of the plane, near the Frostfell (the plane of ice that borders the Plane of Water), is a region of frigid winds called the <strong>Mistral Reach</strong>. These gales drive snowstorms into the Frostfell and away from it, toward the heart of the plane. Earth motes in the reach are covered with snow and ice.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="bbded32f-ff4f-4de9-bfe6-2c20d83f4637">Earth symbolizes stability, rigidity, stern resolve, and tradition. The plane’s position opposite the Plane of Air in the ring of the Elemental Planes reflects its opposition to almost everything air represents.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef7e8605-56a5-475e-b36f-086633ab4927">The Plane of Earth is a chain of mountains rising higher than any mountain range in the Material Plane. It has no sun of its own, and no air surrounds the peaks of its highest mountains. Most visitors to the plane arrive by way of caves and caverns that honeycomb the mountains.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8ada0ac7-5ad8-42b4-a196-2ef31654f0f2">The largest cavern beneath the mountains, called the Great Dismal Delve or the Sevenfold Mazework, is home to the capital city of the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17142-dao" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17142-tooltip">dao</a>, the <strong>City of Jewels</strong>. The dao take great pride in their wealth and send teams across the plane in search of new veins of ore and gemstones to exploit. Thanks to their efforts, every building and significant object in the city is made from precious stones and metals, including the slender gemstone-inlaid spires that top most buildings. The city is protected by a powerful spell that alerts the entire dao population if a visitor steals even a single stone. Theft is punishable by death, with punishment extending to the thief’s relatives.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="63412af4-e7f6-422e-af67-2fc65ada0357">The mountains nearest the Fountains of Creation (on the Plane of Fire) are called the <strong>Furnaces</strong>. Lava seeps through their caverns, and the air reeks of sulfur. The dao have great forges and smelting furnaces here to process their ores and shape their precious metals.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ffd8d304-7b24-4cf3-8d0f-6873bc5fc6d9">The border region between the planes of Water and Earth is a horrid swamp where twisted, gnarled trees and thick, stinging vines grow from the dense muck and slime. Here and there within the <strong>Swamp of Oblivion</strong> (also called the Plane of Ooze), stagnant lakes and pools play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden structures suspended above the muck. Most are built on platforms between trees, but a few stand on stilts driven deep into the muck. No solid earth underlies the mud of the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink down into it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eff9162f-c31b-4e37-86fd-c432d0c622f1">It is said that any object cast into the Swamp of Oblivion can’t be found again for at least a century. Now and then, a desperate soul casts an artifact of power into this place, removing it from the multiverse for a time. The promise of powerful magic lures adventurers to brave the monstrous insects and hags of the swamp in search of these treasures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d0ca1063-8e3f-4a8c-acb4-297b87175dc7">The region of the plane nearest the Swamp of Oblivion is called the <strong>Mud Hills</strong>. Landslides constantly wear away the slopes of the hills, sending cascades of earth and stone into the bottomless swamp. The Plane of Earth seems to constantly regenerate the land, pushing new hills up as the old ones erode to nothing.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="eb71a5e1-fae9-461a-8677-f3a130b808c9">Fire represents vibrancy, passion, and change. At its worst, it is cruel and wantonly destructive, as the efreet often are, but at its best, fire reflects the light of inspiration, the warmth of compassion, and the flame of desire.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f4bd5938-9ea4-446e-9dad-0ea9bd15af50">A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a 24-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at noon to deep red at midnight, so the darkest hours of the plane display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly blinding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below) takes place during the darker hours.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2dc8e664-ce4d-4348-87aa-c95da4af03c9">The weather on the plane is marked by fierce winds and thick ash. Although the air is breathable, creatures not native to the plane must cover their mouths and eyes to avoid stinging cinders. The <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16854-efreeti" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16854-tooltip">efreet</a> use magic to keep the cinder storms away from the City of Brass, but elsewhere in the plane, the wind is always at least blustery and rises to hurricane force during the worst storms.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d324c603-9b2d-4bdd-9107-3257d85ad404">The heat in the Plane of Fire is comparable to a hot desert on the Material Plane, and poses a similar threat to travelers (see “Extreme Heat” in chapter 5, “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeHeat" data-content-chunk-id="a80a5675-7d6e-49fb-bd3d-63bf5af2b776">Adventure Environments</a>”). The deeper one goes into the plane, the rarer water becomes. Beyond a point, the plane holds no sources of water, so travelers must carry their own supplies or produce water by magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a173a05d-b1f3-4ee3-98d6-b6e26c144105">The Plane of Fire is dominated by the vast <strong>Cinder Wastes</strong>, a great expanse of black cinders and embers crossed by rivers of lava. Roving bands of <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17004-salamander" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17004-tooltip">salamanders</a> battle each other, raid azer outposts, and avoid the efreet. Ancient ruins dot the desert — remnants of forgotten civilizations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cfcf0294-3595-4946-81f3-4a775e0f4942">A great range of volcanic mountains called the <strong>Fountains of Creation</strong> is home to <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16794-azer" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16794-tooltip">azers</a>. These rocky peaks curl from the edge of the Plane of Earth around the Cinder Wastes toward the fiery heart of the plane. At the edge of the plane, the mountains are also called the Plane of Magma. <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16862-fire-giant" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16862-tooltip">Fire giants</a> and red dragons make their homes here, as well as creatures from the neighboring planes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="11f9ac8b-1e9d-4f41-969b-eae29dcc7690">Lava flows through the volcanoes toward the Plane of Air and pools into a great lava sea, called the <strong>Sea of Fire</strong>, sailed by efreet and azers in great brass ships. Islands of obsidian and basalt jut up from the sea, dotted with ancient ruins and the lairs of powerful red dragons. On the shore of the Sea of Fire stands the <strong>City of Brass</strong>.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="TheCityofBrass" data-content-chunk-id="814bb2ae-1588-4d51-ad19-cae062047046"><a href="#TheCityofBrass" data-content-chunk-id="81a7ffe3-a212-4bec-81a2-99c943a54241"></a>The City of Brass</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4364b6ab-3311-4fd8-9bd4-844c4443706f">Perhaps the best-known location in the Inner Planes is the City of Brass, on the shores of the Sea of Fire. This is the fabled city of the efreet, and its ornate spires and metal walls reflect their grandiose and cruel nature. True to the nature of the Plane of Fire, everything in the city seems alive with dancing flames, reflecting the vibrant energy of the place.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a253d63c-eb04-4672-a1e6-740cbde6ee5a">Adventurers frequently come here on quests for legendary magic. If it’s possible to buy magic items at all, the City of Brass is the most likely place to find any item for sale, though the price might well be more than gold. The efreet are fond of trading in favors, especially when they have the upper hand in negotiations. Perhaps a magical disease or poison can be cured only with something that must be purchased in the bazaars of the city.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fae8b216-d443-4035-8427-1bca4a583468">The heart of the city is the towering Charcoal Palace, where the tyrannical sultan of the efreet reigns supreme, surrounded by efreet nobles and a host of servants, guardians, and sycophants.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1f50848a-36e1-4971-817f-c0e567522511">The nature of water is to flow, not like the gusting wind or the leaping flame, but smoothly and steadily. It is the rhythm of the tide, the nectar of life, the bitter tears of mourning, and the balm of sympathy and healing. Given time, it can erode all in its path.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="13477aab-aa97-4df7-a4dd-773ab0257d57">A warm sun arcs across the sky of the Plane of Water, seeming to rise and set from within the water at the visible edge of the horizon. Several times a day, however, the sky clouds over and releases a deluge of rain, often accompanied by spectacular shows of lightning, before clearing up again. At night, a glittering array of stars and auroras bedecks the sky.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ec414603-a58b-497b-b761-5ff469864a67">The Plane of Water is an endless sea, called the <strong>Sea of Worlds</strong>, dotted here and there with atolls and islands that rise up from enormous coral reefs that seem to stretch forever into the depths. The storms that move across the sea sometimes create temporary portals to the Material Plane and draw ships into the Plane of Water. Surviving vessels from countless worlds and navies ply these waters with little hope of ever returning home.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ff546238-bc6f-483b-8418-e119b9450575">The weather on the plane is a lesson in extremes. If the sea isn’t calm, it is battered by storms. On rare occasions, a tremor in the planar firmament sends a rogue wave sweeping across the plane, swamping entire islands and driving ships down to the reefs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1981d3d5-38f3-4fbd-9c3c-4a96d09a77c5">Life flourishes in the upper reaches of the Sea of Worlds, called the <strong>Sea of Light</strong> because of the sunlight filtering down into the water. Aquatic humanoids craft castles and fortresses in the coral reefs. The <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17143-marid" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17143-tooltip">marids</a> are the distant stewards of this region, content to allow the lesser folk to compete for territory. The nominal emperor of the marids dwells in the <strong>Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls</strong>, an opulent palace made of coral and studded with pearls.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91a3b6bb-b043-4f6f-9f91-f22a705e5035">The deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight reaches, are called the <strong>Darkened Depths</strong>. Horrid creatures dwell here, and the absolute cold and crushing pressure mean a swift end to creatures accustomed to the surface or the Sea of Light. <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16940-kraken" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16940-tooltip">Krakens</a> and other mighty leviathans claim this realm.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="624cf69f-d357-40f1-9624-e662d533b663">Any land that rises above the surface of the sea is hotly contested by the few air-breathers that live on the plane. Fleets of rafts and ships lashed together serve as solid ground where nothing else is available. Most natives of the plane never break the surface of the sea and thus ignore these habitations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ae13ead-f7f3-4cf5-b9d9-9bcb34b7872f">One of the few actual islands on the plane is the <strong>Isle of Dread</strong>. The island is connected to the Material Plane by means of a regular storm that sweeps over the island. Travelers who know the strange tides and currents of the plane can travel between worlds freely, but the storms also wreck ships from the Material Plane on the island’s shore.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9933d332-665a-475e-b75b-e72528bdcf02">The region of the Plane of Water nearest the Swamp of Oblivion (on the Plane of Earth) is called the <strong>Silt Flats</strong>. The water is thick with soil and sludge, and turns into muddy ground before giving way to the great swamp between the planes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ff328b98-c2f3-4bf3-905f-a8894cae5303">At the other extreme of the plane is the <strong>Sea of Ice</strong>, bordering the Frostfell. The frigid water is choked with icebergs and sheet ice, inhabited by the cold-loving creatures that inhabit the Frostfell. Drifting icebergs can carry these creatures farther into the Plane of Water to threaten ships and islands in warmer seas.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c7841a9-48ce-46d8-a1b4-f7798d1b09c9">The <strong>Frostfell</strong>, also called the Plane of Ice, forms the border between the planes of Air and Water and is a seemingly endless glacier swept by constant, raging blizzards. Frozen caverns twist through the Plane of Ice, home to <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17096-yeti" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17096-tooltip">yetis</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16995-remorhaz" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16995-tooltip">remorhazes</a>, white dragons, and other creatures of cold. The inhabitants of the plane engage in a never-ending battle to prove their strength and ensure their survival.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eb6f7ef4-57f1-4455-92a2-7ea04410116a">Its dangerous monsters and bitter cold make the Frostfell a dangerous place to travel. Most planar voyagers keep to the air, braving the powerful winds and driving snow to avoid setting foot on the great glacier.</p>

They whirled to form what looked like giant eyes staring down, eyes that were swept away before they could focus, only to form anew, again and again. Beneath the ruby glow lay a dark nightmare land of bare rock and flumes of sparks and gouting flame, where things slithered and scrambled half-seen in the shadows. Mountains clawed the ruby sky. The Land of Teeth, Azuth had once aptly called it, surveying the endless jagged rocks. This was the Greeting Ground, the realm of horror that had claimed the lives of countless mortals. He was whirling along above Avernus, uppermost of the Nine Hells.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="dd8d3bc9-20a9-4925-b165-b5b736c43c9c">If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes provide the direction, thought, and purpose for its construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a8795cf-c8ec-4d8c-b392-013864a693f2">When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes aren’t literally places at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bc4082a4-b4a0-472a-b5d4-4d08aa0202cd">Even in perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at a whim of the powerful forces that dwell on these planes, which can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence to better fulfill their divine needs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be03c50e-f562-4369-8615-abb04787f698">Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes can seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. Adventurers could take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day — if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f6042b1-dc94-4fc6-82d5-a0eae8664b3c">The default Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality, which is represented by the Outlands, described in the section on “<a href="#OtherPlanes" data-content-chunk-id="86549fb6-7849-4c9c-af6d-46b7b5174afc">Other Planes</a>”) and the shades of distinction between them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d65b8886-965c-4ca0-a294-945902cf4026">The planes with an element of good in their nature are called the <strong>Upper Planes</strong>, while those with an element of evil are the <strong>Lower Planes</strong>. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s alignment experiences a sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b51d660-4bed-4a9d-aa6c-3685f0414e64">The Upper Planes are the home of celestial creatures, including angels, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16832-couatl" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16832-tooltip">couatls</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16977-pegasus" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16977-tooltip">pegasi</a>. The Lower Planes are the home of fiends: demons, devils, yugoloths, and their ilk. The planes in between host their own unique denizens: the construct race of modrons inhabit Mechanus, and the aberrations called slaadi thrive in Limbo.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LayersoftheOuterPlanes" data-content-chunk-id="9d2c3412-140d-43e1-bae6-cbeedd109e57"><a href="#LayersoftheOuterPlanes" data-content-chunk-id="caabf60f-b278-4d60-83e1-d50b19c336b9"></a>Layers of the Outer Planes</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="10eb30db-847b-494f-8d06-1e1ea1a15673">Most of the Outer Planes include a number of distinct environments or realms. These realms are often imagined and depicted as a stack of related parts of the same plane, so travelers refer to them as layers. For example, Mount Celestia resembles a seven-tiered layer cake, the Nine Hells has nine layers, and the Abyss has a seemingly endless number of layers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="39f1f4c4-085b-4283-b925-8a24836d7b7b">Most portals from elsewhere reach the first layer of a multilayered plane. This layer is variously depicted as the top or bottom layer, depending on the plane. As the arrival point for most visitors, the first layer functions like a city gate for that plane.</p>
<h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TravelingtheOuterPlanes" data-content-chunk-id="90ff2547-1fa4-4dbe-9281-451736415284"><a href="#TravelingtheOuterPlanes" data-content-chunk-id="d138286a-ee1e-49f7-ba72-3dbea566d666"></a>Traveling the Outer Planes</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f2834972-25eb-4d98-86f3-ce1c7490231e">Traveling between the Outer Planes isn’t dissimilar from reaching the Outer Planes in the first place. Characters traveling by means of the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2006-astral-projection" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2006-tooltip">astral projection</a> spell can go from one plane into the Astral Plane, and there search out a color pool leading to the desired destination. Characters can also use <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2206-plane-shift" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2206-tooltip">plane shift</a> to reach a different plane more directly. Most often, though, characters use portals — either a portal that links the two planes directly or a portal leading to <a href="#SigilCityofDoors" data-content-chunk-id="d3846c5d-6ffb-4dd3-9c2e-cf1a229a5776">Sigil, City of Doors</a>, which holds portals to all the planes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ce3e3536-50fa-4b4e-96c8-261ae4c1781d">Two planar features connect multiple Outer Planes together: the River Styx and the Infinite Staircase. Other planar crossings might exist in your campaign, such as a World Tree whose roots touch the Lower Planes and whose branches reach to the Upper Planes, or it might be possible to walk from one plane to another in your cosmology.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="TheRiverStyx" data-content-chunk-id="80d33b11-3cdc-45e1-a781-e1c712dea0ae"><a href="#TheRiverStyx" data-content-chunk-id="93bcede0-e084-4ebc-acfc-53868492dd1c"></a>The River Styx</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db70155d-c174-4078-821b-9b0cb2b0b9e5">This river bubbles with grease, foul flotsam, and the putrid remains of battles along its banks. Any creature other than a fiend that tastes or touches the water is affected by a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2096-feeblemind" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2096-tooltip">feeblemind</a> spell. The DC of the Intelligence saving throw to resist the effect is 15.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1d9e9313-6a55-4ba2-86a2-347e0697c3e8">The Styx churns through the top layers of Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and Pandemonium. Tributaries of the Styx snake onto lower layers of these planes. For example, a tendril of the Styx winds through every layer of the Nine Hells, allowing passage from one layer of that plane to the next.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="839657c4-eae3-45eb-bfe3-3689b0f91f21">Sinister ferries float on the waters of the Styx, crewed by pilots skilled in negotiating the unpredictable currents and eddies of the river. For a price, these pilots are willing to carry passengers from plane to plane. Some of them are fiends, while others are the souls of dead creatures from the Material Plane.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="TheInfiniteStaircase" data-content-chunk-id="d19771a0-44ff-4006-bba5-a903de0b9e6b"><a href="#TheInfiniteStaircase" data-content-chunk-id="9b332f67-8087-44cc-a156-20d5d37e5da4"></a>The Infinite Staircase</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="05ad260f-99e3-481e-9e4d-6afbc0edac09">The Infinite Staircase is an extradimensional spiral staircase that connects the planes. An entrance to the Infinite Staircase usually appears as a nondescript door. Beyond the portal lies a small landing with an equally nondescript stairway leading up and down. The Infinite Staircase changes appearance as it climbs and descends, going from simple stairs of wood or stone to a chaotic jumble of stairs hanging in radiant space, where no two steps share the same gravitational orientation. It is said that one can find one’s heart’s desire on the Infinite Staircase through diligent searching of each landing.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="179f9eeb-0797-4a69-b560-4250b365359f">Doors to the Infinite Staircase are often tucked away in dusty, half-forgotten places that no one frequents or pays any attention to. On any given plane, there can be multiple doors to the Infinite Staircase, though entrances aren’t common knowledge and are occasionally guarded by <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16840-deva" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16840-tooltip">devas</a>, sphinxes, yugoloths, and other powerful monsters.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="45c3a595-aa94-435d-8140-4a6198b17043">Each of the Outer Planes has peculiar characteristics that make traveling through it a unique experience. A plane’s influence can affect visitors in various ways, such as causing them to take on personality traits or flaws that reflect the disposition of the plane, or even shift alignment to more closely match the native inhabitants of the plane. Each plane’s description includes one or more optional rules that you can use to help make the adventurers’ experiences on that plane memorable.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="OptionalRulePsychicDissonance" data-content-chunk-id="606e690b-9872-4c6f-9e21-4f3395374513"><a href="#OptionalRulePsychicDissonance" data-content-chunk-id="d101e9ba-6322-4671-8e89-da04cb130e5a"></a>Optional Rule: Psychic Dissonance</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c751ecd7-1f51-4f19-b854-f14bbbb1d47b">Each of the Outer Planes emanates a psychic dissonance that affects visitors of an incompatible alignment — good creatures on the Lower Planes, evil ones on the Upper Planes — if they spend too much time on the plane. You can reflect this dissonance with this optional rule. At the end of a long rest spent on an incompatible plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/4-tooltip">exhaustion</a>. Incompatibility between lawful and chaotic alignments doesn’t have the same effect, so Mechanus and Limbo lack this quality.</p>
<h3 id="MountCelestia" data-content-chunk-id="dcad46dd-8500-425b-ae07-73238209aa93" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr"><a href="#MountCelestia" data-content-chunk-id="85188e73-7851-456b-ac37-9fe33caadf65"></a>Mount Celestia</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="49dde35e-76d7-49c2-83b0-11e6beac795d">The single sacred mountain of Mount Celestia rises from a shining Silver Sea to heights barely visible and utterly incomprehensible, with seven plateaus marking its seven heavenly layers. The plane is the model of justice and order, of celestial grace and endless mercy, where angels and champions of good guard against incursions of evil. It is one of the few places on the planes where travelers can let down their guard. Its inhabitants strive constantly to be as righteous as possible. Countless creatures aim to reach the highest and most sublime peak of the mountain, but only the purest souls can. Gazing toward that peak fills even the most jaded of travelers with awe.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2427da7e-7d3b-4755-a3b9-7eb9d85be283">In contrast to the dissonance experienced by evil creatures here, good creatures are literally blessed by the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures of good alignment gain the benefit of the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2016-bless" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2016-tooltip">bless</a> spell as long as they remain on the plane. In addition, finishing a long rest on the plane grants a good creature the benefit of a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2164-lesser-restoration" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2164-tooltip">lesser restoration</a> spell.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="Bytopia" data-content-chunk-id="c85fec51-2a9c-47f2-9321-ca3e0252d6d6"><a href="#Bytopia" data-content-chunk-id="79b60b51-b04e-42c0-bbd9-71a62e1548e8"></a>Bytopia</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="89e59ba0-b03a-4b40-a9f7-1ccd9a952c7a">The two layers of the Twin Paradises of Bytopia are similar yet opposite: one is a tamed, pastoral landscape and the other an untamed wilderness, yet both reflect the plane’s goodness and its acceptance of law and order when necessary. Bytopia is the heaven of productive work, the satisfaction of a job well done. The goodness flowing through the plane creates feelings of goodwill and happiness in creatures dwelling there.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="OptionalRulePervasiveGoodwill" data-content-chunk-id="32e83417-14a4-4853-b833-5e5274ddb88f"><a href="#OptionalRulePervasiveGoodwill" data-content-chunk-id="1c833df0-a71e-49df-b253-791fc51d1f55"></a>Optional Rule: Pervasive Goodwill</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d02deb7f-9c60-49bf-bfc6-daf77a8a8ade">At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that is neither lawful good nor neutral good must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s alignment changes to lawful good or neutral good (whichever is closer to the creature’s current alignment). The change becomes permanent if the creature doesn’t leave the plane within 1d4 days. Otherwise, the creature’s alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Bytopia. Casting the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2071-dispel-evil-and-good" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2071-tooltip">dispel evil and good</a> spell on the creature also restores its original alignment.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="Elysium" data-content-chunk-id="0589f41c-2d18-4052-bfeb-0da116262938"><a href="#Elysium" data-content-chunk-id="04551bee-1f4b-421f-bc8f-e6596ea90f74"></a>Elysium</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8ae6b284-cdcf-4a9e-972c-5bfe86c46059">Elysium is home to creatures of unfettered kindness and compassion, and a welcome refuge for planar travelers seeking a safe haven. The plane’s bucolic landscapes glimmer with life and beauty in their prime. Tranquility seeps into the bones and souls of those who enter the plane. It is the heaven of well-earned rest, a place where tears of joy glisten on many a cheek.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="OptionalRuleOverwhelmingJoy" data-content-chunk-id="f0f654f4-5552-415e-a957-cd8e27975122"><a href="#OptionalRuleOverwhelmingJoy" data-content-chunk-id="677579bf-22fd-4862-bdd1-765329383f9b"></a>Optional Rule: Overwhelming Joy</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="40530564-8742-4a71-9482-aa9b67ab7893">Visitors spending any time on this plane risk becoming trapped by overwhelming sensations of contentment and happiness. At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unwilling to leave the plane before taking another long rest. After three failed saving throws, the creature never willingly leaves the plane and, if forcibly removed, does everything in its power to return to the plane. A <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2071-dispel-evil-and-good" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2071-tooltip">dispel evil and good</a> spell removes this effect from the creature.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2343e14a-6e04-49b0-a189-b86498541df7">The Beastlands is a plane of nature unbound, of forests ranging from moss-hung mangroves to snow-laden pines, of thick jungles where the branches are woven so tight that no light penetrates, of vast plains where grains and wildflowers wave in the wind with vibrant life. The plane embodies nature’s wildness and beauty, but it also speaks to the animal within all living things.</p>

In this form, the creature retains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of each long rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature returns to its true form. After three failed saving throws, the transformation can be undone only by a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2229-tooltip">remove curse</a> spell or similar magic.</p>

Its good-natured inhabitants are dedicated to fighting evil, but their reckless emotions sometimes break free with devastating consequences. Rage is as common and as honored as joy in Arborea. There the mountains and forests are extravagantly massive and beautiful, and every glade and stream is inhabited by nature spirits that brook no infringement. Travelers must tread lightly.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1c37ecb9-9e7c-4c36-b843-5108651eeb1e">Arborea is home to many elves and elven deities. Elves born on this plane have the celestial type and are wild at heart, ready to battle evil in a heartbeat. Otherwise, they look and behave like normal elves.</p>

On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to Arborea. As long as the effect persists, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long rest, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

<p data-content-chunk-id="4037257d-dbfe-4e12-aff8-82c253451312">Ysgard is a rugged realm of soaring mountains, deep fjords, and windswept battlefields, with summers that are long and hot, and winters that are wickedly cold and unforgiving. Its continents float above oceans of volcanic rock, below which are icy caverns so enormous as to hold entire kingdoms of giants, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and other beings. Heroes come to Ysgard to test their mettle not only against the plane itself, but also against giants, dragons, and other terrible creatures that thunder across Ysgard’s vast terrain.</p>

Any creature, other than a construct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a spell while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next day. The creature has all its hit points restored, and all conditions and afflictions it suffered before its death are removed.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c77e3e81-692d-4d74-b3a1-829897996688">Limbo is a plane of pure chaos, a roiling soup of impermanent matter and energy. Stone melts into water that freezes into metal, then turns into diamond that burns up into smoke that becomes snow, and on and on in an endless, unpredictable process of change. Fragments of more ordinary landscapes — bits of forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even burbling streams — drift through the disorder. The whole plane is a nightmarish riot.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="baa7fd29-572e-4b83-9b38-2979ec3a39db">Limbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting the plane float in place. A creature can move up to its walking speed in any direction by merely thinking of the desired direction of travel.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4866ab9f-6dbe-43d3-8749-2a1a221952f7">Limbo conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting it. Very disciplined and powerful minds can create whole islands of their own invention within the plane, sometimes maintaining those places for years. A simpleminded creature such as a fish, though, might have less than a minute before the pocket of water surrounding it freezes, vanishes, or turns to glass. The slaadi live here and swim amid this chaos, creating nothing, whereas <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17151-githzerai-monk" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17151-tooltip">githzerai monks</a> build entire monasteries with their minds.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="95fccbd7-bfde-464d-8e15-bba2621262d2">As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an Intelligence check to mentally move an object on the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC depends on the object’s size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by which it beat the DC.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="78ee1c18-f703-4862-bb4a-f3bdda8c8b11">A creature can also use an action to make an Intelligence check to alter a nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried. The same rules for distance apply, and the DC is based on the object’s size: DC 10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature changes the object into another nonliving form of the same size, such as turning a boulder into a ball of fire.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bcb6c458-059c-4239-a3e2-865ccf0a623b">Finally, a creature can use an action to make an Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; each additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the DC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents the area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or until the creature uses this ability again.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c898c351-037c-4cdd-866c-54f51e559b9f">Pandemonium is a plane of overwhelming chaos, a great mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only by yelling, and even then only to a maximum distance of 10 feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability check that relies on hearing.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8442e3b9-fbec-4ca0-94f6-80b17d658ae1">Most of the plane’s inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and the incessant winds have driven many to delirium and forced others to take shelter in places where the winds die down until they sound like distant cries of torment.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7e4f1aba-78c2-4968-b345-bc58c021c06e">The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and chaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into ever more appalling forms.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="42e60b18-17c5-4eb4-abd2-931720ece5df">Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific environment. Although no two layers are alike, they are all harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the entropic nature of the Abyss. In fact, much of what one sees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, crumbling, or corroded state.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1747d767-7aaa-4701-a7aa-86ea58ff7f7a">A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of this corruption. You can substitute different corruption effects of your own creation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ec01b2ef-e3eb-4594-9976-5afbffe2bc09">After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.

A <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2071-dispel-evil-and-good" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2071-tooltip">dispel evil and good</a> spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the effect.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1f31e725-a2a3-4f22-9c58-ef52696ef691">The layers of the Abyss are defined by the demon lords who rule them, as the following examples illustrate. More information about the demon lords can be found in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="ff58709e-933b-49c1-90fe-abaf595e18f4">Monster Manual</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d19437f5-1685-4268-995c-91654b3108f9"><strong><em>The Gaping Maw.</em></strong> Demogorgon’s layer in the Abyss is a vast wilderness of brutality and horror known as the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons are overcome by fear. Reflecting Demogorgon’s dual nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a seemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine flats. The Prince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine towers, which emerge from a turbid sea. Each tower is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires constitute the fortress of Abysm, where few creatures can venture without their minds being crushed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8e914942-1726-49d7-85df-fbade20d722c"><strong><em>Thanatos.</em></strong> If Orcus had his way, all planes would resemble his dead realm of Thanatos, and all creatures would become undead under his control. Under its black sky, Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules Thanatos from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted of obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland called Oblivion’s End, the palace is surrounded by tombs and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow valleys, creating a tiered necropolis.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4cf90c83-2199-4971-ae1e-04649dfd728b"><strong><em>The Demonweb.</em></strong> Lolth’s layer is an immense network of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and cocoon-like chambers. Throughout the web, buildings, structures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught in a spider’s snare. The nature of Lolth’s web creates random portals throughout the plane, drawing such objects in from demiplanes and Material Plane worlds that figure into the schemes of the Spider Queen. Lolth’s servants also build dungeons amid the webbing, trapping and hunting Lolth’s hated enemies within crisscrossing corridors of web-mortared stone.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d73dfc2a-ead1-4f4c-9296-74b735c01eb6">Far beneath these dungeons lie the bottomless Demonweb Pits where the Spider Queen dwells. There, Lolth is surrounded by her handmaidens — <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17127-yochlol" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17127-tooltip">yochlol</a> demons created to serve her and which outrank mightier demons while in the Spider Queen’s realm.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="559c6d65-e15c-4f6a-afac-ab1baf26093e"><strong><em>The Endless Maze.</em></strong> Baphomet’s layer of the Abyss is a never-ending dungeon, the center of which holds the Horned King’s enormous ziggurat palace. A confusing jumble of crooked hallways and myriad chambers, the palace is surrounded by a mile-wide moat concealing a maddening series of submerged stairs and tunnels leading deeper into the fortress.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6a690245-e4a5-4abb-9cd9-9b94088bb702"><strong><em>The Triple Realm.</em></strong> The Dark Prince Graz’zt rules over the realm of Azzagrat, which encompasses three layers of the Abyss. His seat of power is the fantastic Argent Palace in the city of Zelatar, whose bustling markets and pleasure palaces draw visitors from across the multiverse in search of obscure magical lore and perverse delights. By Graz’zt’s command, the demons of Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly comity. However, the so-called Triple Realm holds as much danger as any other part of the Abyss, and planar visitors can vanish without a trace in its mazelike cities and in forests whose trees have serpents for branches.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="171317de-ab37-4a18-b226-d44f31d06847"><strong><em>Death Dells.</em></strong> Yeenoghu rules a layer of ravines known as Death Dells. Here, creatures must hunt to survive. Even the plants, which must bathe their roots in blood, snare the unwary. Yeenoghu’s servants, helping to sate their master’s hunger as he prowls his kingdom seeking prey, capture creatures from the Material Plane for release in the Gnoll Lord’s realm.</p>

A gray land with an ashen sky, Hades is the destination of many souls that are unclaimed by the gods of the Upper Planes or the fiendish rulers of the Lower Planes. These souls become larvae and spend eternity in this place that lacks a sun, a moon, stars, or seasons. Leaching away color and emotion, this gloom is more than most visitors can stand.

<p data-content-chunk-id="b72c43c5-a31f-485f-bea6-7376b120fb30">Gehenna is the plane of suspicion and greed. It is the birthplace of the yugoloths, which dwell here in great numbers. A volcanic mountain dominates each of the four layers of Gehenna, and lesser volcanic earthbergs drift in the air and smash into the greater mountains.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3806cc29-938e-475a-8b3b-48fd2691c928">The rocky slopes of the plane make movement here difficult and dangerous. The ground inclines at least 45 degrees almost everywhere. In places, steep cliffs and deep canyons present more challenging obstacles. Hazards include volcanic fissures that vent noxious fumes or searing flames.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="60b15216-0c2e-4c51-bb9b-592b23683dce">Gehenna has no room for mercy or compassion. The fiends living here are among the greediest and most selfish in all the multiverse.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b127ce72-83a8-481b-829b-40bfd11a3ef5">The plane’s cruel nature makes it difficult for visitors to help one another. Whenever a visitor casts a spell with a beneficial effect, including a spell that restores hit points or removes a condition, the caster must first make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails, the spell slot is expended, and the action is wasted.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="TheNineHells" data-content-chunk-id="98045d27-e824-4773-836c-4d7abbac57ee"><a href="#TheNineHells" data-content-chunk-id="cec540ea-7204-470f-9583-dab9042bc6ce"></a>The Nine Hells</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="422fc88c-f483-413d-a982-fcd7cc6c10d9">The Nine Hells of Baator inflame the imaginations of travelers, the greed of treasure seekers, and the battle fury of all moral creatures. It is the ultimate plane of law and evil and the epitome of premeditated cruelty. The devils of the Nine Hells are bound to obey the laws of their superiors, but they rebel within their individual castes. Most undertake any plot, no matter how foul, to advance themselves. At the very top of the hierarchy is Asmodeus, who has yet to be bested. If he were to be vanquished, the victor would rule the plane in turn. Such is the law of the Nine Hells.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="OptionalRulePervasiveEvil" data-content-chunk-id="524b5f2e-1e4f-4550-b6c7-1dd4c2caeca3"><a href="#OptionalRulePervasiveEvil" data-content-chunk-id="7d2180c6-b0ff-45db-b98e-eee9f0ffc3db"></a>Optional Rule: Pervasive Evil</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f534442f-2846-45c9-b15a-d49abeaa3633">Evil pervades the Nine Hells, and visitors to this plane feel its influence. At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that isn’t evil must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s alignment changes to lawful evil. The change becomes permanent if the creature doesn’t leave the plane within 1d4 days. Otherwise, the creature’s alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than the Nine Hells. Casting the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2071-dispel-evil-and-good" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2071-tooltip">dispel evil and good</a> spell on the creature also restores its original alignment.</p>

<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="TheNineLayers" data-content-chunk-id="dc9bc347-dcab-49f5-859c-c5744b4e570c"><a href="#TheNineLayers" data-content-chunk-id="f15edaf4-5c97-41fe-bd99-d7b11c401072"></a>The Nine Layers</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a6eddf18-e9a4-4b20-8fb3-7ad16c8d0bea">The Nine Hells has nine layers. The first eight are each ruled by archdevils that answer to Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fbc75943-f169-4fb1-870e-9acb824ee5a9"><strong><em>Avernus.</em></strong> No planar portals connect directly to the lower layers of the Nine Hells, by Asmodeus’s orders. As such, the first layer of Avernus is the arrival point for visitors to the plane. Avernus is a rocky wasteland with rivers of blood and clouds of biting flies. Fiery comets occasionally fall from the darkened sky and leave fuming impact craters behind. Empty battlefields are littered with weapons and bones, showing where the legions of the Nine Hells met enemies on their native soil and prevailed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fcd98bd1-7334-4a0f-92cc-77c03b4ea251">The archduchess Zariel rules Avernus, supplanting her rival, Bel, who has fallen out of Asmodeus’s favor and is forced to serve as Zariel’s advisor. Tiamat, the Queen of Evil Dragons, is a prisoner on this layer, ruling her own domain but confined to the Nine Hells by Asmodeus in accordance with some ancient contract (the terms of which are known only to Tiamat and the Lords of the Nine).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="70809177-0d17-472e-87de-dcf069177449">Zariel’s seat of power is a soaring basalt citadel festooned with the partially incinerated corpses of guests who failed to earn the archduchess’s favor. Zariel appears as an angel whose once-beautiful skin and wings have been ruined by fire. Her eyes burn with a furious white light that can cause creatures looking upon her to burst into flame.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1d6826bc-2286-44c0-92b8-0320cc547d03"><strong><em>Dis.</em></strong> Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells, is a labyrinth of canyons wedged between sheer mountains rich with iron ore. Iron roads span and wend through the canyons, watched over by the garrisons of iron fortresses perched atop jagged pinnacles.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="328ae6ee-d97a-480f-8c2d-850ead630be5">The second layer takes its name from its current lord, Dispater. A manipulator and deceiver, the archduke is devilishly handsome, bearing only small horns, a tail, and a cloven left hoof to distinguish him from a human. His crimson throne stands in the heart of the Iron City of Dis, a hideous metropolis that is the largest in the Nine Hells. Planar travelers come here to conspire with devils and to close deals with <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16965-night-hag" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16965-tooltip">night hags</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16990-rakshasa" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16990-tooltip">rakshasas</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/257235-incubus" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/257235-tooltip">incubi</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17027-succubus" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17027-tooltip">succubi</a>, and other fiends. Dispater collects a piece of every deal through special provisions that are added to contracts signed on his layer of the Nine Hells.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f80f3e87-10a5-4447-a3d3-b6acfd74cf7f">Dispater is one of Asmodeus’s most loyal and resourceful vassals, and few beings in the multiverse can outwit him. He is more obsessed than most devils with striking deals with mortals in exchange for their souls, and his emissaries work tirelessly to foster evil schemes in the Material Plane.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bc4d16a3-a787-4d67-be78-9f129982d17e"><strong><em>Minauros.</em></strong> The third layer of the Nine Hells is a stench-ridden bog. Acidic rain spills from the layer’s brown skies, thick layers of scum cover its putrid surface, and yawning pits lie in wait beneath the murk to engulf careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of ornately carved stone rise up from the bog, including the great city of Minauros for which the layer is named.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="44121581-fb9b-4534-a091-b70f78f25e5c">The slimy walls of the city rise hundreds of feet into the air, protecting the flooded halls of Mammon. The Archduke of Minauros resembles a massive serpent with the upper torso and head of a hairless, horned humanoid. Mammon’s greed is legendary, and he is one of the few archdevils who will trade favors for gold instead of souls. His lair is piled high with treasures left behind by those who tried — and failed — to best him in a deal.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f215693c-4df7-4f40-9b0d-f4042326e508"><strong><em>Phlegethos.</em></strong> Phlegethos, the fourth layer, is a fiery landscape whose seas of molten magma brew hurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke, and pyroclastic ash. Within the fire-filled caldera of Phlegethos’s largest volcano rises Abriymoch, a fortress city cast of obsidian and dark glass. With rivers of molten lava pouring down its outer walls, the city resembles the sculpted centerpiece of a gigantic, hellish fountain.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="818eb42c-9852-4323-9aeb-93c07f2b71b5">Abriymoch is the seat of power for the two archdevils who rule Phlegethos in tandem: Archduke Belial and Archduchess Fierna, Belial’s daughter. Belial is a handsome, powerfully built devil who exudes civility, even as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His daughter is a statuesque devil whose beauty encases the blackest heart in the Nine Hells. The alliance of Belial and Fierna is unbreakable, for both are aware that their mutual survival hinges on it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e793e043-909c-4e5b-8f43-1e1b5af7b129"><strong><em>Stygia.</em></strong> The fifth layer of the Nine Hells is a freezing realm of ice within which cold flames burn. A frozen sea surrounds the layer, and its gloomy sky crackles with lightning.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8ef6d7e2-c477-48a8-b9ef-ea06266e8ee1">Archduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and is now encased deep in the ice of Stygia as punishment. He rules this layer all the same, communicating telepathically with his followers and servants, both in the Nine Hells and on the Material Plane.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0086f9b5-2804-412a-a8b9-d3b4cb3261b3">Stygia is also home to its previous ruler, the serpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed by Asmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus to regain his rule. Geryon’s fall from grace has spurred much debate within the infernal courts. No one is certain whether Asmodeus had some secret cause to dismiss the archdevil or whether he is testing Geryon’s allegiance for some greater purpose.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cdebb158-bb9d-4980-84f1-eb68c3330b81"><strong><em>Malbolge.</em></strong> Malbolge, the sixth layer, has outlasted many rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess and the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell out of favor and was struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while her predecessor, Moloch, still lingers somewhere on the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus’s favor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the sides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the layer break off from time to time, creating deadly and deafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants of Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves carved into the mountainside.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2721a4d8-c0fe-4c09-986a-4c73a7abe2b7">Malbolge’s current archduchess is Asmodeus’s daughter, Glasya. She resembles a succubus with her small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from her father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on the slopes of Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars and buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on the verge of collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with cells and torture chambers, where Glasya confines and torments those who displease her.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="77ffaa10-4c01-46ac-b773-01bbc6325b82"><strong><em>Maladomini.</em></strong> The seventh layer, Maladomini, is ruin-covered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban landscape, and between them lie empty quarries, crumbling roads, slag heaps, the hollow shells of empty fortresses, and swarms of hungry flies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9b8c9db5-52cc-4fd4-bf22-99c54ce0c748">The Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul, the Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend with the lower body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul’s form was inflicted on him by Asmodeus as punishment for wavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a miserable and degenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries a curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to calamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows Baalzebul favor for reasons no other archduke can fathom, though some suspect that the Archduke of Nessus still respects the worthiness of this fallen adversary.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0355c9d9-a196-43b1-8699-7731096d5296"><strong><em>Cania.</em></strong> Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells, is an icy hellscape, whose ice storms can tear flesh from bone. Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for guests and prisoners of Cania’s ruler, the brilliant and conniving archdevil Mephistopheles.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="52085e28-91f3-4585-9646-68a081754228">Mephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar, where he plots to seize the Throne of Baator and conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus’s greatest enemy and ally, and the Archduke of Nessus appears to trust Mephistopheles’s counsel when it is offered. Mephistopheles knows he can’t depose Asmodeus until his adversary makes a grave miscalculation, and so both wait to see what circumstances might turn them against each other. Mephistopheles is also a godfather of sorts to Glasya, further complicating the relationship.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="072f6df5-52e4-4003-9066-f0769d12d452">Mephistopheles is a tall, striking devil with impressive horns and a cool demeanor. He trades in souls, as do other archdevils, but he rarely gives his time to any creatures not worthy of his personal attention. His instincts are as razor sharp as Cania’s frigid winds, and it is said that only Asmodeus has ever deceived or thwarted him.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="73a12645-5313-472c-9888-eb05515fe422"><strong><em>Nessus.</em></strong> The lowest layer of the Nine Hells, Nessus is a realm of dark pits whose walls are set with fortresses. There, pit fiend generals loyal to Asmodeus garrison their diabolical legions and plot the conquest of the multiverse. At the center of the layer stands a vast rift of unknown depth, out of which rises the great citadel-spire of Malsheem, home to Asmodeus and his infernal court.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b87de3fc-be05-471d-bc01-e471fcffe96b">Malsheem resembles a gigantic hollowed-out stalagmite. The citadel is also a prison for souls that Asmodeus has locked away for safekeeping. Convincing him to release even one of those souls comes at a steep price, and it is rumored that the Archduke of Nessus has claimed whole kingdoms in the past for such favors.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="457c5126-0c26-4b82-9ecb-cc7f2dca1852">Asmodeus most often appears as a handsome, bearded humanoid with small horns protruding from his forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing robes. He can also assume other forms and is seldom seen without his ruby-tipped scepter in hand. Asmodeus is the most cunning and well-mannered of archdevils. The ultimate evil he represents can be seen only when he wills it so, or if he forgets himself and flies into a rage.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="Acheron" data-content-chunk-id="9b733534-3c36-4e20-b82d-c9819bdbea10"><a href="#Acheron" data-content-chunk-id="64322061-dced-448e-bf73-fa8b0b34a335"></a>Acheron</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="097e07ad-0b6e-45d1-9fd6-ca77a64b1fc3">Acheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron cubes floating in an airy void. Sometimes the cubes collide. Echoes of past collisions linger throughout the plane, mingling with the sounds of armies colliding. That’s the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the spirits of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against orcs devoted to Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet, and legions assembled by other warmongering gods.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="OptionalRuleBloodlust" data-content-chunk-id="7efa9d39-cb82-49e2-a0e2-0481de6ce919"><a href="#OptionalRuleBloodlust" data-content-chunk-id="d895d11b-2adb-4e63-b22f-c9f38380598e"></a>Optional Rule: Bloodlust</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d8773b8f-e223-4cd6-a447-6c8479baf476">Acheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures by imbuing that creature with the strength to keep fighting. While on Acheron, a creature gains <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#TemporaryHitPoints" data-tooltip-href="/rules/76-tooltip">temporary hit points</a> equal to half its hit point maximum whenever it reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="Mechanus" data-content-chunk-id="cac5c3ec-e867-454d-927a-337b9babffcc"><a href="#Mechanus" data-content-chunk-id="b2b99a36-b6e2-4b0d-9783-7bb4d9f85d31"></a>Mechanus</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cab17460-ca75-4da4-a379-d8fe0007524d">On Mechanus, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork gears, all interlocked and turning according to their measure. The cogs seem to be engaged in a calculation so vast that no deity can fathom its purpose. Mechanus embodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt on those who spend time here.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aff4b190-8b63-4f0b-a79d-ca448f8457c5">Modrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus. The plane is also home to the creator of the modrons: a godlike being called Primus.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0d49675d-c344-4e6b-a969-d7f823a01d5b">While on Mechanus, creatures always use the average damage result for attacks and spells. For example, an attack that normally deals 1d10 + 5 damage always deals 10 damage on Mechanus.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="OptionalRuleImposingOrder" data-content-chunk-id="d2b9b661-5861-4661-b0b2-968652958452"><a href="#OptionalRuleImposingOrder" data-content-chunk-id="ada061e4-e7ab-49cc-b96f-36d9e95da6d4"></a>Optional Rule: Imposing Order</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="853b9f63-263f-4ecd-9ef2-7aaee92f7136">At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that isn’t lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s alignment changes to lawful neutral. The creature’s alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Mechanus. Casting the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2071-dispel-evil-and-good" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2071-tooltip">dispel evil and good</a> spell on the creature also restores its original alignment.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="Arcadia" data-content-chunk-id="d5031303-f5c5-4146-a029-2ecf4ba9ade6"><a href="#Arcadia" data-content-chunk-id="e23318ee-f0dd-4d8f-a984-b5e5b378af51"></a>Arcadia</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb9f1adc-d03a-43fd-8d95-374a4a80dceb">Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees, ruler-straight streams, orderly fields, perfect roads, and cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The mountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on Arcadia works toward the common good and a flawless form of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing intrudes on harmony.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d7c2b2c-41a6-485c-9548-19283ffadd78">Night and day are determined by an orb that floats above Arcadia’s highest peak. Half of the orb radiates sunlight and brings about the day; the other half sheds moonlight and brings on the starry night. The orb rotates evenly without fail, spreading day and night across the entire plane.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c039f808-b7d7-48a3-b67e-2fd81680f706">The weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied demigods called the Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the Wind Queen, the Lightning King, and the Rain Queen. Each one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of weather that king or queen controls.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="155fa819-9f3c-44da-b813-038d9cbe343c">Hidden below Arcadia’s beautiful mountains are numerous dwarven kingdoms that have withstood the passage of millennia. Dwarves born on this plane have the celestial type and are always brave and kindhearted, but otherwise they look and behave like normal dwarves.</p>
<h4 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="OptionalRulePlanarVitality" data-content-chunk-id="142f3035-1531-4528-a45f-6a6d3dcdad9c"><a href="#OptionalRulePlanarVitality" data-content-chunk-id="cfc2f59f-da23-4e1e-b988-b4eb3a2f3101"></a>Optional Rule: Planar Vitality</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="92e82585-876b-4502-9286-37273df21216">While on this plane, creatures can’t be <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/5-tooltip">frightened</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/11-tooltip">poisoned</a>, and they are immune to disease and poison.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="53ce5180-f566-45cc-b4f4-a4274d4ddd0c">A variety of realms exist between or beyond the other planes.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="TheOutlandsandSigil" data-content-chunk-id="87a69578-bc0e-4333-b945-b9359fb5275d"><a href="#TheOutlandsandSigil" data-content-chunk-id="3d7db95e-b18f-4a53-8eff-7d6f66f7810f"></a>The Outlands and Sigil</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8596f756-d361-4690-8635-8f47533ffb06">The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes. It is the plane of neutrality, incorporating a little of everything and keeping all aspects in a paradoxical balance — simultaneously concordant and in opposition. The plane has varied terrain, with prairies, mountains, and shallow rivers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="39fc73f1-e117-428a-bc22-15095c5976de">The Outlands is circular, like a great disk. In fact, those who envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point to the Outlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the planes. That argument might be circular, since the arrangement of the Outlands inspired the idea of the Great Wheel in the first place.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9c743c98-8cd5-4a28-80cb-8b9f355ce53d">Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, are the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built around a portal leading to one of the Outer Planes. Each town shares many of the characteristics of the plane where its gate leads. Planar emissaries often meet in these towns, so it isn’t unusual to see strange pairings, such as a celestial and a fiend arguing in a tavern while sharing a fine bottle of wine.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e8405c38-0679-4274-a09c-663153f5fad8">Given the fact that you can ride a horse in the Outlands from a heaven to a hell, a planar-themed campaign can be set there without the need for planar travel. The Outlands is the closest the Outer Planes come to being like a world on the Material Plane.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2671cce0-94fc-477e-918f-22e6bc976dec">At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of a great wheel, is the Spire — a needle-shaped mountain that rises high into the sky. Above this mountain’s narrow peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, its myriad structures built on the ring’s inner rim. Creatures standing on one of Sigil’s streets can see the city curve up over their heads and — most disconcerting of all — the far side of the city directly overhead. Called the City of Doors, this bustling planar metropolis holds countless portals to other planes and worlds.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="79000ab0-6110-44ad-a515-ae3dc16fd009">Sigil is a trader’s paradise. Goods, merchandise, and information come here from across the planes. The city sustains a brisk trade in information about the planes, particularly the command words or items required for the operation of particular portals. Portal keys of all kinds are bought and sold here.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e310f22b-5a20-4d8f-8d81-b7a9e9a766b2">The city is the domain of the inscrutable Lady of Pain, a being as old as gods and with purposes unknown to even the sages of her city. Is Sigil her prison? Is she the fallen creator of the multiverse? No one knows. Or if they do, they aren’t telling.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="Demiplanes" data-content-chunk-id="6d04b6e3-6179-41be-838a-581c07e617e1"><a href="#Demiplanes" data-content-chunk-id="3dff81c9-79b7-4b5b-8453-a6ee25b11df1"></a>Demiplanes</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="79e39f88-fcd6-4112-b9e1-95712f81ae27">Demiplanes are extradimensional spaces that come into being by a variety of means and boast their own physical laws. Some are created by spells. Others exist naturally, as folds of reality pinched off from the rest of the multiverse. Theoretically, a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2206-plane-shift" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2206-tooltip">plane shift</a> spell can carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork would be extremely hard to acquire. The <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2119-gate" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2119-tooltip">gate</a> spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="902cb693-8e88-4f05-846d-f7f890e877a5">A demiplane can be as small as a single chamber or large enough to contain an entire realm. For example, a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2362-mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2362-tooltip">Mordenkainen’s magnificent mansion</a> spell creates a demiplane consisting of a foyer with multiple adjoining rooms, while the land of Barovia (in the Ravenloft setting) exists entirely within a demiplane under the sway of its vampire lord, Strahd von Zarovich. When a demiplane is connected to the Material Plane or some other plane, entering it can be as simple as stepping through a portal or passing through a wall of mist.</p>
<h3 class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" id="TheFarRealm" data-content-chunk-id="475774a4-a392-44e5-abc8-9241590349ce"><a href="#TheFarRealm" data-content-chunk-id="122038f0-6315-454b-a2cd-1ec6a9f4e688"></a>The Far Realm</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8b2ff6e0-7b6a-444a-9149-36af21310f37">The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In fact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable geometry and biology. Aberrations such as <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17104-mind-flayer" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17104-tooltip">mind flayers</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17099-beholder" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17099-tooltip">beholders</a> are either from this plane or shaped by its strange influence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5c478eba-c716-4fa3-ac1f-88c8b40b1b3e">The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain. Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this struggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone who has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes, tentacles, and horror.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="705ce251-e3d2-446b-850b-0774d4c5974e">The Far Realm has no well-known portals, or at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once opened a vast portal to the Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and the portal’s location — even its home world — is long forgotten. Lost portals might still exist, marked by an alien magic that mutates the area around them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f5c78e51-dee8-4177-8a49-2174d77d64bc">Worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse. The most widely known worlds are the ones that have been published as official campaign settings for the D&amp;D game over the years. If your campaign takes place on one of these worlds, that world belongs to you in your campaign. Your version of the world can diverge wildly from what’s in print.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="82f4e531-3f10-4a52-8810-11a196c7e316">On <strong>Toril</strong> (the heroic-fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms setting), fantastic cities and kingdoms stand amid the remains of ancient empires and realms long forgotten. The world is vast, its dungeons rich with history. Beyond the central continent of Faerûn, Toril includes the regions of Al-Qadim, Kara-Tur, and Maztica.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="58105bfa-d0b8-478c-a0d1-f78b2fe5edd8">On <strong>Oerth</strong> (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Greyhawk setting), heroes such as Bigby and Mordenkainen are driven by greed or ambition. The hub of the region called the Flanaess is the Free City of Greyhawk, a city of scoundrels and archmagi, rife with adventure. An evil demigod, Iuz, rules a nightmarish realm in the north, threatening all civilization.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="26acf6b9-907b-40e8-ae2c-61eaf493e1d0">On <strong>Krynn</strong> (the epic-fantasy world of the Dragonlance setting), the return of the gods is overshadowed by the rise of the evil dragon queen Takhisis and her dragons and dragonarmies, which plunge the continent of Ansalon into war.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e06c832-d846-428e-81b0-b5b6f40bdc84">On <strong>Athas</strong> (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Dark Sun setting), a drop of water can be worth more than a human life. The gods have abandoned this desert world, where powerful sorcerer-kings rule as tyrants, and metal is a scarce and precious commodity.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7097b7a2-32cf-45c2-a201-621ffd5dbe22">On <strong>Eberron</strong> (the heroic-fantasy world of the Eberron setting), a terrible war has ended, giving rise to a cold war fueled by political intrigue. On the continent of Khorvaire, magic is commonplace, dragonmarked houses rival kingdoms in power, and elemental vehicles make travel to the far corners of the world possible.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4a1ca908-6f67-4267-ad85-e0d126b90f29">On <strong>Aebrynis</strong> (the heroic-fantasy world of the Birthright setting), scions born from divine bloodlines carve up the continent of Cerilia. Monarchs, prelates, guildmasters, and great wizards balance the demands of rulership against the threat of horrible abominations born from the blood of an evil god.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b2bcc1fd-66d4-4c01-bd9f-d4c90b372932">On <strong>Mystara</strong> (a heroic-fantasy world born out of the earliest editions of the D&amp;D game), diverse cultures, savage monsters, and warring empires collide. The world is further shaped by the meddling of the Immortals — former adventurers raised to nearly divine status.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="09f493cb-3d6f-4883-b9c0-ee538af9235d">Creating adventures is one of the greatest rewards of being a Dungeon Master. It’s a way to express yourself, designing fantastic locations and encounters with monsters, traps, puzzles, and conflicts. When you design an adventure, you call the shots. You do things exactly the way you want to.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0af9c407-9eab-4fd8-ab4e-849d4dcc805d">Fundamentally, adventures are stories. An adventure shares many of the features of a novel, a movie, an issue of a comic, or an episode of a TV show. Comic series and serialized TV dramas are particularly good comparisons, because of the way individual adventures are limited in scope but blend together to create a larger narrative. If an adventure is a single issue or episode, a campaign is the series as a whole.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c493931b-a1c2-402e-b54f-d420f2c28774">Whether you’re creating your own adventures or using published adventures, you’ll find advice in this chapter to help you create a fun and memorable experience for your players.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6aa4bca9-35df-4d2d-81d9-7ce621d3c542">Creating an adventure involves blending scenes of exploration, social interaction, and combat into a unified whole that meets the needs of your players and your campaign. But it’s more than that. The basic elements of good storytelling should guide you throughout this process, so your players experience the adventure as a story and not a disjointed series of encounters.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f93bcdbb-5c23-413e-8af1-b320ae9b4725">The best adventures have several things in common.</p>
<h4 id="ACredibleThreat" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="805e5c47-e6f0-497e-8d4d-0f60950814fb"><a href="#ACredibleThreat" data-content-chunk-id="eb15a597-ca8d-471a-9aab-1ecfc7062477"></a>A Credible Threat</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a37e7352-d25f-4d6d-ae6b-6883046c4982">An adventure needs a threat worthy of the heroes’ attention. The threat might be a single villain or monster, a villain with lackeys, an assortment of monsters, or an evil organization. Whatever their nature, the antagonists should have goals that the heroes can uncover and thwart.</p>
<h4 id="FamiliarTropeswithCleverTwists" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c2e2658e-b131-421b-a8f3-2b4cd0cb5479"><a href="#FamiliarTropeswithCleverTwists" data-content-chunk-id="01a60b17-f765-433d-93b2-c94341616975"></a>Familiar Tropes with Clever Twists</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7f2b37f2-77e2-40cc-8640-f005407b99da">It might seem stereotypical to build an adventure around dragons, orcs, and wizards in towers, but these are staples of fantasy storytelling. It might also seem trite to begin an adventure in a tavern, but that’s an idea that remains true to D&amp;D. Familiar story elements are fine, as long as you and the players occasionally put a spin on them. For example, the mysterious figure who presents adventurers with a quest on behalf of the king might be the king in disguise. The wizard in the tower might be a projected illusion created by a band of greedy gnome thieves to guard their loot.</p>
<h4 id="AClearFocusonthePresent" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="94213512-4a2f-4155-8316-dafa35cb79ec"><a href="#AClearFocusonthePresent" data-content-chunk-id="50aa4d3e-1551-48b1-ab7d-e714b1616b4d"></a>A Clear Focus on the Present</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1afefafb-c879-4ab9-adfb-35efa619ab67">An adventure is about the here and now. A little bit of history might be needed to set the story in motion, and the adventurers might discover interesting lore of the past in the course of the adventure. In general, let the world’s history be evident in the present situation. Instead of dealing with what happened in the past, an adventure should focus on describing the present situation, what the bad guys are up to, and how the adventurers become involved in the story.</p>
<h4 id="HeroesWhoMatter" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="625fedfd-96f8-4654-b81e-aa9a9c7c0fd3"><a href="#HeroesWhoMatter" data-content-chunk-id="66d095e8-c40e-4f13-a10d-e97e26157631"></a>Heroes Who Matter</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0f559d82-f891-40e2-9513-97aa5188537b">An adventure should allow the adventurers’ actions and decisions to matter. Though it might resemble a novel or a TV episode, an adventure needs to allow for more than one outcome. Otherwise, players can feel as if they’ve been railroaded — set onto a course that has only one destination, no matter how hard they try to change it. For example, if a major villain shows up before the end of the adventure, the adventure should allow for the possibility that the heroes might defeat that villain.</p>
<h4 id="SomethingforAllPlayerTypes" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="d4db6754-3561-4860-913e-a12aadfd30fc"><a href="#SomethingforAllPlayerTypes" data-content-chunk-id="560c8183-4d88-4730-8f41-33565484168c"></a>Something for All Player Types</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a1940dab-bb87-4ab5-adeb-97368ba320ca">As outlined in the book’s introduction, players come to the gaming table with different expectations. An adventure needs to account for the different players and characters in your group, drawing them into the story as effectively as possible.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e3a27946-7920-4099-82d9-d0e48471b930">As a starting point, think about your adventure in terms of the three basic types of activity in the game: exploration, social interaction, and combat. If your adventure includes a balance of all three, it’s likely to appeal to all types of players.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="916e1d12-7f0b-42f4-9567-15b415203338">An adventure you create for your home campaign doesn’t have to appeal to every abstract player type — only to the players sitting down at your own table. If you don’t have any players who like fighting above all else, then don’t feel you have to provide a maximum amount of combat to keep the adventure moving.</p>
<h4 id="Surprises" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="3901ffdf-24ee-4037-8470-3a47151b86ff"><a href="#Surprises" data-content-chunk-id="9b22fb80-25ed-422b-8521-0c4bfe2aa5ab"></a>Surprises</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bbe4db45-3cc8-4d2d-a5a2-f11093d8f158">Look for opportunities to surprise and delight your players. For example, the exploration of a ruined castle on a hill might lead to the discovery of a dragon’s tomb hidden underneath. A trek through the wilderness might lead to the discovery of a tower that appears only on nights of the full moon. Players remember such locations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f9be5672-872b-4e6f-b710-af9e96f793e0">Too many surprises can be off-putting to players, but adding the occasional twist gets players to adjust their tactics and think creatively. For example, you could spruce up a goblin lair by including goblin sappers with kegs of oil strapped to their backs. An attack on a villain’s estate might be complicated by the unexpected arrival of a special guest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b85c5648-8f52-4b64-825b-81d6fd26d369">When preparing for possible combat encounters, think about odd pairings of monsters, such as a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17161-hobgoblin-warlord" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17161-tooltip">hobgoblin warlord</a> and his pet <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16951-manticore" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16951-tooltip">manticore</a>, or <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17060-will-o-wisp" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17060-tooltip">will-o’-wisps</a> in league with a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17067-young-black-dragon" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17067-tooltip">young black dragon</a>. Have surprise reinforcements show up, or give the monsters unusual tactics. Throw in the occasional red herring, deception, and plot twist to keep players on their toes, but try not to go overboard. Sometimes a simple, straightforward encounter with an <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16972-orc" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16972-tooltip">orc</a> guard is just as fun for your players.</p>
<h4 id="UsefulMaps" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="7881ee37-5828-4f8b-8845-04bcdc311a9d"><a href="#UsefulMaps" data-content-chunk-id="e706b9eb-5997-4037-8d48-efd81a9e9f8e"></a>Useful Maps</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bc5ed68a-d0e3-4a78-b893-a6e48f7c3a52">A good adventure needs thoughtfully constructed maps. Wilderness areas sprinkled with interesting landmarks and other features are better than vast expanses of unchanging terrain. Dungeons that have branching corridors and similar decision points give players the opportunity to choose which direction their characters should go. Presenting the characters with options allows the players to make choices that keep the adventure unpredictable.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d2d1892-ea47-423c-bb6f-59c17253f448">If drawing maps isn’t your strong suit, the Internet is a great place to look for adventure maps that have been made freely available for use, as well as floor plans of real-world buildings and images that can inspire your mapmaking. You can also use software to help put your maps together.</p>
<h2 id="PublishedAdventures" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="36851e9c-9d14-4c93-a8a5-fd57fe82dc6f"><a href="#PublishedAdventures" data-content-chunk-id="d1befd63-0942-49f5-837e-6eb05a0e4608"></a>Published Adventures</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="17efa922-d580-4cdf-91de-3d0554bb0931">Published adventures are available for purchase if you have neither the time nor the inclination to write an adventure of your own, or if you want a change of pace. A published adventure includes a pregenerated scenario with the maps, NPCs, monsters, and treasures you need to run it. An example of a published adventure appears in the <em>D&amp;D Starter Set</em>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b9029221-aa9c-4c03-bbd1-46ada8c42b13">You can make adjustments to a published adventure so that it better suits your campaign and appeals to your players. For example, you can replace the villain of an adventure with one the players have already encountered in your campaign, or add something to the background of the adventure so that it involves your players’ characters in ways that the adventure’s designer never could have imagined.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ea5df91-dd64-4e99-9eb4-78273a8615a5">A published adventure can’t account for every action the characters might take. The nice thing about published adventures is that they allow you to focus your game preparation time on highlighting plot developments in your campaign that the adventure can’t address.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0aef9a19-3738-44d6-845e-26ac1424f424">Published adventures also provide inspiration. You might not use an adventure as written, but it might spur ideas, or you can pull out one part of it and repurpose that part for your needs. For example, you might use a map of a temple but repopulate it with monsters of your choice, or you might use a chase sequence as a model for a pursuit scene in your campaign.</p>
<h2 id="AdventureStructure" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="2971b17a-2869-4da9-8219-98e78939b991"><a href="#AdventureStructure" data-content-chunk-id="c30bf148-7a1f-4547-a423-e1c67af6d194"></a>Adventure Structure</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a24157a4-7096-4e60-95ae-5626a2be2e1e">Like every story, a typical adventure has a beginning, a middle, and an end.</p>
<h3 id="Beginning" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="3b03f46e-a5e5-4570-a9b0-77c26907afd3"><a href="#Beginning" data-content-chunk-id="b0bf3871-b551-4f67-bdb6-6c5e3e8541d1"></a>Beginning</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a14af616-bb31-4cea-b3e1-afa25d167433">An adventure starts with a hook to get the players interested. A good adventure hook piques the interest of the players and provides a compelling reason for their characters to become involved in the adventure. Maybe the adventurers stumble onto something they’re not meant to see, monsters attack them on the road, an assassin makes an attempt on their lives, or a dragon shows up at the city gates. Adventure hooks such as these can instantly draw players into your story.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa8aaaef-15e5-47b4-af88-7e39677b99f0">The beginning of a good adventure should be exciting and focused. You want the players to go home looking forward to the next session, so give them a clear sense of where the story is headed, as well as something to look forward to.</p>
<h3 id="Middle" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="5985fdbd-a514-43b4-a424-978dc3c368ff"><a href="#Middle" data-content-chunk-id="98d135ec-e0fe-4e5e-a175-b39d73141045"></a>Middle</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="15a5507c-a5a5-4060-8903-8d5fc3940e17">The middle of an adventure is where the bulk of the story unfolds. With each new challenge, the adventurers make important choices that have a clear effect on the conclusion of the adventure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9e58ed9e-2f40-40ae-b51c-8dea5f880c1b">Over the course of the adventure, the characters might discover secrets that reveal new goals or change their original goal. Their understanding of what’s going on around them might change. Maybe rumors of treasure were a trick to lure them into a death trap. Perhaps the so-called spy in the queen’s court is actually a scheme concocted by the monarch herself to seize even more power.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f52efbbd-96a2-4dd5-9fda-bb961718e554">At the same time the adventurers are working to thwart their adversaries, those adversaries are trying to carry out their nefarious plans. Such enemies might also work to hide their deeds, mislead potential adversaries, or confront problems directly, perhaps by trying to kill meddlers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="476db17a-05cf-443a-abd5-21319e4a94f0">Remember that the characters are the heroes of the story. Never let them become mere spectators, watching as events unfold around them that they can’t influence.</p>
<h3 id="Ending" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="9685c038-3417-45bc-830c-e328b1afb1ed"><a href="#Ending" data-content-chunk-id="a21a1ef6-fa71-4f2f-9e33-a079e15bd5b3"></a>Ending</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="586e75f8-34e8-488b-93a0-a592e27bc3d6">The ending encompasses the climax — the scene or encounter in which the tension building throughout the adventure reaches its peak. A strong climax should have the players on edge, with the fate of the characters and much more hanging in the balance. The outcome, which hinges on the characters’ actions and decisions, should never be a forgone conclusion.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8e77af6b-8fb3-4d4c-b1e2-0c7eea839440">An ending needn’t tie everything up in a neat bow. Story threads can be left hanging, waiting to be resolved in a later adventure. A little bit of unfinished business is an easy way to transition from one adventure to the next.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="aed4c35b-5e53-42f4-b45e-70dcb893f00c">Adventures set in crumbling dungeons and remote wilderness locations are the cornerstone of countless campaigns. Many of the greatest D&amp;D adventures of all time are location-based.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b9aa8b1a-6761-4642-97d3-661109423048">Creating a location-based adventure can be broken down into a number of steps. Each step provides tables from which you can select the basic elements of your adventure. Alternatively, roll on the tables and see how the random results inspire you. You can mix up the order of the steps.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="00bab7f9-135d-4ea6-b27c-2f4ef051a9fd">An adventure can begin with a social interaction encounter in which the adventurers find out what they must do and why. It can start with a surprise attack, or with the adventurers coming across information by accident. The best introductions arise naturally from the goals and setting of the adventure. Let the entries in the Adventure Introduction table inspire you.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e00e2902-02ec-41c7-91d9-6a801620a6a7">After you’ve created the location and the overall story of the adventure, it’s time to plan out the encounters that make up that adventure. In a location-based adventure, most encounters are keyed to specific locations on a map. For each room or wilderness area on the adventure map, your key describes what’s in that area: its physical features, as well as any encounter that plays out there. The adventure key turns a simple sketch of numbered areas on graph paper into encounters designed to entertain and intrigue your players.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e6fcdfe9-58f3-4dae-ab0d-337dc73d1532">See “<a href="#CreatingEncounters" data-content-chunk-id="414366a0-2ca6-4b8b-95be-1344c0cf4d6a">Creating Encounters</a>” later in this chapter for guidance on crafting individual encounters.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="288ca5b7-c888-4704-a57f-311d946b6079">In an event-based adventure, the focus is on what the characters and villains do and what happens as a result. The question of where those things happen is of secondary importance.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ce18bcf-4aec-4a37-a0f9-bc2873b048ca">Building an event-based adventure is more work than building a location-based one, but the process can be simplified by following a number of straightforward steps. Several steps include tables from which you can choose adventure elements or roll randomly for inspiration. As with location-based adventures, you don’t necessarily have to follow these steps in order.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9a1904de-124e-4e40-81d5-9d6d2c928ed0">Putting care into creating your villain will pay off later, since the villain plays such a pivotal role in advancing the story. Use the Adventure Villains table in the previous section to get started, and use the information in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters" data-content-chunk-id="61ed7ff8-2bff-4f01-842e-17edd4e1e8c8">chapter 4</a> to help flesh out the villain.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="859e5c1f-c89d-4d7f-987a-c3e102240529">For example, your villain might be an undead creature seeking to avenge a past imprisonment or injury. An interesting aspect of an undead villain is that this past injury might have occurred centuries ago, inspiring revenge against the descendants of those that harmed it. Imagine a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17043-vampire" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17043-tooltip">vampire</a> imprisoned by the members of a religious order of knights, and who now seeks revenge against the current members of that order.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="98d93128-6ab6-4264-8381-d4250e969a7e">Once you have a villain, it’s time to determine what steps the villain takes to achieve its goals. Create a timeline showing what the villain does and when, assuming no interference from the adventurers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e43b8aa9-ef78-4349-93be-c81ca39e1c04">Building on the previous example, you might decide that your <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17043-vampire" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17043-tooltip">vampire</a> villain murders several knights. By slipping past locked doors in gaseous form, the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17043-vampire" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17043-tooltip">vampire</a> is able to make the deaths appear natural at first, but it soon becomes clear that a depraved killer is behind the murders.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5879d209-561f-4afe-9852-028caf603b16"><em><strong>Big Event.</strong></em> The villain’s plans come to fruition during a festival, an astrological event, a holy (or unholy) rite, a royal wedding, the birth of a child, or some similar fixed time. The villain’s activities up to that point are geared toward preparation for this event.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3ed43a61-69bb-4056-b2d8-5a232e589bea"><em><strong>Crime Spree.</strong></em> The villain commits acts that become bolder and more heinous over time. A killer might start out by targeting the destitute in the city slums before moving up to a massacre in the marketplace, increasing the horror and the body count each time.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f325923-8b7f-4d4f-8ab4-15b9b608c1c2"><em><strong>Growing Corruption.</strong></em> As time passes, the villain’s power and influence grow, affecting more victims across a larger area. This might take the form of armies conquering new territory, an evil cult recruiting new members, or a spreading plague. A pretender to the throne might attempt to secure the support of the kingdom’s nobility in the days or weeks leading up to a coup, or a guild leader could corrupt the members of a town council or bribe officers of the watch.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d1765428-a974-454f-b6b0-393e000a03f9"><em><strong>One and Done.</strong></em> The villain commits a single crime and then tries to avoid the consequences. Instead of an ongoing plan to commit more crimes, the villain’s goal is to lie low or flee the scene.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7fa46fb3-4bd9-45ce-9f44-2288566caa41"><em><strong>Serial Crimes.</strong></em> The villain commits crimes one after the other, but these acts are repetitive in nature, rather than escalating to greater heights of depravity. The trick to catching such a villain lies in determining the pattern underlying the crimes. Though serial killers are a common example of this type of villain, your villain could be a serial arsonist favoring a certain type of building, a magical sickness that affects spellcasters who cast a specific spell, a thief that targets a certain kind of merchant, or a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16843-doppelganger" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16843-tooltip">doppelganger</a> kidnapping and impersonating one noble after another.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="192c8d3a-a4cf-4aaa-aa33-35e46b2df00c"><em><strong>Step by Step.</strong></em> In pursuit of its goal, the villain carries out a specific set of actions in a particular sequence. A wizard might steal the items needed to create a phylactery and become a lich, or a cultist might kidnap the priests of seven good-aligned gods as a sacrifice. Alternatively, the villain could be following a trail to find the object of its revenge, killing one victim after another while moving ever closer to the real target.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="58fa1172-281a-4e14-a9ea-f1f4ab9cc001">You can use the Event-Based Goals table to set the party’s goal. A goal can also suggest ways in which the adventurers become caught up in the villain’s plans, and what exactly they must do to foil those plans.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8b747b44-1a17-4884-ab5f-0748939eb3bc">For example, you roll a 10 on the table, indicating that the party’s goal is to secure aid from a ruler or council.

Maybe the order’s leaders have a chest of jewels stolen from the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17043-vampire" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17043-tooltip">vampire</a> centuries ago, and the characters can use the chest as bait to trap the villain.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1cb344c3-0c4c-4790-ad30-f7e35d538c37">Many event-based adventures require a well-detailed cast of NPCs. Some of these NPCs fall neatly into the categories of allies and patrons, but most are likely to be characters or creatures whose attitudes toward the adventurers remain undecided until the adventurers interact with them. (See <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters" data-content-chunk-id="0e47ba23-8747-4a4a-94a1-90a42f0b2c64">chapter 4</a> for more information on creating NPCs.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="247cc889-0fdb-42aa-b129-3b8a0eaab5b1">The elements of the adventure you’ve determined so far should provide a clear idea of what supporting characters you need to create, as well as how much detail you need to generate for each one. NPCs unlikely to become involved in combat don’t need full combat statistics, for example, just as characters heavily involved in negotiation could have ideals, bonds, and flaws. If it’s helpful, roll on the Adventure Allies or Adventure Patrons tables (in the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#LocationBasedAdventures" data-content-chunk-id="8804c5b3-6f02-4541-9cbf-4e9161e4fa26">Location-Based Adventures</a>” section, earlier in this chapter).</p>
<h4 id="5AnticipatetheVillainsReactions" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="86c7daaf-2999-4f87-9271-db9336d3013e"><a href="#5AnticipatetheVillainsReactions" data-content-chunk-id="b2950027-e1f2-4ca5-97c9-64f952db8e7d"></a>5. Anticipate the Villain’s Reactions</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="603b8564-a4cc-423f-9a8a-d3533c11c645">As the adventurers pursue their goals and foil the villain’s plans, how does the villain respond? Does it lash out in violence or send dire warnings? Does it look for simple solutions to its problems or create more complicated schemes to route around interference?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="13c28d91-3040-46ed-bdc8-5bda01c76c27">Look over the villain’s actions that you outlined in step 2. For each event arising from those actions, think about how the adventurers are likely to react. If they can prevent an action or hamper its success, what effect does that have on the villain’s overall plan? What can the villain do to compensate?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e8a5893b-df0d-47e4-a4e3-f4dfc0f49159">One way to track a villain’s reactions is by using a flowchart. This might grow out of the timeline that describes the villain’s plans, outlining how the villain gets back on track after the adventurers thwart its plans. Or the flowchart could be separate from the timeline, showing the various actions the adventurers might take and the villain’s response to those actions.</p>
<h4 id="6DetailKeyLocations" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="06d93744-863a-4f85-9401-ba6929040361"><a href="#6DetailKeyLocations" data-content-chunk-id="244b0285-2ed3-4c1f-adcf-8046b2076b99"></a>6. Detail Key Locations</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7dad2258-6d3d-48e0-90ee-e9166d06e59a">Since locations aren’t the focus of the adventure, they can be simpler and smaller than a dungeon complex or an expanse of wilderness. They might be specific locations in a city, or even individual rooms in locations where combat is likely to break out or significant exploration is needed, such as a throne room, a guild headquarters, a vampire’s crumbling manor, or a knights’ chapter house.</p>
<h4 id="7ChooseanIntroductionandaClimax" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="3317cee5-cee8-4949-9959-1f30b83f669d"><a href="#7ChooseanIntroductionandaClimax" data-content-chunk-id="2e51b0fc-1b87-4829-809f-4dc917e1cf75"></a>7. Choose an Introduction and a Climax</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4bbaaca9-5835-4669-a768-ec77648f246a">The Adventure Introduction table in the “Location-Based Adventures” section offers fun possibilities for hooking the characters into the events of your adventure, including dreams, hauntings, and a simple plea for help. The Adventure Climax table in that same section includes adventure endings that work just as well for event-based adventures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="52904e41-db75-45c7-a5e8-0ec516a300aa">For example, the Adventure Introduction table helps you decide that an ally the adventurers care about needs their help. Perhaps the NPC is a knight who believes that a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17043-vampire" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17043-tooltip">vampire</a> is trying to kill him, or a friend or relative hoping to find the knight’s murderer. This NPC brings the vampire’s crimes to the characters’ attention.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="98c0586a-6562-47c8-a455-6efaf788b013">Looking over the Adventure Climax table, you might decide to have the adventurers bait the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17043-vampire" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17043-tooltip">vampire</a> with a chest of jewels stolen from its lair. As an added twist, you decide that the vampire’s true goal is to retrieve a necklace among the jewels. The necklace is set with nine gems, and with these gems the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17043-vampire" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17043-tooltip">vampire</a> can open a gate to the Nine Hells. Should the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17043-vampire" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17043-tooltip">vampire</a> succeed, the adventurers will have a more pressing threat to deal with, as a powerful devil steps through the gate and honors some ancient pact it made with the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17043-vampire" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17043-tooltip">vampire</a>.</p>
<h4 id="8PlanEncounters" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="ac4f5734-2b96-4c1e-9158-67c12e07b2f7"><a href="#8PlanEncounters" data-content-chunk-id="912493ca-900e-4512-aab3-ddecaa3a1214"></a>8. Plan Encounters</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="afafeaa5-7276-4628-9f27-b8ae6d0a523b">After you’ve created the overall story of the adventure, it’s time to plan out the encounters on which the events of that adventure will hang. In an event-based adventure, encounters occur when the villain’s agenda intersects the path of the characters. You can’t always anticipate exactly when or where that will happen, but you can create a list of possible encounters that the adventurers might experience. This can take the form of general descriptions of the villain’s forces, details of its lieutenants and minions, as well as encounters tied to the key locations of the adventure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4db9e03d-500e-45f3-a8ca-41be3b906c4a">See “<a href="#CreatingEncounters" data-content-chunk-id="fa5130e0-f55f-4330-95c9-9c9c12326ac5">Creating Encounters</a>” later in this chapter for guidance on crafting individual encounters.</p>
<h3 id="Mysteries" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="af5189d9-b449-4ebb-9f87-f1fa0bcc1be3"><a href="#Mysteries" data-content-chunk-id="a4700d7b-d801-4971-bc82-0aa5631ceece"></a>Mysteries</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1224ea9f-758e-4d1f-abd4-b618df353429">A mystery is a form of event-based adventure that usually focuses on the adventurers’ efforts to solve a crime, usually a robbery or murder. Unlike the writer of a mystery novel, a Dungeon Master can’t always predict what the characters will do in a mystery adventure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e046ee3-b8aa-4259-9398-925b3622a422">A villain whose actions are “crime spree,” “one and done,” or “serial crimes” might inspire you to craft a mystery adventure around that villain’s crimes. Similarly, if the adventurers’ goals include determining the villain’s identity, that might be part of a mystery.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="213251db-0431-4df6-8ede-667a2fb69d90">To build a mystery adventure, follow the steps for creating any event-based adventure. Then consider three additional elements for the adventure: the victim, the suspects, and the clues.</p>
<h4 id="Victim" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="2494c640-8235-45b5-9df2-460c86c3446f"><a href="#Victim" data-content-chunk-id="ea58b01e-d62c-4cb7-ae47-02c4d76cd0a8"></a>Victim</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="74bd3290-86c3-44fa-af9c-51664bbe6324">Think about the victim’s relationship to the villain. Though you can create a strong scenario with no such relationship, part of what makes a mystery exciting is the discovery of the twisted connections between NPCs and how those connections led to the crime. A random killing might be just as mysterious, but it lacks that emotional connection.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ecf084a-6aa9-4938-9fc6-7b6a2cafc7dd">Also look for a connection between the victim and one or more of the adventurers. One surefire way to draw adventurers into a mystery — including making them suspects — is to make the victim someone with whom the characters are acquainted.</p>
<h4 id="Suspects" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="0ae5f8f5-847f-4508-9684-b1f461448613"><a href="#Suspects" data-content-chunk-id="6e7f2f90-05ec-4e5d-99ed-61679ee01ca2"></a>Suspects</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ff2cf3ea-9c44-43d8-b00d-ae06edeff9d5">Your cast of characters should include an assortment of other NPCs who didn’t commit the crime, but who had the motive, the means, or the opportunity to do so. Suspects might be obvious or could come to light during the investigation. One technique often used in detective fiction is to create a closed circle of suspects — a finite number of individuals whose circumstances make them the only possible suspects.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="df647f4d-4b95-44ff-9c27-43150fc612cb">One tip for keeping the players and the adventurers guessing as to the identity of the villain is to ensure that more than one suspect has a secret. When questioned by the adventurers, a suspect might appear nervous or attempt to lie, despite being innocent of the crime. A secret business deal, an illicit affair, a dark past, or an uncontrolled vice are flaws that make suspects more interesting than NPCs with nothing to hide.</p>
<h4 id="Clues" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="cc7c206e-3b00-4d33-a149-0b6de163b712"><a href="#Clues" data-content-chunk-id="2230cfc2-aba0-4076-949b-a958cedd2f93"></a>Clues</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0cf00e53-ecd2-4d86-a7c2-597b764fc004">Clues point to the identity of the villain. Some clues are verbal, including the statements of the suspects and witnesses that help the adventurers develop a picture of what happened. Other clues are physical, such as an unfinished message written in the victim’s blood, a piece of jewelry left behind by the villain, or a weapon found hidden in a suspect’s room.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cb4e7c3d-7b39-4285-b5e0-023fc9227691">A clue should connect a suspect to the crime, typically by shedding light on the suspect’s motive, means, or opportunity. Some clues connect the wrong suspect to the crime, leading the adventurers in the wrong direction. Eventually, they must find other clues pointing in a different direction, or come across evidence that absolves the suspect.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6ad4c790-a636-4caf-95f2-b5f3bd303611">It’s better to populate your adventure with too many clues than too few. If the adventurers solve the mystery too quickly, you might feel some disappointment but the players will feel a sense of accomplishment. If the mystery is too hard, though, the players will become frustrated. Since you have to account for the possibility that the adventurers will overlook some clues, use redundant clues to ensure that the players have the knowledge needed to catch the villain.</p>
<h3 id="Intrigue" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="a5380a11-892e-4063-b86a-7b2361248f4e"><a href="#Intrigue" data-content-chunk-id="34fe54c1-f121-4143-8a25-cc2899eda7d2"></a>Intrigue</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa3d8423-5397-4ede-b475-e1922f4c2335">Intrigue adventures are event-based adventures that revolve around power struggles. Intrigues are common in the courts of the nobility, but power struggles can play out just as easily in merchants’ guilds, crime syndicates, and temple hierarchies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="29c79623-3945-4a41-91e4-e518e7733574">Rather than dark events and villainous plots, an intrigue adventure typically revolves around the exchange of favors, the rise and fall of individuals in power and influence, and the honeyed words of diplomacy. A prince’s efforts to be named heir to the throne, a courtier’s ambition to sit at the queen’s right hand, and a merchant’s desire to open a trade route through enemy lands are the stuff of intrigue.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef47f023-12de-4c69-bb58-1632b8ee9882">Like all adventures, an intrigue adventure works only if the players and their characters are invested in the outcome. If no one cares who the king’s chamberlain is or who has logging rights in the elven woods, throwing the characters into an adventure centered on those issues will fall flat. However, if having the ear of the king’s chamberlain means the characters can use royal soldiers to help them defend their own stronghold on the borderlands, players will be invested in the scenario.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="79120411-d4fe-447a-a31b-25a128d0847a">Adventurers usually become embroiled in intrigue when they need a favor from a powerful creature and have to perform a favor in exchange, or when the plots of powerful NPCs get in the way of the characters achieving their goals. Some of the event-based goals discussed earlier in this section lend themselves to intrigue adventures. For example, if the adventurers must uncover a conspiracy, negotiate a peace treaty, or secure aid from a ruler or council, you might be looking at an intrigue adventure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="78396c1f-c8ee-4642-bcd6-86966cd7fb32">The process of creating an intrigue adventure is similar to creating any other event-based adventure, with two main differences: how villains are handled and how the characters can gain influence.</p>
<h4 id="Villains" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="1d8f9e1d-32da-4e29-8a59-2ba5adba1e48"><a href="#Villains" data-content-chunk-id="4954edef-b92f-4ef3-8f5f-be033762da96"></a>Villains</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="00141dcd-5f1a-4bea-b2b0-65e2665649fa">Some intrigue adventures are driven by the actions of a single villain, such as a noble plotting the assassination of a monarch. However, an intrigue adventure can have multiple villains or no villain at all.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37dc9605-7cb9-4d38-b613-834af80e94d7"><em><strong>No Villain.</strong></em> Some intrigue adventures revolve around the exchange of favors in the absence of a villain. For this type of adventure, skip steps 1 and 2 of the event-based adventure creation process (the villain and the villain’s actions) and move straight to the adventurers’ goals in step 3. Figure out why the adventurers become involved in the intrigue, then spend the bulk of your time creating the NPCs they interact with.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e7d2f85a-d521-440d-99f1-f301f13b6895"><em><strong>Many Villains.</strong></em> Some intrigue adventures feature a whole cast of villains, each with its own goals, motivations, and methods. The adventurers might be drawn into the struggle of a court full of nobles vying for the throne in the wake of the king’s sudden death, or could find themselves negotiating the end to a deadly turf war among thieves’ guilds. In this scenario, you’ll spend a lot of time on steps 1 and 2, developing each of the major NPCs as a distinct villain with an agenda.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="400d2f64-ae68-4126-ac36-e045933efd1d">In step 5, you’ll need to develop each villain’s reactions to the potential setbacks they face during the adventure. However, you don’t need to put equal effort into detailing the reactions of every villain, since many will likely echo each other or cancel each other out. Whenever the adventurers foil one villain’s plans, it might let another villain’s schemes move forward, advancing the adventure whether the foiled villain reacts or not.</p>
<h4 id="Influence" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="5417d35f-c41c-4978-8f29-edc32546e28d"><a href="#Influence" data-content-chunk-id="e97a6463-bd38-4ad8-a0a5-772f30201abb"></a>Influence</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f2187163-6787-473b-ab23-edead3e4d134">Depending on the scenario, you might want to track the party’s influence with different NPCs or factions, or even track influence separately for each character.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f259029d-7524-424d-b82a-5060582766ec">One way to handle influence is to treat it like inspiration. A character gains influence in a certain situation only if you grant it, and bringing influence into play requires spending it. Characters can gain influence by doing favors for NPCs, advancing the cause of an organization, or demonstrating their power and heroism, at your discretion. As with inspiration, a character can choose to spend influence to gain advantage on a roll relevant to that influence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b1d325d3-e245-43a3-a01b-509d1ec8a0c7">Another way to handle influence is to treat it like renown (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/a-world-of-your-own#Renown" data-content-chunk-id="4b5ffc18-3419-49bb-b0fb-4e4c777cec95">chapter 1</a>), allowing characters to gain renown at court and within various key factions.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="35d049ca-6ee1-48ea-890b-8edc949ac0dc">You can base an entire adventure on a framing event or use such an event to grab the players’ interest. The Framing Events table presents several ideas, or you can use it to inspire your own framing event.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="abdc6a2c-c00e-451a-9f11-1322f1d3de93"><em><strong>Ally Quandary.</strong></em> The adventurers have a better chance of achieving their goal with the help of two individuals whose expertise is all but essential. However, these two NPCs hate each other and refuse to work together even if the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The adventurers must choose the NPC that is most likely to help them accomplish their goal.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6b1ee93-ae84-4948-aa3d-3cebf159d9d4"><em><strong>Friend Quandary.</strong></em> An NPC that one or more of the characters cares about makes an impossible demand on the characters. A love interest might demand that a character turn away from a dangerous quest. A dear friend might plead with the characters to spare the villain’s life, to prove that they are better than the villain. A weak NPC might beg for a chance to win favor from the characters by undertaking a dangerous but essential mission.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4bf9c2e4-a58e-49ec-9a8d-0af2f903c061"><em><strong>Honor Quandary.</strong></em> A character is forced to choose between victory and a personal oath or code of honor. A paladin who has sworn an oath of virtue might realize that the clearest path to success lies in deceit and subterfuge. A loyal cleric might be tempted to disobey the orders of his or her faith. If you present this quandary, be sure to provide an opportunity for a character to atone for violating his or her oath.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="24f55946-fc92-4e93-b9c4-0b12bad1939f"><em><strong>Rescue Quandary.</strong></em> The adventurers must choose between catching or hurting the villain and saving innocent lives. For example, the adventurers might learn that the villain is camped nearby, but they also learn that another part of the villain’s forces is about to march into a village and burn it to the ground. The characters must choose between taking out the villain or protecting innocent villagers, some of whom might be friends or family members.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="691a7a14-1387-4904-b1cf-3b0f0d7979e9"><em><strong>Respect Quandary.</strong></em> Two important allies give conflicting directions or advice to the adventurers. Perhaps the high priest counsels the characters to negotiate peace with militaristic elves in the nearby forest, while a veteran warrior urges them to prove their strength with a decisive first strike. The adventurers can’t follow both courses, and whichever ally they choose, the other loses respect for them and might no longer aid them.</p>

Side quests are peripheral to the characters’ primary goal, but successfully completing a side quest might provide a benefit toward completing the primary goal.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="49ba5e42-3e17-49f3-9d76-6657f94fdede">Encounters are the individual scenes in the larger story of your adventure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e590d21-fd02-444b-9364-d55b787097df">First and foremost, an encounter should be fun for the players. Second, it shouldn’t be burden for you to run. Beyond that, a well-crafted encounter usually has a straightforward objective as well as some connection to the overarching story of your campaign, building on the encounters that precede it while foreshadowing encounters yet to come.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7d265858-7b76-4be9-a833-6d7412a7df35">An encounter has one of three possible outcomes: the characters succeed, the characters partly succeed, or the characters fail. The encounter needs to account for all three possibilities, and the outcome needs to have consequences so that the players feel like their successes and failures matter.</p>
<h3 id="CharacterObjectives" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="45cf8e6d-eb83-4270-abea-285db144cca2"><a href="#CharacterObjectives" data-content-chunk-id="a84dd883-8836-404f-8178-781be6ae0e0e"></a>Character Objectives</h3>

</figure>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5605d4ba-6d0c-455b-a7ba-ad286cc504f2">When players don’t know what they’re supposed to do in a given encounter, anticipation and excitement can quickly turn to boredom and frustration. A transparent objective alleviates the risk of players losing interest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4bdcca7b-35f0-42db-be5b-bd79546b12e1">For example, if the overall story of your adventure involves a quest to deliver a priceless relic to a remote monastery, each encounter along the way is an opportunity to introduce a smaller objective that moves the quest forward. Encounters during the trip might see the adventurers accosted by enemies determined to steal the relic, or by monsters that are constantly threatening the monastery.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e4a03071-6afd-47ff-8013-a3f0b38a22d0">Some players create their own objectives, which is to be expected and encouraged. It is, after all, as much the players’ campaign as yours. For example, a character might try to bribe enemies rather than fight them, or chase after a fleeing enemy to see where it goes. Players who ignore objectives will have to deal with the consequences, which is another important facet of encounter design.</p>
<h4 id="SampleObjectives" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c4f0f419-786f-4ba9-9345-fd8ddc78d612"><a href="#SampleObjectives" data-content-chunk-id="3479b994-ebf0-4012-b723-e799525453f6"></a>Sample Objectives</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd7d7b16-5b07-4d9d-95e1-f242f298145d">The following objectives can be used as foundations for encounters. Although these objectives focus on a single encounter during an adventure, using the same objective in multiple encounters allows you to combine those encounters into a larger obstacle or problem the adventurers must overcome.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d2263678-58ea-425b-bf10-2175374ea1ee"><em><strong>Make Peace.</strong></em> The characters must convince two opposing groups (or their leaders) to end the conflict that embroils them. As a complication, the characters might have enemies on one or both of the opposing sides, or some other group or individual might be instigating the conflict to further its own ends.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c8bf9802-3b5d-438b-b40b-28783c4f55ed"><em><strong>Protect an NPC or Object.</strong></em> The characters must act as bodyguards or protect some object in their custody. As a complication, the NPC under the party’s protection might be cursed, diseased, prone to panic attacks, too young or too old to fight, or apt to risk the lives of the adventurers through dubious decisions. The object the adventurers have sworn to protect might be sentient, cursed, or difficult to transport.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4bdf091d-d930-4967-bfd6-b6b2ac936c33"><em><strong>Retrieve an Object.</strong></em> The adventurers must gain possession of a specific object in the area of the encounter, preferably before combat finishes. As a complication, enemies might desire the object as much as the adventurers do, forcing both parties to fight for it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ea1abba5-62f9-413d-8210-2cbb35a02974"><em><strong>Run a Gauntlet.</strong></em> The adventurers must pass through a dangerous area. This objective is similar to retrieving an object insofar as reaching the exit is a higher priority than killing opponents in the area. A time limit adds a complication, as does a decision point that might lead characters astray. Other complications include traps, hazards, and monsters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="470e3af1-4dee-431a-8a88-eeffd74ce5e5"><em><strong>Sneak In.</strong></em> The adventurers need to move through the encounter area without making their enemies aware of their presence. Complications might ensue if they are detected.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5e117691-f777-4386-bc40-ec60da9b596e"><em><strong>Stop a Ritual.</strong></em> The plots of evil cult leaders, malevolent warlocks, and powerful fiends often involve rituals that must be foiled. Characters engaged in stopping a ritual must typically fight their way through evil minions before attempting to disrupt the ritual’s powerful magic. As a complication, the ritual might be close to completion when the characters arrive, imposing a time limit. Depending on the ritual, its completion might have immediate consequences as well.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="766876d6-405d-4234-9e8c-f77f3086b555"><em><strong>Take Out a Single Target.</strong></em> The villain is surrounded by minions powerful enough to kill the adventurers. The characters can flee and hope to confront the villain another day, or they can try to fight their way through the minions to take out their target. As a complication, the minions might be innocent creatures under the villain’s control. Killing the villain means breaking that control, but the adventurers must endure the minions’ attacks until they do.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="074eb14e-ee67-4e4b-8f90-7f29126084b0">When creating a combat encounter, let your imagination run wild and build something your players will enjoy. Once you have the details figured out, use this section to adjust the difficulty of the encounter.</p>
<h4 id="CombatEncounterDifficulty" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="d42366a8-02b7-4daf-93cd-0814de9bc6ff"><a href="#CombatEncounterDifficulty" data-content-chunk-id="9dab57cf-7413-41ec-9efa-35572ee5c906"></a>Combat Encounter Difficulty</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a57bfb52-2069-489b-9f30-9f113ba47803">There are four categories of encounter difficulty.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da03ffa6-6db5-4437-9c42-09fa0c296a82"><em><strong>Easy.</strong></em> An easy encounter doesn’t tax the characters’ resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="de842ff7-d9e3-4833-aff5-7ded74d32409"><em><strong>Medium.</strong></em> A medium encounter usually has one or two scary moments for the players, but the characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use healing resources.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cc2c7399-6a1c-4899-bac2-9bea596c8bd6"><em><strong>Hard.</strong></em> A hard encounter could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more characters might die.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="89a65caf-24fa-4bea-94c5-a52082c308e8"><em><strong>Deadly.</strong></em> A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or more player characters. Survival often requires good tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.</p>

<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="ChallengeRating">
<p data-content-chunk-id="f57501b7-b4ac-4828-aa38-770975f865cf">CHALLENGE RATING</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="875dd9ab-76d9-4100-871a-1f27c647f647">When putting together an encounter or adventure, especially at lower levels, exercise caution when using monsters whose challenge rating is higher than the party’s average level. Such a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to take out adventurers of a lower level. For example, an <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogre</a> has a challenge rating of 2, but it can kill a 1st-level wizard with a single blow.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="221eefb6-4eb0-4f82-bdd6-9042abad78ee">In addition, some monsters have features that might be difficult or impossible for lower-level characters to overcome. For example, a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16990-rakshasa" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16990-tooltip">rakshasa</a> has a challenge rating of 13 and is immune to spells of 6th level and lower. Spellcasters of 12th level or lower have no spells higher than 6th level, meaning that they won’t be able to affect the rakshasa with their magic, putting the adventurers at a serious disadvantage. Such an encounter would be significantly tougher for the party than the monster’s challenge rating might suggest.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a7702afa-9924-4e82-bb58-279ebf090f9a"><em><strong>Determine XP Thresholds.</strong></em> First, determine the experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table below has four XP thresholds for each character level, one for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a character’s level to determine his or her XP thresholds. Repeat this process for every character in the party.</p>
</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="35544194-713e-4a1b-b638-f7e974ddacf6">

This determines the party’s XP threshold. You’ll end up with four totals, one for each category of encounter difficulty.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9def9b1f-dddd-40e7-bee6-ebf7730c956a">For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character, the party’s totaled XP thresholds would be as follows:</p>

The more monsters there are, the more attack rolls you’re making against the characters in a given round, and the more dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge an encounter’s difficulty, multiply the total XP of all the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the Encounter Multipliers table.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5f3d5d97-c44c-4dbc-9e86-99750daa5f70">For example, if an encounter includes four monsters worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. This adjusted value is <em>not</em> what the monsters are worth in terms of XP; the adjusted value’s only purpose is to help you accurately assess the encounter’s difficulty.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b88ef000-6992-49d8-98b7-b821632953cc">A party can’t benefit from a short rest between parts of a multipart encounter, so they won’t be able to spend Hit Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that require a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is higher than one-third of the party’s expected XP total for the adventuring day (see “The Adventuring Day,” below), the encounter is going to be tougher than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="91f448b6-000f-4ba7-a930-8657beb2e059">You can build an encounter if you know its desired difficulty. The party’s XP thresholds give you an XP budget that you can spend on monsters to build easy, medium, hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than their base XP values would indicate (see step 4).</p>

</figure>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2962ca1c-778e-425a-8e6d-21dad32fcca2">For example, using the party from step 2, you can build a medium encounter by making sure that the adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP (the party’s threshold for a medium encounter) and no more than 825 XP (the party’s threshold for a hard encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such as a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16951-manticore" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16951-tooltip">manticore</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16975-owlbear" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16975-tooltip">owlbear</a>) is worth 700 XP, so that’s one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each one will count for 1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16841-dire-wolf" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16841-tooltip">dire wolves</a> (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the party as well.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8a7e9f08-3cf1-42e5-979f-f6416d13e40e">To assist with this approach, the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="d14ed2ca-8c01-495b-a428-af5dca8cac53">Monster Manual</a> can be sorted to present a list of all monsters in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="f45b28a2-1aba-4fc0-aa4a-f5c5f6872e42">Monster Manual</a> organized by challenge rating.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="83cd7b6b-04d8-4146-afad-6705c6d43241">Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers can get through more. If it has more deadly encounters, they can handle fewer.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1c89b45c-6d78-47b0-ac8e-32196d6c7ad2">In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an encounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how far the party is likely to progress.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8fd8ce83-0382-429e-9154-712833989d67">For each character in the party, use the Adventuring Day XP table to estimate how much XP that character is expected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all party members to get a total for the party’s adventuring day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP value for encounters the party can handle before the characters will need to take a long rest.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c092e1c9-3e07-4f1c-a6a2-ec3d164693e2">In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the party will likely need to take two short rests, about one-third and two-thirds of the way through the day.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fa35312a-3466-4976-bd4b-aebdd7db4250">An encounter can be made easier or harder based on the choice of location and the situation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3fde3379-2a5b-4bc7-a26b-cd953b64ab62">Increase the difficulty of the encounter by one step (from easy to medium, for example) if the characters have a drawback that their enemies don’t. Reduce the difficulty by one step if the characters have a benefit that their enemies don’t. Any additional benefit or drawback pushes the encounter one step in the appropriate direction. If the characters have both a benefit and a drawback, the two cancel each other out.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="160b5ea9-3eee-4c70-a52e-16ad34e622b9">Situational drawbacks include the following:</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e6a16788-58c4-4f11-9118-696bfc7cfa04">As characters explore a wilderness area or dungeon complex, they are bound to encounter the unexpected. Random encounters are a way to deliver the unexpected. They are usually presented in the form of a table. When a random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult the table to determine what the party encounters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1616d2f8-bd11-43d4-85fa-e0eda4c0dce9">Some players and DMs view random encounters in an adventure as time-wasters, yet well-designed random encounters can serve a variety of useful purposes:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="e4375bc1-91cc-4dd7-ba84-155676e3d628">
<li data-content-chunk-id="73f4f6c2-2296-414c-8836-eb5a9290f118"><strong>Create urgency.</strong> Adventurers don’t tend to dawdle if the threat of random encounters is hanging over their heads. Wanting to avoid wandering monsters creates a strong incentive to look for a safe place to rest. (Rolling dice behind the DM screen can often accomplish this even without an actual encounter.)</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="be953fdc-a975-4531-9882-411134049fca"><strong>Establish atmosphere.</strong> The appearance of thematically linked creatures as random encounters helps to create a consistent tone and atmosphere for an adventure. For example, an encounter table filled with bats, wraiths, giant spiders, and zombies creates a sense of horror, and tells the adventurers to prepare for battle with even more powerful creatures of the night.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="aa6fe90a-b76a-4acb-99cc-3a233960d616"><strong>Drain character resources.</strong> Random encounters can drain the party’s hit points and spell slots, leaving the adventurers feeling underpowered and vulnerable. This creates tension, as players are forced to make decisions based on the fact that their characters aren’t at full strength.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="7054362b-75c5-4ff6-a90e-6f7d365b683f"><strong>Provide assistance.</strong> Some random encounters can benefit the characters instead of hindering or harming them. Helpful creatures or NPCs might provide the adventurers with useful information or assistance when they need it most.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="85f1d832-36a0-4a68-bf3f-6c6135d2da86"><strong>Add interest.</strong> Random encounters can reveal details about your world. They can foreshadow danger or provide hints that will help the adventurers prepare for the encounters to come.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="8b4016de-74e7-4b6e-81aa-2e788ae99264"><strong>Reinforce campaign themes.</strong> Random encounters can remind the players of the major themes of the campaign. For example, if your campaign features an ongoing war between two nations, you might design random encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present nature of the conflict. In friendly territory, your tables might include bedraggled troops returning from battle, refugees fleeing invading forces, heavily guarded caravans full of weapons, and lone messengers on horseback riding for the front lines. While characters are in hostile territory, the tables might include battlefields littered with the recently slain, armies of evil humanoids on the march, and improvised gibbets holding the bodies of deserters who tried to flee the conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="253bf3cc-40ec-4e71-8de4-1df8e37da98b">Random encounters should never be tiresome to you or your players. You don’t want the players to feel as if they aren’t making progress because another random encounter brings their progress to a halt whenever they try to move forward. Likewise, you don’t want to spend time distracted by random encounters that add nothing to the adventure narrative or that interfere with the overall pace you’re trying to set.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="89fa9542-7931-4796-ae77-5062cc365a73">Not every DM likes to use random encounters. You might find that they distract from your game or are otherwise causing more trouble than you want. If random encounters don’t work for you, don’t use them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d1c33a9d-e82a-4c36-9289-a58c54667f0a">Because you want random encounters to build on the intended narrative of a game session, not compete with it, you should choose the placement of those encounters carefully. Think about a random encounter under any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="0df24d58-a469-49d8-a948-6c709ab990e8">
<li data-content-chunk-id="a634c3a3-123c-47d9-90b2-87936a2dbb13">The players are getting off track and slowing down the game.</li>

<li data-content-chunk-id="23e22f88-c1e5-4fdf-9b27-b361cb3a4de8">The characters are undertaking a long, uneventful journey.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="94b169bc-0d99-4686-be90-55facbe44dcd">You decide when a random encounter happens, or you roll. Consider checking for a random encounter once every hour, once every 4 to 8 hours, or once during the day and once during a long rest — whatever makes the most sense based on how active the area is.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cb582e9f-d8ae-4a01-9727-dd452847020b">If you roll, do so with a d20. If the result is 18 or higher, a random encounter occurs. You then roll on an appropriate random encounter table to determine what the adventurers meet, rerolling if the die result doesn’t make sense given the circumstances.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="62160c56-0c86-46e2-aa60-7b4fe088616c">Random encounter tables might be provided as part of the adventure you’re running, or you can use the information in this chapter to build your own.

<p data-content-chunk-id="9f0831be-662f-40e5-a832-daa4b39138ce">Not every run-in with another creature counts as a random encounter. Encounter tables don’t usually include rabbits hopping through the undergrowth, harmless rats scurrying through dungeon halls, or average citizens walking through the streets of a city. Random encounter tables present obstacles and events that advance the plot, foreshadow important elements or themes of the adventure, and provide fun distractions.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="533a26a8-8df0-4749-aa68-2167108676a4">Creating your own random encounter tables is straightforward. Determine what sort of encounters might occur in a given dungeon area, figure out the likelihood of a particular encounter occurring, then arrange the results. An “encounter” in this case could be a single monster or NPC, a group of monsters or NPCs, a random event (such as an earth tremor or a parade), or a random discovery (such as a charred corpse or a message scrawled on a wall).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be5ca12e-54af-480e-b9a9-1b4aefdd363c"><em><strong>Assemble Your Encounters.</strong></em> Once you’ve established a location through which the adventurers are likely to pass, be it a wilderness area or dungeon complex, make a list of creatures that might be found wandering there. If you’re not sure which creatures to include, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/appendix-b-monster-lists" data-content-chunk-id="a844d258-2212-42fe-8c00-f19b4f80fa57">appendix B</a> has lists of monsters organized by terrain type.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="07b8c196-251f-4a1d-a666-dbb1b2e56937">For a sylvan woodland, you might create a table that includes <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16821-centaur" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16821-tooltip">centaurs</a>, faerie dragons, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17192-pixie" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17192-tooltip">pixies</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17020-sprite" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17020-tooltip">sprites</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16849-dryad" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16849-tooltip">dryads</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17005-satyr" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17005-tooltip">satyrs</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16809-blink-dog" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16809-tooltip">blink dogs</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16857-elk" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16857-tooltip">elks</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16975-owlbear" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16975-tooltip">owlbears</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17037-treant" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17037-tooltip">treants</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16889-giant-owl" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16889-tooltip">giant owls</a>, and a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17042-unicorn" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17042-tooltip">unicorn</a>. If elves inhabit the forest, the table might also include elf <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16848-druid" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16848-tooltip">druids</a> and elf <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17007-scout" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17007-tooltip">scouts</a>. Perhaps gnolls are threatening the woods, so adding <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16904-gnoll" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16904-tooltip">gnolls</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16930-hyena" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16930-tooltip">hyenas</a> to the table would be a fun surprise for players. Another fun surprise would be a wandering predator, such as a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17130-displacer-beast" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17130-tooltip">displacer beast</a> that likes to hunt blink dogs. The table could also use a few random encounters of a less monstrous nature, such as a grove of burned trees (the handiwork of the gnolls), an ivy-covered elven statue, and a plant with glowing berries that turn creatures <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/8-tooltip">invisible</a> when ingested.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="70828928-5865-4c7b-a8fb-289cde0fd08b">When choosing monsters for a random encounter table, try to imagine why the monsters would be encountered outside their lairs. What is each monster up to? Is it on patrol? Hunting for food? Searching for something? Also consider whether a creature is moving stealthily as it travels through the area.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="947197e4-4775-4edb-90cb-b33f8da939b9">As with planned encounters, random encounters are more interesting when they happen in memorable locations. Outdoors the adventurers might be crossing a forest clearing when they encounter a unicorn or be pushing through a dense section of forest when they come across a nest of spiders. Crossing a desert, characters might discover an oasis haunted by wights or a rocky outcropping on which a blue dragon perches.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="978c9552-ca0c-4708-b2d2-28c529dd562f"><em><strong>Probabilities.</strong></em> A random encounter table can be created in a number of ways, ranging from simple (roll 1d6 for one of six possible encounters) to complicated (roll percentile dice, modify for time of day, and cross-index the modified number with the dungeon level). The sample encounter table presented here uses a range of 2 to 20 (nineteen entries total), generated using 1d12 + 1d8. The probability curve ensures that encounters appearing in the middle of the table are more likely to occur than encounters placed at the beginning or end of the table. A roll of 2 or 20 is rare (about a 1 percent chance of either), while each of the rolls from 9 to 13 occurs a little over 8 percent of the time.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6d8c0721-aff2-49c3-b50f-9d879d32c67c">Random encounters need not be level-appropriate challenges for the adventurers, but it’s considered bad form to slaughter a party using a random encounter, since most players consider this ending to be an unsatisfying one.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="67c6c3ea-3992-4ae4-b6f1-8f12d24c6ff8">Not all random encounters with monsters need to be resolved through combat. A 1st-level party of adventurers could have a random encounter with a young dragon circling above a forest canopy in search of a quick meal, but the characters should have the option to hide or bargain for their lives if the dragon spots them. Similarly, the party might encounter a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17024-stone-giant" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17024-tooltip">stone giant</a> roaming the hills, but it might have no intention of harming anyone. In fact, it might shy away from the party because of its reclusive nature. The giant might attack only characters who annoy it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="feaf000d-bfff-4178-856a-f9ca8512a61f">That said, a random encounter table usually includes hostile (though not necessarily evil) monsters that are meant to be fought. The following monsters are considered appropriate combat challenges:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="931fcc4a-adbf-4e89-bd1d-1113b61c5f47">
<li data-content-chunk-id="4f2e9a31-0009-4898-8670-05542b75026f">A single monster with a challenge rating equal to or lower than the party’s level.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="d812d3aa-92a1-4ce5-823b-5433c9575ea4">A group of monsters whose adjusted XP value constitutes an easy, medium, or hard challenge for the party, as determined using the encounter-building guidelines earlier in this chapter.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="07b14bad-9aa8-44cf-811d-b4e38da05eeb">Nothing brings your adventures and campaigns to life better than a cast of well-developed NPCs. That said, NPCs in your game rarely need as much complexity as a well-crafted character in a novel or movie. Most NPCs are bit players in the campaign, whereas the adventurers are the stars.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fb7c99d7-b55c-4a03-ae70-d62f6950fb19">An NPC doesn’t need combat statistics unless it poses a threat. Moreover, most NPCs need only one or two qualities to make them memorable.

<p data-content-chunk-id="c421bf13-cdd8-4db9-b54f-72f8a9e96510">Named monsters that play a significant role in an adventure deserve the same attention you would give to a humanoid NPC, with mannerisms as well as ideals, bonds, flaws, and secrets. If a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17099-beholder" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17099-tooltip">beholder</a> mastermind is behind the criminal activities in a city, don’t rely solely on the entry in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="33c18732-a8de-44cf-9a5c-bde7368d8deb">Monster Manual</a> to describe the creature’s appearance and personality. Take the time to give it a bit of background, a distinctive quirk of appearance, and especially an ideal, a bond, and a flaw.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="298656ac-fcb9-4278-be0d-8c24a362dd72">As an example, consider the Xanathar, a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17099-beholder" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17099-tooltip">beholder</a> that runs extensive criminal operations in the city of Waterdeep. The Xanathar’s spherical body is covered in leathery flesh with a texture similar to cobblestones. Its eyestalks are jointed like the legs of an insect, and some of the stalks have magic rings on them. The Xanathar’s speech is slow and deliberate, and it prefers to turn its central eye away from creatures it speaks to. Like all <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17099-beholder" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17099-tooltip">beholders</a>, it sees other creatures as inferiors, though it understands the usefulness of its humanoid minions. The Xanathar uses the sewers beneath Waterdeep to access virtually any location within or under the city.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="94f7ea78-126c-4da1-b42b-98d733bdd2ce">The Xanathar’s ideal is greed. It craves powerful magic items and surrounds itself with gold, platinum, and precious gems. Its bond is to its lair — an elaborate cavern complex carved out between the twisting sewers of Waterdeep, which it inherited from its predecessors and cherishes above all else. Its flaw is a weakness for exotic pleasures: finely prepared foods, scented oils, and rare spices and herbs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="448591ed-ad89-4a4b-bd7b-427ddd6e7ca0">Establishing this information allows you to play the Xanathar as more than an ordinary <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17099-beholder" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17099-tooltip">beholder</a>. The complexities of the creature’s characterization create more memorable interaction and interesting story possibilities.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7e150d6c-695d-4787-aafb-35bac34f60fd"><strong><em>Equipment.</em></strong> Most NPCs don’t need an exhaustive list of equipment. An enemy meant to be faced in combat requires weapons and armor, plus any treasure the NPC carries (including magic items that might be used against the adventurers).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6c9bc705-3a9c-4503-9e39-a507bd02359c"><strong><em>Challenge Rating.</em></strong> An NPC built for combat needs a challenge rating.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ee9c336d-cda8-4d67-91c1-904f3cbfd7ea">NPCs might join the adventuring party because they want a share of the loot and are willing to accept an equal share of the risk, or they might follow the adventurers because of a bond of loyalty, gratitude, or love. Such NPCs are controlled by you, or you can transfer control to the players. Even if a player controls an NPC, it’s up to you to make sure the NPC is portrayed as a character in his or her own right, not just as a servant that the players can manipulate for their own benefit.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d722e310-57f5-48ac-ab18-604da6d3ba07">Any NPC that accompanies the adventurers acts as a party member and earns a full share of experience points. When determining the difficulty of a combat encounter (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="20476f4f-6e25-42fd-920f-5b265f810336">chapter 3</a>), make sure to include all NPC party members.</p>
<h3 id="LowLevelFollowers" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="e723b0ce-7da2-4d19-a495-386f9006ecdc"><a href="#LowLevelFollowers" data-content-chunk-id="14e8f126-429a-413b-81a8-4bea38465c68"></a>Low-Level Followers</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f12aa42-d800-4996-84e3-dba1a815ac4a">Your campaign might allow player characters to take on lower-level NPCs as followers. For example, a paladin might have a 1st-level paladin as a squire, a wizard might accept a 2nd-level wizard as an apprentice, a cleric might choose (or be assigned) a 3rd-level cleric as an acolyte, and a bard might take on a 4th-level bard as an understudy.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b82a117d-d2fa-4fb8-82c7-b3b6eebcf3d2">One advantage of allowing lower-level characters to join the party is that players have backup characters if their main characters take time off, retire, or die. One disadvantage is that you and your players have more party members to account for.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="29ff9ab4-f6b8-4d37-915a-072cbf9cb7d1">Since lower-level NPC party members receive equal party shares of XP, they will gain levels more quickly than the adventurers (the benefit of studying under such experienced masters), and might eventually catch up to them. It also means the adventurers’ advancement is slowed somewhat, as they must share their XP with an NPC shouldering only part of the adventuring burden.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="199705f1-056a-4095-9e5f-3fa7eaeba96e">Powerful monsters that are an appropriate challenge for higher-level characters can deal enough damage to instantly kill or incapacitate a low-level follower. The adventurers should expect to spend effort and resources protecting lower-level NPC party members and to provide healing when this protection fails.</p>
<h3 id="AdventurerNPCs" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="c1e91457-659a-4d97-9627-28cfcd35c6e2"><a href="#AdventurerNPCs" data-content-chunk-id="5a381940-dd81-445d-b3a9-65dd225be519"></a>Adventurer NPCs</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b64dbf36-f685-49e3-96ed-7759e608e958">If you don’t have enough players to form a full party, you can use NPCs to fill out the ranks. These NPCs should be the same level as the lowest-level adventurer in the party and built (either by you or your players) using the character creation and advancement rules in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="011a18f3-e56f-4a88-b8a7-157b33ffc295">Player’s Handbook</a>. It’s easiest on you if you let the players create and run these supporting characters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cbee201a-8c80-48e4-a57e-c2711722b1fe">Encourage players to roleplay supporting characters as true to the NPCs’ personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws as possible, so that they don’t come across as automatons. If you don’t feel that an NPC is being portrayed well, you can take control of the NPC, give it to another player, or simply have the NPC leave the party.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="136f4744-b30b-4806-a85e-d2b35a54d74c">NPC supporting characters are easier to play if you limit their class options. Good candidates for supporting characters include a cleric with the Life domain, a fighter with the Champion archetype, a rogue with the Thief archetype, and a wizard specializing in Evocation.</p>
<h3 id="OptionalRuleLoyalty" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="55913745-814b-443f-ba0a-f362f97d2228"><a href="#OptionalRuleLoyalty" data-content-chunk-id="2fb4a7e6-8d89-432e-8b33-6532cf8df280"></a>Optional Rule: Loyalty</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1b048152-c749-4da5-8d4b-984f2e799f2c">Loyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine how far an NPC party member will go to protect or assist the other members of the party (even those he or she doesn’t particularly like). An NPC party member who is abused or ignored is likely to abandon or betray the party, whereas an NPC who owes a life debt to the characters or shares their goals might fight to the death for them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by this rule.</p>
<h4 id="LoyaltyScore" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="ee27a27f-08e2-4500-890f-ed4fd8159838"><a href="#LoyaltyScore" data-content-chunk-id="a569ee64-325c-42c2-a3ab-3804dcd11e7d"></a>Loyalty Score</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="30839aad-3c3e-4648-918b-029be73708ae">An NPC’s loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 20. The NPC’s maximum loyalty score is equal to the highest Charisma score among all adventurers in the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that number. If the highest Charisma score changes — perhaps a character dies or leaves the group — adjust the NPC’s loyalty score accordingly.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fb537b93-f63a-4900-946a-27a0b48f8945">Keep track of an NPC’s loyalty score in secret so that the players won’t know for sure whether an NPC party member is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently under a player’s control).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="71e37de8-16d9-490b-9465-441da1b409f1">An NPC’s loyalty score increases by 1d4 if other party members help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. Likewise, an NPC’s loyalty score increases by 1d4 if the NPC is treated particularly well (for example, given a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party member. An NPC’s loyalty score can never be raised above its maximum.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="859a776a-4f3e-4a08-8604-4cca52f74a98">When other party members act in a manner that runs counter to the NPC’s alignment or bond, reduce the NPC’s loyalty score by 1d4. Reduce the NPC’s loyalty score by 2d4 if the character is abused, misled, or endangered by other party members for purely selfish reasons.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a65b326d-e614-45f5-8bc2-dd1b012ea706">An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer loyal to the party and might part ways with them. A loyalty score can never drop below 0.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fd637a9d-8fea-4b15-9c7a-18cf32350137">An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life and limb to help fellow party members. If the NPC’s loyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous. An NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts in the party’s best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or works in secret to bring about the party’s downfall.</p>
<h2 id="Contacts" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="815b2fb7-8191-45fe-8fa5-a51e55e623aa"><a href="#Contacts" data-content-chunk-id="7498d8ef-84bf-4a5e-a1bb-acf25e5f515b"></a>Contacts</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7861bf47-4712-4b2a-b5cb-b2713dbfa300">Contacts are NPCs with close ties to one or more of the player characters. They don’t go on adventures, but they can provide information, rumors, supplies, or professional advice, either for free or at a cost. Some of the backgrounds in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="201abc24-8f29-4474-9d7b-f8952e25ddc6">Player’s Handbook</a> suggest contacts for beginning adventurers, and characters are likely to secure more helpful contacts over the course of their adventuring careers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dc98b7bd-47d3-4359-8c74-6274c1b193c9">A name and a few choice details are all you need for casual contacts, but take the time to flesh out a recurring contact, especially one who might become an ally or enemy at some point. At the very least, give some thought to a contact’s goals and how those goals are likely to come into play.</p>
<h3 id="Patrons" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="6239b4fc-07c2-4604-a7c8-c7a04f3ae4f4"><a href="#Patrons" data-content-chunk-id="1938c519-81d0-4e08-83ea-1dfc9a3a63de"></a>Patrons</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fb296f6e-d523-483f-b248-e5a69134c011">A patron is a contact who employs the adventurers, providing help or rewards as well as quests and adventure hooks. Most of the time, a patron has a vested interest in the adventurers’ success and doesn’t need to be persuaded to help them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d507677f-9a6d-4fd1-879e-82ff7617cd3d">A patron might be a retired adventurer who seeks younger heroes to deal with rising threats, or a mayor who knows that the town guard can’t handle a dragon demanding tribute. A sheriff becomes a patron by offering a bounty for kobold raiders terrorizing the local countryside, as does a noble who wants an abandoned estate cleared of monsters.</p>
<h2 id="Hirelings" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="4800c7f5-2e57-488e-b440-bbb33dba7edf"><a href="#Hirelings" data-content-chunk-id="740a74eb-45bb-485d-9d7e-4800cbc36889"></a>Hirelings</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ee48a70f-86ff-444b-9d27-522bf07ab569">Adventurers can pay NPCs to provide services in a variety of circumstances. Information on hirelings appears in chapter 5, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment" data-content-chunk-id="496609c5-1616-474a-8d61-472326f8e65e">Equipment</a>" of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="d8359fe2-0454-4826-9881-47c44fcf2142">Player’s Handbook</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6b5225ea-a22a-478a-bede-788981244772">Hireling NPCs rarely become important in an adventure, and most require little development. When adventurers hire a coach to carry them across town or need a letter delivered, the driver or messenger is a hireling, and the adventurers might never even converse with that NPC or learn his or her name. A ship captain carrying the adventurers across the sea is also a hireling, but such a character has the potential to turn into an ally, a patron, or even an enemy as the adventure unfolds.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3c97d1dd-9b6e-4a53-8cf1-74bbf82239fb">When the adventurers hire an NPC for long-term work, add the cost of that NPC’s services to the characters’ lifestyle expenses. See the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#RecurringExpenses" data-content-chunk-id="c904658b-1965-4c02-80ab-dcc4af539a4b">Additional Expenses</a>” section of chapter 6, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="9d3c7cab-e52f-416e-93be-8b0d8a102546">Between Adventures</a>," for more information.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="53c61fa3-370b-48ac-a98e-742f962656ce">Extras are the characters and creatures in the background that the main characters rarely, if ever, interact with.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8234acb5-9009-4b09-9424-0e6fe980fc92">Extras might be elevated to more important roles by virtue of adventurers singling them out. For instance, a player might be hooked by a passing reference you make to a street urchin and try to strike up a conversation with the youngster. Suddenly, an extra on whom you placed no importance becomes a central figure in an improvised roleplaying scene.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0bf4b523-18af-452f-a71f-8b815cf35aa0">Whenever extras are present, be prepared to come up with names and mannerisms on the fly. In a pinch, you can plunder the race-specific character names found in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/races" data-content-chunk-id="9c5fbcac-2b04-4e86-a2ed-f8ebad722350">chapter 2</a> of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="513aa417-df55-4483-adfe-9b6be2d12a73">Player’s Handbook</a>.</p>

Each creature of the paladin’s choice within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, the target is <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/5-tooltip">frightened</a> of the paladin for 1 minute.

A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9bbd2418-8622-4ae3-848b-3898fe710a56">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>

The aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around the paladin to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/5-tooltip">frightened</a> by the paladin starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, the paladin and creatures he or she chooses in the aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c698d465-7041-49d0-b5e0-700b1bf2b61f">While the aura lasts, the paladin can use a bonus action on his or her turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. The paladin makes a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + the paladin’s Charisma modifier.</p>

Having done so, the paladin loses all Oathbreaker features and must choose a deity and a sacred oath. (With your permission, the player can select a different deity or sacred oath than the character had previously.) However, the paladin doesn’t gain the class features specific to that sacred oath until he or she completes some kind of dangerous quest or trial, as determined by the DM.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f52cacb8-2ed8-47d7-84ab-4d55e7f96276">A paladin who breaks his or her sacred oath a second time can become an oathbreaker once more, but can’t atone.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="37e8d4b2-ba90-487e-9983-77b9e4b44653">Many D&amp;D adventures revolve around a dungeon setting. Dungeons in D&amp;D include great halls and tombs, subterranean monster lairs, labyrinths riddled with death traps, natural caverns extending for miles beneath the surface of the world, and ruined castles.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="54c8cb99-7cb4-45d4-bc2e-e942cd070088">Not every adventure takes place in a dungeon. A wilderness trek across the Desert of Desolation or a harrowing journey into the jungles of the Isle of Dread can be an exciting adventure in its own right. In the great outdoors, dragons wheel across the sky in search of prey, tribes of hobgoblins pour forth from their grim fortresses to wage war against their neighbors, ogres plunder farmsteads for food, and monstrous spiders drop from the web-shrouded canopies of trees.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fdd51240-b165-47d9-b82a-fbe6e175a053">Within a dungeon, adventurers are constrained by walls and doors around them, but in the wilderness, adventurers can travel in almost any direction they please. Therein lies the key difference between dungeon and wilderness: it’s much easier to predict where the adventuring party might go in the dungeon because the options are limited — less so in the wilderness.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2c9d9fb2-864d-486b-b18d-5f1f1ede3fbb">Villages, towns, and cities are cradles of civilization in a dangerous world, but they too offer opportunities for adventure. Encounters with monsters might seem unlikely within a city’s walls, but urban settings have their own villains and perils. Evil, after all, takes many forms, and urban settings aren’t always the safe havens they seem to be.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="00a66175-f347-460c-99e9-c0f579813332">This chapter provides an overview of these three environments plus a few unusual environments, taking you through the process of creating an adventure location, with plenty of random tables to inspire you.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2427bcc6-1204-478a-9045-5812debf1e4b">Some dungeons are old strongholds abandoned by the folk who built them. Others are natural caves or weird lairs carved out by foul monsters. They attract evil cults, monster tribes, and reclusive creatures. Dungeons are also home to ancient treasures: coins, gems, magic items, and other valuables hidden away in the darkness, often guarded by traps or jealously kept by the monsters that have collected them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5c6f7b95-5495-435d-9549-37d2293d59c3">When you set out to create a dungeon, think about its distinctive qualities. For example, a dungeon that serves as a hobgoblin stronghold has a different quality from an ancient temple inhabited by yuan-ti. This section lays out a process for creating a dungeon and bringing it to life.</p>

A death trap might guard the treasure of a villainous wizard, or it might be designed to lure adventurers to their demise for some nefarious purpose, such as to feed souls to a lich’s phylactery.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6c51b16-0922-46c7-8af6-cb7c19e8d654"><strong><em>Lair.</em></strong> A lair is a place where monsters live. Typical lairs include ruins and caves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="697fbc24-a6f8-4699-a272-adcbf289f28c"><strong><em>Maze.</em></strong> A maze is intended to deceive or confuse those who enter it. Some mazes are elaborate obstacles that protect treasure, while others are gauntlets for prisoners banished there to be hunted and devoured by the monsters within.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2f03ab4d-0f1a-43f7-8ab8-20afac222e00"><strong><em>Mine.</em></strong> An abandoned mine can quickly become infested with monsters, while miners who delve too deep can break through into the Underdark.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="47653b92-cf17-4003-9a1d-d9fb4b6ef7c9"><strong><em>Planar Gate.</em></strong> Dungeons built around planar portals are often transformed by the planar energy seeping out through those portals.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8fce412d-6f89-48f9-94a8-e2dd2782b268"><strong><em>Stronghold.</em></strong> A stronghold dungeon provides a secure base of operations for villains and monsters. It is usually ruled by a powerful individual, such as a wizard, vampire, or dragon, and it is larger and more complex than a simple lair.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="962ab23c-4a21-48cd-8c2b-45464443ce83"><strong><em>Temple or Shrine.</em></strong> This dungeon is consecrated to a deity or other planar entity. The entity’s worshipers control the dungeon and conduct their rites there.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="523ed44a-9fec-4ebd-820e-0cb7e8d75ae2"><strong><em>Tomb.</em></strong> Tombs are magnets for treasure hunters, as well as monsters that hunger for the bones of the dead.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e366f547-80bb-47c0-acf8-42532a2220ba"><strong><em>Treasure Vault.</em></strong> Built to protect powerful magic items and great material wealth, treasure vault dungeons are heavily guarded by monsters and traps.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="85313af8-6952-4845-9d3f-49f24dd0c9f4">After a dungeon’s creators depart, anyone or anything might move in. Intelligent monsters, mindless dungeon scavengers, predators and prey alike can be drawn to dungeons.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c189a6f-1be0-4656-aa6c-1d043469f228">The monsters in a dungeon are more than a collection of random creatures that happen to live near one another. Fungi, vermin, scavengers, and predators can coexist in a complex ecology, alongside intelligent creatures who share living space through elaborate combinations of domination, negotiation, and bloodshed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4afe6f09-1bf8-481f-b662-42fac0d5ccbf">Characters might be able to sneak into a dungeon, ally with one faction, or play factions against each other to reduce the threat of the more powerful monsters. For example, in a dungeon inhabited by <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17104-mind-flayer" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17104-tooltip">mind flayers</a> and their goblinoid thralls, the adventurers might try to incite the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16907-goblin" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16907-tooltip">goblins</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16925-hobgoblin" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16925-tooltip">hobgoblins</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16817-bugbear" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16817-tooltip">bugbears</a> to revolt against their illithid masters.</p>
<h4 id="DungeonFactions" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="8aff5afc-450e-4212-aa6b-c5807034d9e3"><a href="#DungeonFactions" data-content-chunk-id="a53f85dc-4f01-4d61-9120-a304a66b6ec5"></a>Dungeon Factions</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ec43cca9-e861-4e7b-a34f-4cf4fe85bf46">A dungeon is sometimes dominated by a single group of intelligent humanoids, whether a tribe of orcs that have taken over a cavern complex or a gang of trolls inhabiting an aboveground ruin. Other times, particularly in larger dungeons, multiple groups of creatures share space and compete for resources.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="097a10ca-a533-457c-9047-9d0f6e3268e6">For example, orcs that dwell in the mines of a ruined dwarf citadel might skirmish constantly against the hobgoblins that hold the citadel’s upper tiers. Mind flayers that have established a colony in the lowest levels of the mines could manipulate and dominate key hobgoblins in an attempt to wipe out the orcs. And all the while, a hidden cell of drow scouts watches and plots to slay the mind flayers, then enslave whatever creatures are left.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="672a6251-c6fb-45f3-9a57-e462e68f7a49">It’s easy to think of a dungeon as a collection of encounters, with the adventurers kicking down door after door and killing whatever lies beyond. But the ebb and flow of power between groups in a dungeon provides plenty of opportunities for more subtle interaction. Dungeon denizens are used to striking unlikely alliances, and adventurers are a wild card that canny monsters seek to exploit.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f05d8466-bc46-4dfc-b552-f9ad88237a43">Intelligent creatures in a dungeon have goals, whether as simple as short-term survival or as ambitious as claiming the entire dungeon as the first step in founding an empire. Such creatures might approach adventurers with an offer of alliance, hoping to prevent the characters from laying waste to their lair and to secure aid against their enemies. Bring the NPC leaders of such groups to life as described in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters" data-content-chunk-id="b44b25d2-0c79-4f3e-8e3e-318a2d5ad81e">chapter 4</a>, fleshing out their personalities, goals, and ideals. Then use those elements to shape a response to the arrival of adventurers in their territory.</p>
<h4 id="DungeonEcology" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="b2566209-04fd-4116-9ee6-ec725a006038"><a href="#DungeonEcology" data-content-chunk-id="f32170ac-008b-4a8d-bff0-a6013593ca31"></a>Dungeon Ecology</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b0f15aee-6131-49ee-8b92-636e80a4a302">An inhabited dungeon has its own ecosystem. The creatures that live there need to eat, drink, breathe, and sleep, just as creatures in the wilderness do. Predators need to be able to seek prey, and intelligent creatures search for lairs offering the best combination of air, food, water, and security. Keep these factors in mind when designing a dungeon you want the players to believe in. If a dungeon doesn’t have some internal logic to it, adventurers will find it difficult to make reasonable decisions within that environment.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="513594b7-b016-41f1-9c5a-edba05a2f2d9">For example, characters who find a pool of fresh water in a dungeon might make the logical assumption that many of the creatures inhabiting the dungeon come to that spot to drink. The adventurers might set an ambush at the pool. Likewise, locked doors — or even doors that require hands to open — can restrict the movement of some creatures. If all the doors in a dungeon are closed, the players might wonder how the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17138-carrion-crawler" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17138-tooltip">carrion crawlers</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17023-stirge" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17023-tooltip">stirges</a> they repeatedly encounter manage to survive.</p>
<h4 id="EncounterDifficulty" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="532e5836-f2be-4ebb-8ea2-9ef2b9cfe040"><a href="#EncounterDifficulty" data-content-chunk-id="2fd86264-d1e5-4208-aa35-a76045a4db06"></a>Encounter Difficulty</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1bf361a3-95ff-40e5-9bff-01bccfbbc7cc">You might be inclined to increase the encounter difficulty as the adventurers descend deeper into the dungeon, as a way to keep the dungeon challenging as the characters gain levels or to ratchet up the tension. However, this approach can turn the dungeon into a grind. A better approach is to include encounters of varying difficulty throughout. The contrast between easy and hard encounters, as well as simple and complex encounters, encourages characters to vary their tactics and keeps the encounters from seeming too similar.</p>
<h2 id="MappingaDungeon" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f3bbc94d-9f68-4ed1-89df-e6f4c51fc189"><a href="#MappingaDungeon" data-content-chunk-id="74dac258-d7cb-496f-9b0a-27cdd696e973"></a>Mapping a Dungeon</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ccef70cb-77c7-417f-8d47-ba19594ef9af">Every dungeon needs a map showing its layout. The dungeon’s location, creator, purpose, history, and inhabitants should give you a starting point for designing your dungeon map. If you need further inspiration, you can find maps that have been made freely available for use on the Internet, or even use a map of a real-world location. Alternatively, you can borrow a map from a published adventure or randomly generate a dungeon complex using the tables presented in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/appendix-a-random-dungeons" data-content-chunk-id="7acb124e-714c-46a4-b952-90435071d659">Appendices</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eb150789-d3de-4a8f-8e5e-ad8b3ac50ee6">A dungeon can range in size from a few chambers in a ruined temple to a huge complex of rooms and passages extending hundreds of feet in all directions. The adventurers’ goal often lies as far from the dungeon entrance as possible, forcing characters to delve deeper underground or push farther into the heart of the complex.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d29d87c9-ef7f-4c73-b702-b4bb401ec300">A dungeon is most easily mapped on graph paper, with each square on the paper representing an area of 10 feet by 10 feet. (If you play with miniatures on a grid, you might prefer a scale where each square represents 5 feet, or you can subdivide your 10-foot grid into a 5-foot grid when you draw your maps for combat.) When you draw your map, keep the following points in mind:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="7cf3400f-559f-4cb3-b42e-c3acac237f39">
<li data-content-chunk-id="3509ac36-d116-425c-8c35-e0ff5282f9e4">Asymmetrical rooms and map layouts make a dungeon less predictable.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="0a89cc4b-d70b-4077-8846-b1d838d01ec0">Think in three dimensions. Stairs, ramps, platforms, ledges, balconies, pits, and other changes of elevation make a dungeon more interesting and make combat encounters in those areas more challenging.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="30dea519-5172-4d27-b513-0826ae5d32f3">Give the dungeon some wear and tear. Unless you want to stress that the dungeon’s builders were extraordinarily skillful, collapsed passages can be commonplace, cutting off formerly connected sections of the dungeon from each other. Past earthquakes might have opened chasms within a dungeon, splitting rooms and corridors to make interesting obstacles.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="9b85fe47-1821-4b93-b463-c60f255627b4">Incorporate natural features into even a constructed dungeon. An underground stream might run through the middle of a dwarven stronghold, causing variation in the shapes and sizes of rooms and necessitating features such as bridges and drains.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="8d07f7ff-23af-4695-8eed-884e50e1a110">Add multiple entrances and exits. Nothing gives the players a stronger sense of making real decisions than having multiple ways to enter a dungeon.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="995288d7-b1ba-4751-b0f6-dddca3122984">Add secret doors and secret rooms to reward players who take the time to search for them.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fe39f854-2a84-4c18-b1f0-19ad0a75ba81">The atmosphere and physical characteristics of dungeons vary as widely as their origins. An old crypt might have stone walls and loose wooden doors, an odor of decay, and no light other than what adventurers bring with them. A volcanic lair might have smooth stone walls hollowed out by past eruptions, doors of magically reinforced brass, a smell of sulfur, and light provided by jets of flame in every hall and room.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fa725903-9913-489e-be66-514242341e9c">Some dungeons have walls of masonry. Others have walls of solid rock, hewn with tools to give them a rough, chiseled look, or worn smooth by the passage of water or lava. An aboveground dungeon might be made of wood or composite materials.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="411ea0d5-9a76-4df8-9cd7-a302b083a128">Walls are sometimes adorned with murals, frescoes, bas-reliefs, and lighting fixtures such as sconces or torch brackets. A few even have secret doors built into them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0549f8e6-dbc8-4a1c-8a6f-b87f24511297">Dungeon doorways might be set within plain arches and lintels. They might be festooned with carvings of gargoyles or leering faces or engraved with sigils that reveal clues as to what lies beyond.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f479d4ac-13d0-40d8-bcb8-6e7f2c8e9bee"><strong><em>Locked Doors.</em></strong> Characters who don’t have the key to a locked door can pick the lock with a successful Dexterity check (doing so requires thieves’ tools and proficiency in their use). They can also force the door with a successful Strength check, smash the door to pieces by dealing enough damage to it, or use a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2162-knock" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2162-tooltip">knock</a> spell or similar magic. <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game" data-content-chunk-id="77e9b2c9-7383-419e-8d12-a1a68bd65522">Chapter 8</a> provides guidelines for setting the DCs and assigning statistics to doors and other objects.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b893f09e-c4c9-488d-a792-1374bfb6275d">A secret door is crafted to blend into the wall that surrounds it. Sometimes faint cracks in the wall or scuff marks on the floor betray the secret door’s presence.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5eef841a-09b1-419d-af85-278f09c117d6">A concealed door is a normal door that is hidden from view. A secret door is carefully crafted to blend into its surrounding surface, whereas a concealed door is most often hidden by mundane means. It might be covered by a tapestry, covered with plaster, or (in the case of a concealed trapdoor) hidden under a rug. Normally, no ability check is required to find a concealed door. A character need only look in the right place or take the right steps to reveal the door. However, you can use the characters’ passive Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) scores to determine whether any of them notices tracks or signs of a tapestry or rug having been recently disturbed.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5bedbdb4-4f87-4932-9868-ea5d846cda0f">A portcullis is a set of vertical bars made of wood or iron, reinforced with one or more horizontal bands. It blocks a passage or archway until it is raised up into the ceiling by a winch and chain. The main benefit of a portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing guards to watch the area beyond and make ranged attacks or cast spells through it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1c92f77d-5fd3-41ea-b572-a96600e1140c">Winching a portcullis up or down requires an action. If a character can’t reach the winch (usually because it is on the other side of the portcullis), lifting the portcullis or bending its bars far enough apart to pass through them requires a successful Strength check. The DC of the check depends on the size and weight of the portcullis or the thickness of its bars. To determine an appropriate DC, see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game" data-content-chunk-id="4318fe85-243d-4cf7-ab33-19a4c809838d">chapter 8</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ab152e90-adf3-433e-aa08-620697ac3937">Darkness is the default condition inside an underground complex or in the interior of aboveground ruins, but an inhabited dungeon might have light sources.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d2335572-ac6e-4a54-86d5-dd947ad6069b">In subterranean settlements, even races that have <a class="tooltip-hover sense-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision" data-tooltip-href="/senses/2-tooltip">darkvision</a> use fire for warmth, cooking, and defense. But many creatures have no need of warmth or light. Adventurers must bring their own sources of light into dusty tombs where only undead stand guard, abandoned ruins teeming with predatory monsters and oozes, and natural caverns where sightless creatures hunt.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="61a044f2-b75b-4f06-87a5-3bbd7ffda09a">The light of a torch or lantern helps a character see over a short distance, but other creatures can see that light source from far away. Bright light in an environment of total darkness can be visible for miles, though a clear line of sight over such a distance is rare underground. Even so, adventurers using light sources in a dungeon often attract monsters, just as dungeon features that shed light (from phosphorescent fungi to the glow of magical portals) can draw adventurers’ attention.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="dcee0354-b943-41c7-bea0-885c45833634">Subterranean tunnels and aboveground ruins are often enclosed spaces with little airflow. Though it’s rare for a dungeon to be sealed so tightly that adventurers have trouble breathing, the atmosphere is often stifling and oppressive. What’s more, odors linger in a dungeon and can be magnified by the stillness of the atmosphere.</p>
<h4 id="Sounds" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="d4a4460a-81f2-410a-b5ce-a30182c78b7b"><a href="#Sounds" data-content-chunk-id="b0b9a932-a510-4ca5-ba56-da4e2cf621e7"></a>Sounds</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="388e6ee8-ef9d-4c98-82dd-2ea21e6d78a9">A dungeon’s enclosed geography helps channel sound. The groaning creak of an opening door can echo down hundreds of feet of passageway. Louder noises such as the clanging hammers of a forge or the din of battle can reverberate through an entire dungeon. Many creatures that live underground use such sounds as a way of locating prey, or go on alert at any sound of an adventuring party’s intrusion.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cddc66bd-e084-4441-a776-8158dea0a909"><strong><em>Hazard Severity.</em></strong> To determine a hazard’s deadliness relative to the characters, think of the hazard as a trap and compare the damage it deals with the party’s level using the <a href="#DamageSeveritybyLevel" data-content-chunk-id="a0a82239-def8-498c-9502-a6ef817236b3">Damage Severity by Level</a> table later in the chapter (the table also appears in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game" data-content-chunk-id="03c16250-7b75-4763-9431-e9d505112cef">chapter 8</a>).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b27966b1-65a7-4e57-8d9b-f79fdd0b5ac7">Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around it. A patch of brown mold typically covers a 10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 feet of it is always frigid.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="18ffd45d-7d8d-4734-bd66-6ae7ac1db3e4">When a creature moves to within 5 feet of the mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="16725d33-bbfa-423c-a153-b5f3bb917b74">Brown mold is immune to fire, and any source of fire brought within 5 feet of a patch causes it to instantly expand outward in the direction of the fire, covering a 10-foot-square area (with the source of the fire at the center of that area). A patch of brown mold exposed to an effect that deals cold damage is instantly destroyed.</p>
<h4 id="GreenSlime" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="8850cc83-077f-43ff-8f14-78ab5589b3f3"><a href="#GreenSlime" data-content-chunk-id="2fa83cba-6d0d-4b4b-b691-1f691009dc7b"></a>Green Slime</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e6a27b86-e159-4bef-831d-7f91077dfb31">This acidic slime devours flesh, organic material, and metal on contact. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53f86c28-b49b-445e-96a0-4fa6e354cce4">A patch of green slime covers a 5-foot square, has <a class="tooltip-hover sense-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Blindsight" data-tooltip-href="/senses/1-tooltip">blindsight</a> out to a range of 30 feet, and drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement below it. Beyond that, it has no ability to move. A creature aware of the slime’s presence can avoid being struck by it with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the slime can’t be avoided as it drops.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b01ccd72-51f4-4f1a-adee-16e65f0302dd">A creature that comes into contact with green slime takes 5 (1d10) acid damage. The creature takes the damage again at the start of each of its turns until the slime is scraped off or destroyed. Against wood or metal, green slime deals 11 (2d10) acid damage each round, and any nonmagical wood or metal weapon or tool used to scrape off the slime is effectively destroyed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c487ebf5-2896-411a-b346-7a01b59f0e38">Sunlight, any effect that cures disease, and any effect that deals cold, fire, or radiant damage destroys a patch of green slime.</p>

These web-filled areas are difficult terrain. Moreover, a creature entering a webbed area for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or become <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/13-tooltip">restrained</a> by the webs. A <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/13-tooltip">restrained</a> creature can use its action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/2-tooltip">Athletics</a>) or Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/3-tooltip">Acrobatics</a>) check.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9225c8bb-d45c-4d7b-9e74-2cde9ab29411">Yellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers a 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of spores that fills a 10-foot cube originating from the mold. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison damage and become <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/11-tooltip">poisoned</a> for 1 minute. While <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/11-tooltip">poisoned</a> in this way, the creature takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns.

<p data-content-chunk-id="89785119-5511-44c1-beec-eae3b2c6666c">Sunlight or any amount of fire damage instantly destroys one patch of yellow mold.</p>
<h2 id="Wilderness" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="fbf24b39-a192-4f08-a3a4-017dddda716f"><a href="#Wilderness" data-content-chunk-id="c8dbf405-a7c6-416c-84a4-d9b38c98b536"></a>Wilderness</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d3abbcbd-cb00-4d4e-9ce4-868855441dec">Between the dungeons and settlements of your campaign world lie meadows, forests, deserts, mountain ranges, oceans, and other tracts of wilderness waiting to be traversed. Bringing wilderness areas to life can be a fun part of your game, both for you and your players. The following two approaches work particularly well.</p>
<h3 id="TravelMontageApproach" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="5266b169-580f-42d6-92b5-a5f4e65c9c86"><a href="#TravelMontageApproach" data-content-chunk-id="c024e3b7-3bdc-43c6-aae1-b2e899b75778"></a>Travel-Montage Approach</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="85c0cffd-d248-4f3b-89e6-d0ea643f6b9d">Sometimes the destination is more important than the journey. If the purpose of a wilderness trek is to get the characters to where the real adventure happens, gloss over the wilderness trek without checking for encounters along the way. Just as movies use travel montages to convey long and arduous journeys in a matter of seconds, you can use a few sentences of descriptive text to paint a picture of a wilderness trek in your players’ minds before moving on.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9642b6ef-1a08-4979-b26d-22aff86bd9e4">Describe the journey as vividly as you like, but keep the forward momentum. “You walk for several miles and encounter nothing of interest” is okay, but far less evocative and memorable than, “A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but otherwise you encounter nothing out of the ordinary.” The trick is to focus on a few details that reinforce the desired mood rather than describe everything down to the last blade of grass.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d9db8d90-a08d-498f-a9e0-bfc82a045f51">Call attention to unusual terrain features: a waterfall, a rocky outcropping that offers a breathtaking view over the tops of the surrounding trees, an area where the forest has burned or been cut down, and so on. Also describe notable smells and sounds, such as the roar of a faraway monster, the stench of burned wood, or the sweet aroma of flowers in an elven forest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="73f0959c-884c-4567-b467-16ec5d8c46e3">In addition to evocative language, visual aids can help set the scene for the characters’ travels. Image searches on the Internet can lead you to breathtaking landscapes (in fact, that’s a good phrase to search for) both real and fantastical. As striking as real-world scenery can be, wilderness travel can be used to remind the players that their characters are in a fantasy world. Once in a while, spice up your descriptions with some truly magical element. A forest might be home to tiny dragonets instead of birds, or its trees might be festooned with giant webs or have eerie, green-glowing sap. Use these elements sparingly; landscapes that are too alien can break your players’ sense of immersion in the world. A single fantastic element within an otherwise realistic and memorable landscape is enough.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa276f24-564b-4be7-8804-0cfb5b2b22b6">Use the landscape to set the mood and tone for your adventure. In one forest, close-set trees shroud all light and seem to watch the adventurers as they pass. In another, sunlight streams through the leaves above and flower-laden vines twine up every trunk. Signs of corruption — rotting wood, foul-smelling water, and rocks covered with slimy brown moss — can be a signal that the adventurers are drawing close to the site of evil power that is their destination or can provide clues to the nature of the threats to be found there.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="083009bd-f13f-41ef-9eb9-e0a392ea23fc">Specific wilderness locations might have their own special features. For example, the Spirit Forest and the Spiderhaunt Woods might feature different kinds of trees, different kinds of flora and fauna, different weather, and different random encounter tables.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e3083e3e-255a-4813-84b6-9548b86fdf74">Finally, a wilderness trek can be enhanced by calling attention to the weather. “You spend the next three days crossing the swamp” sounds less harrowing than, “You spend the next three days trudging through knee-deep mud — the first two days and nights in the pouring rain, and then another day under the beating sun, with swarms of hungry insects feasting on your blood.”</p>
<h3 id="HourbyHourApproach" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="ed63647a-994c-4b4f-9bfe-8a4607e109fc"><a href="#HourbyHourApproach" data-content-chunk-id="1829eef0-c7a9-4a26-995c-23c58d860799"></a>Hour-by-Hour Approach</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3eb57c07-f265-44bc-9019-636505e020f3">Sometimes the journey deserves as much time and attention as the destination. If wilderness travel features prominently in your adventure and isn’t something you want to gloss over, you will need more than a descriptive overview to bring a long and harrowing journey to life; you’ll need to know the party’s marching order and have encounters at the ready.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="77a51729-e9da-431a-8663-306d790b7a33">Let your players determine the party’s marching order (see the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="11a07e12-f9b3-41e8-898d-f28e4d9d6f72">Player’s Handbook</a> for more information). Characters in the front rank are likely to be the first to notice landmarks and terrain features, as well as the ones responsible for navigating. Characters in the back rank are usually responsible for making sure that the party isn’t being followed. Encourage characters in the middle ranks to do something other than blindly trudge along behind the front-rank characters. The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="afb972fb-ee56-4bae-9529-329602c13a84">Player’s Handbook</a> suggests activities such as mapmaking and foraging for food.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="59a61be8-f9cd-45c1-994b-b2c65b848aaf">Wilderness journeys typically feature a combination of planned encounters (encounters that you prepare ahead of time) and random encounters (encounters determined by rolling on a table). A planned encounter might need a map of the location where the encounter is set to occur, such as a ruin, a bridge spanning a gorge, or some other memorable location. Random encounters tend to be less location-specific. The fewer planned encounters you have, the more you’ll need to rely on random encounters to keep the journey interesting. See <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="712c87cd-1337-430f-87a5-0095fbab8332">chapter 3</a> for guidelines on creating your own random encounter tables and when to check for random encounters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="af350720-09df-4ff6-930e-257d91d3fa4b">A good way to keep wilderness encounters from becoming stale is to make sure they don’t all start and end the same way. In other words, if the wilderness is your stage and your adventure is the play or movie, think of each wilderness encounter as its own scene, and try to stage each one in a slightly different way to keep your players’ interest. If one encounter comes at the adventurers from the front, the next one might come at them from above or behind. If an encounter features stealthy monsters, a character tending to the party’s pack animals might get the first indication that monsters are near when a pony whickers nervously. If an encounter features loud monsters, the party might have the option to hide or set an ambush. One group of monsters might attack the party on sight, and another might allow safe passage for food.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="03609c9f-c03c-4d3d-973e-ae91f81e3d66">Reward characters for searching while they travel by providing things for them to find. Broken statues, tracks, abandoned campsites, and other finds can add flavor to your world, foreshadow future encounters or events, or provide hooks for further adventures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="68a6e9dc-c042-43f5-91a5-7584fcdaf6dd">A wilderness journey might take multiple sessions to play out. That said, if the wilderness journey includes long periods with no encounters, use the travel-montage approach to bridge gaps between encounters.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="02c00b02-6949-4ae6-b614-d31c8f875a09">In contrast to a dungeon, an outdoor setting presents seemingly limitless options. The adventurers can move in any direction over a trackless desert or an open grassland, so how do you as the DM deal with all the possible locations and events that might make up a wilderness campaign? What if you design an encounter in a desert oasis, but the characters miss the oasis because they wander off course? How do you avoid creating a boring play session of uninterrupted slogging across a rocky wasteland?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="782d157c-6096-46b2-a832-500302ca90cb">One solution is to think of an outdoor setting in the same way you think about a dungeon. Even the most wide-open terrain presents clear pathways. Roads seldom run straight because they follow the contours of the land, finding the most level or otherwise easiest routes across uneven ground. Valleys and ridges channel travel in certain directions. Mountain ranges present forbidding barriers traversed only by remote passes. Even the most trackless desert reveals favored routes, where explorers and caravan drivers have discovered areas of wind-blasted rock that are easier to traverse than shifting sand.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="82586bb7-ef13-4bef-82b7-fe17ec65bdd7">If the party veers off track, you might be able to relocate one or more of your planned encounters elsewhere on the map to ensure that the time spent preparing those encounters doesn’t go to waste.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="07a5c46e-f14b-469a-b01f-ea2a4ae927e3"><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/a-world-of-your-own" data-content-chunk-id="bffc9c68-aaa5-4694-a21c-c9f7c15e6979">Chapter 1</a> discusses the basics of creating a wilderness map at three different scales to help you design your world and the starting area of your campaign. Especially when you get down to province scale (1 hex = 1 mile), think about paths of travel — roads, passes, ridges and valleys, and so on — that can guide character movement across your map.</p>
<h3 id="MovementontheMap" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="0f6e044c-c456-4717-bfc9-7fb54da35e74"><a href="#MovementontheMap" data-content-chunk-id="b89e81d7-b931-40aa-a598-7d6e9b442734"></a>Movement on the Map</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a292284d-a4c2-4f9e-993a-6eb9cfdb75f5">Narrate wilderness travel at a level of detail appropriate to the map you’re using. If you’re tracking hour-by-hour movement on a province-scale map (1 hex = 1 mile), you can describe each hamlet the adventurers pass. At this scale, you can assume that the characters find a noteworthy location when they enter its hex unless the site is specifically hidden. The characters might not walk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle when they enter a hex, but they can find old paths, outlying ruins, and other signs of its presence in the area.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ab4830f2-6bb9-483f-b277-8ab5e73aea9b">If you’re tracking a journey of several days on a kingdom-scale map (1 hex = 6 miles), don’t bother with details too small to appear on your map. It’s enough for the players to know that on the third day of their journey, they cross a river and the land starts rising before them, and that they reach the mountain pass two days later.</p>
<h3 id="WildernessFeatures" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="8f93e2bc-d452-4bdb-af87-43c84f058d09"><a href="#WildernessFeatures" data-content-chunk-id="70ac337d-2b11-44e0-9d42-263ff1a972ee"></a>Wilderness Features</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8142e06e-1fdc-4de3-9247-f2f6d246d84f">No wilderness map is complete without a few settlements, strongholds, ruins, and other sites worthy of discovery. A dozen such locations scattered over an area roughly 50 miles across is a good start.</p>
<h4 id="MonsterLairs" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="3cfbef70-d616-49ff-8272-f69825c7ee72"><a href="#MonsterLairs" data-content-chunk-id="bf4910f2-3a97-4e9e-a50e-09440340a478"></a>Monster Lairs</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b410f04-a3fc-4bb8-9478-6d673abf1c11">A wilderness area approximately 50 miles across can support roughly a half-dozen monster lairs, but probably no more than one apex predator such as a dragon.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a64ce82c-801e-4269-9097-d3735f359a6d">If you expect the characters to explore a monster’s lair, you’ll need to find or create an appropriate map for the lair and stock the lair as you would a dungeon.</p>
<h4 id="Monuments" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c28345e3-1202-469f-8a42-7985e74f65dd"><a href="#Monuments" data-content-chunk-id="d2363834-e148-429d-a91a-ac4ac17a9fc8"></a>Monuments</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="472e2fdd-f625-44ef-95ea-2ad6802e9fc5">In places where civilization rules or once ruled, adventurers might find monuments built to honor great leaders, gods, and cultures. Use the Monuments table for inspiration, or randomly roll to determine what monument the adventurers stumble upon.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="533f13be-8a2b-44dd-abd0-2031501629cd">Crumbling towers, ancient temples, and razed cities are perfect sites for adventures. Additionally, noting the existence of an old, crumbling wall that runs alongside a road, a sagging stone windmill on a hilltop, or a jumble of standing stones can add texture to your wilderness.</p>
<h4 id="Settlements" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="e195d3a5-0585-4a96-a7b9-58ff20f90da2"><a href="#Settlements" data-content-chunk-id="79d1d829-6735-47d3-91a5-66a447483282"></a>Settlements</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="07618c1d-c409-4979-9eab-e4209f565773">Settlements exist in places where food, water, farmland, and building materials are abundant. A civilized province roughly 50 miles across might have one city, a few rural towns, and a scattering of villages and trading posts.

If the party is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gains a +5 bonus to the check, and a fast pace imposes a -5 penalty. If the party has an accurate map of the region or can see the sun or stars, the navigator has advantage on the check.</p>

When you need to flesh out a building quickly, roll on the Building Type table. Then roll on the table corresponding to that building to add further detail.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8c5b08d3-a90e-4e28-b717-97eec886d803">For towns and cities, note major roads and waterways as well as surrounding terrain. Outline the walls and mark the locations of features you know will be important: the lord’s keep, significant temples, and the like. For cities, add internal walls and think about the personality of each ward. Give the wards names reflecting their personalities, which also identify the kinds of trades that dominate the neighborhood (Tannery Square, Temple Row), a geographical characteristic (Hilltop, Riverside), or a dominant site (the Lords’ Quarter).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cd484ba7-f5a1-41d0-908a-9484ae71f35d">Although they hold the promise of safety, cities and towns can be just as dangerous as the darkest dungeon. Evil hides in plain sight or in dark corners. Sewers, shadowy alleys, slums, smoke-filled taverns, dilapidated tenements, and crowded marketplaces can quickly turn into battlegrounds. On top of that, adventurers must learn to behave themselves, lest they attract unwanted attention from local authorities.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0b41b28b-0119-4c71-aa2f-b2fbcb26c8d6">That said, characters who don’t go looking for trouble can take advantage of all the benefits that a settlement has to offer.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d366743d-e2c7-4c57-804a-51d82bd48a38">Whether a settlement has a police force depends on its size and nature. A lawful, orderly city might have a city watch to maintain order and a trained militia to defend its walls, and a frontier town might rely on adventurers or its citizenry to apprehend criminals and fend off attackers.</p>
<h4 id="Trials" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="6778e614-2869-4d24-9651-4ec4c42ad76d"><a href="#Trials" data-content-chunk-id="cb64f204-0d93-4706-b2cf-a00234bc0ecb"></a>Trials</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="472f3849-f627-40ef-9b71-f4ed42d87fce">In most settlements, trials are overseen by magistrates or local lords. Some trials are argued, with the conflicting parties or their advocates presenting precedent and evidence until the judge makes a decision, with or without the aid of spells or interrogation. Others are decided with a trial by ordeal or trial by combat. If the evidence against the accused is overwhelming, a magistrate or local lord can forgo a trial and skip right to the sentencing.</p>
<h4 id="Sentences" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="0a28d7f1-00a3-4503-a231-4e32b1888ac7"><a href="#Sentences" data-content-chunk-id="5fa74e4a-9d0f-4c88-9df8-9f3061accbff"></a>Sentences</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d55e86fb-8ffc-4ad9-8b71-ee5537047ff8">A settlement might have a jail to hold accused criminals awaiting trial, but few settlements have prisons to incarcerate convicted criminals. A person found guilty of a crime is usually fined, condemned to forced labor for a period of several months or years, exiled, or executed, depending on the magnitude of the crime.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="170e5c21-f3ff-43ca-9374-646b508760ac">The Random Urban Encounters table is useful for city- and town-based adventures. Check for a random encounter at least once per day, and once at night if the characters are out and about. Reroll the result if it doesn’t make sense given the time of day.</p>

Otherwise, a ship’s navigator must rely on dead reckoning (tracking the direction and distance of the ship’s travel) or the sun and the stars.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6c854835-fb40-4a8b-8863-b6356d239d6f">A shipwreck is a plot device that can be used sparingly to great effect, particularly if you want the characters to be washed ashore on some monster-infested island or (in the case of an airship) dropped in the middle of some exotic land. There aren’t rules for determining when a shipwreck happens; it happens when you want or need it to happen.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="134e39b7-0676-4544-8ea5-c10a37f16205">Even the strongest seafaring ship can founder in a storm, run aground on rocks or reefs, sink during a pirate attack, or be dragged underwater by a sea monster. A storm or hungry dragon can lay waste to an airship just as easily. A shipwreck has the potential to change the direction of a campaign. It isn’t, however, a particularly good way to kill off characters or end a campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="deac0bf7-c636-40f1-ab61-a172341254ac">If you and your campaign conspire to wreck a ship on which the characters are traveling, it is assumed that the characters survive with the equipment they were wearing or carrying still in their possession. The fate of any NPCs and cargo aboard the wrecked ship is entirely up to you.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1aa21515-240f-47c4-85f5-eeeaa38972dc">If weather conditions indicate both a strong wind and heavy rain, they combine to create a storm with high waves. A crew caught in a storm loses sight of all landmarks (unless there’s a lighthouse or other bright feature), and ability checks made to navigate during the storm have disadvantage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1f698273-b03d-4807-b215-ca677b5b23bf">In a dead calm (no wind), ships can’t move under sail and must be rowed. A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="aaa182b0-d918-48bb-9a04-756f3815a3da">A relatively calm sea offers great visibility. From a crow’s nest, a lookout can spot another ship or a coastline up to 10 miles away, assuming clear skies. Overcast skies reduce that distance by half. Rain and fog reduce visibility just as they do on land.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ca5318f5-e9a6-409d-a988-f4bd29ad922b">At some point in your campaign, the adventurers might gain custody of a ship. They might purchase or capture one or receive one to carry out a mission. It’s up to you whether a ship is available for purchase, and you have the power to deprive the adventurers of a ship at any time should it become a nuisance (see the “<a href="#Shipwrecks" data-content-chunk-id="0a01e38b-347c-40d0-b923-3d35b6e85986">Shipwrecks</a>” sidebar).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fc9c039a-d1fc-4883-8e8d-b38da1d03b64"><strong><em>Crew.</em></strong> A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to function. As per the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="bc435109-69a3-4d1a-b33b-54dadfadbe0c">Player’s Handbook</a>, one skilled hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of vessel, as shown in the Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d5d72f01-23d3-4621-a607-650d9c53b201">You can track the loyalty of individual crew members or the crew as a whole using the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters#OptionalRuleLoyalty" data-content-chunk-id="b5bea4dd-59c9-4504-ae58-9f40b3452d34">optional loyalty rules</a> in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters" data-content-chunk-id="2d07622c-3f57-4342-82de-6dc8e6731adf">chapter 4</a>. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a mutiny. If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew members leave the ship and never return.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aee52de7-4e7a-4bfe-ad46-3d2932b8cacd"><strong><em>Passengers.</em></strong> The table indicates the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate. Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5b00d94a-5069-4cc2-8e9a-8a6b9c39d68c">A passenger is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 gp per day.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aba2c3ab-984e-44df-8e71-ce003f8475d6"><strong><em>Cargo.</em></strong> The table indicates the maximum tonnage each kind of ship can carry.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eb37466e-fd9c-41c0-ac67-79843a6595dc"><strong><em>Damage Threshold.</em></strong> A ship has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the ship’s hit points.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="32a3d28f-36b0-49d9-92ba-16267fe11789"><strong><em>Ship Repair.</em></strong> Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="af823681-3960-47d8-9013-820d99cbb724">Flying characters can move from one place to another in a relatively straight line, ignoring terrain and monsters that can’t fly or that lack ranged attacks.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="16245b3b-3134-4ab1-a24c-0a128532a9c4">Flying by spell or magic item works the same as travel on foot, as described in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="9a21a25a-f720-481b-9a0d-fedcf4eb1485">Player’s Handbook</a>. A creature that serves as a flying mount must rest 1 hour for every 3 hours it flies, and it can’t fly for more than 9 hours per day. Thus, characters mounted on <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16913-griffon" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16913-tooltip">griffons</a> (which have a flying speed of 80 feet) can travel at 8 miles per hour, covering 72 miles over 9 hours with two 1-hour-long rests over the course of the day. Mounts that don’t tire (such as a flying construct) aren’t subject to this limitation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dcc3221a-cdd4-456f-8634-56c05927717e">As adventurers travel through the air, check for random encounters as you normally would. Ignore any result that indicates a non-flying monster, unless the characters are flying close enough to the ground to be targeted by non-flying creatures making ranged attacks. Characters have normal chances to spot creatures on the ground and can decide whether to engage them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="86dda54a-7ac6-40a5-8c80-631f7a5f4f4e">Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In the D&amp;D game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3b73d830-583f-4abb-b52e-5bdd99522cbe">A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. <strong>Mechanical traps</strong> include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. <strong>Magic traps</strong> are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2125-glyph-of-warding" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2125-tooltip">glyph of warding</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2272-symbol" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2272-tooltip">symbol</a> that function as traps.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cd06c590-f528-4a17-aeb3-2113fe304f6c">When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="266f426b-da3d-4b27-8026-c6484e0f60cb">Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2125-glyph-of-warding" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2125-tooltip">glyph of warding</a> spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="097a77bc-b406-4a48-8aa6-3d57c5c88a6b">Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="81a9186c-b378-4b28-b761-4c83f619f645">A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e979840a-7fcf-4344-bf4b-6391643b16e8">Any character can attempt an Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description.

In addition, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2072-dispel-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2072-tooltip">dispel magic</a> has a chance of disabling most magic traps.

<p data-content-chunk-id="2c72968b-53c9-4dfc-a230-75854889673b">In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e230b610-1b4d-4ad6-a6c5-3f525bf31f67">You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f69a3cb5-37af-47b0-adc5-47df9486c690">Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3b4e800f-3f63-48a1-8f1c-cb914b34ee72">Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d5e8f39f-0ff5-427f-8be7-27be02384dba">The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f5deb5ba-2f92-4bea-ad77-bf18327a0a57">The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="22464c40-8681-4c7f-8773-ef36e7d67610">A trap intended to be a <strong>setback</strong> is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a <strong>dangerous</strong> trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A <strong>deadly</strong> trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="bf3769b8-64b7-44ab-8896-2c2932ba7000">Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2b257b0b-c188-4211-8fc1-62961109dd5e">When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bd0c4f62-d0da-4e1e-b7b8-d1f5a0a27fc6">For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="344b60d1-227c-4dca-9a7c-321a8f7ba45c">The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1ef77dc4-96fb-4c18-bc3e-60b702d233bc">Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8ddbb5d7-8e7d-4097-a074-ef55f87beb46">The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="752087cc-d2ca-401a-9e4a-f574fe8715a5">When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

<p data-content-chunk-id="17c64908-4e6e-4351-8217-8023f5d4709f">This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cc63121b-e724-44b1-862c-4d80a9c27bfd">The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36f79c58-6f19-4944-8945-f6e4da67fa1b">When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area.

<p data-content-chunk-id="03e9a095-3a5d-4f7c-8a36-d0f69fb266ee">This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9967f186-e81a-4e9d-a90c-8b7a62548baf">The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2065-detect-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2065-tooltip">detect magic</a>, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="40907617-ce18-4c5e-aeaf-46f93584c9fb">The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e6af637-dc9d-41c9-8304-71119ef6f9ae">Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.

<p data-content-chunk-id="1d4f7801-823d-471a-af6b-0bdd633ca0ea"><em>Mechanical trap</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="787e6c36-6aa5-4614-b88e-68e0b08a7b4e">Four basic pit traps are presented here.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1dc71e22-0fdf-45e6-a9f8-811872989a1c"><strong><em>Simple Pit.</em></strong> A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="012cbca9-6e7d-45f6-86b8-444df8a3c1ea">The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f470b939-b202-4da5-ae3f-1af130a9adb7"><strong><em>Hidden Pit.</em></strong> This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f5a1e5bc-9b53-4f6a-995c-9816aedf913b">A successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9a5e9316-1371-4934-b8a9-596f6c0ff7c2">When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b944d772-2356-43b1-8fa6-93a08a4fc637">Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2003-arcane-lock" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2003-tooltip">arcane lock</a> spell or similar magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4b91183f-a81c-4fbc-9822-2a4fad13e406"><strong><em>Locking Pit.</em></strong> This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="50e6fdb2-3864-4acc-a476-a9b97958cd4b">A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open (determine the cover’s statistics using the guidelines in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game" data-content-chunk-id="19d1a034-cf89-42bb-959e-a8a1e1996058">chapter 8</a>). A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1694bd92-f459-4c7e-99b0-6561282cdc7d"><strong><em>Spiked Pit.</em></strong> This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a1b8d6f1-398a-4ee6-8118-0e313275faa3"><em>Mechanical trap</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="73ee24c8-4b29-4828-8d9c-1fddf72b4981">When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5a442652-7db6-46b3-b48f-3d7e9c770fef">The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d547d2af-d550-4f4a-8846-9b91fcd40744">The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h4 id="PoisonNeedle" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="5341aeb0-f85e-4600-a003-7d526d0aa983"><a href="#PoisonNeedle" data-content-chunk-id="24521d8a-8409-40a0-a536-8a2e4bb41d4c"></a>Poison Needle</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e4094a1e-9ff8-4ce9-b3cd-299881d1d35d"><em>Mechanical trap</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="93c1ee47-c301-437c-a5e0-e1200511b0be">A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="62c06191-d54f-4d94-b9c2-210ab7dc60f5">When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/11-tooltip">poisoned</a> for 1 hour.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9d523608-01ec-4bf7-96c4-bc88e8fb36be">A successful DC 20 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.</p>
<h4 id="RollingSphere" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="4711950e-a700-4939-a804-2bd2f2e1f5d2"><a href="#RollingSphere" data-content-chunk-id="7f290a1d-711f-4b20-8527-5888f0230954"></a>Rolling Sphere</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb0cbb77-1225-4019-8083-2859f0fa95aa"><em>Mechanical trap</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1b9c16fe-974d-41a0-8e71-ff45d4779268">When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="46bcfc68-1ac3-4018-9cda-f4dc402c97d9">With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fe0d0c2e-1df6-418e-b1dc-944b27128d6e">Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/12-tooltip">prone</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d45372fa-1064-49b2-92e8-4fe2c2872378">The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.</p>

On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d2ede1f3-2dbe-48c0-a1bd-dea0e4344757">Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c63d70af-b08a-4dd9-b45a-5f6eac99c9a8">A successful DC 20 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/6-tooltip">Arcana</a>) check reveals that the mouth contains a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4759-sphere-of-annihilation" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4759-tooltip">sphere of annihilation</a> that can’t be controlled or moved.

<p data-content-chunk-id="df1a6c88-18f3-4aa2-a8e7-8013921fbef9">A campaign is much more than a series of adventures. It also includes the moments between them — the various distractions and side pursuits that engage the characters when they’re not exploring the wilderness, plundering dungeons, and gallivanting around the multiverse on some epic quest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aab7b8ad-afae-46df-9bd0-225a256f59a0">The natural pace of a campaign offers lulls between adventures, time for the characters to spend their treasure and pursue their goals. This downtime gives the characters an opportunity to sink their roots a little deeper into the world, building a personal investment in what happens to the people and places around them, which can, in turn, draw them into further adventures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2a2ad5bc-f625-4b23-abd5-411fdc880a68">Chapter 5, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment" data-content-chunk-id="37fccdf0-28e9-4365-b937-9faef1114280">Equipment</a>" of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="42b9c69c-c9c9-43dc-8b3b-f24a4bb2a1c9">Player’s Handbook</a> details the expenses that a character incurs for basic necessities, depending on the lifestyle the character chooses, from poverty to luxury. Chapter 8, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring" data-content-chunk-id="830f2b9d-768b-40c1-8877-2349cb3d64b7">Adventuring</a>" of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="a1308da2-a2ec-4836-8fae-fe0e37a4f731">Player’s Handbook</a> describes some of the downtime activities they can pursue between adventures. This chapter fills in the gaps, describing the expenses of owning property and hiring NPCs, and a variety of additional downtime activities characters can pursue. The beginning of the chapter also offers suggestions for linking adventures together and keeping track of events in your campaign.</p>

<h2 id="LinkingAdventures" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="db5ee149-d168-456f-8368-7b5b76f7b19a"><a href="#LinkingAdventures" data-content-chunk-id="8f24169b-0ea6-497b-8117-bcdd1d4dc2c3"></a>Linking Adventures</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="759eeac8-58ab-4925-9556-bb94ef1fd157">A campaign in the style of an episodic television show rarely needs story links between its adventures. Each adventure features its own villains, and once the characters complete the adventure, there are typically no loose plot threads. The next adventure presents an altogether different challenge having nothing to do with the adventure that preceded it. As the characters gain experience points, they become more powerful, as do the threats they must overcome. This kind of campaign is easy to run, since it requires little effort beyond finding or creating adventures appropriate for the party’s level.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ca024779-a0cd-49bd-8da6-2d5430b67db9">A campaign with a narrative lets the players feel as though their actions have far-reaching consequences. They’re not just racking up experience points. A few simple modifications can help you overlay overarching elements to create a serialized campaign in which early adventures help set up later ones.</p>
<h2 id="UsinganOverarchingStory" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="01090d80-ecfa-4477-bd53-c9708d990001"><a href="#UsinganOverarchingStory" data-content-chunk-id="2f42dcad-8131-460a-bd2d-27302380e4fc"></a>Using an Overarching Story</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f75c0a77-2f5c-4bc4-bc55-51537a271408">This section presents a couple of examples of overarching stories which have, over the years, fueled many classic D&amp;D campaigns.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1b6668ad-d866-4346-9e81-652f4fe727e0">The adventurers’ goal in the first example is to amass the power they need to defeat a powerful enemy that threatens the world. Their goal in the second example is to defend something they care about by destroying whatever threatens it. The two examples are, in effect, the same story (variations of the battle between good and evil) told in different ways.</p>
<h4 id="Example1TheQuestofManyParts" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="9589d89f-1ed1-40a7-b4e1-4e6db381fbb6"><a href="#Example1TheQuestofManyParts" data-content-chunk-id="6ff9f892-b02b-46b8-a5e0-cc7bdbb0ce77"></a>Example 1: The Quest of Many Parts</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a51ebedc-70be-4097-8304-53acecbd055c">You can tie adventures together using an overarching goal that can be fulfilled only by first completing a series of related quests. For example, you could create a villain who can’t be defeated until the characters explore nine dungeons in which the Nine Dread Princes reside, with each of these dungeons stocked with enough monsters and hazards to advance the adventurers two or three levels. The adventurers spend their whole careers fighting the Nine Dread Princes before finally pursuing an epic quest to destroy the princes’ monstrous progenitor. As long as every dungeon is unique and interesting, your players will appreciate the tight focus of the campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d40f7d69-e7d3-494b-9101-71e64daa1d59">In a similar type of quest campaign, the adventurers might need to collect fragments of an artifact that are scattered in ruins across the multiverse, before reassembling the artifact and using it to defeat a cosmic threat.</p>
<h4 id="Example2AgentsofX" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="1aeedc92-249e-4ad2-9da7-e61c354e5d2a"><a href="#Example2AgentsofX" data-content-chunk-id="0212241e-e928-4a2a-b5ae-1e1757ae94e0"></a>Example 2: Agents of X</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1535e049-1c0a-4678-bcc7-e0dccb747ab4">You can also build a campaign around the idea that the adventurers are agents of something larger than themselves — a kingdom or secret organization, for example. Wherever their allegiance lies, the adventurers are motivated by loyalty and the goal of protecting whatever it is they serve.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ddae9ee5-ade4-413e-b649-db20fcb29f3a">The characters’ overarching mission might be to explore and map an uncharted region, forging alliances where they can and overcoming threats they encounter along the way. Their goal might be to find the ancient capital of a fallen empire, which lies beyond the realm of a known enemy and forces them to navigate hostile territory. The characters could be pilgrims in search of a holy site or members of a secret order dedicated to defending the last bastions of civilization in an ever-declining world. Or they might be spies and assassins, striving to weaken an enemy country by targeting its evil leaders and plundering its treasures.</p>
<h2 id="PlantingAdventureSeeds" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="2763d2bc-5520-4e11-b0cc-0b4238e508fc"><a href="#PlantingAdventureSeeds" data-content-chunk-id="966d467d-bb70-40d3-9959-ad37b891d752"></a>Planting Adventure Seeds</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="80b516e2-ef1a-4a30-af1b-d844d6ceab2d">You can make a campaign feel like one story with many chapters by planting the seeds of the next adventure before the current one is finished. This technique can naturally moves the characters along to their next goal.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c594d7d3-dda9-4b1f-a4a9-eeeed1f93de8">If you’ve planted a seed well, the characters have something else to do when they finish an adventure. Perhaps a character drinks from a magic fountain in a dungeon and receives a mystifying vision that leads to the next quest. The party might find a cryptic map or relic that, once its meaning or purpose is determined, points to a new destination. Perhaps an NPC warns the characters of impending danger or implores them for help.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4ddbf8e1-3a92-4e29-b939-ceee89431dba">The trick is to not distract the characters from the adventure at hand. Designing an effective hook for a future adventure requires finesse. The lure should be compelling, but not so irresistible that the players stop caring about what their characters are doing right now.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8ec31aab-2124-44d2-b5a1-e320128931ce">To keep players from straying, save your best ideas for the very end of your adventures, or insert them during periods of downtime.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6da690d3-83c5-48f0-80eb-56424a7c61c5">Here are a few examples of ways in which an adventure seed can be revealed:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="bb6783f1-6385-4364-a07f-b628aca43f60">
<li data-content-chunk-id="9ff831f9-ac2e-4747-b104-ea75efb4c283">On a villain’s corpse, the characters find evidence that the villain was working for someone else.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="44af3ed2-1ab1-4e73-8c41-9dfeffc8fb65">A captured NPC reveals the location of someone or something that might interest the characters.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="54db35b0-b558-4b20-9dbd-7aaf6894de1b">The characters are heading to a local tavern when they spot a wanted poster or a missing person poster (complete with the promise of a sizable reward).</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="db25a875-65a6-43d3-a4c5-b5061dc809bd">Members of the local militia or city watch put out the word that a crime has been committed, and they’re looking for potential witnesses and suspects.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="4aebecce-c8e4-496b-878e-c37030d5217e">The characters receive an anonymous letter that sheds light on a plot or impending event of which they were previously unaware.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Foreshadowing" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="93910d57-6406-431f-8b9f-7f6eb5ccb362"><a href="#Foreshadowing" data-content-chunk-id="2a34a777-8489-4263-b3a3-b87d9e4ade26"></a>Foreshadowing</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="44057233-217f-45ee-9d0f-825e730a0547">Foreshadowing is an exercise in subtlety, involving the delicate planting of seeds for future adventures. Not all foreshadowing bears fruit, particularly if the clues are too subtle or if events conspire to take your campaign in a new direction. The goal of foreshadowing is to hint at upcoming events and new threats in your campaign without making it obvious to players that you’re telling them what the future holds. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="9f48ec08-2fc3-4114-a9f7-7aa6f87dbd2c">
<li data-content-chunk-id="4e2d2677-9d57-4f3b-87f9-279ca099308b">An object worn or carried by an enemy has the symbol of a previously unknown organization engraved or written on it.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="26331151-345a-404f-b55a-796cade5edc5">A soothsayer standing on a street corner spouts fragments of an ancient prophecy, while pointing a crooked finger at the characters.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="922611d5-4652-496b-a0f8-cfc4acc69ce3">The king and queen announce the marriage of their son to the daughter of a neighboring monarch, but various factions oppose the union. Trouble is brewing.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="86e54570-a31e-46f0-bbc0-b0de063ef6aa">Bugbear scouts are making incursions into civilized lands and spying on settlements, as a prelude to a hobgoblin warlord’s invasion.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="acc9fe0b-dec4-4854-b878-c9f6ab904ba7">A puppet show in a market square predicts a tragic outcome if two noble houses on the cusp of declaring war on each other refuse to reconcile.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="de45eaa1-2575-415d-b093-2d0956559fcf">NPC adventurers in a city are being murdered in a similar yet unusual manner, hinting at a future threat to the player characters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="CampaignTracking" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f9992906-280c-411b-b0cd-40010701ebb1"><a href="#CampaignTracking" data-content-chunk-id="50b3ec50-838b-42f2-abb2-f8d26c5688b5"></a>Campaign Tracking</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c804c6e-45d3-4ef1-9108-8dac0eb6c5e1">Consistent details bring your campaign to life, and continuity helps players imagine that their characters are living in a real world. If the adventurers frequent a particular tavern, the staff, layout of the building, and decor shouldn’t change much from one visit to the next. That said, changes can occur as a result of the characters’ actions or of actions they learn about. When the adventurers kill a monster, it stays dead, unless someone raises it. When they remove treasure from a room, it doesn’t reappear the next time they enter — assuming it hasn’t been stolen from them! If they leave a door open, it should stay open until someone closes it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="70f877d6-a009-425b-9c03-ddf90508ce86">No one’s memory is infallible, so it pays to keep records. Jot notes directly on an adventure map to keep track of open doors, disarmed traps, and the like. Events beyond the scope of a single adventure are best recorded in a notebook dedicated to your campaign. Whether it’s a physical book or an electronic file, such a record is a great way to keep your notes organized.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0b81642f-6baa-463e-8b30-720ca46d55b2">Your notebook might include any of the following elements.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d7929975-d2f8-4528-a54e-ece8035a7515"><strong><em>Campaign Planner.</em></strong> Write down the main story arc of your campaign, and keep track of things that you hope appear in future adventures. Update it as the campaign develops, adding ideas as they come to you.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c83f071c-b1bc-40d3-93b1-dbe6be8f7926"><strong><em>Character Notes.</em></strong> Write down the characters’ backgrounds and goals, since these notes can help you design adventure content that provides opportunities for character development.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f3387e87-0cd7-4210-8cc5-ebcbc3474524">Keep a running tally of the adventurers’ classes and levels, as well as any quests and downtime activities they’re engaged in.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="47183ce9-6324-47b3-acc4-ddb891285033">If the characters have a ship or stronghold, record its name and whereabouts, as well as any hirelings in the characters’ employ.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c7e1dcdb-1592-4606-ab04-c534db6b4e39"><strong><em>Player Handouts.</em></strong> Keep a copy of all handouts you make for your players so that you don’t have to remember their contents later.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="740817ca-c074-4b95-8f8f-2430398152c4"><strong><em>Adventure Log.</em></strong> Think of this log as an episode guide for your campaign. Summarize each game session or adventure to help you keep track of the unfolding campaign story. You can give your players access to this log as well, or to an edited version stripped of your notes and secrets. (The players might also keep their own record of adventures, which you can refer to if your own log is incomplete.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f1adfc00-838e-41be-9f2e-1a7d86481299"><strong><em>NPC Notes.</em></strong> Record statistics and roleplaying notes for any NPC the characters interact with more than once. For example, your notes might differentiate important people in a town by their different voices, as well as their names, the places where they live and work, the names of their family members and associates, and maybe even a secret that each one of them has.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e42516a6-426b-4cd5-99aa-f352cfce6943"><strong><em>Campaign Calendar.</em></strong> Your world feels more real to your players when the characters notice the passage of time. Note details such as the change of seasons and major holidays, and keep track of any important events that affect the larger story.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b5993305-1cc8-4eda-9aa4-316ff53d5389"><strong><em>Toolbox.</em></strong> Keep notes whenever you create or significantly alter a monster, magic item, or trap. Keep any maps, random dungeons, or encounters you create. This information ensures you won’t repeat your work, and you’ll be able to draw on this material later.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="dedee91e-3b5e-4727-9fcd-70548a4e385d">Besides the expenses associated with maintaining a particular lifestyle, adventurers might have additional drains on their adventuring income. Player characters who come into possession of property, own businesses, and employ hirelings must cover the expenses that accompany these ventures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d6001d8-6d8c-4493-8721-4dba3efc2e24">It’s not unusual for adventurers — especially after 10th level — to gain possession of a castle, a tavern, or another piece of property. They might buy it with their hard-won loot, take it by force, obtain it in a lucky draw from a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4617-deck-of-many-things" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4617-tooltip">deck of many things</a>, or acquire it by other means.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1f0a8f1a-7103-417d-86ba-0717c22f2043">The Maintenance Costs table shows the per-day upkeep cost for any such property. (The cost of a normal residence isn’t included here because it falls under lifestyle expenses, as discussed in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="a8274077-37ff-4e74-a267-075b55b34322">Player’s Handbook</a>.) Maintenance expenses need to be paid every 30 days. Given that adventurers spend much of their time adventuring, staff includes a steward who can make payments in the party’s absence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="def1c8fd-a9a2-40eb-889a-c10ebb39d29f"><strong><em>Total Cost per Day.</em></strong> The cost includes everything it takes to maintain the property and keep things running smoothly, including the salaries of hirelings. If the property earns money that can offset maintenance costs (by charging fees, collecting tithes or donations, or selling goods), that is taken into account in the table.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e7174309-8e6d-4475-80d7-2ac9354cca36"><strong><em>Skilled and Untrained Hirelings.</em></strong> The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="61e14567-45b5-4a31-8023-d543eaa53071">Player’s Handbook</a> explains the difference between a skilled hireling and an untrained one.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e1e6531d-b3f5-469b-8fae-21c55bac4f85">The campaign benefits when characters have time between adventures to engage in other activities. Allowing days, weeks, or months to pass between adventures stretches the campaign over a longer period of time and helps to manage the characters’ level progression, preventing them from gaining too much power too quickly.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="642e0ceb-9196-4e4b-a802-8fbb8519f90b">Allowing characters to pursue side interests between adventures also encourages players to become more invested in the campaign world. When a character owns a tavern in a village or spends time carousing with the locals, that character’s player is more likely to respond to threats to the village and its inhabitants.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fdf23fa1-2685-4267-aad0-84e88e9f35a5">As your campaign progresses, your players’ characters will not only become more powerful but also more influential and invested in the world. They might be inclined to undertake projects that require more time between adventures, such as building and maintaining a stronghold. As the party gains levels, you can add more downtime between adventures to give characters the time they need to pursue such interests. Whereas days or weeks might pass between low-level adventures, the amount of downtime between higher-level adventures might be measured in months or years.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="56898870-9d49-4685-ac98-13f35d14c6b0">Chapter 8, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring" data-content-chunk-id="82a52e9b-52c2-4fa6-9ae7-a974688dce55">Adventuring</a>" of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="eb1bf980-4bfd-42d8-b637-db51877e5195">Player’s Handbook</a> describes a few downtime activities to fill the void between adventures. Depending on the style of your campaign and the particular backgrounds and interests of the adventurers, you can make some or all of the following additional activities available as options.</p>
<h4 id="BuildingaStronghold" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="b194c75d-b944-47f3-b882-b62dcb97e048"><a href="#BuildingaStronghold" data-content-chunk-id="e888f070-42aa-4912-acb6-8d2180f22656"></a>Building a Stronghold</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d5ffe8a9-09d0-4c17-add1-cdbaf859a43f">A character can spend time between adventures building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies within a kingdom or similar domain, the character will need a royal charter (a legal document granting permission to oversee the estate in the name of the crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing custody of the land to the character for as long as he or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can also be acquired by inheritance or other means.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dba1cf08-74a7-41b9-81d4-36a7f084f578">Royal charters and land grants are usually given by the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A small estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, if it can be bought at all.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db52952c-e18f-4746-93aa-7164eab292e7">Once the estate is secured, a character needs access to building materials and laborers. The Building a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the stronghold (including materials and labor) and the amount of time it takes, provided that the character is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can continue while the character is away, but each day the character is away adds 3 days to the construction time.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a1e56807-7415-4374-9745-89ace2afd6e5">Magic items are the DM’s purview, so you decide how they fall into the party’s possession. As an option, you can allow player characters to craft magic items.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0803e8f5-0a42-4eb6-817a-44b9afc68005">The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive task. To start, a character must have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item’s rarity, as shown in the Crafting Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character could create a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4794-wand-of-magic-missiles" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4794-tooltip">wand of magic missiles</a> (an uncommon item), as long as the character has spell slots and can cast <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2176-magic-missile" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2176-tooltip">magic missile</a>. That same character could make a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5400-weapon-1" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5400-tooltip">+1 weapon</a> (another uncommon item), no particular spell required.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6a7e09f6-cb93-40eb-9cef-de952ade3224">You can decide that certain items also require special materials or locations to be created. For example, a character might need alchemist’s supplies to brew a particular potion, or the formula for a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5386-flame-tongue" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5386-tooltip">flame tongue</a> might require that the weapon be forged with lava.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6daea411-6e04-498d-bd0a-8565ba816fd6">An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table (half that cost for a consumable, such as a potion or scroll). A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c15c9851-5cee-40b2-8252-d0762c13af94">If a spell will be produced by the item being created, the creator must expend one spell slot of the spell’s level for each day of the creation process. The spell’s material components must also be at hand throughout the process. If the spell normally consumes those components, they are consumed by the creation process. If the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as with a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5418-tooltip">spell scroll</a>, the components are consumed only once by the process. Otherwise, the components are consumed once each day of the item’s creation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="28e4a0e7-817c-4fbc-bef6-131861b507bc">Multiple characters can combine their efforts to create a magic item if each of them meets the level prerequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell slots, and components, as long as everyone participates during the entire crafting process. Each character can contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent helping to craft the item.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="89e87e4a-35af-4f58-8e6e-587e12534aeb">Normally, a character who undertakes this activity creates a magic item described in chapter 7, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure" data-content-chunk-id="19f3c1f7-c4da-4f19-b9a2-76ce764a18ce">Treasure</a>."

<p data-content-chunk-id="7362e12e-bd87-47bb-ad2e-b1b45087b6f1">Few people can afford to buy a magic item, and fewer still know how to find one. Adventurers are exceptional in this regard due to the nature of their profession.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="140127de-6cf2-4dd9-84e0-678edba72206">A character who comes into possession of a common, uncommon, rare, or very rare magic item that he or she wants to sell can spend downtime searching for a buyer. This downtime activity can be performed only in a city or another location where one can find wealthy individuals interested in buying magic items. Legendary magic items and priceless artifacts can’t be sold during downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be the substance of an adventure or quest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5c88b6f9-2482-49bb-bca4-f30ffab67d77">For each salable item, the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check to find buyers. Another character can use his or her downtime to assist with the search, granting advantage on the checks. On a failed check, no buyer for the item is found after a search that lasts 10 days. On a successful check, a buyer for the item is found after a number of days based on the item’s rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Item table.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9f0f428c-8c5c-41e2-a80d-f172f06e0688">A character can attempt to find buyers for multiple magic items at once. Although this requires multiple Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) checks, the searches are occurring simultaneously, and the results of multiple failures or successes aren’t added together. For example, if the character finds a buyer for a common magic item in 2 days and a buyer for an uncommon item in 5 days, but fails to find a buyer for a rare item up for grabs, the entire search takes 10 days.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="577933b0-af6e-4274-a694-d511de79f35a">For each item a character wishes to sell, the player rolls percentile dice and consults the <a href="#SellingaMagicItem" data-content-chunk-id="648538dc-75b5-476d-b8a9-8aeb5d7b53f8">Selling a Magic Item</a> table, applying a modifier based on the item’s rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Items table. The character also makes a Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check and adds that check’s total to the roll. The subsequent total determines what a buyer offers to pay for the item.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08ed4d31-3e38-431d-bdba-3da325d99b85">You determine a buyer’s identity. Buyers sometimes procure rare and very rare items through proxies to ensure that their identities remain unknown. If the buyer is shady, it’s up to you whether the sale creates legal complications for the party later.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="38a7ce39-3edc-4b9d-9790-bb6b07db6545">Swaying public opinion can be an effective way to bring down a villain or elevate a friend. Spreading rumors is an efficient, if underhanded, way to accomplish that goal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject’s standing in a community or embroil someone in scandal. A rumor needs to be simple, concrete, and hard to disprove. An effective rumor also has to be believable, playing off what people want to believe about the person in question.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91153e07-565b-463f-b642-e2fe01fc92a4">Sowing a rumor about an individual or organization requires a number of days depending on the size of the community, as shown in the Sowing Rumors table. In a town or city, the time spent must be continuous. If the character spreads a rumor for ten days, disappears on an adventure for another few days and then returns, the rumor fades away without the benefit of constant repetition.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6f2390dc-7b5c-4827-a733-fe9db3809869">The character must spend 1 gp per day to cover the cost of drinks, social appearances, and the like. At the end of the time spent sowing the rumor, the character must make a DC 15 Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/16-tooltip">Deception</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check. If the check succeeds, the community’s prevailing attitude toward the subject shifts one step toward friendly or hostile, as the character wishes. If the check fails, the rumor gains no traction, and further attempts to propagate it fail.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f3daba8c-bc7b-4ce4-9725-7dcc1b405eda">Shifting a community’s general attitude toward a person or organization doesn’t affect everyone in the community.

<p data-content-chunk-id="5a41abc4-85d4-4ca5-946f-c627f69d616e">As a variant rule, you can require characters to spend downtime training or studying before they gain the benefits of a new level. If you choose this option, once a character has earned enough experience points to attain a new level, he or she must train for a number of days before gaining any class features associated with the new level.</p>

<li data-content-chunk-id="b742f7d1-d124-47a8-902c-adfa93c5eb10">An activity should never negate the need or desire for characters to go on adventures.</li>

<li data-content-chunk-id="25ee3dd5-a3f3-4715-9338-856f8ba484b1">Activities that reveal new adventure hooks and previously unknown facts about your campaign can help you foreshadow future events and conflicts.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="754c0b2a-7cf6-499d-bd2d-cfd60aca60ca">Treasure comes in many forms.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="63073414-a425-42a3-88f2-21b62ca7fbe6"><strong><em>Coins.</em></strong> The most basic type of treasure is money, including copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), electrum pieces (ep), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp). Fifty coins of any type weigh 1 pound.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36ce34d0-d0e6-48a3-b9a5-d2ff8fe83de6"><strong><em>Gemstones.</em></strong> Gemstones are small, lightweight, and easily secured compared to their same value in coins. See the “Gemstones” section for types of stones, gems, and jewels that can be found as treasure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6b1009e-4af0-404e-abcb-f121e5e5f33c"><strong><em>Art Objects.</em></strong> Idols cast of solid gold, necklaces studded with precious stones, paintings of ancient kings, bejeweled dishes—art objects include all these and more. See the “<a href="#ArtObjects" data-content-chunk-id="2d940466-3298-46e7-8673-5471df8454fe">Art Objects</a>” section for types of decorative and valuable artworks that can be found as treasure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7336c60d-9368-4572-9998-50a383aab5da"><strong><em>Magic Items.</em></strong> Types of magic items include armor, potions, scrolls, rings, rods, staffs, wands, weapons, and wondrous items. Magic items also have rarities: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="730fffbb-3af1-4b1f-975d-6760780893d4">Intelligent monsters often use magic items in their possession, while others might hide them away to ensure they don’t get lost or stolen. For example, if a hobgoblin tribe has a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5245-longsword-1" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5245-tooltip">longsword, +1</a> and an <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5346-alchemy-jug" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5346-tooltip">alchemy jug</a> in its treasure hoard, the tribe’s warlord might wield the sword, while the jug is kept somewhere safe.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="cb9ceed4-fad7-4888-872e-ea73cc3fc301">A Treasure Hoard table helps you randomly determine the contents of a large cache of treasure, the accumulated wealth of a large group of creatures (such as an orc tribe or a hobgoblin army), the belongings of a single powerful creature that likes to hoard treasure (such as a dragon), or the reward bestowed upon a party after completing a quest for a benefactor. You can also split up a treasure hoard so that the adventurers don’t find or receive it all at once.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ba71fd8e-3c1f-4f5a-9ae8-f72f0dd0be71">When determining the contents of a hoard belonging to one monster, use the table that corresponds to that monster’s challenge rating. When rolling to determine a treasure hoard belonging to a large group of monsters, use the challenge rating of the monster that leads the group. If the hoard belongs to no one, use the challenge rating of the monster that presides over the dungeon or lair you are stocking. If the hoard is a gift from a benefactor, use the challenge rating equal to the party’s average level.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7ffbd596-6adc-4a59-9646-a3e2eec51f85">Every treasure hoard contains a random number of coins, as shown at the top of each table. Roll a d100 and consult the table to determine how many gemstones or art objects the hoard contains, if any. Use the same roll to determine whether the hoard contains magic items.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="261ec8b2-7e8b-4c0f-b6b0-96a4b5e6796d">As with the individual treasure tables, average values are given in parentheses. You can use an average value instead of rolling dice to save time.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="26b0e008-f69f-48e7-a96d-4977342c4d7f">If a treasure hoard seems too small, you can roll multiple times on the table. Use this approach for monsters that are particularly fond of amassing treasure. Legendary creatures that accumulate treasure are wealthier than normal. Always roll at least twice on the appropriate table and add the results together.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5fa2f093-868c-46af-88f9-afd5c9707348">You can hand out as much or as little treasure as you want. Over the course of a typical campaign, a party finds treasure hoards amounting to seven rolls on the Challenge 0–4 table, eighteen rolls on the Challenge 5–10 table, twelve rolls on the Challenge 11–16 table, and eight rolls on the Challenge 17+ table.</p>

Some legendary items, such as the <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5344-apparatus-of-kwalish" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5344-tooltip">apparatus of Kwalish</a>, are unique. The game assumes that the secrets of creating the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were then gradually lost as a result of wars, cataclysms, and mishaps. Even uncommon items can’t be easily created. Thus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a39c9eb3-7063-4d08-b219-d8efd58d2451">Rarity provides a rough measure of an item’s power relative to other magic items. Each rarity corresponds to character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity table. A character doesn’t typically find a rare magic item, for example, until around 5th level. That said, rarity shouldn’t get in the way of your campaign’s story. If you want a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4723-ring-of-invisibility" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4723-tooltip">ring of invisibility</a> to fall into the hands of a 1st-level character, so be it. No doubt a great story will arise from that event.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0c1c035a-e947-4bd8-86f7-63dee5c0e35a">If your campaign allows for trade in magic items, rarity can also help you set prices for them. As the DM, you determine the value of an individual magic item based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in the Magic Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable item, such as a potion or scroll, is typically half the value of a permanent item of the same rarity.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="40878004-9d7f-4943-ad60-fbae9864a21e">Unless you decide your campaign works otherwise, most magic items are so rare that they aren’t available for purchase. Common items, such as a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/8960641-potion-of-healing" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/8960641-tooltip">potion of healing</a>, can be procured from an alchemist, herbalist, or spellcaster. Doing so is rarely as simple as walking into a shop and selecting an item from a shelf. The seller might ask for a service, rather than coin.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eba3cbcf-4f88-426f-b7c4-b96fbfcaa2af">In a large city with an academy of magic or a major temple, buying and selling magic items might be possible, at your discretion. If your world includes a large number of adventurers engaged in retrieving ancient magic items, trade in these items might be more common. Even so, it’s likely to remain similar to the market for fine art in the real world, with invitation-only auctions and a tendency to attract thieves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ab49ff36-226c-45d2-a485-6f56abe9e0ee">Selling magic items is difficult in most D&amp;D worlds primarily because of the challenge of finding a buyer. Plenty of people might like to have a magic sword, but few of them can afford it. Those who can afford such an item usually have more practical things to spend on. See chapter 6, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="38029790-7ede-427e-b41a-399c0bf403b9">Between Adventures</a>" for one way to handle selling magic items.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1c8e8a96-473e-4755-b4b7-6d9ef8593590">In your campaign, magic items might be prevalent enough that adventurers can buy and sell them with some effort. Magic items might be for sale in bazaars or auction houses in fantastical locations, such as the City of Brass, the planar metropolis of Sigil, or even in more ordinary cities. Sale of magic items might be highly regulated, accompanied by a thriving black market. Artificers might craft items for use by military forces or adventurers, as they do in the world of Eberron. You might also allow characters to craft their own magic items, as discussed in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="e16aa12a-7f14-4d78-a291-b1c9020de405">chapter 6</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d9c75934-c974-4116-8fcb-c0d867e45cc4">Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items display their magical nature conspicuously. Whatever a magic item’s appearance, handling the item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about it. Discovering a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic, however.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="56f07cac-9084-4a71-b807-c7ac5c1fbba1">The <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2152-identify" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2152-tooltip">identify</a> spell is the fastest way to reveal an item’s properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7cfd8de8-6413-4a7e-9f61-1519b55d8b5d">Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it’s a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4721-ring-of-feather-falling" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4721-tooltip">ring of feather falling</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8000691a-5c10-4cde-9cc8-9816f8454520">Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if a character puts on a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4724-ring-of-jumping" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4724-tooltip">ring of jumping</a>, you could say, “Your steps feel strangely springy.” Perhaps the character then jumps up and down to see what happens. You then say the character jumps unexpectedly high.</p>
<h4 id="VariantMoreDifficultIdentification" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="5b745f57-47cc-4816-8366-ba05ab367c3a"><a href="#VariantMoreDifficultIdentification" data-content-chunk-id="3a6a561e-3ae4-40f1-b332-760ffad4cb84"></a>Variant: More Difficult Identification</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0c499f3c-e84e-40a9-9b15-0f60b68a3ce6">If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2152-identify" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2152-tooltip">identify</a> spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does.</p>
<h3 id="Attunement" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="0051af5e-d560-4249-b924-520de039d3e3"><a href="#Attunement" data-content-chunk-id="9d1e9631-16a4-4aea-a09c-8150fdc55100"></a>Attunement</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cfa2e96d-bc95-447e-90d0-71ef207b54f4">Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if that monster has spell slots and uses that class’s spell list.) If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9a07ff97-dd33-42e3-94a2-9029e972317f">Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4ddfcdc5-107a-4a03-9cda-2bb1bfb7f850">Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2a1539c9-21e7-43ec-b75f-dafe68fb1a68">An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t attune to more than one <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4726-ring-of-protection" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4726-tooltip">ring of protection</a> at a time.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0532ae33-aab3-4715-b764-2c9087c8c387">A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.</p>
<h3 id="CursedItems" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="bd2b4f06-deda-40aa-90d5-01171b79a353"><a href="#CursedItems" data-content-chunk-id="f9191ab3-1beb-41c3-a1b9-bc335fd24f37"></a>Cursed Items</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3d986177-708c-43f8-a2b2-46d7e6a0ffd8">Some magic items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item. A magic item’s description specifies whether the item is cursed. Most methods of identifying items, including the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2152-identify" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2152-tooltip">identify</a> spell, fail to reveal such a curse, although lore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item’s user when the curse’s effects are revealed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="895f27e1-0091-4d5f-ad34-ecd92bd01c5c">Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2229-tooltip">remove curse</a> spell.</p>
<h3 id="MagicItemCategories" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="1412c702-e6ae-48ce-b80c-c49fed41a8e1"><a href="#MagicItemCategories" data-content-chunk-id="2e01769d-8996-4eb0-9509-36115eae054a"></a>Magic Item Categories</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="17d95c69-3608-43f1-baec-81d84fabc552">Each magic item belongs to a category: armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or wondrous items.</p>
<h4 id="Armor" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="ca7c6c1c-f9cc-472e-9df2-09c25b4160b4"><a href="#Armor" data-content-chunk-id="312d8666-3982-48de-9aca-5459653d62e7"></a>Armor</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1dfaf5a5-2d24-46f1-8e95-b43496d622c1">Unless an armor’s description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its magic to function.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d02f3271-c945-47cb-b972-2a009273a768">Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor doesn’t specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.</p>
<h4 id="Potions" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="d5d204bf-8b42-4ac2-9ea1-f45125cec735"><a href="#Potions" data-content-chunk-id="de988a8f-ea41-495f-a2e6-4f2555ed2b5b"></a>Potions</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="89a33441-8662-4497-a017-ab3a0b82f286">Different kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions consist of one ounce of liquid.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3d81665c-a7bf-421e-8915-56a33cc64a22">Potions are consumable magic items. Drinking a potion or administering a potion to another character requires an action. Applying an oil might take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8f04b0ff-4e16-4ff3-8d73-07fb3bc99d0e">VARIANT: WANDS THAT DON’T RECHARGE</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0b930b70-7912-4ba9-8f3c-83dd2e7f2007">A typical wand has expendable charges. If you’d like wands to be a limited resource, you can make some of them incapable of regaining charges. Consider increasing the base number of charges in such a wand, to a maximum of 25 charges. These charges are never regained once they’re expended.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e4d56e87-4757-4df5-bcd9-7bfd2c97050d">Whether crafted for some fell purpose or forged to serve the highest ideals of chivalry, magic weapons are coveted by many adventurers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d178e1a3-6419-41a5-a00b-3ad77ea39e86">Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a longsword or longbow. If a magic weapon doesn’t specify its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7825d108-3937-43da-9806-5ffa534baa82">If a magic weapon has the <a class="tooltip-hover weapon-properties-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Ammunition" data-tooltip-href="/weapon-properties/1-tooltip">ammunition</a> property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8515408e-1c02-4563-9ec5-08604131a4f3">Wondrous items include worn items such as boots, belts, capes, gloves, and various pieces of jewelry and decoration, such as amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, crystal balls, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and other objects also fall into this catch-all category.</p>
<h3 id="WearingandWieldingItems" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="926d77fd-04cc-4d57-a0d6-27906099d370"><a href="#WearingandWieldingItems" data-content-chunk-id="e583a09c-3366-45e1-93b0-cdc8f9dffbd8"></a>Wearing and Wielding Items</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d6e4bca8-5882-4488-8d2b-5a2455bda481">Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head, and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held in hand.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3cec9325-637c-439a-acde-2fc5f5debb63">In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="329d872c-013e-4197-adca-05df07963d69">Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn’t adjust. For example, armor made by the drow might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped characters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3980ba16-e4ec-4e84-b0c8-434657aeb645">When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs has no way to wear magic boots.</p>
<h4 id="MultipleItemsoftheSameKind" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="9de261f0-21f8-40b0-a13b-2149c5a69008"><a href="#MultipleItemsoftheSameKind" data-content-chunk-id="00c7bd66-4da9-4189-ba10-5655993c568b"></a>Multiple Items of the Same Kind</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2a8d2236-42e3-482a-96eb-bc0685d6ff78">Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. A character can’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, and one cloak. You can make exceptions; a character might be able to wear a circlet under a helmet, for example, or be able to layer two cloaks.</p>
<h4 id="PairedItems" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="6e169eb1-a4c4-461c-b358-5368bf2e155d"><a href="#PairedItems" data-content-chunk-id="5eb1d93a-ac2c-498a-9b06-db1df7870327"></a>Paired Items</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c0ea9b46-ed95-4b3f-9e3d-797a9da5d062">Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4590-boots-of-striding-and-springing" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4590-tooltip">boot of striding and springing</a> on one foot and a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4587-boots-of-elvenkind" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4587-tooltip">boot of elvenkind</a> on the other foot gains no benefit from either item.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="da2ed83c-f5f6-4935-bb67-27b543279cf9">Activating some magic items requires a user to do something in particular, such as holding the item and uttering a command word, reading the item if it is a scroll, or drinking it if it is a potion. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules related to their activation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3526be7e-5c98-4957-8bc4-ee8865f5a965">If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the <a class="tooltip-hover action-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction" data-tooltip-href="/actions/11-tooltip">Use an Object</a> action, so a feature such as the rogue’s Fast Hands can’t be used to activate the item.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d777122c-1868-4130-9ab0-de39f82e4531">A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken audibly for the item to operate. A magic item that requires the user to speak a command word can’t be activated in the area of any effect that prevents sound, such as the area created by the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2251-silence" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2251-tooltip">silence</a> spell.</p>
<h4 id="Consumables" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="f43ab318-3fd9-4b72-9364-c3771eaf90e0"><a href="#Consumables" data-content-chunk-id="6b235adc-2a7b-4781-b86a-076708608ad6"></a>Consumables</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="aebbed16-7301-4b04-bcc9-87da96096f70">Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic and no longer functions.</p>
<aside class="text--rules-sidebar" id="MagicItemFormulas">
<p data-content-chunk-id="f6eb253f-ce8d-45ed-b847-7312bc8c4d0c">MAGIC ITEM FORMULAS</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4994857d-c163-429f-a689-2a6bba4a0198">A magic item formula explains how to make a particular magic item. Such a formula can be an excellent reward if you allow player characters to craft magic items, as explained in chapter 6, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="f4a87509-847f-4e9e-a999-b1282c4fbda7">Between Adventures</a>."</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fac43722-3135-4dd0-9720-15670110293d">You can award a formula in place of a magic item. Usually written in a book or on a scroll, a formula is one step rarer than the item it allows a character to create. For example, the formula for a common magic item is uncommon. No formulas exist for legendary items.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c0ba2c22-2d09-4b9f-b39e-b8b8d27db739">If the creation of magic items is commonplace in your campaign, a formula can have a rarity that matches the rarity of the item it allows a character to create. Formulas for common and uncommon items might even be for sale, each with a cost double that of its magic item.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d530a47f-d648-40d0-9992-c00d01381d63">Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item, often by expending charges from it. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components unless the item’s description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the spell’s effects with their usual duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="91a2b09c-9291-461c-9dc5-20020dde67db">A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don’t have a spellcasting ability - perhaps you’re a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature - your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.</p>
<h4 id="Charges" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="db5096bb-d61d-4c75-94dd-733b1f93a0d8"><a href="#Charges" data-content-chunk-id="975aced4-5b92-454e-869d-8a55eefae661"></a>Charges</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c0d2325a-723b-4db9-bd2f-6b6a678687c8">Some magic items have charges that you expend to activate its properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2152-identify" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2152-tooltip">identify</a> spell is cast on the item, or when a creature attunes to the item. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to that item learns how many charges it regained.</p>
<h3 id="MagicItemResilience" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="aff555a1-abe2-4c7b-85a8-6806a4a9286b"><a href="#MagicItemResilience" data-content-chunk-id="010eebdb-3962-443a-803c-1cb4d0aaa7c9"></a>Magic Item Resilience</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a50d964a-462d-4bca-8f5b-f87f2b6c1a95">Most magic items are objects of extraordinary artisanship, assembled from the finest materials with meticulous attention to detail. Thanks to this combination of careful crafting and magical reinforcement, a magic item is at least as durable as a regular item of its kind. Most magic items, other than potions and scrolls, have resistance to all damage. Artifacts are practically indestructible, requiring extreme measures to destroy.</p>
<h3 id="SpecialFeatures" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="723221bc-8d07-4d23-b390-62a931063948"><a href="#SpecialFeatures" data-content-chunk-id="8cae01ea-7c18-4247-b49f-94d6521785bd"></a>Special Features</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ff20ec8b-bc71-4264-987e-cd993d58098e">You can add distinctiveness to a magic item by thinking about its backstory, in much the same way you would for a location. Who made the item? Is anything unusual about its construction? Why was it made, and how was it originally used? What minor magical quirks set it apart from other items of its kind? Considering these questions is useful for turning a generic magic item, such as a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5245-longsword-1" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5245-tooltip">longsword, +1</a> or a suit of <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5086-chain-mail-1" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5086-tooltip">chain mail, +1</a>, into a more remarkable discovery.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d4abdaf2-74ec-4850-83a0-4c2b7cbf1cea">The tables that follow can help you come up with answers. Roll on as many of these tables as you like. Some of the table entries make more sense for certain items than for others. Some magic items are made only by certain kinds of creatures, for instance; a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4606-cloak-of-elvenkind" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4606-tooltip">cloak of elvenkind</a> is made by elves, rather than dwarves. If you roll something that doesn’t make sense, roll again, choose a more appropriate entry, or use the rolled detail as inspiration to make up your own.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong>Blissful.</strong> While in possession of the item, the bearer feels fortunate and optimistic about what the future holds. Butterflies and other harmless creatures might frolic in the item’s presence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><strong>Confident.</strong> The item helps its bearer feel self-assured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><strong>Covetous.</strong> The item’s bearer becomes obsessed with material wealth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><strong>Frail.</strong> The item crumbles, frays, chips, or cracks slightly when wielded, worn, or activated. This quirk has no effect on its properties, but if the item has seen much use, it looks decrepit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><strong>Hungry.</strong> This item’s magical properties function only if fresh blood from a humanoid has been applied to it within the past 24 hours. It needs only a drop to activate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td><strong>Loud.</strong> The item makes a loud noise—such as a clang, a shout, or a resonating gong—when used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td><strong>Metamorphic.</strong> The item periodically and randomly alters its appearance in slight ways. The bearer has no control over these minor alterations, which have no effect on the item’s use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td><strong>Muttering.</strong> The item grumbles and mutters. A creature who listens carefully to the item might learn something useful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td><strong>Painful.</strong> The bearer experiences a harmless flash of pain when using the item.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td><strong>Possessive.</strong> The item demands attunement when first wielded or worn, and it doesn’t allow its bearer to attune to other items. (Other items already attuned to the bearer remain so until their attunement ends.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td><strong>Repulsive.</strong> The bearer feels a sense of distaste when in contact with the item, and continues to sense discomfort while bearing it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td><strong>Slothful.</strong> The bearer of this item feels slothful and lethargic. While attuned to the item, the bearer requires 10 hours to finish a long rest.</td>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8182bae3-80da-40c5-bdcd-70baa65e0c89">The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p>

You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f84338d5-9093-4dda-bf2e-dd70bdf7557b">Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it.

<p data-content-chunk-id="e91a2be5-b63c-4e76-b3e2-01b8f374d478">You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1528641d-0c18-4507-ae82-6ab2131467ed">The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2162-knock" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2162-tooltip">knock</a> spell and similar magic, such as that of a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4602-chime-of-opening" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4602-tooltip">chime of opening</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f4733879-055c-48d6-8e41-721acdad9db8">Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a47ecf59-d62a-4466-82e4-006b2eb70a28">The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2303-wish" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2303-tooltip">wish</a> spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2303-wish" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2303-tooltip">wish</a> causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d2224e66-8272-430e-b575-1ab4a43e4482">You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="27382710-166b-493a-b8a5-855f79c2920f">You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/11-tooltip">poisoned</a> for 1 minute. The dagger can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="453a6d3a-b152-4a26-b8c3-44c7ecba5012"><em>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ed02f43-470c-4e50-a365-c1c85e91be3b">You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d176c113-621d-4efa-bc9b-ef3f0e4e6c7e">While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d337d306-9fbd-4084-8735-26a880395c94">After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f63f3495-11ff-4ab5-898f-6a436e58d380">You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:</p>

As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you.

<p data-content-chunk-id="f1c76c5c-78f0-4cfe-a335-3090945211e9">This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a5938976-0a25-4550-b8e3-1651592293f7">The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck).

<p data-content-chunk-id="e87a6a94-9b66-440b-9a51-428ea6447d3d">An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled.

While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check. The creature then appears translucent.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d1500337-6f7b-4485-8a7f-94f461e7f077">The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can’t be used again.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="74b4cd20-2144-472b-b954-94189092c6a0">While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1a978978-7e55-4324-b1ee-9cece481e0ef">Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8e8a5d32-0d29-41a8-ac48-ffc41da4aa84">A <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0867c5bc-2a69-4107-b134-d4b54622e818">The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="2bfb09ad-f7fc-44d5-8e54-ce36e8fe62cb">Monster Manual</a> for the creature’s statistics, except for the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/27750-giant-fly" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/27750-tooltip">giant fly</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9cdea745-5463-43cb-b1a4-27ad28353467">The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.</p>

In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/5-tooltip">frightened</a> of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/5-tooltip">frightened</a> creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat’s aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days have passed.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3bbb2d4b-42e9-4f51-88ea-62a61c735231">This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e227435-b212-4c31-836b-6193a0950478">Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/13-tooltip">restrained</a> until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="afcfa861-e153-48b4-aaea-5bdc97293cde">A creature, including the one <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/13-tooltip">restrained</a>, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/13-tooltip">restrained</a> creature is freed.

<p data-content-chunk-id="15da0678-22ad-4478-997d-94dfc6263019">This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ab3ca3c7-6b9f-44a9-9438-7bd3e4e85822">You can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a0f75633-d53f-4696-9dfb-b5a9626d4cf0">An <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2152-identify" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2152-tooltip">identify</a> spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly.</p>

The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cfbd6306-4089-4cfd-a6bc-d8bf18a04b5f">Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons—that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ed6cc42f-2af4-4492-9731-cd4184b9056a">When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="575657bd-0095-438e-84be-ff342eb7d40d">Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6500c880-670a-47eb-b099-1014dcfdf74c">If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d3f716dc-6e31-4a17-b528-12ac02a3a8da"><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="98c7af76-d328-4a88-b422-d6b0ecb1c0fd">While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="95ab59fe-271c-4619-a896-4a16cf13d5b8">When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd6dd97c-258b-49e5-8b16-ca5c9b0fcbe7">If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e75ab60a-4491-4b02-8d0e-56b6c8385224">A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c5f1a0c4-fe79-4b74-9931-9fc01471cb98"><em><strong>Alertness.</strong></em> While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) checks and on rolls for initiative.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa4219a2-e222-4e0a-9ab5-7e9b1dce131f"><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2064-detect-evil-and-good" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2064-tooltip">detect evil and good</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2065-detect-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2065-tooltip">detect magic</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2066-detect-poison-and-disease" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2066-tooltip">detect poison and disease</a>, or <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2242-see-invisibility" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2242-tooltip">see invisibility</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="912b1948-d5cc-4e83-9dbc-09cf4dfb9ccb">This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9fc31761-31dc-48ff-800a-5b2e27e309df"><em><strong>Six Buttons.</strong></em> You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action.

<p data-content-chunk-id="6cc19363-7c9c-4d67-8678-67dae8261c2d">If you press <strong>button 2</strong>, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="655235aa-859e-4517-8f96-6b01dcc19128">If you press <strong>button 3</strong>, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="be30ce2a-b0e0-4858-8a99-c05f7635c3f3">If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f50337bd-014c-49c2-9936-411cee8026c5">If you press <strong>button 5</strong>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c1b8d03-1b30-4ffe-8d2b-4221daa35219">If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cd69ec99-4094-44bb-ac04-48f001544cb6"><em><strong>Drain Life.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="e4c62360-8cc7-4cc4-a13e-8608d0a7a517">In addition, you can regain one warlock spell slot as an action while holding the rod. You can’t use this property again until you finish a long rest.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="43f7d313-bd0c-43bb-af74-1e0ecd77ac07">While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f8f40d9c-4ac5-4089-8123-de4fe1d406a2">For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="282e1cbd-1958-40ad-8975-8d82d9679219">When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location.

If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="45c5821e-9a65-4ae0-adab-dd8a437e3529">If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1cf7ca05-5fc0-4b10-929c-d0ba0520b206">Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d559dc7e-e109-4440-ac68-5f801fc2a455">Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53a3ce15-68d3-400f-8f98-7f74548eb478">Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the DM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="39412cca-f005-4d03-89ee-0bcf28ba5237">Despite its nihilism, <em>Blackrazor</em> feels a strange kinship to <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5431-wave" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5431-tooltip">Wave</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5432-whelm" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5432-tooltip">Whelm</a>, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain.

<p data-content-chunk-id="781570c4-7bcf-4290-b660-5804d25464e1"><em>Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by an elf or half-elf of neutral good alignment)</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="89698366-9899-48db-a4fa-7d4829335baf">Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a <em>moonblade.</em> In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa5eba4a-11c0-4e52-bc08-34e42c61b5cc">A <em>moonblade</em> passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9be2bc21-5c5f-4c08-9fa2-b5649a3f989a">A <em>moonblade</em> serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="727f61a5-8f78-498e-8339-e19b9ac8e4b4">A <em>moonblade</em> won’t serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b907a957-4ab9-43d2-9cf3-27a99fb651d7">A <em>moonblade</em> has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the <em>moonblade</em> an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="08134d9f-82b2-4c23-8c33-964605e67d3c">The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder’s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ea54a7d8-e384-4f0a-840e-ffed6fd1148b"><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> Every <em>moonblade</em> seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1d1c8821-0121-411d-b5ec-2d244eb5453c">The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c9729abe-b31d-495a-ab0f-4bcd8b2e7b74">If a <em>moonblade</em> has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="934d52b2-72a8-467d-a67e-95b6306c027e">The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge.

<p data-content-chunk-id="70e2ab27-568a-4737-9cb0-ecddf0165093">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with <em>Whelm</em>, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9abc1301-f919-4334-b43c-e83ff9cbf875"><em><strong>Thrown Weapon.</strong> Whelm</em> has the <a class="tooltip-hover weapon-properties-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown" data-tooltip-href="/weapon-properties/10-tooltip">thrown</a> property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don’t have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="06bcfe10-646c-4830-8fab-3c59091d9108"><em><strong>Shock Wave.</strong></em> You can use an action to strike the ground with <em>Whelm</em> and send a shock wave out from the point of impact.

<p data-content-chunk-id="04a8382a-2b50-4994-9432-ecd66673a93a"><em><strong>Personality.</strong> Whelm</em>’s purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="23faa6c5-cce2-40a1-9bf7-cafe17262ba8"><em>Whelm</em> has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c690482f-0367-440c-8606-e7cfa380a7dd">The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time.

<p data-content-chunk-id="fd3601f8-07ec-49be-90f7-3610b1220b03">An artifact is a unique magic item of tremendous power, with its own origin and history. An artifact might have been created by gods or mortals of awesome power. It could have been created in the midst of a crisis that threatened a kingdom, a world, or the entire multiverse, and carry the weight of that pivotal moment in history.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb8aaa75-2957-48e5-952c-df95ff28fa3c">Some artifacts appear when they are needed most. For others, the reverse is true; when discovered, the world trembles at the ramifications of the find. In either case, introducing an artifact into a campaign requires forethought. The artifact could be an item that opposing sides are hoping to claim, or it might be something the adventurers need to overcome their greatest challenge.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="99e9e918-335e-4d37-b5b2-69bf29bc36f4">Characters don’t typically find artifacts in the normal course of adventuring. In fact, artifacts only appear when you want them to, for they are as much plot devices as magic items. Tracking down and recovering an artifact is often the main goal of an adventure. Characters must chase down rumors, undergo significant trials, and venture into dangerous, half-forgotten places to find the artifact they seek. Alternatively, a major villain might already have the artifact. Obtaining and destroying the artifact could be the only way to ensure that its power can’t be used for evil.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9e3106ca-4aa6-43a0-a43d-d680d1d9333b">Each artifact has its own magical properties, as other magic items do, and the properties are often exceptionally powerful. An artifact might have other properties that are either beneficial or detrimental. You can choose such properties from the tables in this section or determine them randomly. You can also invent new beneficial and detrimental properties. These properties typically change each time an artifact appears in the world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="73cc2e5e-d5d8-496e-add4-4080455aad13">An artifact can have as many as four minor beneficial properties and two major beneficial properties. It can have as many as four minor detrimental properties and two major detrimental properties.</p>

The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bc29fc07-9315-4ccd-90b6-77ead222992d">Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.</p>

Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature’s physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf.

<p data-content-chunk-id="235c788e-66c1-4d3f-b495-c79add3aa3de">The <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1bedae9c-8a37-4b20-9dee-b929800103ff">A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book’s contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book’s open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can’t be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd6a47cc-8cf2-4969-9e1a-7bbfc4793e4b">Benefits granted by the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> last only as long as you strive to do good.

<p data-content-chunk-id="496c7b86-c966-408d-a9c5-8844fbd12586">Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn’t escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d0735e5-c117-4f07-a7d8-620285ac38fb">Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="020a8678-b86f-494a-a859-b4b7a8054468">Some say that Vecna’s lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King’s rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna’s tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One’s will in the world.</p>

Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2f13a2a8-5dea-410b-bafe-205d0540e14d">Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="23c66318-75ad-4b08-816c-98fdc39a932e">An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ac21192a-7ec3-417a-95dc-304cfd40f9aa">While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/2-tooltip">charmed</a> by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1f41faed-ebdb-46be-ba2c-cf1a96438bc9">While you are <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/2-tooltip">charmed</a> by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2269-suggestion" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2269-tooltip">suggestion</a> on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat’s name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="124fb3c6-d180-484d-86e0-fb9f2be2690d"><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has the following random properties:</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fabfa5dd-b5a6-485b-b7ea-798ece8a900c"><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2056-cure-wounds" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2056-tooltip">cure wounds</a> (5th-level version, 3 charges), <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2060-daylight" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2060-tooltip">daylight</a> (1 charge), <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2061-death-ward" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2061-tooltip">death ward</a> (2 charges), or <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2239-scrying" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2239-tooltip">scrying</a> (3 charges).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="85e26d4d-6cb6-4fac-9992-2fe0e663e769">You can also use an action to cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2065-detect-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2065-tooltip">detect magic</a> spell from the orb without using any charges.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bef29dbb-b89d-48f1-9329-84d83f02eac2"><em><strong>Call Dragons.</strong></em> While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.</p>

A <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2070-disintegrate" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2070-tooltip">disintegrate</a> spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="10060637-cb8b-4dcc-a896-960ed1e87f08">When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna’s admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="86589b9c-e85d-46da-a1be-153e6efb48c8">For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich, but as Kas’s power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich’s empire in Vecna’s stead. Legend says Vecna’s destruction came at Kas’s hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant’s doom, leaving only Kas’s sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="abe917d9-e1fd-4a40-a691-e9229988eaac">The <em>Sword of Kas</em> is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="25206ebf-807d-4e18-a1b5-98c29c5e7528">If the sword isn’t bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2077-dominate-monster" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2077-tooltip">dominate monster</a> spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword’s demand is met.</p>

In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead.

<p data-content-chunk-id="40fd4a70-be9b-4f98-9dc3-2876a3a9573a"><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2022-call-lightning" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2022-tooltip">call lightning</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2075-divine-word" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2075-tooltip">divine word</a>, or <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2101-finger-of-death" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2101-tooltip">finger of death</a>.

<p data-content-chunk-id="7b21c147-8861-49dc-b7ab-1fe5968cb46b"><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The sword’s purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna’s worshipers, destroying the lich’s works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6dadeccf-206c-4ed3-8115-9402eba948cf">The <em>Sword of Kas</em> also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5425-eye-and-hand-of-vecna" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5425-tooltip">Eye and Hand of Vecna</a>.

<p data-content-chunk-id="2d87441f-bf24-466d-b9d9-31ae35632bcf">The ghastly <em>Wand of Orcus</em> rarely leaves Orcus’s side. The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord’s aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fa3a2b79-5675-449a-9ca9-47e552d6aabe">Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand’s presence.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b5976557-75ad-4bab-8725-e60a1148da59">Any creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17077-zombie" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17077-tooltip">zombie</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="822dcca3-42f3-4faf-abbf-c126127011b4">In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dc444bf5-e98b-467f-8fe4-18326ca82751"><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em> The <em>Wand of Orcus</em> has the following random properties:</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9fcb1de8-d9f6-4e7e-8a11-97b5f06d23ca">While attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand’s spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="35c4871d-d707-4b99-9f00-ad28f025ebcb"><em><strong>Call Undead.</strong></em> While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17015-skeleton" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17015-tooltip">skeletons</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17077-zombie" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17077-tooltip">zombies</a>, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points (see the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="b5d884ba-2dde-4f2b-b714-e6236f6ddd64">Monster Manual</a> for statistics). The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses.

<p data-content-chunk-id="dca98460-184c-4843-ac47-2abbdf70cefd">While attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don’t perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="dbe8d198-7238-436a-8e61-426ef7917219">In order to further its master’s goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1bc8f8a4-e350-4649-9f7c-5b806e1dbc42"><em><strong>Destroying the Wand.</strong></em> Destroying the <em>Wand of Orcus</em> requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life — no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero’s soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="46e5f59f-078d-4867-9ce8-f859a780664b">Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus’s layer of the Abyss.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="2721d1fd-c66c-42da-949e-50f60afdc4a0">A supernatural gift is a special reward granted by a being or force of great magical power. Such supernatural gifts come in two forms: blessings and charms. A blessing is usually bestowed by a god or a godlike being. A charm is typically the work of a powerful spirit, a location of ancient magic, or a creature that has legendary actions. Unlike a magic item, a supernatural gift isn’t an object and doesn’t require attunement. It gives a character an extraordinary ability, which can be used one or more times.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fb5d4fbb-c146-405c-b44a-1187987d4086">A character might receive a blessing from a deity for doing something truly momentous — an accomplishment that catches the attention of both gods and mortals. Killing rampaging gnolls rarely warrants such a blessing, but slaying the high priest of Tiamat as he attempts to summon the Dragon Queen might.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5444c20b-e52a-4100-87a1-fb0225f81bf9">A blessing is an appropriate reward for one of the following accomplishments:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="1eb4009a-efeb-4462-9588-f2589a2a434e">
<li data-content-chunk-id="1fdfa7ca-4d5a-4cb6-bc33-d44650b45edc">Restoring the most sacred shrine of a god</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="cb82aba2-4a99-4150-b84f-1e179c1ff4bc">Foiling an earthshaking plot by the enemies of a god</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="d962f590-9afd-46e3-98e9-02b66852f99f">Helping a god’s favored servant complete a holy quest</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a7eb73e1-bd2c-4f23-807b-fe584baf3bf9">An adventurer might also receive a blessing in advance of a perilous quest. For example, a paladin could receive one before setting out on a quest to slay a terrifying lich that is responsible for a magical plague sweeping the land.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="464ee412-a01b-4252-963d-a7dffa7c316a">A character should receive only a blessing that is useful to him or her, and some blessings come with expectations on the part of the benefactor. A god typically gives a blessing for a particular purpose, such as recovering a holy person’s remains or toppling a tyrannical empire. The god might revoke a blessing if a character fails to pursue that purpose or acts counter to it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7b43b213-936b-4adb-96b3-5615a129cd40">A character retains the benefits of a blessing forever or until it is taken away by the god who granted it. Unlike a magic item, such a blessing can’t be suppressed by an <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/1999-antimagic-field" data-tooltip-href="/spells/1999-tooltip">antimagic field</a> or similar effect.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ccd0d39b-fd39-4a17-be68-2a0663acc7dc">Most adventurers go their entire lives without receiving even one of these blessings. There is no limit on the number of blessings a character can receive, but it should be rare for a character to have more than one at a time. Moreover, a character can’t benefit from multiple instances of a blessing at the same time. For example, a character can’t benefit from two instances of the Blessing of Health at once.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a75ae09d-0ed3-4ee0-b17e-6dce49ead1c7">A charm is a minor supernatural gift, which can be received in a large variety of ways. For example, a wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a dead archmage’s spellbook might be infused with the magic of a charm, as might a character who solves a sphinx’s riddle or drinks from a magic fountain. Legendary creatures, such as <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16780-ancient-gold-dragon" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16780-tooltip">ancient gold dragons</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17042-unicorn" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17042-tooltip">unicorns</a>, sometimes grace their allies with charms, and some explorers find themselves bearing the magic of a charm after discovering a long-lost location that is drenched in primeval magic.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0ef15b57-9ec5-496c-aea2-bdcd637e6931">Some charms can be used only once, and others can be used a specific number of times before vanishing. If a charm lets you cast a spell, you are able to do so without spending a spell slot or providing any components (verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a charm can’t be used in the area created by an <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/1999-antimagic-field" data-tooltip-href="/spells/1999-tooltip">antimagic field</a> or a similar effect, and a charm’s effects are susceptible to <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2072-dispel-magic" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2072-tooltip">dispel magic</a> and the like. But the charm itself can’t be removed from a creature by anything short of divine intervention or the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2303-wish" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2303-tooltip">wish</a> spell.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e21cb596-d5db-42eb-aff8-5098881f1aaa">Example charms are provided below. The text of a charm addresses its user. A typical charm mimics the effects of a potion or a spell, so it is easy to create more charms of your own, if you like.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9c8a4702-ac66-4afb-a56b-8ecb5da794e6">Sometimes the most memorable reward for adventurers is the prestige that they acquire throughout a realm. Their adventures often earn them fame and power, allies and enemies, and titles that they can pass on to their descendants. Some lords and ladies began as commoners who ventured into the dangerous places of the world and made names for themselves through their brave deeds.</p>

<figcaption>Letter of Recommendation</figcaption></figure>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a9685031-d1d2-469e-ac83-e307d5eacf3e">When gold is in short supply, the adventurers’ benefactor might provide them with a letter of recommendation instead of monetary payment. Such a letter is usually enclosed in a handsome folio, case, or scroll tube for safe transport, and it usually bears the signature and seal of whoever wrote it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4117b625-71c7-4116-ba24-7321a76cfb41">A letter of recommendation from a person of impeccable reputation can grant adventurers access to NPCs that they would otherwise have trouble meeting on their own, such as a duke, viceroy, or queen. Moreover, carrying such a recommendation on one’s person can help clear up “misunderstandings” with local authorities who might not otherwise take the adventurers at their word.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4302b95e-0479-4d99-80c2-de4d6e4f868b">A letter of recommendation is worth only as much as the person who wrote it and offers no benefit in places where its writer holds no sway.</p>
<h3 id="Medals" data-content-chunk-id="2f1010e9-5b8c-4d7c-97ec-c0fef0b38d69" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr"><a href="#Medals" data-content-chunk-id="0535499b-8bac-4ace-9719-e5abe5ee709c"></a>Medals</h3>

<figcaption>Medals</figcaption></figure>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7b04bf37-570c-48b9-b62e-2ba73add1823">Although they are often fashioned from gold and other precious materials, medals have an even greater symbolic value to those who award and receive them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1d2c59e3-342b-471c-991a-f310423caba4">Medals are typically awarded by powerful political figures for acts of heroism, and wearing a medal is usually enough to earn the respect of those who understand its significance.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="76e59103-0fad-4ded-a6b3-26ba4b03e1d9">Different acts of heroism can warrant different kinds of medals. The King of Breland (in the Eberron campaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor (shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum) to adventurers for defending Brelish citizens, while the Golden Bear of Breland (a medal made of gold and shaped in a likeness of a bear’s head, with gems for eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their allegiance to the Brelish Crown by uncovering and defeating a plot to end the Treaty of Thronehold and reignite the Last War.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8b6a8b5b-4b5f-4d01-876a-65d428346b24">A medal doesn’t offer a specific in-game benefit to one who wears it, but it can affect dealings with NPCs. For example, a character who proudly displays the Golden Bear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people within the kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the medal carries far less weight, except among allies of Breland’s king.</p>
<h3 id="ParcelsofLand" data-content-chunk-id="f525d76d-9e38-476f-afc7-cfed86df545d" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr"><a href="#ParcelsofLand" data-content-chunk-id="fb818907-2952-416a-a0b6-fa9e75813cb9"></a>Parcels of Land</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0ba696b0-b0cf-45dd-a581-3e805c976dbb">A parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a royal letter affirming that the land has been granted as a reward for some service. Such land usually remains the property of the local ruler or ruling body, but is leased to a character with the understanding that it can be taken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called into question.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cbaa6cf7-9e65-418c-8a66-ed35db9b06a4">A parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one or more farms or villages on it already, in which case the recipient is pronounced lord or lady of the land and is expected to collect taxes, along with any other duties.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a0d36254-97c8-4d81-a38c-21066be02ba5">A character who receives a parcel of land is free to build on it and is expected to safeguard it. He or she may yield the land as part of an inheritance, but can’t sell or trade it without permission from the local ruler or ruling body.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8223cd2e-271f-406b-a396-22adfcbe04d3">Parcels of land make fine rewards for adventurers who are looking for a place to settle or who have family or some kind of personal investment in the region where the land is located.</p>
<h3 id="SpecialFavors" data-content-chunk-id="9d33d03e-54e6-47ff-b52d-90f69b578094" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr"><a href="#SpecialFavors" data-content-chunk-id="13a3b23f-6b51-4e96-8310-7001b77b7a33"></a>Special Favors</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c873789-aa05-4329-aacb-75fb8d066158">A reward might come in the form of a favor that the characters can call on at some future date. Special favors work best when the individual granting them is trustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will do whatever can be done to fulfill an obligation when the time comes, short of breaking laws. A lawful evil NPC does the same, but only because a deal is a deal. A neutral good or neutral NPC might pay off favors to protect his or her reputation. A chaotic good NPC is more concerned about doing right by the adventurers, honoring any obligations without worrying too much about personal risk or adherence to the law.</p>
<h3 id="SpecialRights" data-content-chunk-id="20037524-ada3-4ae9-8aae-780b1d0d9ac0" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr"><a href="#SpecialRights" data-content-chunk-id="dcdcc471-dd5b-480d-8929-471c882f17e0"></a>Special Rights</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5d13bf5a-90d5-4ff6-91f1-4bb66377f840">A politically powerful person can reward characters by giving them special rights, which are usually articulated in some sort of official document. For example, characters might be granted special rights to carry weapons in public places, kill enemies of the crown, or negotiate on a duke’s behalf. They might earn the right to demand free room and board from any establishment within a particular community, or have the right to draft local militia to assist them as needed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fc83ad0e-6924-4314-bb7d-ace4052b38d3">Special rights last only as long as the legal document dictates, and such rights can be revoked if the adventurers abuse them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="33d7f94c-13bc-49dd-aab3-a91ac15f323f">A stronghold is a reward usually given to seasoned adventurers who demonstrate unwavering fealty to a powerful political figure or ruling body, such as a king, a knighthood, or a council of wizards. A stronghold can be anything from a fortified tower in the heart of a city to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While the stronghold is for the characters to govern as they see fit, the land on which it sits remains the property of the crown or local ruler. Should the characters prove disloyal or unworthy of the gift, they can be asked or forced to relinquish custody of the stronghold.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b83ac8b0-87da-4839-a910-eda39c919f46">As an additional reward, the individual bequeathing the stronghold might offer to pay its maintenance costs for a period of one or more months, after which the characters inherit that responsibility. See <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="16e545c9-998c-4875-ada2-af344237d935">chapter 6</a> for more information on stronghold maintenance.</p>
<h3 id="Titles" data-content-chunk-id="68033992-cbbd-4934-9b50-0840e8dc703f" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr"><a href="#Titles" data-content-chunk-id="49fd38ba-aea4-4892-963d-13a02e8a48a1"></a>Titles</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c87e66b7-de30-4edc-9ee2-e49b0d66d2f5">A politically powerful figure has the ability to dispense titles. A title often comes with a parcel of land (see above). For example, a character might be awarded the title Earl of Stormriver or Countess of Dun Fjord, along with a parcel of land that includes a settlement or region of the same name.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a31198ac-a237-4352-8c76-eba45172a8ac">A character can hold more than one title, and in a feudal society, those titles can be passed down to (or distributed among) one’s children. While a character holds a title, he or she is expected to act in a manner befitting that title. By decree, titles can be stripped away if the local ruler or ruling body has reason to question the character’s loyalty or competence.</p>
<h3 id="Training" data-content-chunk-id="3d233d5f-bd83-4533-9f81-b873fe8d69b0" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr"><a href="#Training" data-content-chunk-id="41d93e22-63e7-4156-8c56-fc08a56968d6"></a>Training</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6f9c8cb3-8a0b-44d0-9237-0e1c97b0a4fc">A character might be offered special training in lieu of a financial reward. This kind of training isn’t widely available and thus is highly desirable. It presumes the existence of a skilled trainer — perhaps a retired adventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a mentor. The trainer might be a reclusive wizard or haughty sorcerer who owes the queen a favor, the knight-commander of the King’s Guard, the leader of a powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a remote mountaintop pagoda, a barbarian chieftain, a warlock living among nomads as a fortune-teller, or an absentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known throughout the land.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2e90c492-466a-4685-9649-4e93c3135f7a">A character who agrees to training as a reward must spend downtime with the trainer (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#DowntimeActivities" data-content-chunk-id="a1bd8b4d-4917-4cd4-ba00-d6fcb5a22a61">chapter 6</a> for more information on downtime activities). In exchange, the character is guaranteed to receive a special benefit. Possible training benefits include the following:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="6cdc03e8-c873-436f-8d08-ccf2f1b3ce95">
<li data-content-chunk-id="eb0f96de-f80b-4052-9ddf-c68da2410a29">The character gains <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background#Inspiration" data-tooltip-href="/rules/80-tooltip">inspiration</a> daily at dawn for 1d4 + 6 days.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="cd4ca7f6-2720-412a-90d7-388921ff20ca">The character gains proficiency in a skill.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a7e78886-0e11-4df4-ab22-17a1e0237bc8">You might decide to grant one of the following rewards to a 20th-level character, instead of awarding an epic boon. These two options can be awarded to a character more than once.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="44a97212-4984-4f34-9421-f95278505f75"><strong><em>Ability Score Improvement.</em></strong> The character can increase one ability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by 1 each. The ability score can now be increased above 20, up to a maximum of 30.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4a4ba864-0402-4892-a405-906d13abaea7">An epic boon is a special power available only to 20th level characters. Characters at that level gain such boons only if you want them to and only when you feel it’s appropriate. Epic boons are best awarded after the characters complete a major quest, or accomplish something else particularly notable. A character might gain an epic boon after destroying an evil artifact, defeating an ancient dragon, or halting an incursion from the Outer Planes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1e1a9ceb-adef-420d-8c75-0962494e5a5e">Epic boons can also be used as a form of advancement, a way to provide greater power to characters who have no more levels to gain. With this approach, consider awarding one epic boon to each character for every 30,000 XP he or she earns above 355,000 XP.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e4dd03a-1875-496c-bd93-52bc37b528a2">You determine which epic boon a character gains. Ideally, the boon you pick is something the character would put to use in future adventures. You can allow a player to select a boon for his or her character, subject to your approval.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0a7a58f7-f558-42ed-9894-6c698cba14f8">Whatever boon a character ends up with, consider its place in your story and world. Many of the boons are extraordinary and represent the gradual transformation of a character into something resembling a demigod. The acquisition of a boon might visibly transform a character. For example, the eyes of a character with the Boon of Truesight might glow when he or she feels strong emotion, and a character who has the Boon of High Magic might have faint motes of light glimmering around his or her head. Also, decide how the boon first appears. Does the boon appear spontaneously and mysteriously? Or does a being of cosmic power manifest to bestow it? The bestowal of a boon can itself be an exciting scene in an adventure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="107f3cbc-0667-44a5-9612-39be2309849f">The text of a boon addresses its user. Unless a boon says otherwise, a character can’t gain it more than once.</p>

There are the rules of the game, and there are table rules for how the game is played. For instance, players need to know what happens when one of them misses a session. They need to know whether to bring miniatures, any special rules you’ve decided to use, and how to treat a cocked die (a die that lands so that its face can’t be clearly read). These topics and more are covered in this chapter.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fa912e71-7891-4ab3-9cb9-4c62ad73ad96">Ideally, players come to the gaming table with the same goal: to have a fun time together. This section gives recommendations for table rules you can establish to help meet that goal. Here are some fundamentals:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="33a9cb54-b6ee-4922-b75d-7ddee6e6c692"><strong>Foster respect.</strong> Don’t bring personal conflicts to the table or let disagreements escalate into bad feelings. Don’t touch others’ dice if they’re sensitive about it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ce3e611b-cdb9-4de7-9dba-4cea153ad3ff"><strong>Avoid distractions.</strong> Turn off the television and video games. If you have young children, hire a babysitter. Reducing distractions helps players stay in character and enjoy the story. It might be fine to have players wandering away from the table and back, but some players prefer planned breaks.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b9bf8cd6-b6c2-424f-8938-cc8a1f49e7e9"><strong>Have snacks.</strong> Decide before a session who will bring food and drink. This is often something the players can handle.</p>
<h3 id="TableTalk" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="13090d3d-0dc0-470c-a88d-e73007e9ce2e"><a href="#TableTalk" data-content-chunk-id="c529751a-81f3-4192-970f-c7cdcde4f900"></a>Table Talk</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0d47259a-6b37-4775-b446-8d212612bb7f">Set expectations about how players talk at the table:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="93206710-12db-4f17-9d80-90ebf8bed05a">
<li data-content-chunk-id="7d131ad4-3877-4292-ad36-9f3e54d4316e">Make it clear who’s speaking: the character or the player (out of character).</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="f7f4ee2d-b179-40ef-a5c9-380966630bae">Decide how you feel about a player sharing information that his or her character wouldn’t know or that the character is incapable of sharing as a result of being <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a>, dead, or far away.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="b8c1ff4f-7d39-450b-9eb6-313583f7ac42">Are you all right with players retracting what they just said their characters did?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="DiceRolling" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="71e64712-2302-4236-8b0e-57d2278325ec"><a href="#DiceRolling" data-content-chunk-id="14630d5a-db08-434b-a22d-f02060a5354f"></a>Dice Rolling</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f6004bbf-4007-4add-bae9-35d5fc970493">Establish expectations about rolling dice. Rolling in full view of everyone is a good starting point. If you see a player rolling and scooping the dice up before anyone else can see, encourage that player to be less secretive.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8bfc3690-7afa-45b4-8999-62da500264be">When a die falls on the floor, do you count it or reroll it? When it lands cocked against a book, do you pull the book away and see where it lands, or reroll it?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="018adde4-9b5f-406e-9dd9-cbb2c1b1809d">What about you, the DM? Do you make your rolls in the open or hide them behind a DM screen? Consider the following:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="39530c11-79c0-48be-8c38-f4b39333a5de">
<li data-content-chunk-id="6bc1da29-c142-4d53-a6ca-5f3133b8037a">If you roll dice where the players can see, they know you’re playing impartially and not fudging rolls.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="148ded61-f633-4faa-9a9e-0696a8e64a76">Rolling behind a screen keeps the players guessing about the strength of their opposition. When a monster hits all the time, is it of a much higher level than the characters, or are you rolling high numbers?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="189a8da6-b294-4c6a-98d4-11ce29ff7655">Rolling behind a screen lets you fudge the results if you want to. If two critical hits in a row would kill a character, you could change the second critical hit into a normal hit, or even a miss. Don’t distort die rolls too often, though, and don’t let on that you’re doing it. Otherwise, your players might think they don’t face any real risks — or worse, that you’re playing favorites.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="b5618275-4803-4450-979b-66732046747a">A roll behind a screen can help preserve mystery. For example, if a player thinks there might be someone <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/8-tooltip">invisible</a> nearby and makes a Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) check, consider rolling a die behind the screen even if no one is there, making the player think someone is, indeed, hiding. Try not to overuse this trick.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="18ed4881-6e47-4ccf-b730-6adebbf67a15">You might choose to make a roll for a player because you don’t want the player to know how good the check total is. For example, if a player suspects a baroness might be <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/2-tooltip">charmed</a> and wants to make a Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check, you could make the roll in secret for the player. If the player rolled and got a high number but didn’t sense anything amiss, the player would be confident that the baroness wasn’t <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/2-tooltip">charmed</a>. With a low roll, a negative answer wouldn’t mean much. A hidden roll allows uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="RollingAttacksandDamage" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="52b34b8b-062e-4eea-9dc8-13820155b8a1"><a href="#RollingAttacksandDamage" data-content-chunk-id="87d95a54-fd8a-4c07-b02a-c7d1234a3cf0"></a>Rolling Attacks and Damage</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="224f6be8-73ff-48ee-a6e8-f87a537efa20">Players are accustomed to rolling an attack roll first and then a damage roll. If players make attack rolls and damage rolls at the same time, the action moves a little faster around the table.</p>
<h3 id="RulesDiscussions" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="3de9f922-be3e-4278-8979-d7c98d3daede"><a href="#RulesDiscussions" data-content-chunk-id="39dcafe5-0a0c-47ea-bfec-02ea5e487177"></a>Rules Discussions</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f3c4ddc8-8367-4db3-acf8-8d5b45cdd569">You might need to set a policy on rules discussions at the table. Some groups don’t mind putting the game on hold while they hash out different interpretations of a rule. Others prefer to let the DM make a call and continue with the action. If you gloss over a rules issue in play, make a note of it (a good task to delegate to a player) and return to the issue later.</p>
<h3 id="MetagameThinking" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="8c6633d9-3eda-4175-9d4d-5391ffcfcb1d"><a href="#MetagameThinking" data-content-chunk-id="d566f681-31ef-4f14-98c6-7fca748e45a1"></a>Metagame Thinking</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="78f08ffd-5f34-44d5-9548-fc35b19c4140">Metagame thinking means thinking about the game as a <em>game.</em> It’s like when a character in a movie knows it’s a movie and acts accordingly. For example, a player might say, “The DM wouldn’t throw such a powerful monster at us!” or you might hear, “The read-aloud text spent a lot of time describing that door — let’s search it again!”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c88daa32-18b4-4323-8632-f463922e0c1b">Discourage metagame thinking by giving players a gentle reminder: “What do your <em>characters</em> think?” You can curb metagame thinking by setting up situations that will be difficult for the characters and that might require negotiation or retreat to survive.</p>
<h3 id="MissingPlayers" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="8d0e4889-3c65-4489-9ab2-df5654922fbe"><a href="#MissingPlayers" data-content-chunk-id="4cde9ccc-bf29-41e2-a035-e5898dbfc955"></a>Missing Players</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="68b6ec93-5709-4f12-bf5b-c7d2cfd021c8">How should you deal with the characters of missing players? Consider these options:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="8e3d7a34-e806-436a-8ff1-dfbefbd679bf">
<li data-content-chunk-id="559d4315-3519-4985-803a-3cafd8a53c14">Have another player run the missing player’s character. The player running the extra character should strive to keep the character alive and use resources wisely.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="eadff1d8-f5d2-450c-8dd5-f0e026e63284">Run the character yourself. It’s an extra burden for you, but it can work.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="670bfb7c-0b56-4169-8bfe-8635fed11d94">Decide the character isn’t there. Invent a good reason for the character to miss the adventure, perhaps by having him or her linger in town or continue a downtime activity. Leave a way for the character to rejoin the party when the player returns.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="1e36da67-836b-4f3f-8035-852615b7c998">Have the character fade into the background. This solution requires everyone to step out of the game world a bit and suspend disbelief, but might be the easiest solution. You act as if the character’s not there, but don’t try to come up with any in-game explanation for this absence. Monsters don’t attack the character, who returns the favor. On returning, the player resumes playing as if he or she was never gone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="SmallGroups" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="0b31850c-720c-46f2-816e-50085355b143"><a href="#SmallGroups" data-content-chunk-id="8d253f03-6d87-4dd2-9788-99cdb04fac58"></a>Small Groups</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ba5ad7b1-56ef-46fd-a57e-9b8b8f279c0f">Most of the time, each player runs one character. The game plays best that way, without overwhelming anyone. But if your group is small, players can control more than one character. Or you can fill out the group with NPC followers, using the guidelines in chapter 4, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-nonplayer-characters" data-content-chunk-id="bba1a7e7-00b7-40d3-8724-86346ac540d3">Creating Nonplayer Characters</a>." You can also make the characters more resilient by using the healing surge option in chapter 9, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#HealingSurge" data-content-chunk-id="e9baf56e-30c4-4375-b879-c70f4ec9c471">Dungeon Master’s </a><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#HealingSurge" data-content-chunk-id="8ae21416-f6f7-4cf3-ba69-7632625441be">Workshop</a>."</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="67af5c05-b048-4e0b-a63c-0280d48d85f2">Don’t force a reluctant player to take on multiple characters, and don’t show favoritism by allowing only one player to do so. If one character is the mentor of the other, the player can focus on roleplaying just one character. Otherwise, players can end up awkwardly talking to themselves in character, or avoiding roleplaying altogether.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="353edf3a-eecc-4da8-bf70-fbf53f4a5d10">Multiple characters can be a good idea in a game that features nonstop peril and a high rate of character death. If your group agrees to the premise, have each player keep one or two additional characters on hand, ready to jump in whenever the current character dies. Each time the main character gains a level, the backup characters do as well.</p>
<h3 id="NewPlayers" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c084678f-06ee-49b1-a5c9-573fa72d52e8"><a href="#NewPlayers" data-content-chunk-id="9ab03ee2-afa5-406a-bb7d-41566e8c2a5a"></a>New Players</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f112d734-a09a-449e-af3e-3a849bfd0c3b">When a new player joins the group, allow the new player to create a character of a level equal to the lowest-level member of the party. The only exception to this guideline is when the new player is completely unfamiliar with the D&amp;D game. In that case, have that player start with a 1st-level character. If the rest of the party is significantly higher in level, consider taking a short break from the campaign and having everyone play a 1st-level character for a few sessions while the new player learns the ropes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="515d7d92-99d8-458a-91f5-ab85556edf2f">Integrating a new character into the group can be difficult if the party is in the middle of an adventure. The following approaches can help make it easier:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="248fe613-19f1-48d3-ac27-fb474306ab53">
<li data-content-chunk-id="04ff6ed4-b698-4369-9339-b2a3ccbaf2fd">The new character is a friend or relative of one of the adventurers who has been searching for the group.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="072b8bad-f889-41ee-8c44-3906938df4ed">The new character is a prisoner of the foes the other characters are fighting. When rescued, this character joins their group.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="dbff9a36-82e0-4b42-8246-a648e8c10497">The new character is the sole survivor of another adventuring group.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="TheRoleofDice" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="bd7e2f79-b81f-47a9-bc38-73719f34b9cc"><a href="#TheRoleofDice" data-content-chunk-id="24a6d5da-9564-424c-9340-68f599190809"></a>The Role of Dice</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ecf5be9-bb91-4acf-940c-8ba6a06cbf51">Dice are neutral arbiters. They can determine the outcome of an action without assigning any motivation to the DM and without playing favorites. The extent to which you use them is entirely up to you.</p>
<h3 id="RollingwithIt" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="fc89a72c-dd82-48d9-88e0-82713674ae20"><a href="#RollingwithIt" data-content-chunk-id="ffb73a9e-90ef-424c-ba39-4ba9e92e366d"></a>Rolling with It</h3>

</figure>
<p data-content-chunk-id="647421ef-ea2c-4102-9b85-c08fac7cacf9">Some DMs rely on die rolls for almost everything. When a character attempts a task, the DM calls for a check and picks a DC. As a DM using this style, you can’t rely on the characters succeeding or failing on any one check to move the action in a specific direction. You must be ready to improvise and react to a changing situation.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e0222c20-afb5-4cbc-a097-d3d0f702d0c4">Relying on dice also gives the players the sense that anything is possible. Sure, it might seem unlikely that the party’s halfling can leap on the ogre’s back, pull a sack over its head, and then dive to safety, but with a lucky enough roll it just might work.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b57a14c0-3555-4e8b-8520-e3397b364f03">A drawback of this approach is that roleplaying can diminish if players feel that their die rolls, rather than their decisions and characterizations, always determine success.</p>
<h3 id="IgnoringtheDice" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="62919ceb-d124-46f0-8f4a-5a015e126984"><a href="#IgnoringtheDice" data-content-chunk-id="a8e060b5-174e-486c-beb9-c9e2414c54c0"></a>Ignoring the Dice</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2ce3f9fd-bfc0-4eda-b824-88273f0a436a">One approach is to use dice as rarely as possible. Some DMs use them only during combat, and determine success or failure as they like in other situations.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bb8ab892-93b0-411e-901c-45ffff0f1ac5">With this approach, the DM decides whether an action or a plan succeeds or fails based on how well the players make their case, how thorough or creative they are, or other factors. For example, the players might describe how they search for a secret door, detailing how they tap on a wall or twist a torch sconce to find its trigger. That could be enough to convince the DM that they find the secret door without having to make an ability check to do so.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f0ec3935-18eb-4cef-9f4a-92895fe973b3">This approach rewards creativity by encouraging players to look to the situation you’ve described for an answer, rather than looking to their character sheet or their character’s special abilities. A downside is that no DM is completely neutral. A DM might come to favor certain players or approaches, or even work against good ideas if they send the game in a direction he or she doesn’t like. This approach can also slow the game if the DM focuses on one “correct” action that the characters must describe to overcome an obstacle.</p>
<h3 id="TheMiddlePath" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="0b5a70aa-1c61-40a8-b148-3c3ce0ec937c"><a href="#TheMiddlePath" data-content-chunk-id="d8ca0d2d-11c9-408c-bf90-d505f8bd8a08"></a>The Middle Path</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7e52a000-3153-4b75-985e-b3a4381f30ba">Many DMs find that using a combination of the two approaches works best. By balancing the use of dice against deciding on success, you can encourage your players to strike a balance between relying on their bonuses and abilities and paying attention to the game and immersing themselves in its world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e1bee20d-68a8-406f-b325-3af61b21203e">Remember that dice don’t run your game — you do. Dice are like rules. They’re tools to help keep the action moving. At any time, you can decide that a player’s action is automatically successful. You can also grant the player advantage on any ability check, reducing the chance of a bad die roll foiling the character’s plans. By the same token, a bad plan or unfortunate circumstances can transform the easiest task into an impossibility, or at least impose disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="UsingAbilityScores" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="049ce9aa-7851-4191-a33e-066393b30451"><a href="#UsingAbilityScores" data-content-chunk-id="91b53aa8-7729-4348-b2d1-5e9068299798"></a>Using Ability Scores</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2e2b1972-a99d-45e1-bf15-610c5aa490a6">When a player wants to do something, it’s often appropriate to let the attempt succeed without a roll or a reference to the character’s ability scores. For example, a character doesn’t normally need to make a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room or a Charisma check to order a mug of ale. Only call for a roll if there is a meaningful consequence for failure.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="18b44d5c-af4e-4a0d-be8e-c0f835240a64">When deciding whether to use a roll, ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="efa5ee5a-94db-4fc1-ab04-89e3cfb22366">
<li data-content-chunk-id="8423fbd4-2d88-452f-9bf7-64c5592e84be">Is a task so easy and so free of conflict and stress that there should be no chance of failure?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a7718a88-25b1-4006-bbe7-d5cfe3117349">Is a task so inappropriate or impossible — such as hitting the moon with an arrow — that it can’t work?</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bf77af07-3dd7-441a-9aa7-9d3550855d75">If the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind of roll is appropriate. The following sections provide guidance on determining whether to call for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw; how to assign DCs; when to use advantage and disadvantage; and other related topics.</p>
<h3 id="AbilityChecks" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="0fcc4233-45e6-454c-84a7-337d42437d68"><a href="#AbilityChecks" data-content-chunk-id="25a98e26-0e33-4627-bfc1-a334c29acafd"></a>Ability Checks</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5f2cb021-ff17-4bdc-b0f7-e98aea24520a">An ability check is a test to see whether a character succeeds at a task that he or she has decided to attempt. The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="d27f128b-2426-46a6-a455-b51971be2a90">Player’s Handbook</a> includes examples of what each ability score is used for. The Ability Checks table summarizes that material for easy reference.</p>
<h4 id="MultipleAbilityChecks" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="ba1987ee-9384-4184-9800-e76c2a215430"><a href="#MultipleAbilityChecks" data-content-chunk-id="863fc7a0-34f8-4f8a-8fc3-730d0750267f"></a>Multiple Ability Checks</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="179185ff-0293-40c0-a61b-30710632ba09">Sometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. In some cases, a character is free to do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With enough attempts and enough time, a character should eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, assume that a character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to complete a task automatically succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating the check allows a character to turn an impossible task into a successful one.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ec3bf10d-d7f7-409e-b0c4-2e1def215fda">In other cases, failing an ability check makes it impossible to make the same check to do the same thing again. For example, a rogue might try to trick a town guard into thinking the adventurers are undercover agents of the king. If the rogue loses a contest of Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/16-tooltip">Deception</a>) against the guard’s Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>), the same lie told again won’t work. The characters can come up with a different way to get past the guard or try the check again against another guard at a different gate. But you might decide that the initial failure makes those checks more difficult to pull off.</p>
<h4 id="Contests" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="2502df5c-9fe6-4c7f-866f-82de85fd49df"><a href="#Contests" data-content-chunk-id="b4e08ffd-1aca-435a-a840-bbc54640ca84"></a>Contests</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="18f24d34-e6bb-46cb-920f-3ec2ed5e0e85">A contest is a kind of ability check that matches two creatures against each other. Use a contest if a character attempts something that either directly foils or is directly opposed by another creature’s efforts. In a contest, the ability checks are compared to each other, rather than to a target number.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d999da5-07ce-4160-99d2-d7d037334b32">When you call for a contest, you pick the ability that each side must use, deciding whether both sides use the same ability or whether different abilities should counter each other. For example, when a creature tries to hide, it engages in a contest of Dexterity against Wisdom. But if two creatures arm wrestle, or if one creature is holding a door closed against another’s attempt to push it open, both use Strength.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d4acc0a7-d319-4627-8f59-dd0435fabc0f">If you have trouble deciding whether to call for an Intelligence or a Wisdom check to determine whether a character notices something, think of it in terms of what a very high or low score in those two abilities might mean.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3fe25648-f943-4022-92d8-e0cb583cd324">A character with a high Wisdom but low Intelligence is aware of the surroundings but is bad at interpreting what things mean. The character might spot that one section of a wall is clean and dusty compared to the others, but he or she wouldn’t necessarily make the deduction that a secret door is there.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dad4d248-5529-4b27-9a66-8bb7325ec33d">In contrast, a character with high Intelligence and low Wisdom is probably oblivious but clever. The character might not spot the clean section of wall but, if asked about it, could immediately deduce why it’s clean.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4776275c-a5fe-4807-b6ba-215c7819e571">Wisdom checks allow characters to perceive what is around them (the wall is clean here), while Intelligence checks answer why things are that way (there’s probably a secret door).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="d679c0ec-e9f2-4165-83e5-1639134476ed">Call for an attack roll when a character tries to hit a creature or an object with an attack, especially when the attack could be foiled by the target’s armor or shield or by another object providing cover. You can also use attack rolls to resolve noncombat activities such as archery contests or a game of darts.</p>
<h3 id="SavingThrows" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="10be64b1-1282-4a19-bab9-2adf1e34814a"><a href="#SavingThrows" data-content-chunk-id="cbd1bddd-c0fa-4145-a439-01a3cc141f3c"></a>Saving Throws</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37878721-97d8-45a7-9504-741742f34563">A saving throw is an instant response to a harmful effect and is almost never done by choice. A save makes the most sense when something bad happens to a character and the character has a chance to avoid that effect. An ability check is something a character actively attempts to accomplish, whereas a saving throw is a split-second response to the activity of someone or something else.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="52afe717-dc9d-4dea-891a-789349562434">Most of the time, a saving throw comes into play when an effect — such as a spell, monster ability, or trap — calls for it, telling you what kind of saving throw is involved and providing a DC for it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b31858a7-657d-4238-ab8e-7f559342d549">Other times, a situation arises that clearly calls for a saving throw, especially when a character is subjected to a harmful effect that can’t be hedged out by armor or a shield. It’s up to you to decide which ability score is involved. The Saving Throws table offers suggestions.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="eca6ecb3-06b7-4296-9901-6bbb93f5b6ba">The numbers associated with these categories of difficulty are meant to be easy to keep in your head, so that you don’t have to refer to these rules every time you decide on a DC. Here are some tips for using DC categories at the gaming table.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6c6a8cad-fbe7-4b2d-a58d-1c912adc2b5c">If you’ve decided that an ability check is called for, then most likely the task at hand isn’t a <strong>very easy</strong> one. Most people can accomplish a DC 5 task with little chance of failure. Unless circumstances are unusual, let characters succeed at such a task without making a check.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eea8a72c-87e9-4f5d-8474-f793b59acc88">Then ask yourself, “Is this task’s difficulty easy, moderate, or hard?” If the only DCs you ever use are 10, 15, and 20, your game will run just fine. Keep in mind that a character with a 10 in the associated ability and no proficiency will succeed at an <strong>easy</strong> task around 50 percent of the time. A <strong>moderate</strong> task requires a higher score or proficiency for success, whereas a <strong>hard</strong> task typically requires both. A big dose of luck with the d20 also doesn’t hurt.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3b20ef1b-7f77-41c4-8c7b-d70d62cae257">If you find yourself thinking, “This task is especially hard,” you can use a higher DC, but do so with caution and consider the level of the characters. A DC 25 task is <strong>very hard</strong> for low-level characters to accomplish, but it becomes more reasonable after 10th level or so. A DC 30 check is <strong>nearly impossible</strong> for most low-level characters. A 20th-level character with proficiency and a relevant ability score of 20 still needs a 19 or 20 on the die roll to succeed at a task of this difficulty.</p>
<h4 id="VariantAutomaticSuccess" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="ad7d7130-525a-4c1c-8669-6daf69f1e904"><a href="#VariantAutomaticSuccess" data-content-chunk-id="75bc6a07-95fe-4afa-8992-ff41475a8503"></a>Variant: Automatic Success</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="656b92f0-8261-4dc9-b035-97f2f37a8369">Sometimes the randomness of a d20 roll leads to ludicrous results. Let’s say a door requires a successful DC 15 Strength check to be battered down. A fighter with a Strength of 20 might helplessly flail against the door because of bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with a Strength of 10 rolls a 20 and knocks the door from its hinges.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="80c1f509-423c-4277-9cf4-3b8ba07c4ef1">If such results bother you, consider allowing automatic success on certain checks. Under this optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant ability score minus 5. So in the example above, the fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule doesn’t apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="448896da-4749-446d-8d52-57c104cf0845">Having proficiency with a skill or tool can also grant automatic success. If a character’s proficiency bonus applies to his or her ability check, the character automatically succeeds if the DC is 10 or less. If that character is 11th level or higher, the check succeeds if the DC is 15 or less.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="51a7a69a-b91a-4ac6-ab81-2099adf8369e">The downside of this whole approach is its predictability. For example, once a character’s ability score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that ability become automatic successes. Smart players will then always match the character with the highest ability score against any given check. If you want some risk of failure, you need to set higher DCs. Doing this, though, can aggravate the problem you’re trying to solve: higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even more on luck.</p>
<h3 id="Proficiency" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="15dd6ae6-ed01-4d63-9eeb-4df3ad36e142"><a href="#Proficiency" data-content-chunk-id="59b0d02a-bc9f-40e4-adcc-47bcb868e77a"></a>Proficiency</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f3b2f29a-ce49-4eec-b224-fc4d2e0d2969">When you ask a player to make an ability check, consider whether a skill or tool proficiency might apply to it. The player might also ask you if a particular proficiency applies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cb1e7349-bb6c-4ca7-b389-48d21ad51ef6">One way to think about this question is to consider whether a character could become better at a particular task through training and practice. If the answer is no, it’s fine to say that no proficiency applies. But if the answer is yes, assign an appropriate skill or tool proficiency to reflect that training and practice.</p>
<h4 id="Skills" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="9a73493c-3e10-403c-89d6-4344e790e8dd"><a href="#Skills" data-content-chunk-id="c9ab3cf5-efba-4d58-bb80-fcc05169db43"></a>Skills</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ae385e22-6190-415f-9a37-17ffd4eb4b8b">As described in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="f1e35611-e453-4183-8e12-5d4ec0ef147e">Player’s Handbook</a>, a skill proficiency represents a character’s focus on one aspect of an ability. Among all the things a character’s Dexterity score describes, the character might be particularly skilled at sneaking around, reflected in proficiency in the skill. When that skill is used for an ability check, it is usually used with Dexterity.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0281313f-0cd2-4e68-98dd-c6aefbc14c59">Under certain circumstances, you can decide a character’s proficiency in a skill can be applied to a different ability check. For example, you might decide that a character forced to swim from an island to the mainland must succeed on a Constitution check (as opposed to a Strength check) because of the distance involved. The character is proficient in the <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/2-tooltip">Athletics</a> skill, which covers swimming, so you allow the character’s proficiency bonus to apply to this ability check. In effect, you’re asking for a Constitution (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/2-tooltip">Athletics</a>) check, instead of a Strength (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/2-tooltip">Athletics</a>) check.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="adc83c0a-baf2-42a6-9365-d8b1d9ce79fa">Often, players ask whether they can apply a skill proficiency to an ability check. If a player can provide a good justification for why a character’s training and aptitude in a skill should apply to the check, go ahead and allow it, rewarding the player’s creative thinking.</p>
<h4 id="Tools" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="faa00169-9ba9-42ee-97d8-7b55931c1a84"><a href="#Tools" data-content-chunk-id="dbae765c-1b71-4492-92b7-fb73be52ac88"></a>Tools</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="946dddc9-edd2-4b3d-a1b2-a5ec807c94b5">Having proficiency with a tool allows you to apply your proficiency bonus to an ability check you make using that tool. For example, a character proficient with carpenter’s tools can apply his or her proficiency bonus to a Dexterity check to craft a wooden flute, an Intelligence check to craft a wooden secret door, or a Strength check to build a working trebuchet. However, the proficiency bonus wouldn’t apply to an ability check made to identify unsafe wooden construction or to discern the origin of a crafted item, since neither check requires tool use.</p>
<h4 id="SavingThrowsandAttackRolls" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="5efaf31e-0df5-4cd5-8a1c-a4b6fc44b573"><a href="#SavingThrowsandAttackRolls" data-content-chunk-id="2a514b6b-c8d2-48bf-9551-b1f14fb3883c"></a>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="45b6fe55-1f28-4a9c-8b31-36116f2c9d7e">Characters are either proficient with a saving throw or attack, or they aren’t. The bonus always applies if a character is proficient.</p>
<h3 id="AdvantageandDisadvantage" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="9d5e7fe2-9742-4718-9479-9d5736c64a7f"><a href="#AdvantageandDisadvantage" data-content-chunk-id="a7863eba-56d1-4df8-9927-461815ca89fc"></a>Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="18be81f6-d488-47f4-b6ec-5ab24fde8c74">Advantage and disadvantage are among the most useful tools in your DM’s toolbox. They reflect temporary circumstances that might affect the chances of a character succeeding or failing at a task. Advantage is also a great way to reward a player who shows exceptional creativity in play.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bd0ae998-9e2d-479a-951e-d8d088cf1d35">Characters often gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, spells, or other features of their classes or backgrounds. In other cases, you decide whether a circumstance influences a roll in one direction or another, and you grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="43821720-b744-46f9-9020-cd4de02e74bb">Consider granting <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage" data-tooltip-href="/rules/96-tooltip">advantage</a> when…</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0a3187b6-29d5-42d1-884a-4439d0d85610">Because advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out, there’s no need to keep track of how many circumstances weigh on both sides.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f05d8c86-37a6-4c44-b0a0-1984b8441959">For example, imagine a wizard is running down a dungeon corridor to escape from a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17099-beholder" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17099-tooltip">beholder</a>. Around the corner ahead, two <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogres</a> lie in wait.

You look at the wizard’s passive Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) score and consider all the factors weighing on it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d5ef192b-f65a-4174-80e1-7111009f9e24">The wizard is running, not paying attention to what’s ahead of him. This imposes disadvantage on the wizard’s ability check. However, the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogres</a> are readying a portcullis trap and making a lot of noise with a winch, which could grant the wizard advantage on the check. As a result, the character has neither advantage nor disadvantage on the Wisdom check, and you don’t need to consider any additional factors. Past encounters with an <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogre</a> ambush, the fact that the wizard’s ears are still ringing from the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2278-thunderwave" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2278-tooltip">thunderwave</a> spell he cast at the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17099-beholder" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17099-tooltip">beholder</a>, the overall noise level of the dungeon — none of that matters any more. They all cancel out.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="896d460f-0366-4f74-833d-13eb15eceaae">Awarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="2ce9b5ca-b4cd-4186-8c76-2cf66e413899">Player’s Handbook</a>, having <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background#Inspiration" data-tooltip-href="/rules/80-tooltip">inspiration</a> gives a character an obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember that a character can have no more than one inspiration at a time.</p>
<h4 id="AwardingInspiration" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="d7128d55-48af-427a-9069-f985ea1ab2b7"><a href="#AwardingInspiration" data-content-chunk-id="9fecfe34-7521-49ee-a5f3-2bb8710b1605"></a>Awarding Inspiration</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eaea3c84-ec24-4272-bcd3-2ca4945c7495">Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to enhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of the game. If you take away anything from this section, remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the game more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration when players take actions that make the game more exciting, amusing, or memorable.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8ceba286-d0e2-4f81-a5fc-23085904ee76">As a rule of thumb, aim to award inspiration to each character about once per session of play. Over time, you might want to award inspiration more or less often, at a rate that works best for your table. You might use the same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might change it with each campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8275063b-9687-4c60-819d-e234efe85fab">Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain types of behavior in your players. Think of your style as a DM and your group’s preferences. What helps make the game more fun for your group? What type of actions fit in with your campaign’s style or genre? Your answers to those questions help determine when you award inspiration.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6d5d1229-70a2-4558-b834-f918a5ccda40"><strong><em>Roleplaying.</em></strong> Using inspiration to reward roleplaying is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a player with inspiration when that player causes his or her character to do something that is consistent with the character’s personality trait, flaw, or bond. The character’s action should be notable in some way. It might drive the story forward, push the adventurers into danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence, you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that makes the game more enjoyable for everyone else.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cbbabaf5-0361-4d4d-a046-3f0b2ef408cd">Take into account each player’s roleplaying style, and try not to favor one style over another. For example, Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and adopting her character’s mannerisms, but Paul feels self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe his character’s attitude and actions. Neither style is better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly makes the game better for everyone.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f18673d4-9002-4487-bb11-7f3e5890c7c7"><strong><em>Heroism.</em></strong> You can use inspiration to encourage player characters to take risks. A fighter might not normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the midst of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the character’s daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a reward tells the players that you want them to embrace swashbuckling action.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d10f4485-65c2-466c-a8de-fad8a17aa705">This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider allowing inspiration to be spent after a d20 roll, rather than before. This approach turns inspiration into a cushion against failure — and a guarantee that it comes into play only when a player is faced directly by failure. Such an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="147412c1-0d61-4d04-a439-ada7f0b08f16"><strong><em>A Reward for Victory.</em></strong> Some DMs prefer to play an impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally requires a DM’s judgment to award, which might run against your style if you like a campaign where you let dice determine most outcomes. If that’s your style, consider using inspiration as a reward when the characters achieve an important goal or victory, representing a surge of confidence and energy.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ad658d64-0a7b-4c6a-bbee-a621bd441f60">Under this model, give everyone in the party inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in the campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="18d4e936-7f59-412d-8e65-62af61fa5b58"><strong><em>Genre Emulation.</em></strong> Inspiration is a handy tool for reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as personality traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired by film noir, characters could have an additional flaw: “I can’t resist helping a person I find alluring despite warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble.” If the characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue and betrayal, reward them with inspiration.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e74fe52-2f14-4b92-81fc-0f7268309098">Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can’t help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its secrets. They probably also go off alone when they shouldn’t. If the party splits up, consider giving each character inspiration.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="96785345-c98f-4b83-8dd7-ef1fe6c3cd76">A sensible person would avoid the noble’s intrigues and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, we’re not dealing with sensible people; we’re dealing with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this approach to work, create a list of your genre’s main conventions and share it with your players. Before the campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your group is on board for embracing those conventions.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b5bbd31f-7a08-4e35-b9fe-11e4f2364b10"><strong><em>Players and Inspiration.</em></strong> Remember that a player with inspiration can award it to another player. Some groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It’s best to let players award their inspiration as they see fit, but feel free to talk to them about following certain guidelines, particularly if you’re trying to reinforce conventions of a certain genre.</p>
<h4 id="WhenDoYouAwardInspiration" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="2654ebb6-4494-4af0-927f-0bee8b317bcd"><a href="#WhenDoYouAwardInspiration" data-content-chunk-id="fd8c0bb0-1575-4040-a14b-69cc664a88e9"></a>When Do You Award Inspiration?</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e391d9b-db1a-4bef-8dc4-a38eec55be4b">Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering inspiration while a player is considering options. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8c15eb6e-0363-4d08-9af8-1088e6554163">Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of play, but it also means players don’t know whether their decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the player can’t spend the inspiration on the act that earned it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This approach works best for groups that want to focus on immersion and player agency, where the DM steps back and gives the players more freedom to do what they want.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2364993e-e611-451c-9acc-0328b2f20afa">Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are manipulating the players or making choices for them. Offering inspiration before an action works great with groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre emulation and group storytelling, where character freedom isn’t as important as weaving a compelling tale together.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b34313d9-1ef9-4e30-9435-d1504182602b">Start with awarding inspiration after an action, especially for your first campaign or when playing with a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the flow of play and avoids making the players feel as if you are being manipulative.</p>
<h4 id="TrackingInspiration" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="9371668e-74c9-4174-b097-88ed358ec2ed"><a href="#TrackingInspiration" data-content-chunk-id="cc3637a2-4ed6-43f6-8fe2-15d441817b3d"></a>Tracking Inspiration</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ed54aaab-97e1-4117-aa07-099f9c14b2c3">A player typically notes on a character sheet whether he or she has inspiration, or you can use poker chips or some other token Alternatively, you can hand out special d20s to represent inspiration. When a player spends inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to someone else, the d20 can go to that other person.</p>
<h4 id="IgnoringInspiration" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="90aa0fac-28de-4992-81c0-c13985deb7e1"><a href="#IgnoringInspiration" data-content-chunk-id="8ae0e640-6db2-4fb4-924f-21875e44cca9"></a>Ignoring Inspiration</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d04014c8-e34f-485d-9b70-ff1e10a4e38e">Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some DMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and others feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts of the game are their own rewards that don’t need incentives like inspiration.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c1f2e7eb-c39d-4f38-b7f9-906bdf4c1774">If you choose to ignore inspiration, you’re telling the players that your campaign is one where you let the dice fall where they may. It’s a good option for gritty campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an impartial role as a rules arbiter.</p>
<h4 id="VariantOnlyPlayersAwardInspiration" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="9ccb016e-0df9-40ee-a4f0-acd609b48060"><a href="#VariantOnlyPlayersAwardInspiration" data-content-chunk-id="b5d879d8-4907-4b13-9195-34fcbad8c44f"></a>Variant: Only Players Award Inspiration</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0633265c-c844-4db4-81fc-bb4391da3999">As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every session, each player can award inspiration to another player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group has agreed on for awarding inspiration.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ba8c7857-2169-4cbc-89c2-92100cbe6b80">This approach makes your life easier and also gives players the chance to recognize each other for good play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being awarded fairly.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d628e304-c499-4f07-94f5-9fbee135e967">This approach works best with groups that are focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations, without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying or whatever other criteria the group has established.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8868a8c3-9124-4ec0-bc89-e439853574e1">In this variant, you can allow each player to award inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the first time that a player awards inspiration in a session is free. Whenever that player awards it later in the same session, you gain inspiration that you can spend to give advantage to any foe of the player characters. There’s no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in this way, and unspent inspiration carries over from one session to the next.</p>
<h3 id="ResolutionandConsequences" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="2f1753a9-ac42-4704-95a2-13ccd39930e7"><a href="#ResolutionandConsequences" data-content-chunk-id="a9bcf411-80b2-4926-979b-6fa7bfc9a348"></a>Resolution and Consequences</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01623d07-a7a3-4bc3-b5e8-55eeef5f30b4">You determine the consequences of attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. In most cases, doing so is straightforward. When an attack hits, it deals damage. When a creature fails a saving throw, the creature suffers a harmful effect. When an ability check equals or exceeds the DC, the check succeeds.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="90283636-623b-496c-b8cd-1dd307c2855b">As a DM, you have a variety of flourishes and approaches you can take when adjudicating success and failure to make things a little less black-and-white.</p>
<h4 id="SuccessataCost" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="b955784d-5ab8-4bfb-b569-edef336cf21a"><a href="#SuccessataCost" data-content-chunk-id="800f252b-2e25-4eee-a8d2-acb3439c4a25"></a>Success at a Cost</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b483f93b-6365-470a-b125-3187a5336c5b">Failure can be tough, but the agony is compounded when a character fails by the barest margin. When a character fails a roll by only 1 or 2, you can allow the character to succeed at the cost of a complication or hindrance. Such complications can run along any of the following lines:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="295fcb9a-acc3-48e6-9eab-c246d4780dbc">
<li data-content-chunk-id="9afaa886-0eef-4012-95e8-356705c4f270">A character manages to get her sword past a hobgoblin’s defenses and turn a near miss into a hit, but the hobgoblin twists its shield and disarms her.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="45c6047c-65e2-4b10-876d-27d70b393f76">A character narrowly escapes the full brunt of a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2102-fireball" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2102-tooltip">fireball</a> but ends up <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/12-tooltip">prone</a>.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="5fcdf4ad-9351-48dd-9f55-9f0b81507489">A character fails to intimidate a kobold prisoner, but the kobold reveals its secrets anyway while shrieking at the top of its lungs, alerting other nearby monsters.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="be1b7176-4294-4b33-a516-599dc3448c75">A character manages to finish an arduous climb to the top of a cliff despite slipping, only to realize that the rope on which his companions dangle below him is close to breaking.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6a967fc6-91ec-4c29-a91f-795889d6bd4f">When you introduce costs such as these, try to make them obstacles and setbacks that change the nature of the adventuring situation. In exchange for success, players must consider new ways of facing the challenge.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b837daa0-2c81-43ee-80a0-5f799c9ab085">You can also use this technique when a character succeeds on a roll by hitting the DC exactly, complicating marginal success in interesting ways.</p>
<h4 id="DegreesofFailure" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="0fdb4a7c-9d37-489a-9e09-c7936f49240f"><a href="#DegreesofFailure" data-content-chunk-id="f5343038-490a-42de-b5c6-f78900bbe424"></a>Degrees of Failure</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7879e128-9b34-4b4a-9fb9-fbb26ceb8257">Sometimes a failed ability check has different consequences depending on the degree of failure. For example, a character who fails to disarm a trapped chest might accidentally spring the trap if the check fails by 5 or more, whereas a lesser failure means that the trap wasn’t triggered during the botched disarm attempt. Consider adding similar distinctions to other checks. Perhaps a failed Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check means a queen won’t help, whereas a failure of 5 or more means she throws you in the dungeon for your impudence.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9bfa2d37-7195-433b-ba29-3600eaa221f3">Rolling a 20 or a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw doesn’t normally have any special effect. However, you can choose to take such an exceptional roll into account when adjudicating the outcome. It’s up to you to determine how this manifests in the game. An easy approach is to increase the impact of the success or failure. For example, rolling a 1 on a failed attempt to pick a lock might break the thieves’ tools being used, and rolling a 20 on a successful Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/8-tooltip">Investigation</a>) check might reveal an extra clue.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="de21fff9-fae7-492a-93ad-0c044a974290">Whatever environment the adventurers are exploring, you can use a map to follow their progress as you relate the details of their travels. In a dungeon, tracking movement on a map lets you describe the branching passages, doors, chambers, and other features the adventurers encounter as they go, and gives the players the opportunity to choose their own path. Similarly, a wilderness map can show roads, rivers, terrain, and other features that might guide the characters on their travels — or lead them astray.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="060061c4-aab1-4123-a2ed-8a8570976c39">The Map Travel Pace table helps you track travel on maps of different scales.

The table uses the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#TravelPace" data-content-chunk-id="9b066aef-d908-4687-9a4f-59a47698f672">travel paces</a> — slow, normal, and fast — described in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="1fc179be-e1aa-492b-805a-9ca36a5a6d4b">Player’s Handbook</a>.

</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1022c1d7-3bb6-42ee-bf58-155a63fe4bd6">For example, a character under the effect of a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2301-wind-walk" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2301-tooltip">wind walk</a> spell gains a flying speed of 300 feet. In 1 minute, the character can move 3,000 feet at a normal pace, 4,000 feet at a fast pace, or 2,000 feet at a slow pace. The character can also cover 20, 30, or 40 miles in an hour. The spell lasts for 8 hours, allowing the character to travel 160, 240, or 320 miles in a day.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="84e8abf1-6889-400c-b0e8-bde6cd1c1ef5">Similarly, a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2203-phantom-steed" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2203-tooltip">phantom steed</a> spell creates a magical mount with a speed of 100 feet that doesn’t tire like a real horse. A character on a phantom steed can cover 1,000 feet in 1 minute at a normal pace, 1,333 feet at a fast pace, or 666 feet at a slow pace. In 1 hour, the character can travel 7, 10, or 13 miles.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3f06f57b-5f49-47d1-b8b7-fddb78ddecc2">When traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2 miles in any direction on a clear day, or until the point where trees, hills, or other obstructions block their view. Rain normally cuts maximum visibility down to 1 mile, and fog can cut it down to between 100 and 300 feet.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="36187a4b-2a73-4d74-8741-78923cf6339a">On a clear day, the characters can see 40 miles if they are atop a mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able to look down on the area around them from a height.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="184f891f-6dda-413c-8645-88643d4b7660">While exploring, characters might encounter other creatures. An important question in such a situation is who notices whom.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fbedc599-2bfb-4e24-a0d1-8f49d48c6b20">Indoors, whether the sides can see one another usually depends on the configuration of rooms and passageways. Vision might also be limited by light sources. Outdoor visibility can be hampered by terrain, weather, and time of day. Creatures can be more likely to hear one another before they see anything.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e5768fa5-7323-4115-accd-03bee22851dd">If neither side is being stealthy, creatures automatically notice each other once they are within sight or hearing range of one another. Otherwise, compare the Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/5-tooltip">Stealth</a>) check results of the creatures in the group that is hiding with the passive Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) scores of the other group, as explained in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="0444e6de-b1c5-4405-b294-e5c75d53906e">Player’s Handbook</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1e8b2c83-ff15-454e-bdee-62579feeb1e0">Adventurers sometimes choose their path by following the tracks of other creatures — or other creatures might track the adventurers! To track, one or more creatures must succeed on a Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/15-tooltip">Survival</a>) check. You might require trackers to make a new check in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="e9e46ff7-fc4f-4a7d-bc13-711808753136">
<li data-content-chunk-id="7ec6ab9f-ed35-4a92-9c63-3721d056b30e">They stop tracking and resume after finishing a short or long rest.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a55bad3a-2546-4a15-b2e1-89be0d6aa0e1">The trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that shows no tracks.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="87d12801-6303-4535-8c16-1218f81c501c">The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way that makes tracking harder.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a362528a-b8d7-4ba0-9aba-216818ad7e86">The DC for the check depends on how well the ground shows signs of a creature’s passage. No roll is necessary in situations where the tracks are obvious. For example, no check is needed to track an army advancing along a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is more challenging, unless the creature being tracked leaves a distinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time often makes tracks harder to follow. In a situation where there is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is impossible.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1351f3ad-f682-4447-95db-9edf6baf20c5">The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on your assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant advantage on the check if there’s more than one set of tracks to follow, or disadvantage if the trail being followed passes through a well-trafficked area.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0380e7cb-ca6e-4c0d-a141-de05b505b13f">On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can attempt to find it again by making a careful search of the area. It takes 10 minutes to find a trail in a confined area such as a dungeon, or 1 hour outdoors.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4623804e-b55b-4c14-a3bf-29af846258e7">During a social interaction, the adventurers usually have a goal. They want to extract information, secure aid, win someone’s trust, escape punishment, avoid combat, negotiate a treaty, or achieve whatever other objective led to the interaction in the first place. The creatures they interact with also have agendas.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b1436468-aa40-46e5-9deb-47aacd64120e">Some DMs prefer to run a social interaction as a free-form roleplaying exercise, where dice rarely come into play. Other DMs prefer to resolve the outcome of an interaction by having characters make Charisma checks. Either approach works, and most games fall somewhere in between, balancing player skill (roleplaying and persuading) with character skill (reflected by ability checks).</p>
<h3 id="ResolvingInteractions" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="738c0f07-e023-4fbb-91af-313973b1a67c"><a href="#ResolvingInteractions" data-content-chunk-id="5143f809-783e-4698-ab9a-698b9ef464b0"></a>Resolving Interactions</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="39f6d7e0-eb4e-4c6e-8289-e4891e4339a2">The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="b770a333-565f-4b9a-8503-7b4240d5971f">Player’s Handbook</a> provides guidelines for balancing roleplaying and ability checks in a social interaction (see chapter 8, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#SocialInteraction" data-content-chunk-id="5faff4fc-0a4f-4211-8623-ed3391f0c57d">Adventuring</a>"). This section adds to that material by providing a structured way to resolve a social interaction. Much of this structure will be invisible to your players in play and isn’t meant to be a substitute for roleplaying.</p>
<h4 id="1StartingAttitude" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="34a67a90-e2d8-4367-9fe2-0d218b074773"><a href="#1StartingAttitude" data-content-chunk-id="4cec9026-a29b-466c-863b-e8490246502b"></a>1. Starting Attitude</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2e52f35b-6f5d-4a6c-93ae-0b34bd5a7e01">Choose the starting attitude of a creature the adventurers are interacting with: friendly, indifferent, or hostile.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="61b60eb1-f1df-4bf0-880d-283c85e6da81">A <strong>friendly</strong> creature wants to help the adventurers and wishes for them to succeed. For tasks or actions that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly creatures usually help without question. If an element of personal risk is involved, a successful Charisma check might be required to convince a friendly creature to take that risk.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f0a33571-b12c-4679-900f-9365fda0dabc">An <strong>indifferent</strong> creature might help or hinder the party, depending on what the creature sees as most beneficial. A creature’s indifference doesn’t necessarily make it standoffish or disinterested. Indifferent creatures might be polite and genial, surly and irritable, or anything in between. A successful Charisma check is necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an indifferent creature to do something.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="82a8892c-8bc3-4e5a-9b33-67f5206ce747">A <strong>hostile</strong> creature opposes the adventurers and their goals but doesn’t necessarily attack them on sight. For example, a condescending noble might wish to see a group of upstart adventurers fail so as to keep them from becoming rivals for the king’s attention, thwarting them with slander and scheming rather than direct threats and violence. The adventurers need to succeed on one or more challenging Charisma checks to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their behalf. That said, a hostile creature might be so ill-disposed toward the party that no Charisma check can improve its attitude, in which case any attempt to sway it through diplomacy fails automatically.</p>
<h4 id="2Conversation" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="ebfa16cb-1318-4a6b-9edd-11cdf5c51899"><a href="#2Conversation" data-content-chunk-id="7da9c272-2630-4e18-b6ce-7ed89ea7875b"></a>2. Conversation</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f0716b58-9a94-4b6e-a33a-cbc043f70a6a"><strong>Play out the conversation.</strong> Let the adventurers make their points, trying to frame their statements in terms that are meaningful to the creature they are interacting with.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="10a20147-cfe7-469c-9cbd-b9e7c6d7ee7e"><strong><em>Changing Attitude.</em></strong> The attitude of a creature might change over the course of a conversation. If the adventurers say or do the right things during an interaction (perhaps by touching on a creature’s ideal, bond, or flaw), they can make a hostile creature temporarily indifferent, or make an indifferent creature temporarily friendly. Likewise, a gaffe, insult, or harmful deed might make a friendly creature temporarily indifferent or turn an indifferent creature hostile.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ec4e8156-1431-4478-be1f-f6f09fdc2c8b">Whether the adventurers can shift a creature’s attitude is up to you. You decide whether the adventurers have successfully couched their statements in terms that matter to the creature. Typically, a creature’s attitude can’t shift more than one step during a single interaction, whether temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="faec690b-66d8-4955-b00e-656876a70889"><strong><em>Determining Characteristics.</em></strong> The adventurers don’t necessarily enter into a social interaction with a full understanding of a creature’s ideal, bond, or flaw. If they want to shift a creature’s attitude by playing on these characteristics, they first need to determine what the creature cares about. They can guess, but doing so runs the risk of shifting the creature’s attitude in the wrong direction if they guess badly.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="451a2061-3ae8-4fdd-a3a1-87d93f3e26d9">After interacting with a creature long enough to get a sense of its personality traits and characteristics through conversation, an adventurer can attempt a Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/12-tooltip">Insight</a>) check to uncover one of the creature’s characteristics. You set the DC. A check that fails by 10 or more might misidentify a characteristic, so you should provide a false characteristic or invert one of the creature’s existing characteristics. For example, if an old sage’s flaw is that he is prejudiced against the uneducated, an adventurer who badly fails the check might be told that the sage enjoys personally seeing to the education of the downtrodden.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3c95c124-8b58-4725-a671-e2a984eb9060">Given time, adventurers can also learn about a creature’s characteristics from other sources, including its friends and allies, personal letters, and publicly told stories. Acquiring such information might be the basis of an entirely different set of social interactions.</p>
<h4 id="3CharismaCheck" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="fa0fde78-13a7-4583-adad-1ba33098cf7c"><a href="#3CharismaCheck" data-content-chunk-id="e9d62353-397d-435d-a461-e055a5405745"></a>3. Charisma Check</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b8109788-074f-49ec-afe9-5bdccfb3ed6a">When the adventurers get to the point of their request, demand, or suggestion — or if you decide the conversation has run its course — call for a Charisma check. Any character who has actively participated in the conversation can make the check. Depending on how the adventurers handled the conversation, the <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/16-tooltip">Deception</a>, or <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/17-tooltip">Intimidation</a> skill might apply to the check. The creature’s current attitude determines the DC required to achieve a specific reaction, as shown in the Conversation Reaction table.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="145c83bc-8469-4e05-bf27-99fcf43043bf"><strong><em>Aiding the Check.</em></strong> Other characters who make substantial contributions to the conversation can help the character making the check. If a helping character says or does something that would influence the interaction in a positive way, the character making the Charisma check can do so with advantage. If the other character inadvertently says something counterproductive or offensive, the character making the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="974675e6-d23f-4edd-b652-8528686476c8"><strong><em>Multiple Checks.</em></strong> Certain situations might call for more than one check, particularly if the adventurers come into the interaction with multiple goals.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c635e962-1c8c-4335-a2c4-3649cab48dd9">Once a Charisma check has been made, further attempts to influence the target of the interaction might be fruitless or run the risk of upsetting or angering the subject creature, potentially shifting its attitude toward hostility. Use your best judgment. For example, if the party’s rogue says something that pushes a noble’s attitude toward the party from indifferent to hostile, another character might be able to diffuse the noble’s hostility with clever roleplaying and a successful Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/19-tooltip">Persuasion</a>) check.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fe6c3e9e-23ac-42fb-8b9d-ad2162464c60">For some DMs, roleplaying comes naturally. If it doesn’t come naturally for you, don’t worry. The main thing is for you to have fun portraying your NPCs and monsters and to amuse your players in the process. You don’t need to be a practiced thespian or comedian to create drama or humor. The key is to pay attention to the story elements and characterizations that make your players laugh or feel emotionally engaged and to incorporate those things into your roleplaying.</p>
<h4 id="BeingtheNPC" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="624904ed-d3fe-4dbd-9508-5b32c4681226"><a href="#BeingtheNPC" data-content-chunk-id="d6fea8b4-3b5f-472f-b92d-3fd64347a34b"></a>Being the NPC</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd32df88-f4dc-4158-a825-d7a6d0beb713">Imagine how a character or monster you bring to life would react to the adventurers. Consider what it cares about. Does it have any ideals, flaws, or bonds? By working such things into your portrayal, you not only make the character or monster more believable, but you also enhance the sense that the adventurers are in a living world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="66a76d40-f763-4b88-8ffe-3f5cfdcf20a6">Strive for responses and actions that introduce twists into the game. For example, an old woman whose family was killed at the hands of an evil wizard might regard the party’s wizard with grave suspicion.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="691bc263-164d-4101-a836-1b7f8f9d7bf8">However you roleplay a character or monster, the classic advice for writers holds true: show, don’t tell. For example, rather than describe an NPC as shallow and self-centered, have the individual act the way you would expect a shallow, self-centered person to behave. The NPC might have off-the-cuff answers for everything, an over-willingness to share personal anecdotes, and a desperate need to make himself or herself the subject of every conversation.</p>
<h4 id="UsingYourVoice" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="2644951f-c5b0-4786-9d95-d45a700a225f"><a href="#UsingYourVoice" data-content-chunk-id="a587a1ab-4d85-4bc1-b4c9-d62884cb730b"></a>Using Your Voice</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="438fa436-d977-499a-bfdf-e476779b7353">Most of what you say during a session will be at a consistent level. For dramatic effect, be ready to shout out a battle cry or speak in a conspiratorial whisper.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="17ae8f54-d3ed-4a40-9d23-4ef749f3704b">Also, characters and monsters with distinctive voices are memorable. If you’re not a natural mimic or actor, borrowing distinctive speech patterns from real life, the movies, or television is a good place to start. Practice different voices and impersonations of famous people, then use those voices to bring your NPCs to life.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="917c9286-5f06-4479-ae0e-ffdf6ff41e66">Experiment with different speech patterns. For instance, a barmaid and a city magistrate probably use their words differently. Similarly, peasants could speak in earthy dialects, while rich folk talk in haughty drawls. Let a pirate NPC say, “Arrrr, maties!” in your best Long John Silver voice. Let intelligent monsters unfamiliar with Common stumble along with awkward grammar. Let drunkards and monsters mutter with slurred speech, while lizardfolk hiss their threats.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ec4f4577-22d5-4b5a-a2e6-bd0cdf9766e0">In any interaction with multiple NPCs, make sure the adventurers remain the focus. Have the NPCs talk to them, not so much to each other. If possible, let one NPC do most of the talking, but if multiple NPCs need to talk, give them distinct voices so the players know who’s who.</p>

Scowl, smile, grin, snarl, pout, cross your eyes — do whatever it takes to make the character or monster memorable to the players. When you combine facial expressions with an unusual voice, a character truly comes to life.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="723e3cf7-e956-4718-afac-ad40a0f26e6e">Though you don’t need to stand up out of your chair, you can use your arms to bring even more life to an NPC. A noble could chop the air with one hand while speaking in a deadpan monotone, while an archmage might express her displeasure by silently rolling her eyes and massaging her temples with her fingers.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3c73040c-cc39-4b92-821b-7a784ccd13ab">Some players enjoy roleplaying and interaction more than others. Whatever your players’ tastes, your lively portrayal of NPCs and monsters can inspire players to make just as much investment in portraying their characters. This makes social interactions an opportunity for everyone to become more immersed in the game, creating a story whose protagonists have depth.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4c9f127d-dbc3-497c-9086-18b584712825">To make sure everyone has something to do during a roleplaying-heavy game session, consider one or more of the following approaches.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0322ea16-fb13-4292-97bd-22f3327d2a7f"><strong><em>Appeal to Player Preferences.</em></strong> There are in-game activities that players enjoy more than others, as discussed in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/introduction" data-content-chunk-id="b0e71ab1-bd88-4b4f-96db-5753bbf402a4">Introduction</a>. Players who like acting thrive in interaction situations, and it’s fine to let those players take the spotlight. They often inspire other players by their example, but make sure those other players have an opportunity to join in the fun.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2602e9fb-5480-4403-a0ef-822a6fcf45b8">Players who like exploring and storytelling are usually amenable to roleplaying, as long as it moves the campaign forward and reveals more about the world. Players who like problem-solving often enjoy figuring out the right thing to say to shift an NPC’s attitude. Players who are instigators like provoking reactions from NPCs, so they’re often easily engaged — though not always productively.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4859706d-aefb-46f7-97a7-0870615e0a50">Players who like to optimize their characters and slay monsters also like to argue, and having conflict within an interaction can help those players embrace roleplaying. Still, creating combat connections to an extended interaction (such as a corrupt vizier sending assassins to kill the adventurers) is often the best way to keep action-focused players engaged.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7162c4f5-11dc-4ae0-8eb5-28eac4041daf"><strong><em>Target Specific Characters.</em></strong> Create situations where characters who might not otherwise be engaged with a social interaction have to do at least some of the talking. Perhaps the NPC in question is a family member or a contact of a particular adventurer and talks only to that character. An NPC of a certain race or class might listen only to characters he or she feels a kinship with. Creating a sense of importance can be a great way to get specific players engaged, but don’t shut out players who are already roleplaying.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7444abde-9c0f-4f91-a78f-82349bb303ba">If a couple of players are dominating the conversation, take a moment now and then to involve the others. You can do this in character if you like: “And what about your hulking friend? Speak, barbarian! What will you pledge in exchange for my favor?” Or just ask the player what his or her character is doing while the conversation is going on. The first approach is better for players who are already comfortable speaking in their characters’ voices. The second approach works better for players who need encouragement to engage in a roleplaying scenario.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="41f9cb5b-ad51-4873-a8f1-afb9d7c3315e">When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire’s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character’s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c42cf718-6b18-478a-963a-2e77a7cdffa8">For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1acb8210-1da7-46c7-8e42-f3e8fbb54d8a">When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="99556527-c7d7-4ce3-a458-4d2b849d421a"><strong><em>Armor Class.</em></strong> An object’s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.</p>

Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="864de743-fca7-4b27-a0b1-74fbda5020a8"><strong><em>Huge and Gargantuan Objects.</em></strong> Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2081-earthquake" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2081-tooltip">earthquake</a> spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="176cd25c-08de-4d21-ad92-eea6ec517a62"><strong><em>Objects and Damage Types.</em></strong> Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can’t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c6618eca-9337-4a2d-94a5-bccd2ae7fd8a"><strong><em>Damage Threshold.</em></strong> Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points.</p>

<h3 id="TrackingInitiative" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="bba22c3a-f43e-4106-9292-a9932ad63a7a"><a href="#TrackingInitiative" data-content-chunk-id="1a81c53b-b04c-42ee-84b6-99a1f855e11c"></a>Tracking Initiative</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="73b2a73b-393d-43df-ab05-bb591066f9ca">You can use several different methods for keeping track of who goes when in combat.</p>
<h4 id="HiddenList" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="1bd665cc-110c-4a45-b68f-63e454d37e08"><a href="#HiddenList" data-content-chunk-id="9e2a01ce-01bb-45b7-8a39-3e7d8bfe7104"></a>Hidden List</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="01c2ebba-37be-4db0-a8ec-13d345cf6419">Many DMs keep track of initiative on a list the players can’t see: usually a piece of paper behind a DM screen or a spreadsheet on a tablet computer. This method allows you to keep track of combatants who haven’t been revealed yet, and you can use the initiative list as a place to record the current hit points of monsters, as well as other useful notes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ef5a096-e756-4c2b-a944-ff8b566f71ca">A downside of this approach is that you have to remind the players round after round when their turns come up.</p>
<h4 id="VisibleList" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="9db01bae-51c4-40cf-9a74-ead1a5fc40cf"><a href="#VisibleList" data-content-chunk-id="a7b65f14-fcb1-4d8c-a5ca-ef594d938bf6"></a>Visible List</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="812e1dc9-3ffa-45e6-bfc7-dc42383bab2c">You can use a whiteboard to track initiative. As the players tell you their initiative numbers, write them on the whiteboard in order from highest to lowest, leaving space between each name. Either write the monsters’ initiatives on the list at the same time or add them to the list on each monster’s first turn.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a1b1d413-6e61-43e9-9ead-d0e4f7c7fcaf">As a further improvement, use magnets that you can attach to a metal-based whiteboard with characters’ and monsters’ names written on them, or write those names on cards held in place by magnets.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="47ff7453-4002-4272-8e1a-649c9ac49aa0">A visible list lets everyone see the order of play. Players know when their turns are coming up, and they can start planning their actions in advance. A visible list also removes any uncertainty about when the monsters will act in the fight.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3042092f-b759-42f5-8830-1daaa835806f">A variation on the visible list is to give one player responsibility for keeping track of initiative, either on a whiteboard or on a piece of paper the other players can see. This method reduces the number of things you need to keep track of yourself.</p>
<h4 id="IndexCards" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="eaa0e9d2-fce5-4d7f-bea1-b69efc54c0f8"><a href="#IndexCards" data-content-chunk-id="19b932e1-1961-4664-9b3b-8742cd2370da"></a>Index Cards</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="042c6ca0-882e-4024-96d1-9e3ac70a1638">In this approach, each character gets an index card, as does each group of identical monsters. When the players tell you their initiative numbers, write the numbers on their characters’ index cards. Do the same when you roll the monsters’ initiative. Then arrange the cards in order from highest to lowest. Starting at the top, you move down through the stack. When you call out the name of the character whose turn it is, also mention who’s next, prompting that player to start thinking ahead. After each character or group of monsters acts, the top card is moved to the bottom of the stack.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1177ad0c-c30c-4551-b2b1-de0f03234bad">At first, players don’t know the order of play when you use combat cards, and they don’t know where the monsters fall into the order until the monsters act.</p>
<h3 id="TrackingMonsterHitPoints" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="b00da7df-d4b0-4cd1-88fa-50925e59a3ea"><a href="#TrackingMonsterHitPoints" data-content-chunk-id="94d7b7d2-5001-4fc2-9898-f5c7ae56d19c"></a>Tracking Monster Hit Points</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="49d9fe38-7ac2-42c4-a630-8665f276cf3a">During a combat encounter, you need to track how much damage each monster takes. Most DMs track damage in secret so that their players don’t know how many hit points a monster has remaining. Whether you choose to be secretive or not is up to you. What’s important is that every monster’s hit points be tracked individually.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="970407e1-5c14-4731-9037-7c57344a3ecf">Tracking damage for one or two monsters isn’t onerous, but it helps to have a system for larger groups of monsters. If you aren’t using miniatures or other visual aids, the easiest way to keep track of your monsters is to assign them unique features. Descriptions such as “the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogre</a> with the nasty scar” and “the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogre</a> with the horned helm” help you and your players track which monster is which. For example, imagine that you’re running an encounter with three ogres, each of which has 59 hit points. Once initiative is rolled, jot down each ogre’s hit points and add notes (and even a name, if you like) to differentiate each one:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a693a5ea-f77c-47db-8871-c6aa936fdb3e">Krag (<a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogre</a> w/ scar): 59</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6a0530c9-e124-4baa-a0f0-2b7af8a48272">Thod (<a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogre</a> w/ helm): 59</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="10a608fc-81e9-4c30-b381-1a4f8c26a971">Mur (<a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogre</a> who smells like poo): 59</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2eb02c19-5a33-4807-999b-16eca2b9a31e">If you use miniatures to represent monsters, one easy way to differentiate them is to give each one a unique miniature. If you use identical miniatures to represent multiple monsters, you can tag the miniatures with small stickers of different colors or stickers with different letters or numbers on them.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="16954aa9-f9a0-4436-aeb2-b4f4d9012eee">For example, in a combat encounter with three ogres, you could use three identical ogre miniatures tagged with stickers marked A, B, and C, respectively. To track the ogres’ hit points, you can sort them by letter, then subtract damage from their hit points as they take it. Your records might look something like this after a few rounds of combat:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c7cdf4c4-dc8b-4a34-9043-cb111b4fdd6f"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">Ogre</a> A: <del>59</del> <del>53</del> <del>45</del> <del>24</del> <del>14</del> <del>9</del> dead</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ea48be5f-7279-4538-ad9b-905eab941d0d"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">Ogre</a> B: <del>59</del> <del>51</del> 30</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3cdd3c6f-92fb-4d10-8110-c899f1b68ec7"><a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">Ogre</a> C: 59</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d1da5cad-b6c0-45be-963b-031901164674">Players often ask how hurt a monster looks. Don’t ever feel as though you need to reveal exact hit points, but if a monster is below half its hit point maximum, it’s fair to say that it has visible wounds and appears beaten down. You can describe a monster taken to half its hit points as bloodied, giving the players a sense of progress in a fight against a tough opponent, and helping them judge when to use their most powerful spells and abilities.</p>
<h3 id="UsingandTrackingConditions" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="e012b1eb-1eab-4db4-bef0-7387ccc0b4e2"><a href="#UsingandTrackingConditions" data-content-chunk-id="eb4562e7-a0dd-41c0-babf-a7bd77da10a9"></a>Using and Tracking Conditions</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="806257b9-debe-4023-8fb4-30b66218de45">Various rules and features in the game are clear about when they apply a condition to a creature. You can also apply conditions on the fly. They’re meant to be intuitive for you to do so. For example, if a character is in a state, such as sleep, that lacks consciousness, you can say the character is <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/15-tooltip">unconscious</a>. Or did a character just stumble onto the ground? He or she is now <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/12-tooltip">prone</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3ee311af-2b3b-4404-ac22-2b9e70e39b27">Keeping track of conditions can become tricky. For monsters, it’s often easiest to track conditions on combat cards or wherever you track initiative. Players should remember any conditions affecting their characters. Because players have incentive to forget or overlook hampering conditions, character conditions can also be marked on combat cards or a whiteboard.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d50002f0-a901-4517-bec9-fbb824e8f8bb">You might also try keeping a supply of index cards on hand, marked with conditions and their effects. Then hand the cards to players as the conditions come up. Having a bright pink index card on top of a character sheet can help even the most absentminded player remember the effects of being <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/2-tooltip">charmed</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/5-tooltip">frightened</a>.</p>
<h3 id="MonstersandCriticalHits" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="923a5b92-2dfe-4a56-9665-66510368ec94"><a href="#MonstersandCriticalHits" data-content-chunk-id="22050473-4f60-42bf-aac0-ec277239f0a3"></a>Monsters and Critical Hits</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="02ae57e6-f609-4703-93f1-d4da1447e122">A monster follows the same rule for critical hits as a player character. That said, if you use a monster’s average damage, rather than rolling, you might wonder how to handle a critical hit. When the monster scores a critical hit, roll all the damage dice associated with the hit and add them to the average damage. For example, if a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16907-goblin" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16907-tooltip">goblin</a> normally deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage on a hit and scores a critical hit, it deals 5 + 1d6 slashing damage.</p>
<h3 id="ImprovisingDamage" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="2526e661-3d14-41c7-a6c4-452ccb7b58f3"><a href="#ImprovisingDamage" data-content-chunk-id="87284667-886b-4dd9-83de-dd2b1682d004"></a>Improvising Damage</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7ffcb07e-f524-4b4d-b80c-4449f5fe91a4">A monster or effect typically specifies the amount of damage it deals. In some cases, though, you need to determine damage on the fly. The Improvising Damage table gives you suggestions for when you do so.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f113f770-9d71-4292-bad5-b12c343b0268">Many spells and other game features create areas of effect, such as the cone and the sphere. If you’re not using miniatures or another visual aid, it can sometimes be difficult to determine who’s in an area of effect and who isn’t. The easiest way to address such uncertainty is to go with your gut and make a call.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4f28a85f-fc23-45e7-81bc-856c3d210571">If you would like more guidance, consider using the Targets in Areas of Effect table. To use the table, imagine which combatants are near one another, and let the table guide you in determining the number of those combatants that are caught in an area of effect. Add or subtract targets based on how bunched up the potential targets are. Consider rolling 1d3 to determine the amount to add or subtract.</p>

Similarly, a sorcerer could launch a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2167-lightning-bolt" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2167-tooltip">lightning bolt</a> (100-foot line) at some <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16969-ogre" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16969-tooltip">ogres</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16925-hobgoblin" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16925-tooltip">hobgoblins</a>, and you could use the table to say four of the monsters are targeted (100 ÷ 30 = 3.33, rounded up to 4).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d1ecb29b-402d-490f-8452-061602726b5f">This approach aims at simplicity instead of spatial precision. If you prefer more tactical nuance, consider using miniatures.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="43fa3800-3830-446e-ba10-585725a4c3f7">Keeping combat moving along at a brisk pace can be difficult when there are dozens of monsters involved in a battle. When handling a crowded battlefield, you can speed up play by forgoing attack rolls in favor of approximating the average number of hits a large group of monsters can inflict on a target.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2f595ef8-fe4b-42f9-ab26-ee81174bf6b2">Instead of rolling an attack roll, determine the minimum d20 roll a creature needs in order to hit a target by subtracting its attack bonus from the target’s AC. You’ll need to refer to the result throughout the battle, so it’s best to write it down.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="04bb7c6b-f3a6-4222-993c-b3b9c52fe6fc">Look up the minimum d20 roll needed on the Mob Attacks table. The table shows you how many creatures that need that die roll or higher must attack a target in order for one of them to hit. If that many creatures attack the target, their combined efforts result in one of them hitting the target.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="17da18d5-44a6-43fc-8373-b56b7e68dcdf">For example, eight <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16972-orc" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16972-tooltip">orcs</a> surround a fighter. The orcs’ attack bonus is +5, and the fighter’s AC is 19. The orcs need a 14 or higher to hit the fighter. According to the table, for every three orcs that attack the fighter, one of them hits. There are enough orcs for two groups of three. The remaining two orcs fail to hit the fighter.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="08dbadc8-e5be-4539-87b1-f602c93d8522">If the attacking creatures deal different amounts of damage, assume that the creature that deals the most damage is the one that hits. If the creature that hits has multiple attacks with the same attack bonus, assume that it hits once with each of those attacks. If a creature’s attacks have different attack bonuses, resolve each attack separately.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="613ca782-6971-4b2a-9d6d-162153b85d04">This attack resolution system ignores critical hits in favor of reducing the number of die rolls.

<p data-content-chunk-id="ca23ae33-c8b5-4119-9ca5-fbfb8b3a74d5">In combat, players can often rely on your descriptions to visualize where their characters are in relation to their surroundings and their enemies. Some complex battles, however, are easier to run with visual aids, the most common of which are miniatures and a grid. If you like to construct model terrain, build three-dimensional dungeons, or draw maps on large vinyl mats, you should also consider using miniatures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0000371d-c9d3-4030-b773-ef223de8fcd3">The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="45c42405-35f5-42b1-872f-a24dbf9d2cb0">Player’s Handbook</a> offers simple rules for depicting combat using miniature figures on a grid. This section expands on that material.</p>
<h4 id="TacticalMaps" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="30c38f4f-232e-4db6-9800-1822f5ce5e1b"><a href="#TacticalMaps" data-content-chunk-id="97532458-2626-4edb-9f9d-b02de7d2ce67"></a>Tactical Maps</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c077d00-92a7-49a6-a36c-f0ae4ef5847b">You can draw tactical maps with colored markers on a wet-erase vinyl mat with 1-inch squares, on a large sheet of paper, or on a similar flat surface. Preprinted poster-sized maps, maps assembled from cardboard tiles, and terrain made of sculpted plaster or resin are also fun.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1eedb0a9-4ce6-40d6-82a8-56efb5b0da8e">The most common unit for tactical maps is the 5-foot square, and maps with grids are readily available and easy to create. However, you don’t have to use a grid at all. You can track distances with a tape measure, string, craft sticks, or pipe cleaners cut to specific lengths. Another option is a play surface covered by 1-inch hexagons (often called hexes), which combines the easy counting of a grid with the more flexible movement of using no grid. Dungeon corridors with straight walls and right angles don’t map easily onto hexes, though.</p>
<h4 id="CreatureSizeonSquaresandHexes" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="51be2deb-5d80-4f38-982f-79ea298f1698"><a href="#CreatureSizeonSquaresandHexes" data-content-chunk-id="fe232663-64bc-44ea-b075-076627b5334a"></a>Creature Size on Squares and Hexes</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f65fbfc2-afc9-45e0-b5de-adda2e494b69">A creature’s size determines how much space it occupies on squares or hexes, as shown in the Creature Size and Space table. If the miniature you use for a monster takes up an amount of space different from what’s on the table, that’s fine, but treat the monster as its official size for all other rules. For example, you might use a miniature that has a Large base to represent a Huge giant. That giant takes up less space on the battlefield than its size suggests, but it is still Huge for the purposes of rules like grappling.</p>

If three or four of those lines are blocked but the attack can still reach the target (such as when the target is behind an arrow slit), the target has <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Cover" data-tooltip-href="/rules/84-tooltip">three-quarters cover</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6dc27e0d-ac9a-4edb-af7a-17399962188c">On hexes, use the same procedure as a grid, drawing lines between the corners of the hexagons.

<p data-content-chunk-id="35a6f58c-4f81-4fc2-bfa1-e461f809664a">The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="6983bc8e-5db1-405e-891a-afda2f3a887b">Player’s Handbook</a> presents a simple method for counting movement and measuring range on a grid: count every square as 5 feet, even if you’re moving diagonally. Though this is fast in play, it breaks the laws of geometry and is inaccurate over long distances. This optional rule provides more realism, but it requires more effort during combat.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cf410f12-640f-45d4-a0a8-645fd94958e7">When measuring range or moving diagonally on a grid, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you’re counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. For example, a character might move one square diagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight (15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total movement of 30 feet.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ea8d9b61-7773-4a64-a578-01d0a746a42f">If you want the precision of knowing which way a creature is facing, consider using this optional rule.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="359d1c12-3f1c-4df1-86b0-b27ff929ffd8">Whenever a creature ends its move, it can change its facing. Each creature has a front arc (the direction it faces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature can also change its facing as a reaction when any other creature moves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b73ebced-9c83-4404-8cc5-3ef987b781aa">A creature can normally target only creatures in its front or side arcs. It can’t see into its rear arc. This means an attacker in the creature’s rear arc makes attack rolls against it with advantage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e746ddc-173d-4989-abcb-703c8f80eac5">Shields apply their bonus to AC only against attacks from the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For example, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it only against attacks from the front and left arcs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1526da16-e1e7-41da-956f-c962ac2d610a">Feel free to determine that not all creatures have every type of arc. For example, an amorphous <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16967-ochre-jelly" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16967-tooltip">ochre jelly</a> could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="53a60601-61ec-4d0d-9792-7e009bdf63b9">On squares, you pick one side of a creature’s space as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line outward from each corner of this side to determine the squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature form its side arcs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9fd4ecd3-cfb0-4242-91c1-bad922683caf">On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature’s space and create a wedge shape expanding out from there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature are its side arcs.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="025bd84a-6521-4fea-a8ff-18b6da3abeca">A square or hex might be in more than one arc, depending on how you draw the lines from a creature’s space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one arc, it is in that arc. If it is split exactly down the middle, use this rule: if half of it lies in the front arc, it’s in that arc. If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it’s in the side arc.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1a66774c-8052-47e1-b343-fda9d0072951">Typical combatants rely on the <a class="tooltip-hover action-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack" data-tooltip-href="/actions/1001-tooltip">opportunity attack</a> and the <a class="tooltip-hover action-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ReadyAction" data-tooltip-href="/actions/9-tooltip">Ready</a> action for most of their reactions in a fight. Various spells and features give a creature more reaction options, and sometimes the timing of a reaction can be difficult to adjudicate. Use this rule of thumb: follow whatever timing is specified in the reaction’s description. For example, the <a class="tooltip-hover action-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack" data-tooltip-href="/actions/1001-tooltip">opportunity attack</a> and the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2247-shield" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2247-tooltip">shield</a> spell are clear about the fact that they can interrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing specified, or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs after its trigger finishes, as in the <a class="tooltip-hover action-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ReadyAction" data-tooltip-href="/actions/9-tooltip">Ready</a> action.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="4fc3d4ae-9504-4abc-b34d-fad5c517f792">Different game features can affect a target at the same time. But when two or more game features have the same name, only the effects of one of them—the most potent one—apply while the durations of the effects overlap. For example, if a target is ignited by a fire elemental’s Fire Form trait, the ongoing fire damage doesn’t increase if the burning target is subjected to that trait again. Game features include spells, class features, feats, racial traits, monster abilities, and magic items. See the related rule in the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting#CombiningMagicalEffects" data-content-chunk-id="894718b1-189d-4c94-97d3-8feb982fc9d1">Combining Magical Effects</a>” section of chapter 10 in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="a521ddec-45a3-4b6f-a142-220a0d94f43d">Player’s Handbook</a>.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="b6722d81-d9c8-48a2-bb86-da729fe4c75c">Strict application of the movement rules can turn a potentially exciting chase into a dull, predictable affair. Faster creatures always catch up to slower ones, while creatures with the same speed never close the distance between each other. This set of rules can make chases more exciting by introducing random elements.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5240e119-673e-42f9-8c8a-758af7a07bbe">A chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any participants not already in initiative order must roll initiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase can take one action and move on its turn. The chase ends when one side drops out or the quarry escapes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="518af01f-6e36-46e6-9b5f-58b75118d954">When a chase begins, determine the starting distance between the quarry and the pursuers.

<p data-content-chunk-id="65e77d87-d622-482f-8a3e-c9ef250b20d1">Chase participants can’t normally make opportunity attacks against each other, since they are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time. However, participants can still be the targets of opportunity attacks from creatures not participating in the chase.

<p data-content-chunk-id="97a20a70-64b1-4b85-896d-04917fab12e7">The tables presented here don’t work for all possible environments. A chase through the sewers of Baldur’s Gate or through the spiderweb-filled alleys of Menzoberranzan might inspire you to create your own table.</p>
<h4 id="SplittingUp" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="07bb3698-4683-4c63-b3fc-0fa6b6f5f1a5"><a href="#SplittingUp" data-content-chunk-id="ba3710f1-8aca-458e-8d88-9b163c92382c"></a>Splitting Up</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9e6b39e3-b073-4a5c-a49e-49a8ad60126d">Creatures being chased can split up into smaller groups. This tactic forces pursuers to either divide their forces or allow some of the quarry to escape. If a pursuit splits into several smaller chases, resolve each chase separately. Run a round of one chase, then a round of the next, and so on, tracking the distances for each separate group.</p>
<h4 id="MappingtheChase" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="15196f0c-c544-4e2a-ae8f-2e71521ac064"><a href="#MappingtheChase" data-content-chunk-id="c3100181-abe9-4f86-adf6-f99c78e2e970"></a>Mapping the Chase</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="89f414fe-5b53-4375-9dda-d93dcc172eb8">If you have the opportunity to plan out a chase, take the time to draw a rough map that shows the route. Insert obstacles at specific points, especially ones that require the characters to make ability checks or saving throws to avoid slowing or stopping, or use a random table of complications similar to the ones in this section. Otherwise, improvise as you play.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="89e0fa7f-0f13-4d41-a218-21b3527f0ac7">Complications can be barriers to progress or opportunities for mayhem. Characters being chased through a forest by <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16817-bugbear" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16817-tooltip">bugbears</a> might spot a wasp nest and slow down long enough to attack the nest or throw rocks at it, thus creating an obstacle for their pursuers.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="571310f1-acdb-4795-87ec-db82afa7915a">A map of a chase can be linear or have many branches, depending on the nature of the chase. For example, a mine cart chase might have few (if any) branches, while a sewer chase might have several.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0d9b7b0c-4d23-48e4-9154-59ef165e3659">During a chase, it’s possible for the pursuers to become the quarry. For example, characters chasing a thief through a marketplace might draw unwanted attention from other members of the thieves’ guild. As they pursue the fleeing thief, they must also evade the thieves pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, the fleeing thief might run into the waiting arms of his accomplices. The outnumbered characters might decide to flee with the thieves in pursuit.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0cd70308-0abc-4f48-be42-11ffc07ede2c">Siege weapons are designed to assail castles and other walled fortifications. They see much use in campaigns that feature war. Most siege weapons don’t move around a battlefield on their own; they require creatures to move them, as well as to load, aim, and fire them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="12bebc4d-e899-4d72-aa8c-5c53e1be91c8">A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/1-tooltip">blinded</a> until its sight is restored by magic such as <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2164-lesser-restoration" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2164-tooltip">lesser restoration</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2139-heal" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2139-tooltip">heal</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7b762d36-40d3-47bd-adbc-09ededafbe27">Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1e4bf656-172e-4b14-8f60-2a922cd1dfb6">Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3af6bd0e-4f40-434f-97b0-a308969a1673">Poisons come in the following four types.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="637ecc2e-e2c5-48ac-9f83-1a35b22cf685"><strong>Contact.</strong> Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d47c30a4-0fe6-47da-a89c-e30678401584"><strong>Ingested.</strong> A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a3a00a7c-ef6f-4662-b959-23e1b24af052"><strong>Inhaled.</strong> These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3e82b4ef-d9e2-4370-8c86-839ce9da3306"><strong>Injury.</strong> Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="862ead57-1e3c-4899-aed5-e0cb4474c35c">Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind.

<p data-content-chunk-id="47574560-b16c-4860-a61c-7e2c0f9e0488">Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.

<p data-content-chunk-id="a0f58039-194c-4fbc-9a04-35be8c4d280d">Experience points (XP) fuel level advancement for player characters and are most often the reward for completing combat encounters.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0d16bb1f-59f2-405a-b7c3-7581444b61ea">Each monster has an XP value based on its challenge rating. When adventurers defeat one or more monsters — typically by killing, routing, or capturing them — they divide the total XP value of the monsters evenly among themselves. If the party received substantial assistance from one or more NPCs, count those NPCs as party members when dividing up the XP. (Because the NPCs made the fight easier, individual characters receive fewer XP.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="34846a4e-541d-4787-a922-9d282354dd08">Chapter 3, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="b76c2918-ad3c-4f0e-af24-929f3d6f0a34">Creating Adventures</a>" provides guidelines for designing combat encounters using experience points.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="39dd42c5-60b9-4510-945f-e1b0530834d5">Typically, adventurers earn experience only for encounters they participate in. If a player is absent for a session, the player’s character misses out on the experience points.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="102de8e0-981c-463a-807b-b51ce43d6df7">Over time, you might end up with a level gap between the characters of players who never miss a session and characters belonging to players who are more sporadic in their attendance. Nothing is wrong with that. A gap of two or three levels between different characters in the same party isn’t going to ruin the game for anyone. Some DMs treat XP as a reward for participating in the game, and keeping up with the rest of the party is good incentive for players to attend as many sessions as possible.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c2e35d81-7990-40db-9ac2-b2cc652aba0f">As an alternative, give absent characters the same XP that the other characters earned each session, keeping the group at the same level. Few players will intentionally miss out on the fun of gaming just because they know they’ll receive XP for it even if they don’t show up.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8521370a-9c1e-4420-b009-1dc4e0d1c0f4">You decide whether to award experience to characters for overcoming challenges outside combat. If the adventurers complete a tense negotiation with a baron, forge a trade agreement with a clan of surly dwarves, or successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom, you might decide that they deserve an XP reward.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="66cb9044-73e1-4d56-ae8d-4d25b078ec2a">As a starting point, use the rules for building combat encounters in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures#CreatingaCombatEncounter" data-content-chunk-id="c53477a6-cef0-4c8f-93dd-ce0303086adb">chapter 3</a> to gauge the difficulty of the challenge.

<p data-content-chunk-id="dc8d4a11-c95a-4f6a-8c03-813f314709d0">You can also award XP when characters complete significant milestones. When preparing your adventure, designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as with the following examples:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="1bf73b41-094f-477f-968f-59ba5459c5eb">
<li data-content-chunk-id="74e2b00d-78e6-45fa-9026-c35fbeae8ec5">Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to complete the adventure.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="73f0226f-c851-4be3-8102-9defdcc073e2">Discovering a hidden location or piece of information relevant to the adventure.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="c07a7048-bf3e-4be5-9bb2-ab744df80b8d">Reaching an important destination.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e9d68d40-0cd6-4d65-a992-a640ef63bc57">When awarding XP, treat a major milestone as a hard encounter and a minor milestone as an easy encounter.</p>

<ul data-content-chunk-id="a4dfbef0-96c2-4406-9e77-d18b85331267">
<li data-content-chunk-id="0dee4f6b-d3e4-4717-8e4d-2d766b47cc05">The adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="9f960de6-97c1-4719-8261-5abd28e60d06">You can do away with experience points entirely and control the rate of character advancement. Advance characters based on how many sessions they play, or when they accomplish significant story goals in the campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their characters gain a level.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8e6e1da1-a908-460c-98bb-a72715a6b633">This method of level advancement can be particularly helpful if your campaign doesn’t include much combat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP becomes tiresome.</p>
<h4 id="SessionBasedAdvancement" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="25d87abb-5eef-431c-8109-d7cba2ef710e"><a href="#SessionBasedAdvancement" data-content-chunk-id="a8bf5b87-f37c-4839-ad6c-47055265c849"></a>Session-Based Advancement</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2c375f71-b0c4-4b3c-a085-fcf8bdb48a5c">A good rate of session-based advancement is to have characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play, 3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two more sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for each subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard rate of advancement, assuming sessions are about four hours long.</p>

You can let your imagination run wild. This chapter contains optional rules that you can use to customize your campaign, as well as guidelines on creating your own material, such as monsters and magic items.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1c1d8394-1479-4687-bdfe-5862fc36667f">The options in this chapter relate to many different parts of the game. Some of them are variants of rules, and others are entirely new rules. Each option represents a different genre, style of play, or both. Consider trying no more than one or two of the options at a time so that you can clearly assess their effects on your campaign before adding other options.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da346b72-4c08-4114-8bb4-0bb0df374342">Before you add a new rule to your campaign, ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="6891588a-ab74-4cb4-91ff-51b21ca1b9d9">
<li data-content-chunk-id="c6aec23e-656f-4b4b-b9e5-6d72caef2765">Will the rule improve the game?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a8910e28-4b92-4e8a-885b-7248b1ed689d">Will my players like it?</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="55ab2c5c-d236-4839-862d-1c4dfdfffb9e">If you’re confident that the answer to both questions is yes, then you have nothing to lose by giving it a try. Urge your players to provide feedback. If the rule or game element isn’t functioning as intended or isn’t adding much to your game, you can refine it or ditch it. No matter what a rule’s source, a rule serves you, not the other way around.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a23826d4-0479-46ad-9be4-146660f93386">Beware of adding anything to your game that allows a character to concentrate on more than one effect at a time, use more than one reaction or bonus action per round, or attune to more than three magic items at a time. Rules and game elements that override the rules for concentration, reactions, bonus actions, and magic item attunement can seriously unbalance or overcomplicate your game.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3def9f9b-b82b-4f21-9180-f4c963f7c2be">This optional rule replaces a character’s proficiency bonus with a proficiency die, adding more randomness to the game and making proficiency a less reliable indicator of mastery.

The Proficiency Die table shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by the character’s level.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="20bf722e-4509-444f-a83d-c2200ceccff8">Whenever a feature, such as the rogue’s Expertise, lets a character double his or her proficiency bonus, the player rolls the character’s proficiency die twice instead of once.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5e59a74f-edfb-4b0f-8723-3f5d02fe6abc">This option is intended for player characters and nonplayer characters who have levels, as opposed to monsters who don’t.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="58af947c-f725-4103-9511-58c1d802ab00">A skill dictates the circumstances under which a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to an ability check. Skills define those circumstances by referring to different aspects of the six ability scores. For example, <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/3-tooltip">Acrobatics</a> and <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/5-tooltip">Stealth</a> are two different aspects of Dexterity, and a character can specialize in either or both.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8b8d30bd-eb65-464f-976a-a2a19e5011a9">You can dispense with skills and use one of the following variants. Choose whichever one best suits your campaign.</p>
<h4 id="AbilityCheckProficiency" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c589ce8f-fbb3-4cd1-b48e-9dc2587c1c84"><a href="#AbilityCheckProficiency" data-content-chunk-id="c68ca7c3-c18f-440b-bfab-b9ab24d3bdc3"></a>Ability Check Proficiency</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="863c3a30-3200-46c9-a24e-c3fd332cab44">With this variant rule, characters don’t have skill proficiencies. Instead, each character has proficiency in two abilities: one tied to the character’s class and one tied to the character’s background. The Ability Proficiencies by Class table suggests a proficiency for each class, and you choose which ability is tied to a given background. Starting at 1st level, a character adds his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check tied to one or the other of these two abilities.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="12b7189b-75e9-4a10-89c9-913522a70f1d">The Expertise feature works differently than normal under this rule. At 1st level, instead of choosing two skill proficiencies, a character with the Expertise class feature chooses one of the abilities in which he or she has proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two of the character’s Expertise choices. If the character would gain an additional skill proficiency, that character instead selects another ability check in which to gain proficiency.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37c7f0d2-f487-4d54-82dc-13129fce8c05">This option removes skills from the game and doesn’t allow for much distinction among characters. For example, a character can’t choose to emphasize persuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally adept at both.</p>
<h4 id="BackgroundProficiency" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="0311e315-c3a6-4a50-8974-dffcc84588d1"><a href="#BackgroundProficiency" data-content-chunk-id="7312465c-4a5e-4f63-afb7-cfda3f411cf0"></a>Background Proficiency</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="26251d48-2bd5-4703-afa9-6dd50be6dcb2">With this variant rule, characters don’t have skill or tool proficiencies. Anything that would grant the character a skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check to which the character’s prior training and experience (reflected in the character’s background) reasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of whether the character’s background applies.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="88d3cc52-5a36-4e3f-9aa3-675352e9cabc">For example, the player of a character with the noble background could reasonably argue that the proficiency bonus should apply to a Charisma check the character makes to secure an audience with the king. The player should be encouraged to explain in specific terms how the character’s background applies. Not simply “I’m a noble,” but “I spent three years before starting my adventuring career serving as my family’s ambassador to the court, and this sort of thing is second nature to me now.”</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="030c018f-cc3b-44d5-ab5b-e9c470b34049">This simple system relies heavily on players developing their characters’ histories. Don’t let it result in endless debates about whether a character’s proficiency bonus applies in a given situation. Unless a player’s attempt to explain the relevance of the character’s background makes everyone else at the table roll their eyes at its absurdity, go ahead and reward the player for making the effort.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b334c015-1d1f-4480-9a09-b668b886950a">If a character has the Expertise feature, instead of choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of that feature, the player defines aspects of his or her background to which the benefit applies. Continuing the noble example, the player might decide to apply Expertise to “situations where courtly manners and etiquette are paramount” and “figuring out the secret plots that court members hatch against one another.”</p>
<h4 id="PersonalityTraitProficiency" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="a953b643-c41d-4862-ab7e-c48b40327c83"><a href="#PersonalityTraitProficiency" data-content-chunk-id="f922e493-8603-4084-9409-c6eab2b38f03"></a>Personality Trait Proficiency</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6c423ffd-8916-41ad-9282-1db17ddffeee">With this variant rule, characters don’t have skill proficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to the character’s positive personality traits. For example, a character with a positive personality trait of “I never have a plan, but I’m great at making things up as I go along” might apply the bonus when engaging in some off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player should come up with at least four positive personality traits when creating a character.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="251c866d-5f3d-4f59-8b1a-e1b59af71568">When a character’s negative personality trait directly impacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage on the check. For example, a hermit whose negative trait is “I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, oblivious to my surroundings” might have disadvantage on an ability check made to notice creatures sneaking up.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f6c98cd5-5693-43e8-b1fd-212376fd5e4d">If a character has the Expertise feature, the player can apply its benefit to personality traits related to ability checks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead gains a new positive personality trait.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e2a6f4b0-e41f-4fa8-9801-25b616b5259e">This system relies heavily on players developing their characters’ personalities. Make sure that different characters’ traits — positive and negative—come into play with about the same frequency. Don’t let a player get away with a positive trait that always seems to apply and a negative trait that never does.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d84cd407-4a15-46df-b4f6-d2e0eb4d8325">At your discretion, you can also tie a character’s ideals, bonds, and flaws to this system.</p>
<h3 id="HeroPoints" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="b509cbe0-1818-488a-a40a-64e45e7ad8b4"><a href="#HeroPoints" data-content-chunk-id="608714c9-4b56-40ae-b260-00ff1d5bf496"></a>Hero Points</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1c8693f2-90fe-4271-abd2-be30bf83c8d9">Hero points work well in epic fantasy and mythic campaigns in which the characters are meant to be more like superheroes than the average adventurer is.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="07601fa4-7afb-4771-89a6-36e5b8f2f4f9">With this option, a character starts with 5 hero points at 1st level. Each time the character gains a level, he or she loses any unspent hero points and gains a new total equal to 5 + half the character’s level.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f99a554b-32e5-4248-be16-6136a6bddf8b">A player can spend a hero point whenever he or she makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. The player can spend the hero point after the roll is made but before any of its results are applied. Spending the hero point allows the player to roll a d6 and add it to the d20, possibly turning a failure into a success. A player can spend only 1 hero point per roll.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="725d54f8-1626-410f-9c30-feddfe50e339">In addition, whenever a character fails a death saving throw, the player can spend one hero point to turn the failure into a success.</p>
<h3 id="NewAbilityScoresHonorandSanity" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="e453dc41-fd77-412b-8bf2-ae0cc84c8f33"><a href="#NewAbilityScoresHonorandSanity" data-content-chunk-id="ad67d9c9-ac9e-4909-8889-29f9027e43fa"></a>New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2bbcfe36-d845-422e-9866-b6a58412dc79">If you’re running a campaign shaped by a strict code of honor or cosmic horror, consider adding one or both these new ability scores: Honor and Sanity. These abilities function like the standard six abilities, with exceptions specified in each ability below.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5a4cfb4d-3219-4698-b2ff-3cff6aa6ff72">Here’s how to incorporate these optional abilities at character creation:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="c0a84e9f-64aa-4baa-b39a-0b9c1b70458c">
<li data-content-chunk-id="e2c03aeb-408c-4c6e-88a3-53d7edbe5430">If your players use the standard array of ability scores, add one 11 to the array for each optional ability you add.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="6305bbdb-203b-44e1-a996-e355c7efc328">If your players use the optional point-buy system, add 3 points to the number of points for each optional ability you add.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="5d9aafa8-db9a-44d1-b2a7-1e01f3fb26f2">If your players roll their ability scores, have them roll for the added ability scores.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c092bc15-523d-4b50-87cd-6b8778dca797">If you ever need to make a check or saving throw for Honor or Sanity for a monster that lacks the score, you can use Charisma for Honor and Wisdom for Sanity.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="49323a2e-4e7c-4da3-bacd-05e2c228fc27">If your campaign involves cultures where a rigid code of honor is part of daily life, consider using the Honor score as a means of measuring a character’s devotion to that code. The Honor ability is useful in any campaign that revolves around orders of knights or other warriors who adhere to a formal code.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8afea0b6-0d63-4bfc-bc7e-7435fafe6624">Honor measures not only a character’s devotion to a code but also the character’s understanding of it. The Honor score can also reflect how others perceive a character’s honor. A character with a high Honor usually has a reputation that others know about, especially those who have high Honor scores themselves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8a43875b-a80b-4fe6-b42a-d480eadfb5bb">Unlike other abilities, Honor can’t be raised with normal ability score increases. Instead, you can award increases to Honor—or impose reductions—based on a character’s actions. At the end of an adventure, if you think a character’s actions in the adventure reflected well or poorly on his or her understanding of the code, you can increase or decrease the character’s Honor by 1. As with other ability scores, a character’s Honor can’t exceed 20 or fall below 1.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef5658fb-b02f-48e3-a338-c07be0b6c034"><strong><em>Honor Checks.</em></strong> Honor checks can be used in social situations, much as Charisma would, when a character’s understanding of a code of conduct is the most defining factor in the way a social interaction will play out.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a41b9886-8eaf-446e-a015-5787652ca214">You might also call for an Honor check when a character is in one of the following situations:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="d44754e3-b725-4110-9eca-41d754966015">
<li data-content-chunk-id="0fef29eb-8de4-4b66-b361-20e1bab26d13">Being unsure how to act with honor</li>

</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="03ddfb1e-5d4e-4c79-8f63-316c9c0ee2c2"><strong><em>Honor Saving Throws.</em></strong> An Honor saving throw comes into play when you want to determine whether a character might inadvertently do something dishonorable. You might call for an Honor saving throw in the following situations:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="3f829c13-0a11-42d0-8640-d1bc1455ff65">

<p data-content-chunk-id="e5ccffb0-c307-4d20-a63e-d2858f480d6f">Consider using the Sanity score if your campaign revolves around entities of an utterly alien and unspeakable nature, such as Great Cthulhu, whose powers and minions can shatter a character’s mind.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d970546-fb0b-41cb-867e-8bb0f6a90dec">A character with a high Sanity is level-headed even in the face of bizarre circumstances, while a character with low Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted by eldritch horrors that are beyond normal reason.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="41aa8704-5636-4790-aee4-a2feab59d1c9"><strong><em>Sanity Checks.</em></strong> You might ask characters to make a Sanity check in place of an Intelligence check to recall lore about alien creatures featured in your campaign, to decipher the incomprehensible scrawlings of witnesses, or to learn spells from tomes of forbidden lore. You might also call for a Sanity check when a character tries one of the following activities:</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="43448f1e-40d5-49e4-b0bc-a07b0deb3ca9">Horror involves more than simple fright. It entails revulsion and anguish. Often it arises when adventurers see something completely contrary to the common understanding of what can and should occur in the world, or upon the realization of a dreadful truth.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="130c7d62-291a-4fa1-a87b-8ccf97998172">In such a situation, you can call on characters to make a Charisma saving throw to resist the horror. Set the DC based on the magnitude of the horrific circumstances. On a failed save, a character gains a short-term or long-term form of madness that you choose or determine randomly, as detailed in chapter 8, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Madness" data-content-chunk-id="2b98a57d-4124-4ad5-8fad-58016936bdc1">Running the Game</a>.”</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="ebc38426-6b39-49b3-a7af-988e41e7f9e3">These optional rules make it easier or harder for adventurers to recover from injury, either increasing or reducing the amount of time your players can spend adventuring before rest is required.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7c3c9f58-9972-472b-99d7-da382b9f5a36">This optional rule allows characters to heal up in the thick of combat and works well for parties that feature few or no characters with healing magic, or for campaigns in which magical healing is rare.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ff536223-543c-4dac-8b18-f223d0d1d4a0">As an action, a character can use a healing surge and spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e36c3075-9bed-42aa-9b3e-d0b71e51e14f">A character who uses a healing surge can’t do so again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c0597008-b114-4b29-97f0-e5f1de861ed3">Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level divided by four (minimum of one die).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8b53b085-e327-412b-bf2f-fabead8ccf98">For a more superheroic feel, you can let a character use a healing surge as a bonus action, rather than as an action.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7155047a-8863-4313-a815-bb9e7a631dec">Characters don’t regain hit points at the end of a long rest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at the end of a long rest, just as with a short rest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3695d786-ee14-439b-b7d7-cc8d9c0fba47">This optional rule prolongs the amount of time that characters need to recover from their wounds without the benefits of magical healing and works well for grittier, more realistic campaigns.</p>
<h3 id="RestVariants" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="ccb78ee6-e29b-493a-9d45-4904597ca12d"><a href="#RestVariants" data-content-chunk-id="c9f079e9-397f-4ccf-8fb1-62a3667f75d4"></a>Rest Variants</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3b654ae0-2309-464a-abf2-3ace844442dc">The rules for short and long rests presented in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring" data-content-chunk-id="a8c12fb6-c004-43db-86db-572e7b757fda">chapter 8</a> of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="c5cc635f-2d55-4cbe-9722-7490f3456263">Player’s Handbook</a> work well for a heroic-style campaign. Characters can go toe-to-toe with deadly foes, take damage to within an inch of their lives, yet still be ready to fight again the next day. If this approach doesn’t fit your campaign, consider the following variants.</p>
<h4 id="EpicHeroism" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="b57c3f4a-5acb-48a1-b0bc-68da395e657f"><a href="#EpicHeroism" data-content-chunk-id="2728b469-5a65-44d4-becb-e3a7268ae9d0"></a>Epic Heroism</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5a67a8e0-c3ea-4da5-8e7a-41769f8ddfa7">This variant uses a short rest of 5 minutes and a long rest of 1 hour. This change makes combat more routine, since characters can easily recover from every battle. You might want to make combat encounters more difficult to compensate.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="88bb4fae-dec2-4e86-82b4-ed456d55d2c0">Spellcasters using this system can afford to burn through spell slots quickly, especially at higher levels. Consider allowing spellcasters to restore expended spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots (rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to limit spell slots restored to 5th level or lower. Only a full 8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to restore all spell slots and to regain spell slots of 6th level or higher.</p>
<h4 id="GrittyRealism" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="0371fe0e-ad18-4da6-af13-482e2e4a6525"><a href="#GrittyRealism" data-content-chunk-id="46ff9403-9a48-462d-adfe-cfe0222f4406"></a>Gritty Realism</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d95a577d-16cf-43da-9dbd-3508485db35e">This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits and drawbacks of combat. Characters can’t afford to engage in too many battles in a row, and all adventuring requires careful planning.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="449a3095-c26c-4173-80d1-8f53101b1906">This approach encourages the characters to spend time out of the dungeon. It’s a good option for campaigns that emphasize intrigue, politics, and interactions among other NPCs, and in which combat is rare or something to be avoided rather than rushed into.</p>
<h3 id="Firearms" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="fa7ef837-f8db-43cb-a836-6b20c0d0416e"><a href="#Firearms" data-content-chunk-id="a1e5a081-d103-4650-b021-223b54b8f5ba"></a>Firearms</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="6e684fba-5f0e-49ce-934b-9815e8aad5c9">If you want to model the swashbuckling style of <em>The Three Musketeers</em> and similar tales, you can introduce gunpowder weapons to your campaign that are associated with the Renaissance. Similarly, in a campaign where a spaceship has crashed or elements of modern-day Earth are present, futuristic or modern firearms might appear. The Firearms table provides examples of firearms from all three of those periods. The modern and futuristic items are priceless.</p>
<h4 id="Proficiency" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="e7892bb4-1a10-4542-875d-91147b7c72a4"><a href="#Proficiency" data-content-chunk-id="4453154b-8cd2-4db1-b2d2-cde18642b81b"></a>Proficiency</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bbd4b0ec-f401-4c75-8335-a36a1d517113">It’s up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&amp;D worlds wouldn’t have such proficiency. During their downtime, characters can use the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/adventuring#Training" data-content-chunk-id="6b957ae6-86b3-400a-8828-f2a0d42838f7">training rules</a> in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="18151a0a-d8d0-47b7-8b78-9f64f0c27f40">Player’s Handbook</a> to acquire proficiency, assuming that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons working while mastering their use.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f418f82c-d798-40d1-95a7-58f01a3feec8">Firearms use special ammunition, and some of them have the burst fire or reload property.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="426b48ec-e352-488a-b96b-4910991a818d"><strong><em>Ammunition.</em></strong> The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Renaissance and modern firearms use bullets. Futuristic firearms are powered by a special type of ammunition called energy cells. An energy cell contains enough power for all the shots its firearm can make.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a6a41ad9-1710-456a-aace-04992c7ba1d5"><strong><em>Burst Fire.</em></strong> A weapon that has the burst fire property can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot-cube area within normal range with shots. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon’s normal damage. This action uses ten pieces of ammunition.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f931c0f9-e32c-49f1-b1f5-ddcacb92c47e"><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character’s choice).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f632d856-d943-4f26-8066-a3838326743c">Setting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause it to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it (3d6 for a powder horn, 7d6 for a keg).

<p data-content-chunk-id="3f2635dc-7947-401a-b3e8-0316a25b729f">Plot points allow players to change the course of the campaign, introduce plot complications, alter the world, and even assume the role of the DM. If your first reaction to reading this optional rule is to worry that your players might abuse it, it’s probably not for you.</p>
<h4 id="UsingPlotPoints" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="ac27e747-0133-4a09-b9c5-f3e3572cf0b4"><a href="#UsingPlotPoints" data-content-chunk-id="7513a38c-d9fa-4f1e-8be8-6b36a5a47e37"></a>Using Plot Points</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c148216f-26f3-446d-9647-3542f52c5000">Each player starts with 1 plot point. During a session, a player can spend that point for one effect. The effect depends on your group’s approach to this optional rule. Three options are presented below.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c5cfd5da-1350-44a0-a338-c68a9211aab5">A player can spend no more than 1 plot point per session. You can increase this limit if you like, especially if you want the players to drive more of the story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot point, they each gain 1 plot point.</p>
<h4 id="Option1WhataTwist" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="7557a02b-ee4b-4e90-9ba1-1171bec011e0"><a href="#Option1WhataTwist" data-content-chunk-id="f21ce503-3f97-4346-8009-1c5b9e52d693"></a>Option 1: What a Twist!</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="226d494a-96a4-4c2e-8ec0-faddce43bb25">A player who spends a plot point gets to add some element to the setting or situation that the group (including you) must accept as true. For example, a player can spend a plot point and state that his or her character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or a monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed into a horrid beast.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4da5f61a-d5d3-4f9c-9319-d7911db4277b">A player who wants to spend a plot point in this way should take a minute to discuss his or her idea with everyone else at the table and get feedback before settling on a plot development.</p>
<h4 id="Option2ThePlotThickens" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="e4a76a41-79e1-4236-b1a5-19c55d9d18e0"><a href="#Option2ThePlotThickens" data-content-chunk-id="1ce0e6d7-3dfc-4760-9eab-6f24ceb39887"></a>Option 2: The Plot Thickens</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d7166d77-ca69-40ba-bab8-c790f5985a8d">Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to his or her right must add a complication to the scene. For example, if the player who spends the plot point decides that her character has found a secret door, the player to the right might state that opening the door triggers a magical trap that teleports the party to another part of the dungeon.</p>
<h4 id="Option3TheGodsMustBeCrazy" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="525cac81-efa7-41ed-92bd-0cb3f40f187e"><a href="#Option3TheGodsMustBeCrazy" data-content-chunk-id="1dbb3659-92ec-41bb-ab54-76aa120a2d98"></a>Option 3: The Gods Must Be Crazy</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="06526b1d-bdc4-4abe-b0dc-d8c144276007">With this approach, there is no permanent DM. Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as the DM and runs the game as normal. That person’s character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the group or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="54c483f9-0d1e-4d31-b22e-60fc954f535c">At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become the DM. That player’s character becomes an NPC, and play continues. It’s probably not a good idea to swap roles in the middle of combat, but it can happen if your group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or her role and pick up where the previous DM left off.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="82c3a3db-821c-4073-9788-958a08bb0f39">Using plot points in this way can make for an exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in unexpected directions. This approach is also a great way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small, controlled doses.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a3dee7c8-63da-46b1-9b6f-acc155f1c764">In a campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone should come to the table with a bit of material prepared or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn’t prepared or who doesn’t feel like DMing can choose to not spend a plot point that session.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="44a95fd4-59cb-41d3-9cb1-1567ff378873">For this approach to work, it’s a good idea to establish some shared assumptions about the campaign so that DMs aren’t duplicating efforts or trampling on each other’s plans.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="23c523d2-6544-4659-9a50-5fe18af50faf">The options in this section provide alternative ways to handle combat. The main risk of adding some of these rules is slowing down play.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="958318fc-fbca-450d-8c94-07cf41854d96">This section offers different ways to handle initiative.</p>
<h4 id="InitiativeScore" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="e81f7a66-4102-4d8d-a9d2-14e11cdaa6ce"><a href="#InitiativeScore" data-content-chunk-id="0fe5fc53-9e05-40ba-bcaf-20a0dfc6777f"></a>Initiative Score</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d93ddf2-7b7b-4497-956f-4250748cbb4a">With this optional rule, creature don’t roll initiative at the start of combat. Instead, each creature has an initiative score, which is a passive Dexterity check: 10 + Dexterity modifier.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="880fb058-8760-4ea5-b5bd-7b652f4c2e2a">By cutting down on die rolls, math done on the fly, and the process of asking for and recording totals, you can speed your game up considerably—at the cost of an initiative order that is often predictable.</p>
<h4 id="SideInitiative" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c9d31c07-5a67-4f7b-94b9-b1b7c2f78de8"><a href="#SideInitiative" data-content-chunk-id="81b9c8b4-4591-49cd-ac4c-138c975033fd"></a>Side Initiative</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1403f20f-1747-488b-99e8-29d00fd81c6f">Recording initiative for each PC and monster, arranging everyone in the correct order, and remembering where you are in the list can bog the game down. If you want quicker combats, at the risk of those combats becoming unbalanced, try using the side initiative rule.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3f2fd2ec-75d3-4123-8ab2-3720cee23292">Under this variant, the players roll a d20 for their initiative as a group, or side. You also roll a d20. Neither roll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins initiative. In case of a tie, keep rerolling until the tie is broken.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b042c1ca-416f-49dd-a2ac-0c66f2f6236a">When it’s a side’s turn, the members of that side can act in any order they choose. Once everyone on the side has taken a turn, the other side goes. A round ends when both sides have completed their turns.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="923a5a0f-fd49-465e-9443-9ddf0ea5588b">If more than two sides take part in a battle, each side rolls for initiative. Sides act from the highest roll to lowest. Combat continues in the initiative order until the battle is complete.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7014ae40-d22d-402a-a90f-d744bfcda6f1">This variant encourages teamwork and makes your life as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate monsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative can gang up on enemies and take them out before they have a chance to act.</p>
<h4 id="SpeedFactor" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="960a5a2f-f472-4db5-af08-5f53885d176a"><a href="#SpeedFactor" data-content-chunk-id="11fed219-df34-4b99-9b94-881255ddb449"></a>Speed Factor</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a1f0839-0914-49d7-b7d8-8e0e1dec3eeb">Some DMs find the regular progression of initiative too predictable and prone to abuse. Players can use their knowledge of the initiative order to influence their decisions. For example, a badly wounded fighter might charge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes before the monster and can heal him.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a07aec5f-ae1f-46a9-b976-03f99cbe51fc">Speed factor is an option for initiative that introduces more uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of play. Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll initiative each round. Before rolling, each character or monster must choose an action.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c3dac22b-5e8d-4c4e-b20d-79a51a08409a"><strong><em>Initiative Modifiers.</em></strong> Modifiers might apply to a creature’s initiative depending on its size and the action it takes. For example, a creature that fights with a light weapon or casts a simple spell is more likely to act before a creature armed with a heavy or slow weapon. See the Speed Factor Initiative Modifiers table for details. If an action has no modifier listed, the action has no effect on initiative. If more than one modifier applies (such as wielding a two-handed, heavy melee weapon), apply them all to the initiative roll.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="41ceb263-b5ce-44ae-b97c-4725c7d5f7a8">Don’t apply the same modifier more than once on a creature’s turn. For example, a rogue fighting with two daggers gains the +2 bonus for using a light or finesse weapon only once. In the case of spellcasting, apply only the modifier from the highest-level spell.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="74f9ac61-c156-49b6-8add-7426fc20211d">Apply any modifiers for bonus actions to that creature’s turn, remembering never to apply the same modifier twice. For instance, a paladin casts a 2nd-level spell as a bonus action and then attacks with a shortsword. The paladin takes a -2 penalty for the spell and gains a +2 bonus for using a light weapon, for a total modifier of +0.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3cb57c50-e292-4d58-8fb8-33db75dc0b33">The table is only a starting point. You can refer to it when adjudicating any actions a character takes that you think should be faster or slower. Quick, easy actions should grant a bonus, while slow, difficult ones should incur a penalty. As a rule of thumb, apply a bonus or penalty of 2 or 5 for an action.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="09a9dd9d-097e-4b46-be0f-ca4cdf38dd14">For example, a fighter wants to turn a winch to raise a portcullis. This is a complex, difficult action. You could rule that it incurs a -5 initiative penalty.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c0996eaa-0c01-4ccc-bf5d-f9c22e582d00"><strong><em>Rolling Initiative.</em></strong> After deciding on an action, everyone rolls initiative and applies modifiers, keeping the result secret. You then announce an initiative number, starting with 30 and working down (it helps to call out ranges of numbers at the start). Break any ties by having the combatant with the highest Dexterity act first. Otherwise, roll to determine who goes first.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="33971e4f-b0cf-4ea6-97b6-c59622a1fbba"><strong><em>Turns.</em></strong> On its turn, a creature moves as normal but must take the action it selected or take no action at all.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8df790aa-8c36-4b3c-8ada-999be9cc37cf">Once everyone has acted, the process repeats. Everyone in the battle selects an action, rolls initiative, and takes turns in order.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="92481fc1-483c-4d28-9319-f248bedd20a2">If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A Small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8e21dbe1-df2a-411b-ae1b-27109b63283a">As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/2-tooltip">Athletics</a>) or Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/3-tooltip">Acrobatics</a>) check contested by the target’s Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/3-tooltip">Acrobatics</a>) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature’s space and clings to its body. While in the target’s space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a5f92ef8-054a-47c1-b8c7-b6e7bd7ec53b">The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature’s space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature’s ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature’s location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/2-tooltip">Athletics</a>) check contested by the smaller creature’s Strength (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/2-tooltip">Athletics</a>) or Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/3-tooltip">Acrobatics</a>) check.

<p data-content-chunk-id="715b3a83-9464-4e7b-b1c8-fb16153c1460">A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target’s grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target’s Strength (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/2-tooltip">Athletics</a>) check or Dexterity (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/3-tooltip">Acrobatics</a>) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d9673d11-06a3-4d7d-b38e-a2460af2d043">The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="be5ed302-0f08-4841-a400-fe0e6c6b2a35">When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker’s next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn’t expend the attacker’s reaction, but the attacker can’t make the attack if anything, such as the <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/7-tooltip">incapacitated</a> condition or the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2250-shocking-grasp" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2250-tooltip">shocking grasp</a> spell, is preventing it from taking reactions.

The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it.

<p data-content-chunk-id="89aff426-ac11-4aae-8171-a6579a19abdd">The <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="04d6f5d3-aa67-4328-adf3-91c612acc5e7">Monster Manual</a> contains hundreds of ready-to-play monsters, but it doesn’t include every monster that you can imagine. Part of the D&amp;D experience is the simple joy of creating new monsters and customizing existing ones, if for no other reason than to surprise and delight your players with something they’ve never faced before.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="37c83df5-35ad-466a-adbc-c6a41cfaf4c9">The first step in the process is coming up with the concept for your monster. What makes it unique? Where does it live? What role do you want it to serve in your adventure, your campaign, or your world? What does it look like? Does it have any weird abilities? Once you have the answers to these questions, you can start figuring out how to represent your monster in the game.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fbee01f4-090b-48e8-b524-18efe743a351">Once you have an idea for a monster, you’ll need statistics to represent it. The first question you should ask yourself is: Can I use statistics that already exist?</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8d3679c2-4b6d-4887-b082-04ad647f952b">A stat block in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="c91e1395-9e2f-4de0-8817-3ac23634285a">Monster Manual</a> might make a good starting point for your monster. Imagine, for example, that you want to create an intelligent arboreal predator that hunts elves. There is no such monster in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="6e5c3c77-df14-4d6e-85e5-ff52615fa1ae">Monster Manual</a>, but the quaggoth is a humanoid predator with a climbing speed. You could borrow the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17193-quaggoth" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17193-tooltip">quaggoth</a> stat block for your new monster, changing nothing but the creature’s name. You can also make minor tweaks, such as replacing the quaggoth’s language, Undercommon, with one that’s more appropriate, such as Elvish or Sylvan.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3a434f92-de21-426f-823e-109893fb113a">Need a fiery phoenix? Take the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16881-giant-eagle" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16881-tooltip">giant eagle</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16998-roc" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16998-tooltip">roc</a>, give it immunity to fire, and allow it to deal fire damage with its attacks. Need a flying monkey? Consider a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16795-baboon" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16795-tooltip">baboon</a> with wings and a flying speed. Almost any monster you can imagine can be built using one that already exists.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="524e38df-d896-4451-aa9a-61c31ccb65e8">Adapting a stat block is far less time-consuming than creating one from scratch, and there are changes you can make to an existing monster that have no effect on its challenge rating, such as swapping languages, changing its alignment, or adding special senses. However, once you change the creature’s offensive or defensive ability, such as its hit points or damage, its challenge rating might need to change, as shown later.</p>
<h4 id="SwitchingWeapons" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="44c02dac-d4b5-4b38-bccf-a2b5d664e76f"><a href="#SwitchingWeapons" data-content-chunk-id="f68d0132-b6f7-40fe-9e1d-5487e7929d05"></a>Switching Weapons</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bebc0df4-0f9e-4549-a5eb-2d14c8c1343d">If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, you can replace that weapon with a different one. For example, you could replace a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16925-hobgoblin" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16925-tooltip">hobgoblin’s</a> longsword with a halberd. Don’t forget to change the damage and the attack’s reach where appropriate. Also be aware of the consequences of switching from a one-handed weapon to a two-handed weapon, or vice versa. For example, a hobgoblin wielding a halberd (a two-handed weapon) loses the benefit of its shield, so its AC decreases by 2.</p>
<h4 id="AddingaSpecialTrait" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="8812bdcd-cc3a-448b-9416-1b923fdd359d"><a href="#AddingaSpecialTrait" data-content-chunk-id="a964a6df-ac2d-4b2f-ad59-88d73292e5e8"></a>Adding a Special Trait</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="95822300-5b5d-42da-81e3-56b216bf4225">Another simple way to customize a monster is to add a special trait. You can add a special trait of your own devising or pick up a special trait from one of the many creatures in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="dc41ece1-7ae5-4011-9466-ef4d8ed98e6c">Monster Manual</a>. For example, you can create a goblin-spider hybrid by giving the normal <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16907-goblin" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16907-tooltip">goblin</a> the Spider Climb special trait, turn an ordinary <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17040-troll" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17040-tooltip">troll</a> into a two-headed troll by giving it the Two Heads special trait, or turn an <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16975-owlbear" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16975-tooltip">owlbear</a> into a flying owlbear by giving it wings and a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16889-giant-owl" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16889-tooltip">giant owl’s</a> flying speed.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="928d97fc-6428-41bc-9e18-4e8481964568">Pick the expected challenge rating (CR) for your monster. Knowing the monster’s expected challenge rating will help you figure out the monster’s proficiency bonus and other important combat statistics. Don’t worry about getting the challenge rating exactly right; you can make adjustments in later steps.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b1f4ef5c-18a2-45ae-aed9-e8625f0fd73e">A single monster with a challenge rating equal to the adventurers’ level is, by itself, a fair challenge for a group of four characters. If the monster is meant to be fought in pairs or groups, its expected challenge rating should be lower than the party’s level.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="395ae559-4c10-4c5e-9ea6-74a6e29c549c">Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that your monster must have a challenge rating equal to the level of the characters to be a worthy challenge. Keep in mind that monsters with a lower challenge rating can be a threat to higher-level characters when encountered in groups.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="772c1dd6-2927-4a30-bf00-1577748c80da">Use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine the monster’s Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus, and damage output per round based on the challenge rating you chose in step 1.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="5e275179-9c8d-45dc-a570-1d9cc5a3bf51">Raise or lower the monster’s Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus, damage output per round, and save DC as you see fit, based on whatever concept you have in mind for the monster. For example, if you need a well-armored monster, increase its Armor Class.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="38898a1b-756e-4769-947e-49f7e9379650">Once you’ve made the desired adjustments, record the monster’s statistics. If there are any other statistics you think the monster needs (such as ability scores), follow the appropriate steps under “<a href="#CreatingaMonsterStatBlock" data-content-chunk-id="1f5a3383-8ddd-437d-ad85-f8eaf0c99077">Creating a Monster Stat Block</a>.”</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="48668e66-e971-4056-86b2-d199ddabe667">Calculate the monster’s final challenge rating, accounting for the adjustments you made in step 3.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d7601709-026a-43c1-b1b4-b29a4461eed0"><strong><em>Defensive Challenge Rating.</em></strong> Read down the Hit Points column of the <a href="#MonsterStatisticsbyChallengeRating" data-content-chunk-id="690a5ef2-d272-445b-9033-c76519bfa821">Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating</a> table until you find your monster’s hit points. Then look across and note the challenge rating suggested for a monster with those hit points.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a91f258d-a727-4994-977e-8b9983813b5b">Now look at the Armor Class suggested for a monster of that challenge rating. If your monster’s AC is at least two points higher or lower than that number, adjust the challenge rating suggested by its hit points up or down by 1 for every 2 points of difference.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dd0af458-88cb-4105-91ed-85cbaff1ed58"><strong><em>Offensive Challenge Rating.</em></strong> Read down the Damage/Round column of the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table until you find your monster’s damage output per round. Then look across and note the challenge rating suggested for a monster that deals that much damage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="24be3ed3-f52f-419c-a1eb-5e50c2c683cd">Now look at the attack bonus suggested for a monster of that challenge rating. If your monster’s attack bonus is at least two points higher or lower than that number, adjust the challenge rating suggested by its damage output up or down by 1 for every 2 points of difference.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d6f61eef-1f54-4473-8d92-2426a28338d6">If the monster relies more on effects with saving throws than on attacks, use the monster’s save DC instead of its attack bonus.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f89f54e4-d3a9-4be6-ad94-bbc7b2e22b11">If your monster uses different attack bonuses or save DCs, use the ones that will come up the most often.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="40efd9d4-ad88-4c77-841c-39c3c12402b0"><strong><em>Average Challenge Rating.</em></strong> The monster’s final challenge rating is the average of its defensive and offensive challenge ratings. Round the average up or down to the nearest challenge rating to determine your monster’s final challenge rating. For example, if the creature’s defensive challenge rating is 2 and its offensive rating is 3, its final rating is 3.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b535e9ed-a5e3-484c-81cb-7490cece51c1">With the final challenge rating, you can determine the monster’s proficiency bonus using the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table. Use the Experience Points by Challenge Rating table to determine how much XP the monster is worth. A monster of challenge rating 0 is worth 0 XP if it poses no threat. Otherwise, it is worth 10 XP.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="00e32797-750a-4271-9f96-0464561e52cc">Creating a monster isn’t just a number-crunching exercise. The guidelines in this chapter can help you create monsters, but the only way to know whether a monster is fun is to playtest it. After seeing your monster in action, you might want to adjust the challenge rating up or down based on your experiences.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="1ec54328-313a-42bd-bb92-3fa92e83669f">Your monster might be based on a real-world creature or a monster from myth, in which case its name might be obvious. If you need to invent a name, keep in mind that the best names either reflect the monster’s appearance or nature (such as the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16957-mimic" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16957-tooltip">mimic</a> and the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16975-owlbear" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16975-tooltip">owlbear</a>) or have a nice ring to them (such as the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16824-chuul" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16824-tooltip">chuul</a> and the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17203-thri-kreen" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17203-tooltip">thri-kreen</a>).</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="a5afda17-a88a-4c8e-9ec5-98f7178056a0">Monsters, like player characters, have the six ability scores. A monster can’t have a score lower than 1 or higher than 30 in any ability.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e2153940-34a1-42a8-8ec0-4bbdf209b6ad">A monster’s score in any ability determines its ability modifier, as shown in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/step-by-step-characters#AbilityScoresandModifiers" data-content-chunk-id="bc653106-b8b7-4a45-97d7-2e232ebc55e9">Ability Scores and Modifiers</a> table in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="41d362f7-1664-434b-b5eb-2de52027cded">Player’s Handbook</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="43b145f7-9fe1-4bc9-abcb-a8d1edd9b749">If you can’t decide what a monster’s ability scores should be, look for comparable monsters in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="248abc90-364e-44e8-93f2-696a32b6468d">Monster Manual</a> and mimic their ability scores. For example, if your monster is roughly as smart as a human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoner</a>, give it an Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier).

<p data-content-chunk-id="b62ea01a-6bde-40e1-b343-c32218226d9e">A monster’s Armor Class has a direct bearing on its challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine your monster’s Armor Class in one of two ways.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="42eb6123-95cb-4c94-b7e1-3e9b779823d8"><strong><em>Use the Table.</em></strong> You can choose an appropriate AC based on the monster’s expected challenge rating, as shown in the <a href="#MonsterStatisticsbyChallengeRating" data-content-chunk-id="794157f4-23b6-4741-9a45-901dad713222">Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating</a> table. The table provides the baseline AC for a monster of a specific challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the AC as you see fit. For example, the baseline AC for a challenge rating 1 monster is 13, but if your monster is well armored, raise its AC accordingly. Don’t worry if the monster’s AC isn’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster’s challenge rating, as shown in later steps.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b156380a-bf40-4ac6-9c97-ef08f7dd4ae4"><strong><em>Determine an Appropriate AC.</em></strong> Alternatively, you can determine an appropriate AC based on the type of armor the monster wears, its natural armor, or some other Armor Class booster (such as the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2172-mage-armor" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2172-tooltip">mage armor</a> spell). Again, don’t worry if the monster’s AC isn’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="71c4611c-daea-4895-83e4-beb2ca29232b">If your monster wears manufactured armor, its Armor Class is based on the type of armor worn (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#ArmorandShields" data-content-chunk-id="e5ac8616-75cb-43db-b277-4dadc8137c2d">chapter 5</a> of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="de19c9ad-5d80-428b-b030-a9d943543ff0">Player’s Handbook</a> for armor types). If the monster carries a shield, apply the shield bonus to its AC as normal.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9ab76b07-2c89-41a3-b269-24ef9c030a86">A monster that doesn’t wear armor might have natural armor, in which case it has an AC equal to 10 + its Dexterity modifier + its natural armor bonus. A monster with a thick hide generally has a natural armor bonus of +1 to +3. The bonus can be higher if the creature is exceptionally well armored. A <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16908-gorgon" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16908-tooltip">gorgon</a>, for example, is covered in steely plates and has a natural armor bonus of +9.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="7440a9d7-fcb3-4854-b3a1-c94d2697e1e7">A monster’s hit points have a direct bearing on its challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine your monster’s hit points in one of two ways.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3219a55d-6750-45b3-a747-125ef4ade793"><strong><em>Use the Table.</em></strong> You can start with the monster’s expected challenge rating and use the <a href="#MonsterStatisticsbyChallengeRating" data-content-chunk-id="bc489044-2115-4a73-811b-a21679b7547e">Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating</a> table to determine an appropriate number of hit points. The table presents a range of hit points for each challenge rating.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="356925f0-d35c-49ec-bcc9-e61d37950ca0"><strong><em>Assign Hit Dice.</em></strong> Alternatively, you can assign a number of Hit Dice to a monster, then calculate its average hit points. Don’t worry if the hit points aren’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster’s challenge rating, as shown in later steps, and you can always adjust a monster’s Hit Dice and hit points later on.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c769a272-f5e5-48b9-964e-7be85e683afc">A monster can have as many Hit Dice as you want, but the size of the die used to calculate its hit points depends on the monster’s size, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table. For example, a Medium monster uses d8s for hit points, so a Medium monster with 5 Hit Dice and a Constitution of 13 (+1 modifier) has 5d8 + 5 hit points.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="44b7ccfe-17d1-4fc3-a8bd-78f7b5b22c34">A monster typically has average hit points based on its Hit Dice. For example, a creature with 5d8 + 5 hit points has an average of 27 hit points (5 × 4.5 + 5).</p>

Damage Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8b3cb1ee-d82f-4db1-b2b4-1a0ee20f1399">Decide whether your monster has vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to one or more types of damage (see the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#DamageTypes" data-content-chunk-id="da805a2b-a3ed-4d9b-88e2-1dcf45aab979">Combat</a> section of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="b3bfa2de-a535-4410-a644-957f6d9e9148">Player’s Handbook</a> for descriptions of the various damage types). Assign a vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to a monster only when it’s intuitive. For example, it makes sense for a monster made of molten lava to have immunity to fire damage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="312ff53a-9559-4638-984d-f47113726bab">Giving a monster resistances and immunities to three or more damage types (especially bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage) is like giving it extra hit points. However, adventurers have more resources at higher levels to counteract such defenses, making resistances and immunities less relevant at higher levels.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7b8ee67e-690e-4cc8-85b4-7c88fc645580"><strong><em>Effective Hit Points.</em></strong> If a monster has resistance or immunity to several damage types—especially bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons—and not all the characters in the party possess the means to counteract that resistance or immunity, you need to take these defenses into account when comparing your monster’s hit points to its expected challenge rating. Using the Effective Hit Points Based on Resistances and Immunities table, apply the appropriate multiplier to the monster’s hit points to determine its effective hit points for the purpose of gauging its final challenge rating. (The monster’s actual hit points shouldn’t change.)</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8ee07e7a-593f-470e-98d6-412ccbbff44d">For example, a monster with an expected challenge rating of 6, 150 hit points, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons effectively has 225 hit points (using the 1.5 multiplier for resistances) for the purpose of gauging its final challenge rating.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="026db5c0-97b2-474f-b0c7-d68216bd0ee2">Monsters don’t normally have vulnerability to more than one or two types of damage. Vulnerabilities don’t significantly affect a monster’s challenge rating, unless a monster has vulnerabilities to multiple damage types that are prevalent, especially bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. For such a strange monster, reduce its effective hit points by half. Or even better, eliminate the vulnerabilities and give the brittle monster fewer hit points.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="f0cbe698-27cf-4777-a7f8-f3081e623161">A monster’s attack bonuses have a direct bearing on its challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster’s attack bonuses in one of two ways.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="910cc833-6a67-449c-bb20-59980ccd2897"><strong><em>Use the Table.</em></strong> You can start with the monster’s expected challenge rating and use the <a href="#MonsterStatisticsbyChallengeRating" data-content-chunk-id="67aeb4c3-b607-44b7-9729-8f1cd34f1b93">Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating</a> table to determine an appropriate attack bonus for all the monster’s attacks, regardless of its ability scores.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="86890020-dfa8-4ba8-87ce-9d2385447a7e">The table provides the baseline attack bonus for each challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the attack bonus as you see fit to match whatever concept you have in mind. For example, the baseline attack bonus for a challenge rating 1 monster is +3, but if your monster needs more accuracy, raise its bonus accordingly. Don’t worry if the monster’s attack bonus isn’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster’s challenge rating, as shown in later steps.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="038419ac-c0be-4834-b13b-51f232de8317"><strong><em>Calculate Attack Bonuses.</em></strong> Alternatively, you can calculate a monster’s attack bonuses the same way players calculate the attack bonuses of a character.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e65fee8c-2531-4734-a4f9-5057e6c42601">When a monster has an action that requires an attack roll, its attack bonus is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Strength or Dexterity modifier. A monster usually applies its Strength modifier to melee attacks and its Dexterity modifier to ranged attacks, although smaller monsters sometimes use Dexterity for both.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="707ac697-9f03-4afa-b6f3-53d93efa5d45">Again, don’t worry if the attack bonuses aren’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. You can always adjust a monster’s attack bonuses later.</p>
<h4 id="Step11Damage" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="04a54538-6c93-4424-b6d4-08bfa1300649"><a href="#Step11Damage" data-content-chunk-id="eb7c9017-7161-4f45-8ebf-d1b01d625d4c"></a>Step 11. Damage</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8fda874c-e6ae-4699-bf36-aa32c309bc40">A monster’s damage output—the amount of damage it deals every round—has a direct bearing on its challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster’s damage output in one of two ways.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0c15a9da-12bd-46de-acb6-5d0123f601c0"><strong><em>Use the Table.</em></strong> You can start with the monster’s expected challenge rating and use the <a href="#MonsterStatisticsbyChallengeRating" data-content-chunk-id="241a2640-c459-4050-99b1-b8041cb9aeb9">Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating</a> table to determine how much damage the monster should deal every round. The table presents a range at each challenge rating. It doesn’t matter how this damage is apportioned or distributed; for example, a monster might deal the damage every round with a single attack, or the damage could be split among multiple attacks against one or more foes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3500c5eb-a965-4c05-8db5-d7b60264817a">Choose the type of damage based on how you imagine the damage being delivered. For example, if the monster is attacking with razor-sharp claws, the damage it deals is probably slashing damage. If its claws are poisonous, some portion of the damage might be poison damage instead of slashing damage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="179d82cd-afe6-40a0-8850-5e96e2b08938">If you want the damage output to vary slightly from round to round, you can translate the damage range into a single die expression (for a monster with one attack) or multiple die expressions (for a monster with multiple attacks). For example, a challenge rating 2 monster deals 15–20 damage per round. If you imagine the creature having a Strength of 18 (+4 modifier), you could give it one melee attack that deals 3d8 + 4 (average 17.5) damage, split the damage output into two separate attacks that deal 1d10 + 4 (average 9) damage each, or use any other combination where the average damage output falls within the desired range.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="59061ba6-dbd2-4496-ae58-320758cffe20"><strong><em>Base the Damage on the Weapon.</em></strong> Alternatively, you can use a die expression to represent the damage that a monster deals with each of its attacks based on whatever weapon it is using.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b9e61c3e-6abc-4f12-8ada-0dee5b748217">Don’t worry if the damage output isn’t matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster’s challenge rating, as will be discussed in later steps, and you can always adjust a monster’s damage output later on.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a80a32cb-33dd-43f9-bcee-8e8112b9690d">Some monsters use natural weapons, such as claws or tail spikes. Others wield manufactured weapons.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5a06b6b8-5fa2-4abf-bae7-05fd25c8c779">If a monster has natural weapons, you decide how much damage it deals with those attacks, as well as the type of damage. See the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="fa79465a-ce24-4d7a-a52c-18fd19a6c8e7">Monster Manual</a> for examples.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="df1a9253-2721-4330-a225-d719f1306a79">If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, it deals damage appropriate to the weapon. For example, a greataxe in the hands of a Medium monster deals 1d12 slashing damage plus the monster’s Strength modifier, as is normal for that weapon.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cfe0238e-772b-471f-a55d-7e3381d8a127">Big monsters typically wield oversized weapons that deal extra dice of damage on a hit. Double the weapon dice if the creature is Large, triple the weapon dice if it’s Huge, and quadruple the weapon dice if it’s Gargantuan. For example, a Huge giant wielding an appropriately sized greataxe deals 3d12 slashing damage (plus its Strength bonus), instead of the normal 1d12.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4e87fa91-dec6-4e40-b973-c4036b2666eb">A creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a weapon that is sized for a larger attacker. You can rule that a weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes larger is too big for the creature to use at all.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2acf8fc7-7d9b-485c-b35d-7ddae45d640e"><strong><em>Overall Damage Output.</em></strong> To determine a monster’s overall damage output, take the average damage it deals with each of its attacks in a round and add them together. If a monster has different attack options, use the monster’s most effective attacks to determine its damage output. For example, a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16862-fire-giant" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16862-tooltip">fire giant</a> can make two greatsword attacks or one rock attack in a round. The greatsword attacks deal more damage, so that attack routine determines the fire giant’s damage output.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8fc2ac9d-2eb3-454f-8644-34e9baa887f4">If a monster’s damage output varies from round to round, calculate its damage output each round for the first three rounds of combat, and take the average. For example, a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17076-young-white-dragon" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17076-tooltip">young white dragon</a> has a multiattack routine (one bite attack and two claw attacks) that deals an average of 37 damage each round, as well as a breath weapon that deals 45 damage, or 90 if it hits two targets (and it probably will). In the first three rounds of combat, the dragon will probably get to use its breath weapon once and its multiattack routine twice, so its average damage output for the first three rounds would be (90 + 37 + 37) ÷ 3, or 54 damage (rounded down).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3260952c-6bad-4cab-8371-8f480a8eef73">When calculating a monster’s damage output, also account for special off-turn damage-dealing features, such as auras, reactions, legendary actions, or lair actions. For example, a balor’s Fire Aura deals 10 fire damage to any creature that hits the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16797-balor" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16797-tooltip">balor</a> with a melee attack. The aura also deals 10 fire damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the balor at the start of each of the balor’s turns. If you assume that one character in the party is within 5 feet of the balor at all times, hitting it with a melee weapon every round, then the balor’s damage output per round increases by 20.</p>

The table notes which features increase a monster’s effective Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus, or damage output for the purpose of determining its challenge rating. (The features don’t actually change the monster’s statistics.) Features that have no effect on a monster’s challenge rating are noted with a dash (—).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5fcb23e8-5df6-4aa1-a1aa-7c189314b120">When assigning special traits, actions, or reactions to a monster, keep in mind that not all monsters need them. The more you add, the more complex (and harder to run) the monster becomes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="431a0ae4-7dd2-4292-90b0-2923d5213283"><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting.</em></strong> The impact that the Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting special traits have on a monster’s challenge rating depends on the spells that the monster can cast. Spells that deal more damage than the monster’s normal attack routine and spells that increase the monster’s AC or hit points need to be accounted for when determining the monster’s final challenge rating. See the “<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/introduction#SpecialTraits" data-content-chunk-id="cda884ac-0e62-4dce-a7ed-fb99b803c95c">Special Traits</a>” section in the introduction of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="9f1323cc-f2b6-4975-963d-f776063a6f5a">Monster Manual</a> for more information on these two special traits.</p>
<h4 id="Step14Speed" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="0ed9847c-9a3e-41ec-858a-b9d195745a3b"><a href="#Step14Speed" data-content-chunk-id="9e4d4ad8-14cc-488f-ba13-6cfab96a42b3"></a>Step 14. Speed</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="46494637-3555-4f28-b735-63ec02c8b27c">Every monster has a walking speed. (Immobile monsters have a walking speed of 0 feet.) In addition to its walking speed, a monster might have one or more other speeds, including a burrowing, climbing, flying, or swimming speed.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bd1a776e-ece9-446e-8e19-12b5a3bf60fb"><strong><em>Flying Monster.</em></strong> Increase the monster’s effective Armor Class by 2 (not its actual AC) if it can fly and deal damage at range and if its expected challenge rating is 10 or lower (higher-level characters have a greater ability to deal with flying creatures).</p>
<h4 id="Step15SavingThrowBonuses" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="e7c2c1c2-f781-434c-8444-addf1fbc7393"><a href="#Step15SavingThrowBonuses" data-content-chunk-id="d4f66da6-89fe-4241-8920-6777e101216a"></a>Step 15. Saving Throw Bonuses</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3e9be258-7b63-4ae2-a313-fbc1a6fe8f2b">If you want a monster to be unusually resistant to certain kinds of effects, you can give it a bonus to saving throws tied to a particular ability.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1d9fbe47-b43c-4f0d-83e4-87c6715a4830">A saving throw bonus is best used to counteract a low ability score. For example, an undead monster with a low Wisdom score might need a Wisdom saving throw bonus to account for the fact that it’s more difficult to charm, frighten, or turn than its Wisdom would indicate.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="645a4aef-a503-4a37-a9fc-398bc4cee873">A saving throw bonus is equal to the monster’s proficiency bonus + the monster’s relevant ability modifier.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3fcb419c-a147-4920-970b-33fe82266f04">A monster with three or more saving throw bonuses has a significant defensive advantage, so its effective AC (not its actual AC) should be raised when determining its challenge rating. If it has three or four bonuses, increase its effective AC by 2. If it has five or more bonuses, increase its effective AC by 4.</p>
<h4 id="Step16FinalChallengeRating" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="e83e6ec0-c7d0-4c8a-9fea-c5b6dd46d79f"><a href="#Step16FinalChallengeRating" data-content-chunk-id="4ecce649-1885-48e9-a49f-c88b175af706"></a>Step 16. Final Challenge Rating</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="18ada87e-33e5-4a5b-8daa-f7c050ac3054">At this point, you have all the statistical information you need to calculate the monster’s final challenge rating. This step is identical to <a href="#Step4FinalChallengeRating" data-content-chunk-id="55f21d9e-bf34-4201-82ec-241e5f606f36">step 4</a> under “<a href="#CreatingQuickMonsterStats" data-content-chunk-id="ea5e96f5-8e0a-4d16-adc5-4006f8350b75">Creating Quick Monster Stats</a>.” Calculate the monster’s defensive challenge rating and its offensive challenge rating, then take the average to get its final challenge rating.</p>
<h4 id="Step17SkillBonuses" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c8262385-cf03-4208-995b-1fb5b73447f9"><a href="#Step17SkillBonuses" data-content-chunk-id="952f2b20-e64b-469a-9100-88fb875c41d3"></a>Step 17. Skill Bonuses</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cdf5f7b3-a9a2-4f56-abb0-056f84d50af7">If you want a monster to be proficient in a skill, you can give it a bonus equal to its proficiency bonus on ability checks related to that skill. For example, a monster with sharp senses might have a bonus on Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) checks, while a duplicitous monster might have a bonus on Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/16-tooltip">Deception</a>) checks.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e77e402d-fb54-4101-882f-512fb4e03bc4">You can double the proficiency bonus to account for heightened mastery. For example, a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16843-doppelganger" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16843-tooltip">doppelganger</a> is so good at deceiving others that its bonus on Charisma (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/16-tooltip">Deception</a>) checks is equal to double its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e28e94c6-89a2-4188-9359-d67af9ba6d77">Skill bonuses have no bearing on a monster’s challenge rating.</p>
<h4 id="Step18ConditionImmunities" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="bfc0409f-19f8-47eb-a821-e5cbb69a46af"><a href="#Step18ConditionImmunities" data-content-chunk-id="8e8f48d3-3533-4733-b48a-486e0075e884"></a>Step 18. Condition Immunities</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1524a56b-a299-47ff-9661-b615dca19b7a">A monster can be immune to one or more debilitating conditions, and these immunities have no bearing on its challenge rating. For descriptions of the various conditions, see the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/appendix-a-conditions" data-content-chunk-id="5060e0ae-f553-4999-abee-f7fa4e133366">Appendices</a> section of the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="5dd7b563-a270-481b-975e-0411902a9522">Player’s Handbook</a>.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="db304624-6342-4c8a-9560-3062848fd95a">As with damage immunities, condition immunities should be intuitive and logical. For example, it makes sense that a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17025-stone-golem" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17025-tooltip">stone golem</a> can’t be <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition" data-tooltip-href="/conditions/11-tooltip">poisoned</a>, since it’s a construct without a nervous system or internal organs.</p>
<h4 id="Step19Senses" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="ba406995-911d-4e8d-a0d5-3bbc3fdbf209"><a href="#Step19Senses" data-content-chunk-id="2ceed0a5-9ae8-4a8d-832c-eb6d62ec0a80"></a>Step 19. Senses</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5ec09f78-147b-4635-8360-aacb1cdc1bfc">A monster might have one or more of the following special senses, which are described in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm" data-content-chunk-id="4825f9b0-78b4-4248-81b4-3635489b959e">Monster Manual</a>: <a class="tooltip-hover sense-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Blindsight" data-tooltip-href="/senses/1-tooltip">blindsight</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover sense-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision" data-tooltip-href="/senses/2-tooltip">darkvision</a>, <a class="tooltip-hover sense-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Tremorsense" data-tooltip-href="/senses/3-tooltip">tremorsense</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover sense-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Truesight" data-tooltip-href="/senses/4-tooltip">truesight</a>. Whether the monster has special senses or not has no bearing on its challenge rating.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f9e666bf-7cf4-4edf-94a3-cb5aa27513bc"><strong><em>Passive Perception Score.</em></strong> All monsters have a passive Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) score, which is most often used to determine whether a monster detects approaching or hidden enemies. A monster’s passive Wisdom (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) score is 10 + its Wisdom modifier. If the monster has proficiency in the <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a> skill, its score is 10 + its Wisdom (Perception) bonus.</p>
<h4 id="Step20Languages" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="52d24234-d04c-4975-80ba-29cd0d0120e4"><a href="#Step20Languages" data-content-chunk-id="f4ea4969-350f-481d-a7fb-6a45e10ed736"></a>Step 20. Languages</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d33c1d41-dc6c-425c-a7a4-24c656e5f67e">Whether a monster can speak a language has no bearing on its challenge rating.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cb32ede0-05c1-4d65-8aa9-401f7aef54fb">A monster can master as many spoken languages as you want, although few monsters know more than one or two, and many monsters (beasts in particular) have no spoken language whatsoever. A monster that lacks the ability to speak might still understand a language.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="86a18486-3eb0-4077-a358-57ca866eb8a7"><strong><em>Telepathy.</em></strong> Whether or not a monster has telepathy has no bearing on its challenge rating.

<p data-content-chunk-id="52c471d5-f9e0-4ad6-9aca-8325ee4dd1e1">Once you finish adding class levels to a monster, feel free to tweak its ability scores as you see fit (for example, raising the monster’s Intelligence score so that the monster is a more effective wizard), and make whatever other adjustments are needed. You’ll need to recalculate its challenge rating as though you had designed the monster from scratch.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0a82f096-0451-41c5-93d4-46a7c29858b2">Depending on the monster and the number of class levels you add to it, its challenge rating might change very little or increase dramatically. For example, a <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17057-werewolf" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17057-tooltip">werewolf</a> that gains four barbarian levels is a much greater threat than it was before. In contrast, the hit points, spells, and other class features that an <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16782-ancient-red-dragon" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16782-tooltip">ancient red dragon</a> gains from five levels of wizard don’t increase its challenge rating.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="c21e24a7-0aae-429d-afa0-a77820abdcc4">When creating a new spell, use existing spells as guidelines. Here are some things to consider:</p>
<div class="flexible-double-column" data-content-chunk-id="f1703ed9-6539-475e-89d0-020854a5f0c9">
<div data-content-chunk-id="20c610b5-32fd-4074-b2bd-5d02e5423a35">
<ul data-content-chunk-id="e71f6dac-d109-43bb-8537-872d66408a69">
<li data-content-chunk-id="c6478a9f-6265-4ecc-97f1-2137a8c33bff">If a spell is so good that a caster would want to use it all the time, it might be too powerful for its level.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="a0fac935-a51d-44f5-89ce-db88b0a20f11">A long duration or large area can make up for a lesser effect, depending on the spell.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="87d87213-7c94-4066-8ad2-7548b5b68402">Avoid spells that have very limited use, such as one that works only against good dragons. Though such a spell could exist in the world, few characters will bother to learn or prepare it unless they know in advance that doing so will be worthwhile.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="abf471f2-9062-4a16-b2d4-e4736fd16c2f">Make sure the spell fits with the identity of the class. Wizards and sorcerers don’t typically have access to healing spells, for example, and adding a healing spell to the wizard class list would step on the cleric’s turf.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="SpellDamage" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f65072ba-fb6d-4ed1-bbea-7ee89b746ed5"><a href="#SpellDamage" data-content-chunk-id="0e9a7c63-29c7-4636-b17f-7fc226ff57e2"></a>Spell Damage</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="85402755-9a6c-4c7c-a084-5963daa3e7c9">For any spell that deals damage, use the Spell Damage table to determine approximately how much damage is appropriate given the spell’s level. The table assumes the spell deals half damage on a successful saving throw or a missed attack. If your spell doesn’t deal damage on a successful save, you can increase the damage by 25 percent.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="0be90246-a683-4c2a-9686-a1fc43a8466e">You can use different damage dice than the ones in the table, provided that the average result is about the same. Doing so can add a little variety to the spell. For example, you could change a cantrip’s damage from 1d10 (average 5.5) to 2d4 (average 5), reducing the maximum damage and making an average result more likely.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fcfeac0e-592d-4fdb-a9b2-ab74ee11abfa">The magic items in chapter 7, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure" data-content-chunk-id="07334b2e-063c-4db0-bce7-ef06c44d68e1">Treasure</a>," section are but a few of the magic treasures that characters can discover during their adventures. If your players are seasoned veterans and you want to surprise them, you can either modify an existing item or come up with something new.</p>
<h3 id="ModifyinganItem" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="f87b1902-3669-4151-8504-5b6f83c9b96d"><a href="#ModifyinganItem" data-content-chunk-id="c0b820fb-d508-48b6-9ef4-5135083c4909"></a>Modifying an Item</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="46231bc2-f622-4ee2-9bb9-496a9ed9a043">The easiest way to invent a new item is to tweak an existing one. If a paladin uses a flail as her main weapon, you could change a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5389-holy-avenger" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5389-tooltip">holy avenger</a> so that it’s a flail instead of a sword. You can turn a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4734-ring-of-the-ram" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4734-tooltip">ring of the ram</a> into a wand, or a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4607-cloak-of-protection" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4607-tooltip">cloak of protection</a> into a <em>circlet of protection</em>, all without altering the item’s properties.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f393898a-2141-4935-aab7-7aebaa7d7770">Other substitutions are equally easy. An item that deals damage of one type can easily deal damage of another type. A <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/5386-flame-tongue" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/5386-tooltip">flame tongue</a> sword could deal lightning damage instead of fire, for example. One capability can replace another, so a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4702-potion-of-climbing" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4702-tooltip">potion of climbing</a> can easily become a <em>potion of stealth.</em></p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ec9d1976-981c-4621-821b-f98ef12552d1">You can also modify an item by fusing it with properties from another item. For example, you could combine the effects of a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4654-helm-of-comprehending-languages" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4654-tooltip">helm of comprehending languages</a> with those of a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4655-helm-of-telepathy" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4655-tooltip">helm of telepathy</a> into a single helmet. This makes the item more powerful (and probably increases its rarity), but it won’t break your game.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p data-content-chunk-id="831bc0d5-4e4b-4075-826f-05c42b870845">Finally, remember the tools that are provided for modifying items in chapter 7, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure" data-content-chunk-id="26015e61-10cc-401e-8ed4-992ea11a709a">Treasure</a>." Giving an item an interesting minor property, a quirk, or sentience can alter its flavor significantly.</p>
<h3 id="CreatingaNewItem" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="93b3519d-6599-4006-b17c-bccc12e93d32"><a href="#CreatingaNewItem" data-content-chunk-id="a34f883c-d5b8-4f40-885b-9d51d91cee75"></a>Creating a New Item</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e49c8767-21c9-42ea-9b14-761513935c0c">If modifying an item doesn’t quite do the trick, you can create one from scratch. A magic item should either let a character do something he or she couldn’t do before, or improve the character’s ability to do something he or she can do already. For example, the <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4724-ring-of-jumping" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4724-tooltip">ring of jumping</a> lets its wearer jump greater distances, thus augmenting what a character can already do. A <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/4734-ring-of-the-ram" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4734-tooltip">ring of the ram</a>, however, gives a character the ability to deal force damage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b7e2081a-e8cc-478a-b380-965b3e1d3819">The simpler your approach, the easier it is for a character to use the item in play. Giving the item charges is fine, especially if it has several different abilities, but simply deciding that an item is always active or can be used a fixed number of times per day is easier to manage.</p>
<h4 id="PowerLevel" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="68b1020c-64ec-4fb1-8f17-a349364f2fb8"><a href="#PowerLevel" data-content-chunk-id="e5e9e50d-864f-460d-9d10-f4a7d47b15cb"></a>Power Level</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f7477ae5-efc0-464f-b515-a25efb79c6f9">If you make an item that lets a character kill whatever he or she hits with it, that item will likely unbalance your game. On the other hand, an item whose benefit rarely comes into play isn’t much of a reward and probably not worth doling out as one.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="fd133ef1-0f06-4040-aace-013ef81719ed">Use the Magic Item Power by Rarity table as a guide to help you determine how powerful an item should be, based on its rarity.</p>

For example, a common item might confer the benefit of a 1st-level spell once per day (or just once, if it’s consumable). A rare, very rare, or legendary item might allow its possessor to cast a lower-level spell more frequently.</p>

<li data-content-chunk-id="e68a20db-cfff-4ec0-a33a-822f166a02c2">If the item grants a bonus that other items also grant, it’s a good idea to require attunement so that characters don’t try to collect too many of those items.</li>

<p data-content-chunk-id="6018534e-2ac2-4975-9795-206db0f80983">This section teaches you how to modify existing races, as well as create new ones. The most important step in customizing or designing races for your campaign is to start with the story behind the race or subrace you wish to create. Having a firm idea of a race’s story in your campaign will help you make decisions during the creation process. Ask yourself several questions:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="2cb0d647-16e8-4253-b602-36900c3edbca">

<li data-content-chunk-id="0485ccd7-b513-4bfb-be27-f94b47a25d8b">Are there interesting conflicts built into the race’s history that make the race compelling from a storytelling standpoint?</li>

</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f2efdcf6-8e0d-47d3-b3f0-cd595461c0ac">Compare the race you have in mind with the other race options available to players, to make sure that the new race doesn’t pale in comparison to the existing options (which would result in the race being unpopular) or completely overshadow them (so that players don’t feel as if the other options are inferior).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="05dc8690-1fc4-46c2-99b8-04336b957276">When the time comes to design the game elements of the race, such as its traits, take a look at the game’s existing races and let them inspire you.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="970361d3-ff65-467a-aa73-ac0455372fa1">A simple way to modify an existing race is to change its appearance. Changes to a race’s appearance need not affect its game elements. For example, you could transform halflings into anthropomorphic mice without changing their racial traits at all.</p>
<h4 id="CreatingaNewSubrace" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="e605401b-b526-474f-b090-23f1e2f2164d"><a href="#CreatingaNewSubrace" data-content-chunk-id="246e5413-8e90-4dbe-ba20-7b24a0305390"></a>Creating a New Subrace</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8a394432-b73c-4f9f-b04b-266f5c9b9cab">Creating a new subrace is more involved than making some minor tweaks to existing racial features, but it does have the advantage of increasing the diversity of options for a particular race, rather than replacing some options with other ones.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3b12f1da-b146-4e22-9e5b-70fffd1b7ba5">The following example walks through the creation of an elf subrace: the eladrin. This subrace has history in the D&amp;D multiverse, so you already have some stories to draw on when building its traits.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="dca0e89a-0402-47ad-bd87-d66a9eeceadd">Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin live in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing briefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before fading back into the Feywild.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bbc2eed8-c227-41a4-92e3-3012bf43cc43">The elf subraces in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="2b16bcba-aaaa-4fa0-81b6-3c888c82636c">Player’s Handbook</a> include an ability score increase, a weapon training feature, and two or three additional traits. Given the story of the eladrin and their magical nature, an increase to an eladrin character’s Intelligence is appropriate. There’s no need to alter the basic weapon training shared by high elves and wood elves.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f1b39e00-7acf-437f-93f2-777e5f5dac2e">An ability that sets the eladrin apart from other elves is their ability to step through the boundary between the planes, disappearing for a moment before reappearing somewhere else. In the game, this is reflected in a limited use of the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2195-misty-step" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2195-tooltip">misty step</a> spell. Since <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2195-misty-step" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2195-tooltip">misty step</a> is a 2nd-level spell, this ability is potent enough that the subrace doesn’t need additional traits. This leaves us with the following features for the eladrin subrace:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9fec9275-2b3f-43fb-a61c-ad40dd0b2213"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ef776f6c-40e1-4570-a615-d0cc0ffad44f"><strong><em>Elf Weapon Training.</em></strong> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="778dbd4e-cb13-45d1-a89f-629ec0857b69"><strong><em>Fey Step.</em></strong> You can cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2195-misty-step" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2195-tooltip">misty step</a> spell once using this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h4 id="CreatingaNewRace" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="76140154-5c7f-4a20-a7fc-10af3a2584da"><a href="#CreatingaNewRace" data-content-chunk-id="ab300595-9a4c-485d-aea3-743f11593726"></a>Creating a New Race</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a4f751b9-7985-431d-b67e-5acf48a12fc3">When creating a race from scratch, begin with the story and proceed from there. Compare your creation to the other races of your world, and borrow freely from the traits of other races. As an example, consider the aasimar, a race similar to the tiefling but with a celestial heritage.</p>
<h4 id="ExampleRaceAasimar" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="32691b2e-5760-444f-9753-c6c88e8707c5"><a href="#ExampleRaceAasimar" data-content-chunk-id="e4178489-e0f6-45ef-b1de-07c014242563"></a>Example Race: Aasimar</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="dc49a7e0-2856-4c17-a7fe-f256f4d56661">Whereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins, aasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrous hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often attempt to pass as humans in order to right wrongs and defend goodness on the Material Plane without drawing undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive to fit into society, although they usually rise to the top, becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="544ca992-fda5-4326-ab5e-88c1ec2d249a">You might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpoint to the tiefling race. The two races could even be at odds, reflecting some greater conflict between the forces of good and evil in your campaign.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f7fc94d6-4741-43a5-a897-9df0cffbafd0">Here are our basic goals for the aasimar:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="df6524a7-e69f-473a-8be0-3ff1bf10cd5b">
<li data-content-chunk-id="545cadf9-2eaa-4c0c-a53e-8ae6eed1f6b5">Aasimar should make effective clerics and paladins.</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="d265ec92-8f05-4ed7-b6bd-6c0e63fcdae7">Aasimar should be to celestials and humans what tieflings are to fiends and humans.</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="eb2e4b61-980e-4aef-8aeb-44187ac96a61">Given that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of the same coin, the tiefling makes a good starting point for coming up with the new race’s traits. Since we want aasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it makes sense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead of Intelligence and Charisma.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="09296cdf-4296-4259-ad4d-4bb664352a99">Like tieflings, aasimar have <a class="tooltip-hover sense-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkvision" data-tooltip-href="/senses/2-tooltip">darkvision</a>. Instead of resistance to fire damage, we give them resistance to radiant damage to reflect their celestial nature. However, radiant damage isn’t as common as fire damage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage as well, making them good at facing undead.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ad5abdf3-e826-4020-9732-74911f9c2c64">The tiefling’s Infernal Legacy trait is a good model for a similar trait to reflect a magical, celestial heritage, replacing the tiefling’s spells with spells of similar levels that more closely match the aasimar’s celestial ancestry. However, the aasimar’s expanded resistance might require limiting this trait to basic utility spells.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="74f78558-6651-452e-9903-cfe00bca8750">Filling in the remaining details, we end up with the following racial traits for the aasimar:</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0e0802ef-ea77-43d3-a566-5b42302d1984"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="48d4babe-96b4-475d-a60b-24afac753c6f"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Aasimar mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="56dbaac6-8594-4794-95a7-bb41e7fcc9d8"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Aasimar are built like well-proportioned humans. Your size is Medium.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="76a485be-2226-4104-82a4-55d2143a7021"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="878b19e8-36ed-47c3-bedc-c96d2b839a85"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Thanks to your celestial heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="9728ad7f-cf01-4045-8d36-abc43e10b77c"><strong><em>Celestial Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="572e132c-504d-44b6-b55e-afa50a6f1b9d"><strong><em>Celestial Legacy.</em></strong> You know the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2166-light" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2166-tooltip">light</a> cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2164-lesser-restoration" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2164-tooltip">lesser restoration</a> spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2060-daylight" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2060-tooltip">daylight</a> spell once with this trait as a 3rd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="05e3419f-baaf-4ea3-b862-680e20846a20"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="275e8291-9d57-4fc1-b09e-f0525fc0ead4">The classes in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="82e04c24-cd52-4b34-959a-a0f04a58b644">Player’s Handbook</a> capture a wide range of character archetypes, but your campaign world might have need of something more. The following section discusses ways to modify existing classes to better serve your game’s needs.</p>
<h4 id="ChangingProficiencies" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="ffb39bb8-8eac-4666-8c5d-a0639b9beb69"><a href="#ChangingProficiencies" data-content-chunk-id="c36a9cca-3ca5-4e9e-b201-d749f7c2bd07"></a>Changing Proficiencies</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="da75b31e-9ee3-4c8b-b021-d824fadf7434">Changing a class’s proficiencies is a safe and simple way to modify a class to better reflect your world. Swapping out one skill or tool proficiency for another doesn’t make a character any stronger or weaker, but doing so can change the flavor of a class in subtle ways.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="07e9d26f-51c2-433c-bcc8-c127e1b978d5">For example, a prominent guild of rogues in your world might worship a patron deity, performing secret missions in that deity’s name. To reflect this cultural detail, you could add <a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills" data-tooltip-href="/skills/10-tooltip">Religion</a> to the list of skills that a rogue character can choose as a proficiency. You could even mandate that skill as one of the choices for rogues who belong to this guild.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f672fd43-2dbf-4898-b2c8-e0156a07fd6b">You can also change armor and weapon proficiencies to reflect certain aspects of your world. For example, you could decide that the clerics of a particular deity belong to an order that forbids the accumulation of material goods, other than magic items useful for their divine mission. Such clerics carry a staff, but they are forbidden from wearing armor or using weapons other than that staff. To reflect this, you could remove the armor and weapon proficiencies for clerics of this faith, making them proficient with the quarterstaff and nothing else. You could give them a benefit to make up for the loss of proficiencies—something like the monk’s Unarmored Defense class feature, but presented as a divine blessing.</p>

<h4 id="ChangingSpellLists" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="9b51e320-3a32-4863-8f91-2bc385604264"><a href="#ChangingSpellLists" data-content-chunk-id="82137d3b-67c6-440c-a436-850fc7a42482"></a>Changing Spell Lists</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="00edee19-6e54-4c16-afb8-b803867a2cd4">Modifying a class’s spell list usually has little effect on a character’s power but can change the flavor of a class significantly. In your world, paladins might not swear their oaths to ideals, but instead swear fealty to powerful sorcerers. To capture this story concept, you could build a new paladin spell list with spells meant to protect their masters, drawn from the sorcerer or wizard lists. Suddenly, the paladin feels like a different class.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="8760f020-975c-49ad-a614-418633e5460c">Be cautious when changing the warlock spell list. Since warlocks regain their spell slots after a short rest, they have the potential to use certain spells more times in a day than other classes do.</p>
<h4 id="RestrictingClassAccess" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="aca80558-f821-460f-9a19-99434f872ae7"><a href="#RestrictingClassAccess" data-content-chunk-id="096e2ba3-e615-4f5e-bbd3-98ad2be890dc"></a>Restricting Class Access</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1a70e7c4-26e9-45db-a0e8-2bc5cc6a9ed7">Without changing the way a class functions, you can root it more firmly in the world by associating the class with a particular race or culture.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0a4eeabe-7571-4ed3-a89b-b431441f8760">For example, you might decide that bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards represent the magical traditions of four different races or cultures. The bardic colleges might be closed to everyone except elves, dragonborn might be the only creatures capable of becoming sorcerers, and all warlocks in your world might be human. You could break that down still further: bards of the College of Lore could be high elves, and bards of the College of War could be wood elves. Gnomes discovered the school of illusion, so all wizards who specialize in that school are gnomes. Different human cultures produce warlocks with different pacts, and so on. Similarly, different cleric domains might reflect entirely separate religions associated with different races or cultures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c2cccc85-6b4f-426a-af17-f817cc06e40b">You decide how flexible you want to be in allowing a player character to break these restrictions. Can a half-elf live among the elves and study their bardic traditions? Can a dwarf stumble into a warlock pact despite having no connection to a culture that normally produces warlocks? As always, it’s better to say yes and use the player’s desire as an opportunity to develop the character’s story and that of your world, rather than shutting down possibilities.</p>
<h4 id="SubstitutingClassFeatures" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="a6cae1cf-5e42-4ef1-be17-c60bcf78d0e1"><a href="#SubstitutingClassFeatures" data-content-chunk-id="97961dbf-7ba8-4b9a-b800-6c3c7e3f5e72"></a>Substituting Class Features</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="a8eac643-6568-4e4c-9518-7ae5ff3db800">If one or more features of a given class don’t exactly fit the theme or tone of your campaign, you can pull them out of the class and replace them with new ones. In doing so, you should strive to make sure that the new options are just as appealing as the ones you are removing, and that the substitute class features contribute to the class’s effectiveness at social interaction, exploration, or combat just as well as those being replaced.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="420d8431-1232-42f6-8543-a790e95057b4">Ultimately, a class exists to help a player express a particular character concept, and any class feature you replace is also removing an aspect of that character. Substituting a class feature should be done only to fit a specific need for your campaign, or to appeal to a player trying to create a specific kind of character (perhaps one modeled after a character from a novel, TV series, comic book, or movie).</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="f042b67a-78e4-4994-8a9a-74185e2c40eb">The first step is to figure out what class feature or group of class features you’re going to replace. Then you need to evaluate what each feature provides to the class, so that the features you are adding don’t make the class over- or underpowered. Ask yourself the following questions about a feature you’re replacing:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="dbf46ab4-6468-4fe8-9cbb-d1cd951d42e3">
<li data-content-chunk-id="98250265-0be3-4542-8d67-20bb53182981">What impact does replacing the feature have on exploration, social interaction, or combat?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="d26f1b26-55c6-4343-af0d-511c55a95d5c">Does replacing the feature affect how long the party can continue adventuring in a day?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="cecef7b0-9323-4f72-ba98-6dd5dd87f19a">Does the feature consume resources provided elsewhere in the class?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="7e8dab15-efd0-4ef6-a0fa-4aff7189fca9">Does the feature work all the time, or is it regained after a short rest, a long rest, or some other length of time?</li>
</ul>
<p data-content-chunk-id="b55e4d7a-4b38-4843-bd4e-77b65d06c037">Armed with answers to these questions, you can start designing new features that replace the ones you are removing. It’s fine if the new class features drift closer to exploration, social interaction, or combat than the ones you are replacing, but be wary of going too far. For example, if you replace an exploration-focused feature with something purely combat focused, you’ve just made that class more powerful in combat, and it could overshadow the other classes in a way that you didn’t intend.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="40e82a6b-160b-449c-bb7e-1a30e57ea401">There’s no formula that can tell you how to design new class features. The best place to start is by looking at other class features, or at spells, feats, or any other rules for inspiration. You’re almost certainly going to have some missteps, as features that seem good on the surface fall apart in play. That’s all right. Everything you design will need to be playtested. When introducing new class features, be sure the players using them are comfortable with the fact that you might need to go back and make some changes after seeing them in play.</p>
<h4 id="CreatingNewClassOptions" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="5781bcfd-95ca-40e8-8fea-940ccdfcd9d0"><a href="#CreatingNewClassOptions" data-content-chunk-id="9f434aaf-0183-4243-900c-d42e6c46a1d6"></a>Creating New Class Options</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="63d78d19-c6a5-470f-8d42-07f370f90d06">Each class has at least one major choice point. Clerics choose a divine domain, fighters choose a martial archetype, wizards choose an arcane tradition, and so forth. Creating a new option doesn’t require you to remove anything from the class, but any new option you add should be compared to existing options to make sure it’s no more or less powerful, yet remains distinctive in flavor. Like anything in class design, be prepared to playtest your ideas and make changes if things aren’t playing out the way you want them to.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="778a628d-4c15-4d93-83b6-dc06c67edba7">Once you have the concept for the class option in mind, it’s time to design the specifics. If you’re not sure where to begin, look at the existing options and see what class features they provide. It’s perfectly acceptable for two class options to have similar features, and it’s also fine to look at other classes for examples of mechanics you can draw on for inspiration. As you design each class feature, ask the following questions:</p>
<ul data-content-chunk-id="384beadf-2b57-4449-bb44-43122aff5dc2">
<li data-content-chunk-id="9dce1d73-070f-45d2-acb6-8fc863b5a592">How does the class feature reinforce the story or theme of the class option?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="33116085-8343-4887-bcf3-f820866c542f">Is there an existing feature that can be used as a model?</li>
<li data-content-chunk-id="873286eb-f0ec-4633-8a37-51ccec310b8b">How does the new class feature compare to other features of the same level?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="VariantSpellPoints" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="3a1ee6fe-2f92-4192-a75a-129a7d7b4fc8"><a href="#VariantSpellPoints" data-content-chunk-id="a788708e-5356-4f7f-b4b3-522f5fdc11d3"></a>Variant: Spell Points</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5760deec-9527-463e-b954-87850d680ed0">One way to modify how a class feels is to change how it uses its spells. With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead of spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1ba86654-ac0f-4568-9c3a-1eb568d1a82f">In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don’t require slots and therefore don’t require spell points.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="25b022ab-0764-41c8-8dcb-2bd80fc89791">Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can’t reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="149414da-0ce1-43da-82fa-258bc66d06fd">Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can’t create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="912b560b-9aa6-48a2-9246-5e6741ef8425">The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can’t do so.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5d8e5463-5dac-478d-9ea9-554ae13adbbe">The Spell Points by Level table applies to bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. For a paladin or ranger, halve the character’s level in that class and then consult the table. For a fighter (Eldritch Knight) or rogue (Arcane Trickster), divide the character’s level in that class by three.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c178de9c-2297-4fdd-b230-ef3de4dc068d">This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn’t recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.</p>

<h3 id="CreatingaBackground" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="801935f6-8a66-4dd0-a11e-b6f612a169ec"><a href="#CreatingaBackground" data-content-chunk-id="dd64a805-74a2-4233-975d-916585d079d2"></a>Creating a Background</h3>
<p data-content-chunk-id="50803cf3-a419-4fbb-a5f2-8b58dd307f47">A well-crafted background can help a player create a character that feels like an exciting addition to your campaign. It helps define the character’s place in the world, rather than what a character is in terms of game mechanics.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="bab65532-4ccc-4914-a778-7efe3cd5fff0">Instead of focusing on a generic character background, such as merchant or wanderer, think about the factions, organizations, and cultures of your campaign and how they might be leveraged to create flavorful backgrounds for player characters. For example, you could create an acolyte of Candlekeep background that is functionally similar to a sage background, but which ties a character more closely to a place and organization in your world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="493f265a-bba6-4647-a5c0-82cf9ad1c2c0">A character with the acolyte of Candlekeep background probably has friends among the Avowed—the monks who maintain the great library at Candlekeep. The character can enter the library and consult its lore freely, while others must donate a rare or valuable tome of knowledge before they are allowed entry. Candlekeep’s enemies are the character’s enemies, and its allies, the character’s friends. Acolytes of Candlekeep are generally regarded as learned sages and protectors of knowledge. It’s possible to envision many interesting interactions as NPCs discover the character’s background and approach the character in search of assistance.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="22671e90-d2f3-4f1c-a6a9-bb7a65d7fc1a">To create your own background, follow these steps.</p>
<h4 id="Step1RootItinYourWorld" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="cbaedbbf-ca0c-45ce-9246-1092e161e2c4"><a href="#Step1RootItinYourWorld" data-content-chunk-id="a93807b5-de63-41f5-800a-32b980aeb0c5"></a>Step 1. Root It in Your World</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="475c26fc-bb09-4462-9aa3-963a74edae18">To ground a new background in your campaign’s setting, determine what element of your campaign the background is tied to: a faction, an organization, a trade, a person, an event, or a location.</p>
<h4 id="Step2SuggestPersonalCharacteristics" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="1452166d-071d-4dbc-9008-0c10ec07f885"><a href="#Step2SuggestPersonalCharacteristics" data-content-chunk-id="648254bf-1e46-4190-ace6-c1576a0aab13"></a>Step 2. Suggest Personal Characteristics</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="447eb680-c9c7-4822-b81c-d771a93d32d4">Create tables of suggested characteristics—personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws—that fit the background, or plunder entries from the tables presented in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="8d60c11e-c0e9-41ad-9e9b-9c868f986dcd">Player’s Handbook</a>. Even if your players don’t use the tables, this step helps you paint a picture of the background’s place in your world. The tables need not be extensive; two or three entries per table are enough.</p>
<h4 id="Step3AssignProficienciesorLanguages" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="6a3f344d-672c-4242-aeac-0a0e96733919"><a href="#Step3AssignProficienciesorLanguages" data-content-chunk-id="ff4acdc1-351b-439e-bf29-0cd8b0f1faed"></a>Step 3. Assign Proficiencies or Languages</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="4d24223e-74b3-400c-9f44-4b935d19dffe">Choose two skill proficiencies and two tool proficiencies for the background. You can replace tool proficiencies with languages on a one-for-one basis.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="646de211-af3a-43b4-98b3-430972e1ac75">Make sure your background offers a package of starting equipment. In addition to a small amount of money that a character can use to buy adventuring gear, the starting equipment should include items that a character would have acquired prior to becoming an adventurer, as well as one or two items unique to the background.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c901e37-187a-4fa8-85f5-ad2ae2e68093">For example, starting equipment for a character with the acolyte of Candlekeep background might include a set of traveler’s clothes, a scholar’s robe, five candles, a tinderbox, an empty scroll case engraved with the symbol of Candlekeep, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp. The scroll case might be a gift given to an acolyte of Candlekeep who embarks on a life of adventure. At your discretion, it might also contain a useful map.</p>
<h4 id="Step5SettleonaBackgroundFeature" class="heading-anchor compendium-hr" data-content-chunk-id="c9f7428c-e642-4898-ad54-6853ce9c7ee5"><a href="#Step5SettleonaBackgroundFeature" data-content-chunk-id="ab8e3b09-5f6e-41b1-9efa-419ec5bdfd7f"></a>Step 5. Settle on a Background Feature</h4>
<p data-content-chunk-id="428a117e-c2e2-445f-a333-2b2254a6b016">Choose an existing background feature or create a new one, as you prefer. If you choose an existing feature, add or tweak a few details to make it unique.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1af1c368-429c-45a1-bbad-1df306ba7776">For example, the acolyte of Candlekeep background might have the Researcher feature of the sage (as presented in the <a class="sourcebook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb" data-content-chunk-id="6d13115b-7067-48ed-9443-1c8fda931838">Player’s Handbook</a>), with the additional benefit that the character is allowed to enter Candlekeep without paying the normal cost.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e4c847d4-fd4c-4caf-9b81-646e3359bac3">A background feature should avoid strict game benefits, such as a bonus to an ability check or an attack roll. Instead, the feature should open up new options for roleplaying, exploring, and otherwise interacting with the world.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="d089646d-e6d9-4679-a726-2c2bb591a06f">For example, the sage’s Researcher feature is designed to send the character on adventures. It doesn’t provide information or an automatic success for a check. Instead, if a character with the sage background fails to recall information, he or she instead knows where to learn it. This might be a pointer to another sage or to a library long lost within an ancient tomb.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="2edfbf57-d848-4d64-bbe3-d84042435dfd">The best background features give characters a reason to strike out on quests, to make contact with NPCs, and to develop bonds to the setting you’ve devised.</p>

</div>
<p data-content-chunk-id="0c95dda9-46e9-4c13-9433-ed6ed361155a">This appendix helps you quickly generate a dungeon. The tables work in an iterative manner. First, roll a starting area, then roll to determine the passages and doors found in that area. One you have initial passages and doors, determine the location and nature of subsequent passages, doors, chambers, stairs, and so on — each of them generated by rolls on different tables.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="3adb50ef-0f3e-4631-b569-25337929c030">Following these instructions can lead to sprawling complexes that more than fill a single sheet of graph paper. If you want to constrain the dungeon, establish limits ahead of time on how far it can grow.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cd664baa-fe38-450d-b87b-9fd79b33db5e">The most obvious limit to a dungeon’s size is the graph paper it’s drawn on. If a feature would exceed the boundaries of the page, curtail it. A corridor might turn or come to a dead end at the map’s edge, or you can make a chamber smaller to fit the available space.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="ce407a8b-9d16-4c29-8653-6b79d2b2ee34">Alternatively, you can decide that passages leading off the edge of the map are additional dungeon entrances. Stairs, shafts, and other features that would normally lead to levels you don’t plan to map can serve a similar purpose.</p>
<h2 id="StartingArea" class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" data-content-chunk-id="842133d1-7520-48f8-9af8-842dc087a7af"><a href="#StartingArea" data-content-chunk-id="1de6e83d-184c-4920-968a-6604465668ce"></a>Starting Area</h2>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e51a02a5-8b3b-4524-a3d2-01376fd4d4f5">The Starting Area table produces a chamber or a set of corridors at the entrance to your dungeon. When rolling for a random starting area, pick one of the doors or passages leading into the starting area as the entrance to the dungeon as a whole.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5e2a7ce1-20af-40cd-a49f-d4e409f8d689">Once you’ve selected the entrance, roll on the appropriate table for each passage or door leading away from the starting area. Passages each extend 10 feet beyond the starting area. After that point, check on the Passage table for each passage to determine what lies beyond. Use the Beyond a Door table to determine what lies behind doors and secret doors.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="abf72893-c94b-4e8e-a25b-05f6ca13c75e">When your map is done, consider adding doors between chambers and passages that are next to each other but otherwise not connected. Such doors create more paths through the dungeon and expand players’ options.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="1a876929-d319-4965-9357-d80a2ca28aec">If your dungeon consists of more than one level, be sure that any stairs, pits, and other vertical passages line up between levels. If you’re using graph paper, lay a new page on top of your existing map, mark the locations of stairs and other features shared by the two levels, and begin mapping the new level.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="fe1bc4d9-3451-4b44-8f62-d9c6da2e68d6">Creating a map for your dungeon is only half the fun. Once you have the layout, you need to decide what challenges and rewards are to be found in the dungeon’s passages and chambers. Any reasonably large space should be stocked with interesting sights, sounds, objects, and creatures.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="e2edeb5d-50b8-4c8e-a513-91d0c0ad5bc0">You don’t need to have every last detail of your dungeon plotted out. You can get by with nothing more than a list of monsters, a list of treasures, and a list of one or two key elements for each dungeon area.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="3435d33a-0731-4813-89c4-da64763c5f48">A room’s purpose can help determine its furnishings and other contents.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="5d26e6e7-1834-4e72-beab-5369097ed463">For each chamber on your dungeon map, establish its purpose or use the tables below to generate ideas. Each type of dungeon described in “Dungeon Purpose” section of chapter 5, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#DungeonPurpose" data-content-chunk-id="a14bad93-100b-44b5-a69d-a34788cd3c65">Adventure Environments</a>" has its own table featuring chambers geared to the dungeon’s purpose. For example, if you’re building a tomb, use the Dungeon: Tomb table to help you determine the purpose of each chamber. These dungeon-specific tables are followed by the General Dungeon Chambers table, which you can use if your dungeon isn’t an exact fit for one of the standard types of dungeon or if you want to mix things up.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="cdd461e0-f846-4c4e-8383-f10238da1ea1">Relying on random rolls to stock an entire dungeon can lead to incongruous results. A tiny room might end up being identified as a temple, while the huge chamber next door serves as storage. It can be fun to try to make sense of such strange design ideas, but make changes as you see fit. You can set aside a few key rooms and create specific contents for them.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="8a3002b8-bc3e-40dc-b200-c1c0d89a2f5e">Once you have a sense of the purpose of the various dungeon chambers, you can think about the contents of those areas. The Dungeon Chamber Contents table allows you to randomly roll contents for a chamber, or you can choose contents for specific areas. If you choose contents, be sure to include an interesting, colorful assortment of things. In addition to the contents shown on this table, refer to “<a href="#DungeonDressing" data-content-chunk-id="5c118e3c-309e-41d1-b21d-95f89aa5766f">Dungeon Dressing</a>” later in this appendix for additional items and elements to fill rooms.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="7c58e7d4-81c8-43ef-881d-225452a49950">In the Dungeon Chamber Contents table, a “dominant inhabitant” is a creature that controls an area. Pets and allied creatures are subservient to the dominant inhabitant. “Random creatures” are scavengers or nuisances, usually lone monsters or small groups passing through the area. They include such creatures as carrion crawlers, dire rats, gelatinous cubes, and rust monsters. See chapter 3, "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/creating-adventures" data-content-chunk-id="931b509c-b551-4292-8037-986353ae02a0">Creating Adventures</a>" for more information on random encounters.</p>

To foster variety and suspense, be sure to include encounters of varying difficulty.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c866b625-b947-41ba-94b0-2087a2f45785">A powerful creature encountered early in the dungeon sets an exciting tone and forces the adventurers to rely on their wits. For example, an <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16782-ancient-red-dragon" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16782-tooltip">ancient red dragon</a> might slumber on the first level of a dungeon, a pall of smoke and the sound of its heavy breathing filling the chambers near its lair. Clever characters will do their utmost to avoid the dragon, even as the party’s brave thief makes off with a few coins from its hoard.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="97ec455c-cb87-44f4-86da-9a24f7067a64">Not all monsters are automatically hostile. When placing monsters in your dungeon, consider their relationships to nearby creatures and their attitudes toward adventurers. Characters might be able to appease a hungry beast by offering it food, and smarter creatures have complex motivations. The Monster Motivation table lets you use a monster’s goals to define its presence in the dungeon.</p>
<p data-content-chunk-id="c15ae147-4f01-480f-be88-992cc8cdc443">For large groups of monsters encountered across multiple chambers, motivation could apply to the entire group, or each subgroup could have conflicting goals.</p>

However, unless you have something specific in mind, you’re better off conserving your time and energy by repurposing an existing map. Published adventures and the Internet are terrific sources for maps. A few sample maps are included here as well. Use them as you will!</p>
