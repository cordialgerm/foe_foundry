        storm of falling stars devastated the city on that woeful eve, leaving behind a meteorite that would have
        lasting effects. Fifteen years later, Drakkenheim is a dismal urban wasteland contaminated by otherworldly magic
        and haunted by hideous monsters. Fantastic wealth, lost knowledge, and powerful artifacts lie ready for the
        taking by adventurers brave or foolish enough to venture into the ruins. However, even those who survive the
        dangers of Drakkenheim may not return unmarked by its terrors!</p>

        adventure set in a gothic renaissance ruined city. The campaign is designed with four player characters in mind,
        so adjust accordingly for smaller or larger groups. You can play <em>Drakkenheim</em> as a series of
        loosely-connected exploration quests or an unpredictable narrative filled with faction conflict. The material
        herein will challenge characters from 1st to 13th level.</p>

            on dangerous expeditions into monster-filled ruins, haunted streets, decrepit gardens, shattered mage
            towers, baroque cathedrals, and ancient castles to plunder treasure and solve mysteries.</li>

            factions clash over the ruins of Drakkenheim. A tangled web of secrets, subterfuge, and sabotage awaits when
            the factions’ opposing objectives and your characters’ personal goals come into conflict!</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="b2e328d5-e545-4405-8896-cef39a7a4d17"><strong>COMBAT.</strong> Beyond fierce warriors
            dispatched by the factions, all manner of otherworldly horrors inhabit Drakkenheim. Characters battle undead
            husks, predatory beasts, mutated monstrosities, and terrifying abominations produced by the mysterious
            meteor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="96978d7c-38a3-4a74-996e-15ec935ac01a">You’ll need a copy of the core rules for Fifth
        Edition to properly run this adventure. When reading this book, text in <strong>bold</strong> usually references
        a creature or non-player character stat block, while text in <em>italics</em> often indicates spells or magic
        items. Many new monsters, items, and spells are described in the appendix sections of this book; otherwise,
        consult the Fifth Edition core rules.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f0b2d359-6cc5-4e36-9c0e-51997b2b1267">Iridescent crystals of vast magical potential are
        found throughout Drakkenheim. Known as delerium, these lambent stones emanate unnatural energies that induce
        madness and monstrous transformations. Despite these dangers, delerium is ideally suited to crafting magic items
        and fuelling mighty new spells. Sorcerers, warlocks, wizards, and all manner of occult magicians crave its
        supernatural power, thus delerium commands a high price within arcane circles and underground markets alike.
        Many prospectors risk everything to collect a few fragments, but the true origins of the strange mineral remain
        unknown. The rival factions stand divided over whether the crystals should be destroyed, harnessed, or
        worshipped, and their simmering disagreements threaten outright war. <a

        Westemär, ruled by the imperious House von Kessel. A decade of bloody civil war erupted after the city’s
        destruction. The realm was left shattered and the royal line broken. Now, the political order of the wider world
        lies in shambles, torn apart by religious schism and military conflict, and only a faint hope remains that the
        city can be rebuilt and the nation restored.</p>

        their ambitious agendas. Though their ideologies and methods differ, each seeks valuable resources and lost
        secrets within the city. However, the ruins present many confounding obstacles for their agents. As such, all
        the factions hope to attract talented adventurers to their cause, drawing would-be heroes into a fierce
        political intrigue that may boil over into violent struggle. Those who wish to decide the fate of Drakkenheim
        must choose their allies well and their enemies carefully! <a href="/sources/dodr/factions"

        taken root in their nation’s capital. Each has pledged their swords and lives to rebuild Drakkenheim and restore
        the Realm of Westemär. Several noble houses have set aside their feuds to support the Hooded Lanterns’ efforts.
        These families believe once the city is restored, evidence will emerge revealing the true heir to the throne of

        prospectors, and explorers drawn to the city, extort and rob adventurers, smuggle delerium to disreputable
        clients in distant lands, and plunder the fantastic treasures and incredible wealth left behind in the city. The
        Queen of Thieves dreams of building an influential and powerful criminal empire forged in the anarchy and

        incursions. The questing knights normally travel the realms in small bands and companies, and adhere to the
        Faith of the Sacred Flame, the dominant religion across the continent. They believe delerium is a contaminating
        blight borne of the darkest chaos, and have resolved to annihilate the corrupted crystals, slay every monster it
        has created, and hunt down diabolical mages who would wield its power to work evil magic. Now an entire regiment

        Mathias and branded her followers as an insane cult with heretical beliefs and blasphemous practices. Even

        manufacture of magical wares, and orchestrates an influential arcane syndicate that provides occult counsel to
        the nobility of the continent. However, the Academy was dealt a terrible blow following Drakkenheim’s
        destruction, as the city was home to their greatest stronghold: the Inscrutable Tower. <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c19d449a-1b27-45a2-8b2a-5ff9dfe6b720"><em><strong>Apocalyptic Vision.</strong></em> I have
        been haunted by visions of the meteor for fifteen years. Every time I sleep, I see it crashing down upon me. My
        personal quest is to see for myself what lies at the heart of the crater. I must overcome whatever I find there
        in order to stop these nightmares.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="819f3e4d-3e25-4450-8b87-0daa10f4b8d9"><em><strong>Arcane Secrets.</strong></em> Forbidden
        lore lies in Drakkenheim. Several dark wizards living in the ruins have mastered terrible and powerful new
        magic. The Inscrutable Tower library stands unguarded, filled with spellbooks containing secret arcana. My
        personal quest is to learn these spells.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="890d8c7b-3071-4de2-a979-33f04e1c7a5b"><em><strong>Blighted Landscape.</strong></em> A
        blight on the natural order envelops Drakkenheim, but the contamination could spread beyond the city. My
        personal quest is to study the unnatural phenomena found within the most corrupt places in the city: Queen’s
        Park Garden, the underground waterways, and the Crater’s Edge. Perhaps then I can develop a way to reverse the
        contamination.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0ee58b96-2e84-411b-8c34-42029a447cf7"><em><strong>Claim the Throne.</strong></em> Though
        my family has fallen on hard times, we were distantly related to the royal House von Kessel. I may have a claim
        to the throne of Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to search the cathedral, noble estates, and the castle for
        sufficient evidence to conclusively prove my inheritance. Then I will take the crown for myself.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4fb26af7-ad0a-4c71-8610-e07f9802d96e"><em><strong>Faction Aspirant.</strong></em> I
        believe strongly in the ideals and goals of one of the five factions: either the Amethyst Academy, the Followers
        of the Falling Fire, the Hooded Lanterns, the Knights of the Silver Order, or the Queen’s Men. My personal quest
        is to join the faction, aid their mission, climb the ranks, and rise to a high leadership position within their
        organization.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d5257775-81d1-4a16-bec1-287b96c70078"><em><strong>Family Matter.</strong></em> One of my
        family members or close friends has become mixed up with one of the factions. Perhaps they have foolishly
        decided to join the organization. Alternatively, they’ve been taken prisoner by the faction due to some trespass
        or misunderstanding. Either way, my personal quest is to bring them back home.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c2671ce6-8b9c-43c7-9c80-7fcfb614c3ff"><em><strong>Find a Cure.</strong></em> I have a
        friend, family member, or loved one who was contaminated by delerium and turned into a monster. They have gone
        mad, and are lost somewhere in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to locate them, then discover a way to reverse
        their horrific transformation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0ee29afb-6fd8-48b9-877a-42e51034ae38"><em><strong>Lost Heirloom.</strong></em> I used to
        live in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to recover a lost heirloom from my old home, which was located
        somewhere in the Inner City. Perhaps the item is sentimental, valuable only to members of my family.
        Alternatively it may have magical properties, and I wish to use these powers to aid my own ambitions.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4a373da7-9971-478a-8de8-09671118514f"><em><strong>Monster Slayer.</strong></em> I wish to
        leave behind a heroic legacy by defeating dread beasts. My personal quest is to slay three of the greatest
        monsters rumoured to dwell in Drakkenheim, and bring back their heads as trophies. Each must be a notable
        creature with a challenge rating greater than my own level when I defeat them. My allies can assist me, but I
        must strike the decisive blow myself!</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8514d571-9780-4bc2-b822-940a21e77bbc"><em><strong>Overwhelming Debt.</strong></em> I owe a
        tremendous debt of 10,000 gold pieces, maybe more. My personal quest is to pay it back by making a fortune in
        Drakkenheim collecting delerium, plunder, and completing work-for-hire. Meanwhile, I must hide from bounty
        hunters my creditor send to kill me.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9b130d85-9f84-4cfe-b44c-a0c2e31ccb44"><em><strong>Personal Pilgrimage.</strong></em> As an
        acolyte of the faith, my personal quest is to visit several holy places in the city and perform a sacred ritual
        before the remains of the martyrs interred within each: the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, Saint Selina’s
        Monastery, and the Chapel in Castle Drakken. Through these devoted acts I will understand my place in the divine
        order.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4c23bc6d-308c-4b76-95b9-c97640f38e97"><em><strong>Score to Settle.</strong></em> I have

        </h3>
        <p><a href="/sources/dodr/the-world-of-drakkenheim">Appendix E: The World of Drakkenheim</a> explains these
            background details further, but the setting of Drakkenheim diverges from the default assumptions of Fifth
            Edition in four key ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The gods are silent and distant.</strong> They don’t manifest physically nor speak with
                worshippers, and do not interfere in earthly matters. Planar cosmology is mysterious and unknowable, but
                sages have still developed many conflicting (and wildly incorrect) theories.</li>
            <li><strong>Divine spellcasting powers aren’t granted by gods.</strong> Instead, clerics, druids, and
                paladins tap into sacred energies through devotion, meditation, and resolve. Violating one’s religious
                tenets won’t result in a loss of this ability, but a crisis of faith might.</li>
            <li><strong>Individuals can’t become wizards through study alone.</strong> The arcane magic of both
                sorcerers and wizards alike is borne in the blood, which may be harnessed via practice and study. The
                laws of the land bar arcane spellcasters from holding noble titles.</li>
            <li><strong>High-level NPCs and spellcasters are exceptionally rare in the wider world.</strong> Despite
                their few numbers, such people still have a profound impact on society. However, Drakkenheim has
                attracted an uncommonly high concentration of such individuals.</li>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6ecae0dd-abb0-4c3f-bf7f-ba80620c3d99">The characters arrive in Drakkenheim to pursue their
        personal quests or a few freelance missions from friendly contacts in Emberwood Village. They face ravenous <a
            class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/4086136-ratling"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/4086136-tooltip">ratlings</a>, malfeasant wizards, and rival adventurers in the
        Outer City Ruins. During their first forays into the city, the characters witness the strange magic of delerium
        and contend with the mysterious Haze. The threat of contamination makes survival in Drakkenheim difficult and
        dangerous. The characters may seek assistance and resources from the five factions to accomplish their goals and
        find a way deeper into the city.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="753a4e7d-9ee4-4f4d-9ab6-587228bc2cdf">As the characters learn more about the factions’
        differing ideologies, the various faction leaders take notice of their progress. Once the characters
        successfully traverse the City Walls and begin exploring the Inner City Ruins, each leader approaches the
        characters for help with their objectives. They appeal to the characters’ Ideals and Bonds, offer resources and
        support, and promise crucial assistance with the characters’ personal quests.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5ba4e894-ecba-43d7-8d57-f4f39e4c39bd">However, as the characters collaborate with the
        factions to advance their mutual goals, they become increasingly entangled in the political machinations between
        the competing groups. Each organization has a different vision for the future of Drakkenheim, and the tenuous
        peace won’t last much longer. Nevertheless, with the support of one or more of these groups, the characters can
        explore dangerous Inner City locations such as the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, the Inscrutable Tower of the
        Amethyst Academy, or perhaps even mount an expedition into the crater. Characters may unearth stunning
        revelations from Drakkenheim’s past and recover powerful artifact which threaten the balance of power between
        the factions. They might even discover how the Haze threatens to engulf the world itself.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="91765b6c-5eec-480d-8338-f75bdd746dfb">The factions are deeply divided over what must be
        done to solve these problems. As a result, simmering tensions boil over into outright conflict. As the city
        streets become a battlefield between the organizations, the faction leaders each demand the characters’ loyalty.
        Now, the characters must decide which factions are their allies, and which are their enemies. Eventually, the
        unraveling situation may require the characters to act directly against one or more of the factions, who respond
        with counterstrikes of their own. In turn, the characters may launch major assaults against enemy factions to
        destroy their strongholds, defeat their leaders, and drive them out of Drakkenheim. As the conflict reaches its
        zenith, the surviving factions set their master plans into motion, requiring an expedition into Castle Drakken.
        There, a final showdown will decide the fate of Drakkenheim.</p>

        scenarios intentionally stack the odds against the player characters. They must use cunning, ingenuity, and

        replace a slain character, or perhaps be encountered as the lone survivor of another adventuring party.
        Alternatively, they might play a faction member assigned to the party as a reinforcement.</p>

        <p><em>“Magic attracts more magic. Under extraordinarily rare circumstances, magical energies crystallize into
                delerium. The stones slowly draw more raw magic into the world from distant planes, possible realities,
                and alternate dimensions. The rate is exponential. Considerably more leakage occurs around vast
                quantities of delerium. These chaotic energies are inherently destabilizing. Unfocused magic conjures up
                paradoxical improbabilities at random, leaving behind lingering eldritch contamination. Uncontained,
                these magical forces manifest as the Haze. More delerium forms within, and so the process
                accelerates.”</em></p>
        <p><em>– Archwizard Ryan Greymere</em></p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="84fc2603-b6d0-41ea-a407-a5c52a5efbfa">The meteor left behind vast deposits of delerium,
        enough to manifest an erratic magical field called the <strong>Haze.</strong> New delerium deposits gradually
        emerge within the Haze, which causes the affected region to expand slowly over time. Left unchecked, the Haze
        can overtake an entire world within a few centuries, leaving behind a chaotic landscape of churning madness and
        wild magic. The infected world cataclysmically shatters when more destructive magic inevitably erupts, sending a
        hail of delerium-filled comets throughout the cosmos. After hurtling through the Astral Void for eons, some
        collide with new worlds where the process begins again. Countless worlds have met this fate, the rest are wholly
        ignorant of the doom that might one day descend upon them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="be73c8ca-4cd6-4739-aef9-002f4a2e9d7f">If nothing is done to stop the spread, the Haze will
        fully engulf Westemär in roughly one hundred and fifty years. Once this happens, little hope for reversal
        remains, and the dread mists will envelop the world two centuries thereafter. Civilization and society collapse
        into a monster-filled wasteland that catastrophically ruptures about one thousand years later.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a6f00a2e-340d-474e-9132-4874f6ba1c49">None know the complete truth about the Haze at the
        outset of the campaign, and little knowledge is revealed via divination magic save mad whispers. Throughout the
        adventure, player characters may find clues about delerium from which they may develop their own theories and
        speculations regarding the origins of the meteor. They can learn much by exploring deep into the ruins,
        especially locations such as the Inscrutable Tower, the crater, and Castle Drakken. Faction leaders and
        malfeasant wizards might also offer their research and insights to help players along the way.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d4f9702b-9bf8-451e-81fc-901a7a625cfa">House von Kessel ruled Westemär from the capital of
        Drakkenheim for one hundred fifty years. The last monarch, Ulrich IV, inherited a period of relative political
        stability, and so pursued interests in architecture, education, and carnal affairs instead of politics and
        warfare. He married a Caspian princess, Lenore, and they had three children: Leonard, Katarina, and Eliza.
        Ulrich IV was ten years into his reign when the meteor struck Drakkenheim. The King, his wife, and their
        children were never seen again after that day, but their true fate remains a mystery.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="69c95e50-4ba9-40e5-b50b-0d1478b40944">However, many members of the royal household were
        not in Drakkenheim when the meteor struck, including the King’s younger siblings, Mannfred and Cecilia von
        Kessel. The two spent vast sums commissioning the clergy of the Sacred Flame and the mages of the Amethyst
        Academy to use divination magic to discern what happened, but to no avail. They nearly bankrupted themselves by
        launching multiple large-scale military expeditions attempting to reclaim Drakkenheim, all of which failed.
        Eventually, Mannfred became convinced further efforts were futile, and proposed he would take up the crown and
        relocate the capital. However, Cecilia contested the claim, arguing there was no conclusive evidence that
        confirmed their brother and his children were dead. The nobility was divided over the issue, and a civil war
        ensued that raged for nearly a decade. As Westemär itself descended into political and financial ruin, Mannfred
        von Kessel and his children were assassinated in a dramatic betrayal. Cecilia von Kessel herself died
        unexpectedly only a few days later, leaving behind no heirs of her own. Lacking a clear successor, the Civil War
        ended with a whimper.</p>

        however, many relatives and cadet branches exist. As such, the House von Kessel family tree has been left
        intentionally vague so you and your players may freely insert your own player and non-player characters as
        potential heirs. They need not be one of Ulrich’s known children, but instead illegitimate offspring, a
        grandchild, niece, nephew, or other family relative. The most dramatically compelling possibilities include:</p>

        it, and gain the support to actually take the crown. Finally, it’s possible another noble household could gain
        sufficient political clout and military power to turn a tenuous claim into a credible one, and simply supplant
        House von Kessel entirely.</p>

        why a potential claimant to the throne hasn’t emerged yet. Decades of affairs, disaster, and war have ravaged
        the public records, and conclusively determining heredity via magical means requires the blood or remains of
        Ulrich IV. While an heir could possess a locket, signet ring, or some other document, this must be substantiated
        with something from the ruins to prove their identity and ancestry. Consider introducing one of the following
        additional complications:</p>

            the Unknown</h3>
        <p>What has happened to Drakkenheim is simply a cosmic accident. It is not the intentional work of an
            inscrutable extraplanar being, nor did any chortling demon lord or scheming evil deity set these events in
            motion. Instead, it is more akin to a natural disaster, albeit one caused by the magical forces that
            underscore the cosmos. Much like an earthquake, hurricane, or volcano, the calamitous forces that cause such
            magical catastrophes are entirely beyond mortal means to control or reverse. This fact may come as a
            surprise to players who expect they can simply defeat some tangible evil entity and save the world. However,
            the dark fantasy and cosmic horror literature that inspired this adventure rarely ends in such clear-cut
            ways. Instead, the heroic actions of the player characters may avert further disaster, but will never erase
            the damage that has already been done.</p>
        <p>While outwardly presenting a tantalizing mystery, the meteor functions more as a catalyst for conflict in
            Drakkenheim. My players failed to fully uncover the origins of the meteor during their adventures, but our
            campaign still had an immensely satisfying conclusion. In fact, themes of cosmic horror and madness are
            greatly enhanced when the real answers are never fully understood.</p>

        quest ties the character strongly to a central conflict in the campaign. A fun twist is introducing a rival

        of the children of Ulrich IV.</p>

        This character will need to seek out the means to survive the most contaminated area in the city. Once they
        reach the heart of the crater, the character has another apocalyptic vision when they touch the Delerium Heart.
        The character must now decide what they will do to save the world.</p>

        Advancement in a faction requires a full commitment from the character, exclusive of any other faction.
        Achieving this quest happens when a faction’s leader regards the character as a capable and trusted confidant,
        and appoints them as their right-hand lieutenant. The most challenging aspect of this quest are the conflicts of
        interest it may cause with the other player characters, but embrace this conflict as a sticking point between

        <li data-content-chunk-id="647b7784-6ce6-40b9-8ed1-666c6015a49a">The quest should require characters to explore
            one or more locations within the Inner City ruins. A character shouldn’t be able to complete their personal
            quest too early. Conversely, a personal quest involving Castle Drakken likely can’t be completed until late
            in the campaign.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="e6ce6d66-72d2-49ea-8c23-85070dbc1d03">It should present some sort of complication
            with one of the factions, or perhaps require the characters to seek help from the faction to complete their
            quest.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="bf3b0781-2071-4e8d-b6db-9e5d936e2d66">The quest should be specific and achievable,
            and not related to character advancement (such as reaching 10th level or taking a specific feat).</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="6ab5a309-6601-4596-aa4e-36be9e807ecb">Be careful about using a “ticking clock” for a
            personal quest. While this can introduce a compelling complication, focus on long-term goals rather than
            extremely urgent matters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e353b3a6-e884-4afe-aa99-027ccdcc1228">Players often suggest personal quests involving
        missing persons, lost objects, or revenge. Many example personal quests provided already cover such motivations,
        such as “A Family Matter’’, “A Lost Heirloom”, and “A Score to Settle”. Ask players to consider these options
        first. Perhaps their idea can be easily adapted to work with one of these quests (or vice versa).</p>

            href="/sources/dodr/factions" data-content-chunk-id="4d3a07a9-85c6-41ce-a405-7f8e470c8ecd">Chapter 3:
            Factions</a> describes the background, objectives, roleplaying traits, major NPCs, and assets of each
        faction. Using this information, it’s up to you to determine how the factions might help or hinder the player
        characters during their adventures in Drakkenheim.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1abac75a-d5f5-45f3-91c6-63a759cd6a62">Rather than uniting the factions as one against a
        common foe, the player characters must navigate a fractious web of intrigue, negotiation, sabotage, and violent
        conflict if they wish to uncover the greatest treasures and secrets in Drakkenheim. Their relationships with
        each faction will naturally develop as a consequence of the character’s choices, but it’s ultimately up to them
        to decide who they want to join and who they will oppose. Thus, each individual faction might become a
        supportive patron, fierce competitor, close ally, bitter enemy, or anything in between.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2d860e6d-44ec-4822-bd6d-32c68f1ae8da">Exploring the most dangerous locations in
        Drakkenheim is extraordinarily difficult without gaining the support (or inciting the ire) of one or more
        factions. Correspondingly, the factions need the player characters’ help to accomplish their own goals in the
        city, and offer rewards to their allies and assistance with the characters’ personal quests. Conversely,
        factions that become antagonistic create dynamic problems and new complications throughout the campaign when
        they use their resources against the characters. Either way, the factions are best played in a reactive manner.
        Their leaders make firm demands when characters try to negotiate, orchestrate counterstrikes when characters
        foil their plans, and conduct sabotage when characters oppose their goals.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a0b9ec05-58b8-42ee-acb0-7ed50f4db937">Eventually, these interactions may blossom into a
        full-scale hostility between the factions. Once this occurs, aim to keep each faction in play as long as
        possible. Don’t be afraid of letting the players get in over their heads if they make enemies with more than one
        faction, either. Your players will find surprising ways to foil the factions, and develop cunning plans when
        they collaborate with them. Embrace their creativity by responding with new challenges, and rewarding players
        when they succeed by having their allies recognize their accomplishments. The factions are equipped with the
        tools to help you escalate tension and raise the stakes of the conflict in interesting ways.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9755162a-44fb-4bf9-ae90-920f8613124d">Many adventure sites provide hooks and missions
        connected to the factions you may use to prompt the characters to visit each area. Each location also details
        how the factions could respond to possible events and outcomes that may occur.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7b2da95b-fdc6-4db2-8b74-293934ffbd7f">Despite their conflicts, the faction leaders know
        they can’t achieve their goals on their own. Not only do they seek the aid of the player characters, many
        factions see the benefits to collaborating with each other. Diplomatic characters could negotiate an alliance,
        truce, or ceasefire between two (or more) factions. Convincing any two factions to set aside their differences
        and work together should be difficult, but achievable. In order to broker such a deal, characters will need to
        demonstrate how the alliance will help both factions achieve their objectives, but also make an appeal to the
        roleplaying traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws of the factions and their leaders. These tense negotiations can
        make for some of the most memorable moments in the campaign, so potential alliances are best arranged in
        dramatic locations such as the faction strongholds and the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bf8ed691-ccd0-4a75-8850-705b2c2ca9eb">The factions have been designed such that a
        long-term alliance between any two factions is achievable, and a short-term truce involving three is difficult
        but entirely possible. Countless situations in your campaign may emerge that could cause the factions to
        re-evaluate their priorities, and clever and convincing players might present compelling arguments. Bear in mind
        of course, that the factions are composed of people: and people don’t always act in logical ways. These
        alliances are always unstable, however, as each faction presses to have their own goals prioritized. Unless the
        player characters make an ongoing effort to keep a coalition together, any alliance between factions will
        inevitably collapse.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fe8f8641-bfb3-4e36-ab97-40027555a44c">Factions such as the Amethyst Academy and the
        Queen’s Men may even use alliances as a convenient opportunity to manipulate the player characters and the other
        factions, and possibly even make a dramatic reversal at a critical moment. Especially cunning characters might
        help the factions weave such deceptions and plots, resulting in brutal betrayal against an unsuspecting ally
        which allows the faction to seize full control of Drakkenheim for themselves.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a17c1c8-d181-4bcd-a84f-98f87e813625">Since the threat of betrayal is so real, player
        characters who build a coalition between multiple factions may compromise the trust they earn with an individual
        faction. They won’t receive the greatest boons the faction can offer, and faction agents don’t trust characters
        with sensitive information. Faction leaders are wary of double-agents, and would much rather see the player
        characters make a commitment to them. As a result, the player characters should constantly be called upon to
        demonstrate their loyalty.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="18a21386-3425-4c0a-8d56-60b17183398a">Unfortunately for the player characters, discovering
        the full properties of delerium and facts regarding the meteor’s origins will not unite the factions. Instead,
        these revelations will drive further wedges between the fractious groups since they deeply disagree on the best
        way to address the problem. Given that The Haze threatens to overtake the entire world, it may at first appear
        the Silver Order is completely correct that the crystals must be destroyed. Throughout the campaign however, the
        feasibility of accomplishing such a task should be consistently cast in doubt. You should strive to contrast
        this viewpoint against the rational yet questionable stance of the Amethyst Academy which insists arcane means
        may harness delerium to prevent further catastrophe, and the zealous and apocalyptic prophecies of the Followers
        of the Falling Fire. Whenever it seems like the players have made up their minds, rival factions should present
        a gnawing sense that some alternative might still be possible. You should avoid presenting any “correct” answer:
        It’s up to the characters to piece it all together, draw their own conclusions, and decide how to act.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c673c819-649c-4909-8fcf-c7dab9913a86">As such, there is no fixed resolution to the faction
        conflict. By the end of the campaign, several factions could be routed from Drakkenheim entirely, their leaders
        slain and strongholds toppled. While a showdown in Castle Drakken is inevitable, who exactly is present for that

        pre-generated stat blocks from the Core Rules rather than spending time making character sheets for these NPCs
        like you would a player character. When it comes to making a good rival, interesting roleplaying traits are far
        more important than game statistics. A rival works well when they reflect the personalities and flaws of the
        player characters themselves, then exaggerate their best and worst qualities to the extreme while sharing some
        common ground. Diametrically opposing those traits tends to result in antagonists, not rivals. Flesh out such
        characters by pulling in one or two roleplaying traits from one of the backgrounds or personal quests presented
        in this book.</p>

        asks each of them about their reasons for travelling to Drakkenheim, and how the characters met each other. This
        is a perfect opportunity to introduce the player characters, their relationships, and personal quests. In turn,
        Marlowe can share the following information with characters:</p>

            Gainsbury, who runs a supply company in Emberwood Village. Armin sells useful adventuring equipment and can
            provide good advice about exploring the ruins.</li>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1097523b-58de-4a35-92d6-83edaef4adea">This details a brief history of each faction and its
        recent activities in Drakkenheim.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="a48a0612-bc53-41e2-b7ef-e0cc0a522d28">These describe the faction’s major goals in
        Drakkenheim. Most concern two core conflicts that define the campaign: <em>Who should control Drakkenheim? What
            should be done about delerium?</em> Conflict is inevitable because every faction desires very different
        outcomes with regard to these questions. All wish to control the ruins and decide how delerium will be used (or
        destroyed). In addition, some factions have additional objectives which may directly oppose those of a rival
        faction.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="74fa499b-81bb-4dd1-8f50-ed0e9d902f2f">Each faction’s <strong>Roleplaying Traits</strong>
        resonate strongly with their <strong>Objectives.</strong> However, a faction may tolerate setting aside or even
        adjusting its objectives if it perceives a chance for greater gain in the future; if acting on its objectives
        would incite overwhelming retribution from political forces beyond Drakkenheim; or if circumstances emerge where
        achieving its objectives would contradict the faction’s own ideals. In such a situation, a faction might even
        modify its objectives. Player characters might create alliances or expose weaknesses in the factions by taking
        advantage of this fact.</p>

            data-content-chunk-id="0c42ed1d-b2c0-4e27-8b71-09beb5df46d4"></a>Faction Leader</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e99a8c52-b17e-4ca4-b5ea-fd4b0f3e97f5">A formidable legendary non-player character commands
        each faction. These faction leaders issue orders to faction agents, direct faction resources, and make the final
        decision on how the faction acts in all matters. Each has their own individual Personality Traits, Ideals,
        Bonds, and Flaws, and perhaps a few dark secrets too! As conflict in Drakkenheim escalates, the player
        characters should interact with the faction leaders often, and might even bring several faction leaders together
        for negotiations.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2c9fd603-2460-46c7-9290-8b76a2fc446e">The faction leaders spend most of their time
        coordinating strategy and logistics within their faction stronghold. They are the organizational lynchpin for
        their entire faction, and rarely take to the field. A faction leader should only personally venture into
        Drakkenheim for a major gathering or offensive involving the cathedral, Castle Drakken, or a faction stronghold.
        The risk to the faction is simply too great to risk their lives in the field otherwise.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="43a59bf1-4f9e-47dc-9770-b29ca9d9a4d9">If a faction leader is slain or permanently <a

            data-tooltip-href="/conditions/7-tooltip">incapacitated</a>, the faction must withdraw from Drakkenheim
        shortly thereafter unless there is someone else to take up their mantle. Surviving faction agents may seek
        immediate retribution, but the death of a faction leader seals their defeat in Drakkenheim for the foreseeable
        future.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ec25600c-493c-4925-afe0-5950e6424b27">Under the right circumstances, a player character
        who demonstrates unwavering belief in the faction and great leadership could rise through the ranks and replace
        a faction leader.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FactionLieutenant"
        data-content-chunk-id="c4ae6e48-a471-4c26-8c5b-8394d6332fec"><a href="#FactionLieutenant"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5f00c327-5802-48ad-9b96-d1cb65686788">The faction lieutenant is the right-hand of the
        faction leader. As such, the lieutenant is usually the first point of contact the player characters have with a
        faction, and most can be encountered in Emberwood Village. Once the lieutenant is confident the players are
        capable and trustworthy collaborators, they’ll facilitate an introduction with the faction leader.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="440a9273-f313-41da-87a5-78fb8b23624d">Many lieutenants also lead elite faction strike
        teams. If the lieutenant is slain, the faction leader will appoint another faction member as a replacement.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d63450a7-faf4-4da0-96f8-9a9f78a7241a">Each faction has numerous rank-and-file members,
        support staff, craftspeople, recruits, and other followers. Use these lists to generate quick NPCs who might be
        guarding a stronghold, relaying a message, maintaining the supply lines, or fighting alongside (or against!) the
        player characters. You can add additional NPCs to the factions if you wish, but be careful when adding
        high-level NPCs or spellcasters capable of casting spells above 3rd level. The factions have specific and
        limited access to high-level magic. Powerful NPCs are meant to be rare so the player characters may rise to a
        position of importance and prominence during the campaign.</p>

        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="RoleplayingCharacteristics"><a
                href="#RoleplayingCharacteristics"></a>Roleplaying Characteristics</h4>
        <p>Much like a player character, every faction has Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws. Rather than
            qualities of any individual person, these describe ideological beliefs shared by all faction members. Use
            these characteristics to guide roleplaying interactions with faction agents, determine the way the faction
            behaves, and judge how their leaders might react to changing circumstances or unexpected events.</p>
        <p>Faction NPCs often possess these characteristics, but may have their own personal interpretations. However, a
            faction that betrays its ideals or bonds has betrayed its own members. When a faction repeatedly fails to
            uphold its own ideals and bonds, its agents might start deserting Drakkenheim or refuse to comply when
            called to action.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f2a3bd19-dd54-41d6-8305-11edadfc4566">Most factions have several holdings in Drakkenheim,
        but one major location is the faction stronghold. Full details on each faction stronghold are described in <a

            data-content-chunk-id="e5360403-f76d-4a4c-96e8-bb40db103bfb">chapter 8</a>. This is where most faction
        members reside and where many faction resources are kept. If a faction loses its stronghold, the rank-and-file
        members are routed and the power of the faction is broken. If the faction leader survives, they may still be
        able to muster together a few remaining diehard agents to cause a few more complications for the player
        characters, but the faction teeters on the brink of defeat.</p>

        rough progression: those presented first may lead to later ones. Characters who complete these missions gain
        greater respect and trust from the faction, and are rewarded with faction boons (described below). In addition,
        when the player characters complete a faction mission they receive experience points based on the advancement

        order: latter boons should only be offered later in the campaign to characters who have demonstrated their
        commitment to the faction. Unless otherwise indicated, a faction can only offer each boon once. Beyond this, how
        often you reward characters with a faction boon is up to you.</p>

        intentionally abstract so you may exercise your judgement and decide what’s appropriate given the circumstances.
        Regardless, the factions do not have infinite resources. Every faction is stretched thin, and must cope with
        severe limits and constraints on their finances, personnel, materials, equipment, and time. The nearest large
        city is several weeks’ travel away and the surrounding villages have been abandoned. More troops require
        exponentially more supplies since there are so few uncontaminated food and water sources. For many of the
        factions, simply maintaining the ground they currently hold requires everything they’ve got. <strong>This is why
            the factions need the player characters to help them.</strong></p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c0836f33-79c9-4a5b-a8e1-194cef70b69c">The characters may occasionally demand more from the
        factions; citing dire need or urgent circumstances. If the characters push hard for more resources and appeal to
        the factions’ ideals, objectives, and bonds, you might grant them an additional boon for that mission. However,
        the next time the characters need help from the faction or would receive a boon, the faction can’t offer them
        anything as they are recuperating their stockpile!</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e73139fc-9ab3-4f7c-a462-92ea2dbcb360">An allied faction might send strike teams as
        reinforcements to help the player characters on a critical mission. Consequently, an enemy faction can dispatch
        a strike team against the player characters to disrupt missions, capture them, or even assassinate them. Each
        faction keeps tabs on the player characters, and might even send a strike team to interfere during a mission
        that wouldn’t otherwise involve them just to sabotage the characters’ efforts. More ruthless factions might take
        the fight directly to the characters’ doorsteps, hitting them while they are retreating, recuperating, or simply
        unprepared for battle. Especially devious GMs may opt to have faction strike teams operate behind-the-scenes by
        carrying out attacks while the player characters are occupied elsewhere!</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7c021f7c-8e95-48dd-8ace-3e923e1a7652"><em><strong>Mustering Forces.</strong></em> Any
        faction can call up a strike team within a few hour’s notice. However, mustering up larger forces for major
        offensives takes time. When a faction needs to assemble multiple teams at once to perform a specific task, it
        takes at least one day per strike team involved. This can give characters the chance to notice something big is
        being planned.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="521bbc3c-5763-49f9-b32a-bcedc5b03938"><em><strong>Reinforcements.</strong></em> The
        factions regularly bring in reinforcements and new recruits. However, increasing casualties amongst the
        rank-and-file devastate morale within all the factions, and it’s a problem when its more elite strike teams are
        captured, defeated, or killed. When a faction strike team is destroyed, it takes roughly five days for the
        faction to assemble a replacement team. Under desperate circumstances, a faction can put together another group
        immediately. Should this group also be taken out, it takes ten days to draw up further replacements thereafter.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="980c2daa-89ac-42c3-b045-649c47859d8e"><em><strong>Retribution.</strong></em> Faction
        leaders often investigate when their agents go missing. Each faction possesses a web of informants, <a

            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17007-tooltip">scouts</a>, and <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"
            href="/monsters/17021-spy" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17021-tooltip">spies</a>, and can possibly use
        magical means to find out what happened. Unless an active effort is made to conceal what occurred, most factions
        can discover the fate of their agents within seven days and possibly even determine who was responsible.
        Skirmishes between adventurers and low-level faction agents are relatively common in the ruins, so such events
        may not incite immediate retribution, but rather careful observation. If the situation continues to escalate,
        the faction responds.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eeabf5bd-6e1e-4567-b86a-4a664d881e1a"><em><strong>Major Offensives.</strong></em> Every
        faction knows that sending large numbers of soldiers into Drakkenheim is a foolish risk: several attempts have
        been made by much larger forces and failed. The biggest issue is contamination: there simply aren’t enough
        spellcasters and materials to remove it quickly enough. Generally speaking, the factions will only consider
        launching major offensives if it means taking the cathedral, Castle Drakken, or another faction stronghold.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c1322ca2-dfdb-4861-86a0-d0d1eba9157d">Should your player characters become enemies with
        one of the factions, the factions enact these dastardly plots against them. These schemes are presented in
        escalating hostility; so latter schemes are only used in dire conflict. Set one of these schemes into motion the
        next time the player characters venture into the ruins. If the players manage to foil the faction’s schemes, the
        defeated faction will need at least a week before they can muster up another. On the other hand, the factions
        don’t do things “just to get revenge”. They instead consider their long-term goals first. They retreat, regroup,
        and find a way to attack from a position of strength.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="33249dcc-1171-4c86-92dd-e3f66db1de27">You can invent your own schemes. Try using a strike
        team in a creative or unexpected way, or consider the personal capabilities of each faction leader: especially
        the spells, magic items, and unique knowledge at their disposal. Don’t be afraid to turn the player characters’
        own motivations, goals, and flaws against them either!</p>

        characters have demonstrated themselves to be staunch supporters of the faction’s cause. They’ve successfully
        completed multiple missions for the faction that prove their loyalty, including a mission where they acted
        <em>directly</em> against another faction. The faction offers the characters complete access to their resources,
        support, and information. The characters receive faction boons to help them complete missions.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="926c7d0b-2016-44f2-9197-ed8de3307230"><em><strong>Allies.</strong></em> The party and the
        faction are working together to advance their mutual goals, but they have some minor differences and
        disagreements. Characters might be working with multiple factions in this manner. The characters have helped the
        faction in several ways by completing a few missions, and proven themselves reliable and capable. The faction
        rewards characters with boons after they complete these missions.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="72f56040-cccf-4a93-9663-574656daf41a"><em><strong>Indifferent.</strong></em> They are
        neutral. Perhaps they aren’t known to each other yet. The faction is willing to hire the party on a freelance
        basis to help fulfil their objectives—especially ones that require arms’ length interaction (such as working
        against another faction), but the faction doesn’t trust the players yet. They may have had some rough
        interactions with low-level faction members, so the faction won’t offer the players resources, support, or
        information beyond what is required to fulfil any missions they hire them to do. The faction might offer to
        trade for services and pay the characters in gold rather than grant them boons.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9d0d3ea1-3334-4f3c-a0cb-006fc416d5c0"><em><strong>Adversaries.</strong></em> There isn’t
        any trust here. The players show disregard for the faction’s objectives. Minor skirmishes may have broken out
        with low-level faction members. The faction won’t let the players use their resources or help. If the players
        want to repair the relationship, the faction offers the players a chance to complete a mission to demonstrate
        their commitment, possibly by striking directly at a rival faction. The faction occasionally sends strike teams
        to impede the party, disrupt their goals, and dissuade them from entering the city. However, these teams don’t
        try to kill the characters. If violence breaks out, these strike teams either knock the characters out to try to
        capture them, deescalate, or flee.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="df344bd0-74cd-4f2d-810f-820fe01a0a67"><em><strong>Enemies.</strong></em> The characters
        have betrayed the faction’s trust, murdered its members, <em>and</em> are working against the faction’s most
        important goals in a profound way. The faction actively tries to thwart the characters using its schemes, and
        sends its deadly strike teams against the the characters.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7e3c861d-499b-4794-8c71-7bfe27bdd9e0">The Amethyst Academy began as a secret school for
        young sorcerers during a time when arcane magic faced extreme persecution from the clergy of the Sacred Flame.
        The mages located children who manifested magical talents, rescued them from their fearful and paranoid
        communities, and educated them in hidden strongholds and far-away castles so they might wield their abilities
        with trained and refined control. The secret school gradually grew into a secret society in its own right.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c0afb4c8-f1b4-4621-8f3d-c85f50c26ad2">Sequestered in unseen universities to hide from the
        mage-slaying Knights of the Silver Order, the mages pooled their knowledge. They conducted research into arcane
        and cosmological phenomena, and developed the modern practice of wizardry. Over time, the Amethyst Academy
        secured allies amongst the nobility by providing them clandestine magical services and occult counsel, crafting
        enchanted heirlooms, protecting their castles with arcane wards, and teaching their heirs magic.</p>

        the Sacred Flame, a renewed series of brutal inquisitions and vengeful witch-hunts began. What had been a shadow
        conflict between paladins and sorcerers for centuries spilled into outright war between noble houses who
        championed the Faith, and those that supported the Amethyst Academy. These conflicts ended with the <a

            data-content-chunk-id="21d87d13-2154-412f-9f9b-9c44b69ad9cb">Edicts of Lumen</a> (detailed in <a

        ago, this landmark treaty stopped the murderous suppression of arcane magic by the religious ministry, and
        established a new balance of power between mages, the Faith, and the nobility throughout the continent.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b570ec8d-95c9-4ea5-8585-032e919a72a1">The Edicts of Lumen bestow extensive protections,
        full autonomy, and economic advantages to the Amethyst Academy, but also require the Academy to observe strict
        standards of mercantile neutrality and political non-intervention. Most importantly, it grants the Amethyst
        Academy guardianship of any child who demonstrates magical aptitude until they come of age and master their
        abilities. In exchange, the agreement stipulates that all arcane spellcasters are disinherited from any land,
        rank, or titles, including the scions of noble and royal families. Since the Edicts, Academy mages may work
        magic without fear of oppression from church or state, though the organization remains withdrawn as it
        increasingly turns its attention to global affairs and extraplanar happenings. However, the direction and focus
        of the Amethyst Academy has dramatically shifted following the destruction of Drakkenheim, when their greatest
        stronghold was cut off from them.</p>

        Edicts of Lumen, in recent years some have claimed the mages furtively flaunt its restrictions and disregard the
        terms that forbid dark magical practices. Others suspect the mages are weaving an arcane conspiracy to control
        commerce and influence politics while shielding themselves from the wrath of the Sacred Flame.</p>

        well-guarded <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2276-teleportation-circle"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2276-tooltip">teleportation circles</a>, and Academy agents working in
        Drakkenheim usually teleport back and forth between these strongholds and the secret circle in Emberwood
        Village. The sigil sequences of these teleportation circles is a closely guarded secret known only to Academy
        mages who can cast 5th level spells.</p>

            <li>We cannot allow the brutal suppression of arcane magic to ever occur again, so we respect the Edicts of
                Lumen. We must maintain the trust of the nobility and avoid arousing suspicion and hostility from the

                when their minds can be put to much better use. Other lives are disposable.</li>
            <li>We believe only Academy mages possess the intelligence and wisdom to wield arcane magic in a responsible
                way. Magic users who aren’t Academy members are undisciplined amateurs at best, and more often become

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4134a8c4-d49e-406e-a55b-7faa2162cd1a">Far away from Drakkenheim in secret laboratories,
        Amethyst Academy wizards relentlessly research delerium samples recovered from the ruins. Their brilliant minds
        have crafted potent arcane artefacts and invented mighty new spells powered by the vast energies contained
        within the crystals. Though the true origin of delerium remains unknown to them, many Academy assets are now
        dedicated to the study and refinement of delerium. They procure enormous quantities to fuel their esoteric
        experiments and eldritch industries. Rather than risk their own members’ lives in the ruins of Drakkenheim, the
        Academy usually obtains delerium through various grey market sources, typically by hiring adventurers.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d49964a6-8a9e-45c3-b4c9-7a6a60a1fa16">The mages do not disregard the dangers presented by
        delerium’s contaminating properties. In fact, it is precisely because of these hazards that the mages believe
        only they can use the crystals responsibly. Thus, the Academy seeks complete control over this critical resource
        both to protect the wider world and to secure their magical hegemony for the foreseeable future. However, other
        factions are now moving to reclaim Drakkenheim and potentially install a new ruling dynasty. Such political
        upheavals could affect the Academy’s ability to research and harvest delerium. The Academy does not want a ruler
        who will destroy delerium, force the Academy to pay exorbitant sums to obtain it, or impose conditions on how
        the Academy may use the crystals.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a79f4a2f-1418-44a7-b4f0-71bd751f40aa">Ultimately, the Academy has zero interest in seeing
        Drakkenheim restored and rebuilt, and view this as a folly doomed to fail. Rather, they have an ambitious plan
        to transform the city ruins into a quarry for their research and industry. Once they fulfil their other goals,
        the Amethyst Academy wants the other factions to totally abandon Drakkenheim so they can have sole control over
        the ruins.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="bf329d43-8a56-40eb-9f70-5b3b0827e579">Drakkenheim was home to one of the Amethyst
        Academy’s most important strongholds: the Inscrutable Tower. This immense structure houses vast repositories of
        magical lore, incomplete magical experiments, hidden vaults containing unspeakable extraplanar entities, and
        powerful magic items sheltered from the world at large—all rendered completely inaccessible to the Academy since
        the meteor fell. The Deep Haze has settled within the tower, scrambling the Academy’s own arcane wards and
        foiling every attempt to enter or observe the Tower using teleportation or divination magic.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7b0d5e40-6984-4ae7-9f2b-46cb9a92a517">The mages have already expended considerable effort
        attempting to retake the Tower on their own. These attempts catastrophically failed. The pragmatic wizards
        cannot afford to exhaust the Academy’s resources in such a fruitless manner any longer, so now they turn to
        research and patient methods to advance their goals in Drakkenheim. They seek a suitably talented, trustworthy,
        and expendable adventuring party to conduct survey and recovery missions into the Inscrutable Tower. If the
        Tower were to be secured and repaired, the Amethyst Academy would have the ideal staging ground to begin the
        mass industrial exploitation of delerium, and would be able to bring its full resources to bear in Drakkenheim.

        Directorate has remained vacant ever since. The Academy desperately wishes to discover her ultimate fate,
        recover her research, and obtain the <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="61a420eb-2ce5-4485-8f80-fc8c076b4a51">The Faith of the Sacred Flame has long looked to the
        stars for guidance. The flickering stars cast within the Astral Void symbolize how the faithful see their place
        in the cosmos: points of light holding darkness at bay. Scripture tells how a shooting star inspired Saint Tarna
        to seek redemption before a pair of angels. The story of a blackguard turned paladin who founded the Faith
        itself established an important message within the religion: that from the deepest darkness may arise the
        brightest light.</p>

        was one such Flamekeeper who read omens in the night sky, and was regarded as one of the most learned and wise
        amongst the clergy. She channeled immense divine power, and invoked miracles that have not been witnessed in a
        generation. A decade before the meteor destroyed Drakkenheim, she beheld a vision of a falling star that would
        arrive on earth and signal a great upheaval for the faithful. Despite her reputation, her visions were dismissed
        as an apocalyptic fantasy and largely suppressed at the time.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="23da0572-d8f9-46f4-9ff6-cacd6e3b6ade">Her visions proved true; right down to the hour.
        However, even Lucretia Mathias did not expect the actual destruction the meteor would cause, nor did she
        anticipate it would annihilate her birthplace, Drakkenheim. She spent several years afterwards contemplating the
        heavens and several strange stones recovered from the city. Her conclusion was dire indeed: the world stands on
        the precipice of darkness unending. Yet within delerium, she saw the spark of salvation. Though the stones are
        the stuff of chaos, black charcoal and midnight oil may fuel a great flame. Perhaps if taken up by righteous
        souls, the crystals might become an earthly vessel for the Sacred Flame itself. Rather than fall to
        all-consuming shadows, Lucretia Mathias prophesied a New Age of Heroes that could meet the coming night. She
        spoke widely about her beliefs and discoveries, and her fiery sermons galvanized a throng of loyal supporters
        who proselytized her new creed across Elyria, Westemär, and Caspia. As her support grew, she resolved to make a
        pilgrimage to the crater itself to confirm her revelations.</p>

        declared a heretic and excommunicated. However, she refused to be silenced. Escaping Elyria, she expanded her
        original writings and published them as the <em>Testament of the Falling Fire</em>. This religious essay
        proclaimed a radical new doctrine for the faith, and called upon all devout believers to make pilgrimage to the
        crater in Drakkenheim. Those who finish this arduous journey partake in a controversial rite known as the <a

        has proselytized that hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of devoted followers will need to complete
        the pilgrimage to fulfil her prophecy. Once they do, the Sacred Flame will set alight every righteous mortal
        heart, and a glorious new age of heroes shall begin. Until then, they must ensure many more can make the
        journey, and preserve the delerium, the sacred charcoal needed to enact their rituals. Thus, they wish to make
        Drakkenheim itself a holy site.</p>

        edge participate in a ritual called the <em>Sacrament of the Falling Fire</em>. This controversial rite requires

            data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/356-tooltip">delerium fragment</a> into their hearts. Those who survive
        the pilgrimage are spiritually transformed and physically empowered, rendered immune to contamination and able
        to survive in the Haze. Many who complete the pilgrimage suddenly discover they are able to tap into powerful
        spiritual energies, which they claim are the Sacred Flame. Thus many followers channel divine magic who had not
        before exhibited the necessary willpower to master such abilities.</p>

        <p>Within the quotation at the start of this section, the entire truth of Lucretia Mathias’ visions are laid
            bare. While it might <em>seem</em> like she is speaking in metaphor, she is actually being quite literal.
            Lucretia Mathias has seen how the Haze will consume the world, but also knows that the spread of delerium
            through comets has continued for untold eons. She intends to break this cycle.</p>
        <p>“From the deepest darkness comes the brightest light.” is a core doctrine for the Sacred Flame, and Lucretia
            Mathias. believes the chaotic and destructive energies of the Haze and delerium can be re-made into a vessel
            for light and order.</p>
        <p>One must only plant the seed of righteousness within. Thus the purpose of the <em>Sacrament of the Falling
                Fire</em> is only realized when participants die and their souls are drawn into the <a
                class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/355-delerium-crystal"
                data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/355-tooltip">delerium crystals</a> in their chests. Lucretia
            Mathias believes that if enough of these sanctified stones are gathered by the time the world ends, a divine
            apotheosis will result in a new generation of harbingers of light and salvation, rather than chaos and doom.
            Whether or not this will actually happen is impossible to say. Since Drakkenheim is a world of distant and
            unknowable gods, there is no way to prove or disprove her claims. It is entirely a matter of faith.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c1a34db0-445a-4f9e-ab6c-6d2ed92db882">Multiple military operations have attempted to
        retake Drakkenheim over the past fifteen years. Each has ended in miserable failure, and the contaminated ruins
        have swallowed thousands of soldiers’ lives. What remains of these assaults are merely twisted monsters and
        undead monstrosities formed from the risen corpses of these regiments. After these disastrous attempts,
        Drakkenheim was left abandoned while civil war ripped Westemär apart instead. These conflicts also ended in
        vain, with the royal line of House von Kessel undone by fratricide.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="df590222-3db0-4c77-a316-be3dd0f75333">Westemär is slowly disintegrating into a realm of
        squabbling fiefdoms, yet some amongst the fractured nobility hold a glimmer of hope in restoring the nation and
        rebuilding the capital. Three years ago, they marshaled up the remnants of the royal guard, the city watch, and
        patriotic veterans of the civil war to make one last-ditch attempt to retake the city. Although officially
        dubbed the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the Capital, this guerilla regiment was nicknamed
        after oil lamps carried by the old city watch: the Hooded Lanterns.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dad8bcaf-aaad-44d1-bf1b-71defc14b0e3">The core members of the Hooded Lanterns are warriors
        fighting for their homeland. Few honest soldiers survived the civil war, so many veterans have a life of bloody
        deeds behind them already. On the other hand, new recruits are seldom old enough to have any strong memories of
        Drakkenheim before it was destroyed. As such, many possess naïve and idealistic notions honed into simmering
        rage and fury at a golden age stolen from them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4495eacb-248e-4cf7-89a7-740637cecf82">Under the leadership of <a
            class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/4086125-lord-commander-elias-drexel"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/4086125-tooltip">Lord Commander Elias Drexel</a>, the Hooded Lanterns have
        finally broken the losing streak of previous military operations. Rather than making an all-out assault on the
        ruins, they have taken a methodical approach. After spending nearly a year carefully scouting out the ruins,
        they began clearing out important fortifications in the city to use as staging grounds for future operations.
        This strategy has paid off: the Hooded Lanterns have managed to establish countless safehouses and supply caches
        within the city. They captured Shepherd’s Gate and the Drakkenheim Garrison last year. However, in recent months
        their efforts have been stymied by sabotage enacted by the <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"

        the mantle of law-and-order in the city, these setbacks have revealed their actual authority is limited to their
        strength of arms. The regiment maintains only a fragile foothold in Drakkenheim, and their supply lines are now
        exceptionally difficult to maintain. It’s taking almost everything the Hooded Lanterns have to hold their
        current position.</p>

        vassals of the royal family who wish to see the old monarchy of Westemär restored. Many of these wealthy nobles
        lost estates, treasure vaults, family heirlooms, and personal documents when the city was destroyed, and expect
        the Hooded Lanterns to retrieve them. In return, these noble houses provide soldiers, material, and other
        supplies to the Hooded Lanterns on a periodic basis, but their financial resources are not inexhaustible.
        Indeed, the Hooded Lanterns have often resorted to selling delerium themselves to make ends meet.</p>

        their chest pieces, and shoulder stitches denote their rank and company. Scout units wear light armour, and

        an inscribed plate bearing their name, hometown, and next of kin. Most Hooded Lanterns cut their hair when they

        throne still survives somehow. Others believe that even if House von Kessel is truly extinct, a new monarchy
        could be formed by a prominent noble house with some connection to the royal line. Both Saint Vitruvio’s
        Cathedral and Castle Drakken are believed to contain archives detailing the line of succession, and magically
        preserved vials of royal blood that can be used in a special ritual to confirm legitimate royal ancestry. A
        potential claimant with access to these documents could galvanize the support needed to ascend to the throne.
        However, proof of royal ancestry alone is not enough - any claim is spurious at best without the <em>Seals of
            Drakkenheim</em>, the <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"

        Afterwards, he took part in three military expeditions to reclaim Drakkenheim, and saw firsthand their horrors.
        He then went on to fight in the Westemär Civil War alongside Mannfred von Kessel. However, the idea that his
        soldiers died for nothing in Drakkenheim festered in his mind, and made him doubt Mannfred’s ability to be a
        good ruler. He secretly participated in a successful conspiracy to assassinate Mannfred von Kessel. Little did
        he know that shortly thereafter, tragedy would soon befall Cecilia von Kessel. He isn’t exactly proud of his
        choice to betray Mannfred, and that causes him considerable guilt, regret, and internal self-loathing.</p>

        traps. Once engaged, squads communicate using whistles, code-signs, signal flares, and horn calls to execute
        complex and practiced maneuvers. While the Hooded Lanterns don’t have access to much magic, they’re prepared to
        fight spellcasters in battle. They know much about the monsters they fight on a regular basis, and they always
        confirm their kills. The Hooded Lanterns know the layout of the city streets well, and stash caches of healing

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ebd90665-dbaf-4a20-bd61-a62c0473851a">The Silver Order was founded several centuries ago
        as a militant arm of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. These knights and paladins act by the decree of the Divine
        Matriarch to defend the faithful from demons and monsters, and are called up as witch-hunters when wayward mages
        dabble in forbidden arcana. Their holy missions transcend sovereign borders, but the order is headquartered in
        the Holy City of Lumen in Elyria.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="36372d94-42eb-4795-adb9-9e9781907a81">Paladins are revered figures in the Faith of the
        Sacred Flame, as the founder of the faith was herself a paladin. Though not every warrior in the Silver Order is
        a paladin, each strives to emulate Saint Tarna’s valiant example. Though they usually operate as individual
        questing knights or in small warrior-companies, occasionally they are deployed as a regiment. Members of the
        Silver Order have been traditionally drawn from all peoples and all levels of society. <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7775651c-4364-4914-bfb8-48caaec0c3fd">In their role as witch-hunters and mage-slayers, the
        Silver Order was complicit in the persecution and oppression of arcane spellcasters. To this day, the issue
        remains a deep stain on the order’s honour, as many observed that the injustices and persecution visited upon
        spellcasters stand in stark contrast against the tenets of the faith of the Sacred Flame, a faith that calls out
        for justice for the oppressed. Nevertheless, staunch supporters of the Silver Order argue that their deeds were
        indeed justified. Decisive action is necessary to defend the innocent and the faithful from wicked sorcerers who
        sought to dominate others with magical might, or cut down foul warlocks who spread wickedness through demonology
        and necromancy. The chronicle of the Silver Order records countless heroic missions that have prevented a dire
        threat from growing into a far greater crisis.</p>

        Flame, not to the command of any sovereign nation. However, the Order remains strongly connected to its roots,
        and most of its members hail from Elyria. Ever since the realm of Elyriacame under the de facto rule of the
        religious ministry, the order has become increasingly entangled in state affairs. Their knights have been
        deployed on inquisitional crusades against heretics, heathens, and other political enemies of the Sacred Flame.
        The distinction between an “enemy of the Sacred Flame” and an “enemy of Elyria” is not entirely clear anymore.
        As such, some worry the Order’s presence in Drakkenheim is an invasive ploy by Elyria to wrest control of
        Westemär, rather than a righteous expedition to purify the city of eldritch contamination.</p>

        Haze. Outside Drakkenheim, the Silver Order can often find shelter in any chapel or cathedral of the Sacred
        Flame, though not every Flamekeeper in Westemär now supports their mission. Their headquarters is the
        impregnable Vigilant Keep in the far city of Lumen in Elyria, where the Grandmaster oversees the entire order at
        the behest of the Divine Matriarch.</p>

        delerium an unholy abomination. These chaotic seeds of evil magic must be wholly destroyed before they can take
        root. By her command, the Silver Order has come to cleanse Drakkenheim of this foul taint: even if it means
        burning the city to the ground. Furthermore, the knights have resolved to stop others from harvesting and using
        delerium, especially the Amethyst Academy.</p>

        the Silver Order does not intend to establish Elyrian rule over Westemär, they want to ensure any new ruler

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ae0d131f-7e0c-46ff-9bb7-820ddac9c6a1">The Silver Order favours aggressive charges and
        defensive bastions, employing a “hammer and anvil” approach whether on the battlefield or in skirmishes. Their
        inspiring commanders drive their rank-and-file soldiers to greater acts of boldness and heroism, while the
        magical support of their clergy means they can tend the wounded and unravel evil magic levied against them. The
        Silver Order have superlative training in combating spellcasters and fiends, and know how to recognize the magic
        and tactics of such foes. They target spellcasters aggressively, and seek to break their concentration or end
        their spells using <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2072-dispel-magic"

        straightforward battle plan, which they execute with discipline and focus. In all matters, they operate with
        honor. They will often reach out in parley before engaging, and even in battle they will often implore their
        foes to retreat or surrender once they seize the upper hand. On the contrary, members of the Silver Order expect
        no quarter themselves, and offer none to the wicked and unrepentant.</p>

        fugitives. The ever-present dangers of the dark city make it the perfect place to hide for someone on the wrong
        side of the law with nothing left to lose. Opportunities for plunder abound within this new frontier for
        banditry. Many more ply their trade raiding the supply caravans making their way to Emberwood Village. Sly
        cutthroats know that simply taking the spoils from a weakened but successful adventuring party at swordpoint
        makes for a highly profitable enterprise, and a far less risky one to boot!</p>

        few years ago, they resolved to restore order. Presenting a united front against the fractious outlaws, the
        Hooded Lanterns met with early success in driving out the more violent and bloodthirsty among them. Then, an
        enigmatic figure emerged. This self-proclaimed “Queen of Thieves” used assassination, trickery, intimidation,
        and guile to reshape the disparate gangs into a budding criminal empire. Her plots have sabotaged many important
        Hooded Lanterns operations, and the Lord Commander believes the Queen of Thieves blackmailed several of his
        important backers into withdrawing their support.</p>

        Those who don’t become a target for all the others, while loyal and successful scoundrels enjoy extra benefits
        and kickbacks. Though the Queen of Thieves is now infamous for her schemes and skill, her web of black market
        smugglers secures her rule over the underworld. Her agents funnel treasures and delerium purloined from
        Drakkenheim to skilled fences and unscrupulous merchants in the world beyond. This ensures ample gold and booze

        them—that would be bad for business! Therefore, she aims to disrupt and sabotage the other factions’ goals.
        Perhaps she might even install a puppet on the throne of Westemär!</p>

        is a scheming mastermind who controls the Drakkenheim underworld. She has transformed a hundred squabbling bands
        of brigands and outlaws into a burgeoning criminal empire. However, none know her true identity or origin, for
        she wears many faces. Though she is most infamously encountered as a lithe masked woman garbed in swashbuckling
        attire with a wide-brimmed hat and jewelled rapier, the Queen of Thieves adopts a variety of costumes, facial
        features, skin and hair colours, body shapes, ages, and genders depending on her mood and circumstances. As
        such, she typically confirms her identity by revealing some secret about whoever she is speaking with or
        demonstrating her uncanny ability to change appearance seemingly at-will.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b589bafc-68ca-4135-87c7-23b84f04b3c4">The true power of the Queen of Thieves is her
        apparent anonymity. Once her true identity is revealed, she is effectively defeated. In this regard, it’s
        important to separate the “persona” that is the Queen of Thieves from the actual <em>person</em> behind her.
        While this book includes one possible suggestion, you may decide the true identity of the Queen of Thieves in
        your campaign, and decide her true motivations for yourself. You might choose one of the missing heirs to the
        monarchy, or a long-lost friend or relative connected to one of your player characters. The Queen of Thieves
        does not disclose her identity readily, but foreshadowing various possibilities with uncanny remarks and subtle
        hints makes the final reveal that much more dramatic!</p>

        in her sister, Eliza, being banished to the Abyss. Unwilling to accept her sister’s death, Katarina von Kessel
        fled the Amethyst Academy and travelled the world to find a way to bring her sister back. In the process, she
        learned to weave her proclivities for enchantment and illusion magic with her noble-born fascination for
        swordplay and scheming. Eventually, she hatched a plan to return to Drakkenheim under a false identity and claim
        her birthright. She does not want to be used as a pawn of the Amethyst Academy or the nobility. She wants to do
        things <em>her way,</em> and does not believe such organizations have <em>her</em> best interests in mind—nor
        the interests of the common folk, for that matter. Katarina von Kessel wants to obtain the <a

        She hasn’t yet decided on her last wish, however.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="81c0003f-cdf8-44dc-8cf5-2934d18b814f">Two decades ago, Emberwood Village was little more
        than a farmers market, blacksmith, a pub, a small chapel and a few dozen cottages. The local businesses served
        the farmlands and logging camps surrounding the capital, and the town was an occasional rest stop for merchants
        to stop off on their way to Drakkenheim.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fe43dd29-1b9d-4ace-ba5f-4f9e813c01a7">As the town lies some five miles south of the
        capital city, it was not directly damaged by the meteor shower, though the impact shattered the windows of every
        building, caused some weaker structures to collapse, and left some in the village <a
            class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition"
            data-tooltip-href="/conditions/1-tooltip">blinded</a> or <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip"
            href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition"
            data-tooltip-href="/conditions/3-tooltip">deafened</a>. Unfortunately, the aftermath was all the more
        terrible. Over the past fifteen years, the contamination in Drakkenheim has affected the countryside for miles
        around. The once fertile fields and dense woods are now barren and dying. Gradually, most folk gave up,
        departing for safer and more prosperous places. A few people remained behind, determined to hold onto their
        family homes and salvage their livelihoods.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="548d6427-f8f5-4045-98d6-4f67f9afe301">Emberwood Village persisted despite the odds. After
        the civil war, adventurers began showing up in the town. Explorers heading towards the dark city needed a safe
        place to tend their wounds and rest, and so Emberwood Village gradually became a sort of boom town on a new
        frontier for adventure.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="8cc30738-a395-4c15-8fae-40b089d74ce0">Emberwood Village is home to only about two hundred
        permanent residents, almost all are <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16829-commoner"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16829-tooltip">commoners</a> who endured years of hardship after Drakkenheim
        was destroyed. However, the recent flow of coin from explorers scouring the ruins allows many to live modest or
        comfortable lifestyles. The common folk tend to keep their dealings with adventurers friendly but professional.
        They give rough-looking warriors a wide berth, but enjoy hearing news, gossip, and stories about daring exploits
        in the ruins. As long as interactions stay peaceful, the villagers will deal with anyone regardless of their
        faction allegiances. The villagers live in strange times, and are used to seeing odd-looking folk and weird
        magic. They can recognize delerium, severe contamination, and mutations, and encourage such individuals to seek
        magical aid.</p>

        the agreed rate of 25 gp per character. While Marlowe doesn’t sell goods commonly needed by adventurers, they
        can offer some friendly advice about town:</p>

        the precocious youngster tells a story about an adventurer who once frequented the business, then gives a
        lighthearted account of the grisly fates they met in Drakkenheim. The tour ends at the Crowe and Sons Smithy.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="41162f73-8aa7-4cd5-974f-0cff1183ea10">Emberwood Village relies entirely on trade for goods
        and supplies, since all other settlements for miles around are now abandoned and local food production has
        become impossible. As a result, weapons, armour, and adventuring equipment are sold for double the normal price
        found in the Core Rules. Food costs five times as much, and water isn’t given freely. Instead, it is priced like
        alcohol.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a22705ba-edc7-4380-971f-4e268050c065">Exotic equipment, vehicles, mounts, or other mundane
        items that cost over 500 gp are especially rare and must be brought in from outside Drakkenheim. It takes 21
        (6d6) days to deliver such items, which cost five times the typical price.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="79337a1c-637a-4572-8462-7aeadd658349">The folk of Emberwood Village have grown accustomed
        to adventurers trying to haggle and swindle them. They don’t give discounts or make deals, and tell adventurers
        who push for better prices to pay up or go elsewhere (there isn’t anywhere else to go).</p>

        little the villagers can do when perpetrators aren’t caught red-handed. There’s no authority willing to
        investigate crimes or search for missing people, so the villagers must petition adventurers or the factions for

        Emberwood Village, this small one-level public house is a popular spot for locals and adventurers seeking a
        peaceful and laid back place to unwind. The sign hanging above the door depicts a cartoonish vulture feasting on

        there’s no proper bar, nor any walls separating the kitchen from the dining room. Instead, a few benches are
        arranged beside the main cask, and about a dozen round tables surround an inviting hearth. The Alsberg family

        farmstead. A jawless skull impaled upon a rusty sword is embedded beside the main doors: no one knows who it was
        or who did them in, but it’s tradition to make a macabre greeting to the skull on your way into the bar. Inside
        the establishment is a rowdy environment - brawls and fist fights happen daily, and several ruffians are thrown
        out nightly.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9f5402ba-0063-4fb6-83dc-1808afb01a9f">The Skull &amp; Sword is a popular place for

            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16966-tooltip">noble</a> named Kosta Stavros who served as Reeve of Emberwood
        Village. After narrowly avoiding destitution when Drakkenheim was destroyed, Stavros converted his home into a
        hotel that serves wealthy explorers, merchants, and nobles conducting business near Drakkenheim. He is an older
        man with a sallow face, thinning hair, and monocle, always garbed in a rich blue vest and doublet.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="133de9a1-c0ae-401b-8cab-c8b9947ed9d6">The three-storey manor is made of red brick. It
        features lion-shaped gargoyles, large glass-paned windows, and embossed wooden doors painted green. The estate
        includes a dozen well-appointed bedrooms, each with their own private bath and common room. A full service staff
        provides patrons’ every need. Meals are taken in a sumptuous dining room outfitted with an impressive crystal
        chandelier, and drinks are served in a vast parlour furnished with fine antiques and decorated with various
        sculptures, paintings, and bookshelves. Each room features a great hearth and lovely views which overlook the
        village or the surrounding countryside.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d3a4ee93-3304-441e-86a5-af2a9c27463b">The Reeve has abandoned his civic duties, and is now
        little more than another business owner in the town. However, he still lords his imagined authority and
        privilege over others in the village, and prefers to share wine and gossip with travellers and merchants than
        deal with common folk. He regards the idea of adventuring in Drakkenheim as a sort of sport. He often makes
        wagers on who will die first amongst any adventuring groups who visit the Red Lion Hotel.</p>

        levels, one serving as a meeting room, another as armoury, and the final as a private chamber for the

            another more, and perhaps snoop around town for any information related to their personal quests.</p>
        <p>Eventually, several townsfolk may begin asking characters if they’ve been to the ruins yet or tried their

    <p data-content-chunk-id="79c7c4fb-1afd-4189-894f-0d09fe5c11d1">Drakkenheim was a grandiose capital city famous for
        its many architectural wonders. The even-handed rule of House von Kessel fostered a vibrant and industrious
        spirit that welcomed folk throughout the realm and beyond, and the city was an international hub for trade and
        culture. Nearly a hundred thousand people called Drakkenheim home, and thousands more lived in small villages
        and hamlets a few days travel from the city. Only a few hundred people survived the cataclysm that devastated
        the city, and the folk who lived in the surrounding countryside have abandoned the area for safer regions.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ba0d4e8f-81fc-46de-a1ce-f0192cb2f0f0">The recorded history of Drakkenheim stretches back
        about six hundred years, but a settlement and fortification have stood here since antiquity. The city was named
        after its founders, the now-extinct House von Drakken. Four distinct dynasties have ruled the city since, with
        House von Kessel claiming the throne one hundred fifty years ago.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="26b3e1b8-6802-4a69-bc5a-6d3ef8c9a944">Drakkenheim is divided into three main regions:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="c1de7efe-810e-485e-a0d7-7348e6c5775a">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="091b78c9-4c67-48be-89d3-91bc112ca97f"><strong>The Outer City,</strong> estates,
            suburbs, and slums surrounding the city walls.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="e21df836-d2b0-4210-b488-72b6ef0b8dee"><strong>The Inner City</strong>, protected by
            the City Walls and accessible through five Gates.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="0767ed5b-ce46-4d35-85a8-e94e970f55f1"><strong>Castle Drakken</strong>, a palace and
            military fortification that lies atop a high crag.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="18242227-ae91-4199-b3d9-1e489188110b">The city itself is further divided by the
        <strong>Drann River</strong>. Common parlance calls the two halves the North Ward and the South Ward.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Streets" data-content-chunk-id="55e32b6f-c9ae-491c-8e93-1be85762078d">

    <p data-content-chunk-id="813a1a06-f823-4e12-a6cb-86d89d1c5173">Five major highways lead to Drakkenheim. The roads
        transition into the city’s main streets: King’s Road, Temple Road, Shepherd’s Way, Champion’s Way, and College
        Street. Each passes through a correspondingly-named gate, and ranges from twenty to forty feet wide with broad
        sidewalks along either side. Wrought-iron lamp posts and sewer drains are placed throughout. They converge at
        Market Square. Elsewhere in the city, the common cobblestone-paved roads are twelve to eighteen feet wide. Most
        have a narrow two-foot wide brick sidewalk. Sidestreets are often no more than ten feet wide, and in other areas
        only a narrow alley separates the buildings. In the outer city slums, many roads are merely gravel-covered or
        raw dirt, though there are some stone-paved streets.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Buildings"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="bdfdcc39-5aea-49a7-800f-b5ba422688b2">Drakkenheim is a city of stone buildings and slate
        spires. Many in the Inner City may be three or four storeys tall, sometimes taller. Most are tightly packed
        townhouses built on stone ground levels, although the upper levels are often made from wood, and boast fine
        glass windows and sturdy chimneys. Wealthier homes even feature indoor plumbing directly connected to the city’s
        water system. Dozens of smaller chapel domes and spires mark distinct boroughs in the city. In contrast, the
        outer city is mostly a ramshackle slum consisting of crumbling tenements, wattle and daub cottages, and
        fieldstone shacks. However, the northern estates and the sections along major roads boast fine construction
        similar to that of the inner city.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b9784cc1-0654-416e-aa00-a66dafb5b179">The Drann River is roughly four hundred feet wide
        and flows southwest. The water is deep, slow-moving, and thoroughly contaminated. Four stone causeways span the
        water. Stone quays and piers surround the river within the Inner City.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="82767223-aecb-4d87-8a12-6af87aac708b"><em><strong>Contaminated Water.</strong></em> All
        water in Drakkenheim is contaminated, including the Drann River. Characters who end their turn in contaminated
        water must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination.</p>

        feet thick separate the Inner City and the Outer City, with entrance via five gates. These fortifications
        present a major obstacle when exploring the city: the five city gates are occupied by faction forces or

    <p data-content-chunk-id="0dcfa546-5115-4176-ba6c-d8f7401e130b">The Drakkenheim sewers were a sophisticated
        engineering marvel. The system combined underground gravity-based aqueducts and drainage canals with carefully
        placed locks and floodgates to deliver clean and fresh water to the city population and draw away the massive
        quantities of sewage and wastewater. Major canals run under the city streets, and can be accessed from the
        surface by numerous maintenance hatches.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4d07b02a-566e-4ba7-b684-26eb8dfb4d25">After over a decade of disuse, most tunnels are
        flooded with contaminated water and many other passages have collapsed. Other sections are now monster lairs. As
        a result, travelling in the sewers is extraordinarily hazardous and ill-advised. However, characters might
        consider taking the sewers to locate a route under the city walls, or to gain access to hidden underground
        dungeons such as the cistern (see <a href="/sources/dodr/inside-the-walls-of-drakkenheim#OldTownCistern"
            data-content-chunk-id="fedce474-57ba-4fd1-9635-7ffeb19b2237">chapter 7</a>) or the Court of Thieves (see <a

        sewer navigation abstractly using the same mechanics for navigating the streets above, except characters move at
        half their normal pace through the twisting tunnels. Sewer passages and access points could be almost anywhere
        in the city, so use the surface map as an approximate guide to track the character’s progress. In addition,
        after each hour spent in the sewers characters must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one
        level of contamination from contact with sewer water.</p>

        Other secret locations may be found in this manner. A DC 20 check result is needed for success when searching

    <p data-content-chunk-id="dfe51a55-969b-4c8f-9673-6d32fafe6e57"><em><strong>Taking a Rest.</strong></em> Before
        taking a short rest in the ruins, characters may spend one hour locating a safe spot or hiding their campsite.
        If they do, don’t check for random encounters during their rest. Note that <a href="#TheHaze"
            data-content-chunk-id="9732e906-dfe7-4d27-9710-949c8bc7c608">the Haze</a> (described above) prevents
        characters from benefiting from a long rest in the city. Characters who attempt to do so anyways check for
        random encounters each hour.</p>

        may soar across the city rapidly. At your discretion, they may risk hostile attention from the <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="83af7482-26e1-461d-a6b7-026abb286be8"><em><strong>Vehicles.</strong></em> Land vehicles
        are largely impractical in the ruins, although characters could use a boat to travel via the river normally
        (though at your discretion characters may risk attack from aquatic or sewer-dwelling monsters!) Characters
        moving with a land vehicle or portaging a water vehicle travel ¼ mile per hour. Land and water vehicles can’t be
        hidden without magic, but individual characters might be able to use stealth.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c1db3a8a-1adf-476d-8281-5f868998c2de"><em><strong>Finding Sustenance.</strong></em>
        Finding suitable sustenance within Drakkenheim is difficult since most food and water within the city is either
        spoiled or contaminated. Instead, characters should bring their own supply of food and water from outside the
        city. Nevertheless, a character who eats or drinks anything found in Drakkenheim that has not been magically
        purified makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they gain one level of contamination.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="9fd80ea1-6a6c-47f0-b625-f3ee7718ce3c">Drakkenheim is dangerous and unpredictable. There is
        no such thing as a foolproof plan for safely exploring the ruins. Nevertheless, characters using special
        resources, spells, magic items, or with a very inventive plan might greatly improve their navigation. For
        example, characters could use spells such as <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
            href="/spells/2159-invisibility" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2159-tooltip">invisibility</a> and <a
            class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2201-pass-without-trace"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2201-tooltip">pass without trace</a> together to travel quickly while remaining
        unseen, or perhaps <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2298-water-walk"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2298-tooltip">water walk</a> helps characters move over the river. If they aren’t
        expending resources, you should call for a few difficult skill checks. On a failure, they stumble into a
        difficult random encounter with extra complications.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="17d83e92-0601-4ac8-9c8a-f4f684c0ff94">Characters must use their resources carefully while
        exploring Drakkenheim, as there is always a chance they’ll face a random encounter or two when <em>leaving</em>
        the ruins as well. At some point during their adventures, characters might be heavily wounded and out of
        resources deep in the city ruins. As they stagger back to Emberwood Village, they roll up a difficult random
        encounter. This could be the one that ends it for them! Be lenient the first time this happens, but merciless
        the second.</p>

        good fortune for the players, such as an opportunity to get the drop on foes or avoid them, a delerium deposit,
        monsters carrying treasure or a magic item, nearby allies who can help, or other advantageous circumstances for
        the characters.</p>

        players check for random encounters, such as using a 1d10 or even 1d6. The odds of a random encounter happening
        increase with lower die sizes, so this is ideal if you have a smaller group or want the characters to face more
        random encounters.</p>

        This fundamental hook is simple: the characters head into the Outer City Ruins on their own initiative to seek
        out whatever treasure and delerium they can find. Allow characters to take the reigns and plan their route. If
        for some reason characters don’t think to do this on their own, a friendly NPC contact in Emberwood Village or
        even a faction lieutenant suggests the characters experience the ruins firsthand and prove they can survive the
        dangers there. It’s risky, but there’s a chance to make good money!</p>

        <p>Nestled within a pine-covered valley, Drakkenheim is a walled metropolis that straddles the wide and sluggish
            Drann River. A high rocky hill rises above the city, upon which perches Castle Drakken. Below the imposing
            fortress, cobblestone streets weave around densely-packed stone buildings and slate-shingle spires. The city
            spills from the outer walls into a ruined urban sprawl.</p>
        <p>The great dome of Saint Vitruvio’s Cathedral stands prominently southwest of the castle. At the heart of the
            city lies the Cosmological Clocktower of Market Square, and to the northwest is the Inscrutable Tower of the
            Amethyst Academy. The soaring obsidian-glass building is broken in half at the middle, but the top still
            hovers above in defiance of gravity.</p>
        <p>Four bridges reach across the Drann River like desperate limbs; one is covered in massive stone statues of
            the heroes of old, and another lurches under the weight of the ramshackle homes and other buildings
            constructed upon its length.</p>
        <p>Billowing clouds of midnight purple and dusky violet mask the sky overhead, casting the city in a dismal
            gloom. In the rare moments where the clouds part, stray sunbeams scornfully shine upon the city. There
            hasn’t been a clear day in Drakkenheim in fifteen years.</p>

        of preserved foods and dried fruits and berries can also be found, along with sacks of grains and flour, and a

        illegal gambling to take place. The room is sparse of decorations save for a few round tables and some of the

        on the wall that details the underground passages, smugglers’ tunnels and sewer systems of Drakkenheim.

        having a private meeting and they best go back upstairs before they start trouble.</p>

            another nondescript ruin of Drakkenheim. But, the entrance to the smugglers tunnel is still very much
            intact, and Open Mike’s corpse can be found amongst the bodies of the patrons. The key to the smuggler’s

        lies on the southeastern outskirts of Drakkenheim. Decades ago, these were the choice watering holes for
        lower-class labourers, sweat-soaked craftspeople, and assorted scoundrels who inhabited Drakkenheim. Today,
        Buckledown Row is a hub for outlaws, outcasts, scavengers, and worse. The taverns are mostly intact, and close
        enough to the edge of town for a band of rough-and-tumble ruffians to make the trek easy enough, but still far
        enough into the city to dissuade others from following. Ever since the Queen of Thieves brought the gangs under
        her influence, the street has been controlled by the Queen’s Men: bandits and brigands meet here on neutral
        ground, join in revelry together, trade with fences and smugglers, and only occasionally slit each other’s
        throats. There’s few rules and even less order. Flowing ale and gold tend to calm the most violent disputes, but
        for anything else the hidden fighting pit is the perfect place to settle feuds, make some bets, and lose a few
        teeth.</p>

        Characters might hear rumours about Buckledown Row, especially if they frequent the Skull &amp; Sword Taphouse
        in Emberwood Village. If they have been working with Blackjack Mel, he’ll even suggest the characters test their
        might in the fighting pits. He offers to sponsor them as a fighting team and act as their manager (for an equal
        cut of the winnings, of course!). If they’re interested, he encourages them to travel there with him. He’ll be
        sure to set up a good matchup! Blackjack Mel explains that anyone who proves themselves in the Buckledown Row
        fighting pit wins the honor to face the Queen of Thieves’ personal champion in her secret arena (located in the

        way to meet the Queen of Thieves, and she’s even proclaimed that she’ll grant one personal favour to anyone who
        can defeat her champion. Of course, no one’s actually managed to beat them yet...</p>

        gather that the fighting pits below the taverns are the way people around here get known. Many of the fighters
        in the pits are renowned legends amongst the gangs. Anyone who can defeat the other fighters gets to take a
        crack at the Queen’s champion in the royal fighting pits. Beat the champion, and you get a private audience with

        with various gangs of the Queen’s Men. Around every corner is gambling, cards, dice, and occasionally people
        brawling openly in the streets. A body being thrown out a window, or the sound of shattering glass or
        splintering wood are so common that they become almost part of the backdrop of the place. Everyone here is a
        little rough around the edges and if you stick out too much you’ll draw a lot of unwanted attention.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="0cf61909-935f-445e-9a06-5a1ab84d691d">If the party manages to fit in without drawing
        unwanted attention, the gangs pay them no mind above anyone else. The gangs are gaining so many members that if
        you are in Buckledown Row, most assume you ought to be there. Discussing other factions, or any plans or
        adventures that seem suspicious, might arouse the attention of people nearby. Also if the party is acting
        awkward or nervous, this may draw attention - it may also help their cause to dress in appropriate gang attire
        or to have symbols of a gang on their gear. Again, the <a href="/sources/dodr/factions#OutlawsandScoundrels"

            Men Dossier</a> can provide information the party might gather to help them disguise themselves or hatch a
        plan to fit in. If the party openly approaches a gang leader without invitation, they may gain some attention as
        well, but most of the leaders are eager to hear out anyone bold enough to approach them and will engage with the
        party in amused curiosity. Otherwise the gangs accept the characters as more new recruits and try and encourage
        them with drinking, games, sometimes a fight, or a game of cards. Or maybe trying to push them to join the
        fighting pits below.</p>

            bar named Reeda Blackstone is polishing glasses. She is friendly, kind-hearted, and welcoming to any who
            come through the door. Everyone who orders a drink from her tips her one gold and says “Thank you Reeda.”
            Above the bar is a wall of swords and daggers, all stuck in place in an array of metal and leather. The

            over their gear. There is a lot of hollering and it seems a fight is breaking out every couple minutes
            somewhere in the place. There is a small corner bar with a shelf of various bottles of alcohol spanning both
            storeys from floor to ceiling. A long rickety ladder transcends the shelves on a wheeled system so it can
            slide back and forth across the many types of alcohol. Three goblins work the bar. One on the ladder, the
            other below catching and tossing bottles, and one making the drinks and sliding them down the bar to whoever
            catches them. People don’t seem to ask questions, the goblins seem to make whatever mix of booze suits them
            and toss it down the bar to whoever catches it. Occasionally a glass slides right off the bar and smashes on
            the wall to which everyone in the tavern hollers and cheers.</p>

        searching the upper level of the chapel, and another rival faction will arrive on the scene later to contest the
        claim. It’s up to the characters to decide how to deal with these faction agents: they could fight them, trick
        them, sneak past them, or negotiate with them in some way.</p>

        use their own creativity to develop out-of-the-box solutions, as there is no “correct” way to overcome them.
        However, if characters rouse the remains of the interred clerics and paladins in the process, they’ll have an
        interesting problem on their hands as the undead will rejuvenate when destroyed unless laid to rest again

        the chapel at ground level. The other tower remains standing up to the second storey. Piles of debris and stone
        surround the tower’s base. Elegant arched windows filled with stained glass mosaics decorate the chapel, but

        <p>How the characters dealt with the other faction agents encountered during this adventure could potentially
            influence future interactions with those factions. It’s possible the characters use guile, negotiation, and
            stealth to navigate this scenario without making enemies. If the characters slay all the members of a strike
            team, there might not be anyone who can actually report back to identify that the characters were the ones
            responsible. Nevertheless, if faction members survive and escape, or evidence emerges implicating the
            characters, it could potentially sour future interactions. However, the factions still regard the characters
            as neutral mercenaries at this stage of the campaign. Faction agents clash with adventurers all the time in
            the ruins, so becoming outright enemies of either faction should only occur if the characters incite serious
            altercations and violence by keeping the sceptre for themselves. If they simply retrieve and return the
            sceptre to whichever faction hired them, it arises ire from the other factions, but not retribution.</p>
        <p>Characters who decide to keep the sceptre become a target for both the Followers of the Falling Fire and the
            Knights of the Silver Order. Both factions entreat the characters to turn the sceptre over to them, offering
            rewards in exchange. However, if the characters don’t accept these offers, the factions dispatch strike
            teams to attack them. The first strike team sent won’t be ordered to slay the characters, but they will
            rough them up badly and take the scepter. If this strike team is defeated or killed, the characters might
            risk further escalation with one of the factions. Characters who incur the ire of the Silver Order or the
            Falling Fire then turn the sceptre over to one of the other factions, have made an enemy of that faction.

                href="/magic-items/7755378-aqua-delerium" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/7755378-tooltip">aqua
                delerium</a> as an additional reward. She encourages them to take a few days off to recuperate,
            promising to contact them shortly (in 1d6 days) with another job. On the other hand, River is much less
            impressed if the characters fail to recover the delerium crystal. She still offers to buy any found delerium
            from the characters, but decides to wait and reassess the characters’ capabilities before offering them
            further work.</p>
        <p>Characters who aren’t already in contact with the Amethyst Academy still have a valuable find on their hands,
            which could put them in contact with any faction. The Hooded Lanterns know the delerium crystal is worth a
            small fortune, but they’re happy to let the characters keep it as an extra reward for their efforts. Ansom
            or Petra could suggest the characters sell the crystal in Emberwood Village to Fairweather Trades and
            Exports. Another NPC might suggest the characters ask around the village for contacts with the Amethyst
            Academy or the Queen’s Men to sell the crystal to them. Alternatively, the characters might encounter a
            knight of the Silver Order, who encourages the characters to destroy the delerium. Finally, a pilgrim of the
            Falling Fire may claim the crystal has a holy purpose, and try to convince the characters to bring it to
            Lucretia Mathias at Saint Selina’s Monastery as an offering.</p>

            Lang</h4>
        <p>If Petra Lang survives, she invites the characters to return with her to Shepherd’s Gate. Her comrades are
            thrilled at her safe return, and Lord Commander Elias Drexel takes note of the characters. He won’t meet
            them personally just yet, but instead makes arrangements for Ansom or Petra to contact them for another
            mission within 7 (2d6) days.</p>
        <p>Ansom reminds the characters that their arrangement was a personal matter, and technically not official
            Hooded Lanterns business. As such, this mission alone won’t earn the characters free passage through
            Shepherd’s Gate. However, should the characters come to the gate in an emergency, the Hooded Lanterns will
            help them. In such an event, they’ll overlook the tariffs “just this one time” and let them through.</p>
        <p>If the characters fail to rescue Petra, Ansom believes them to be utterly incompetent. He hesitates to
            involve them further in Hooded Lanterns affairs, and bitterly mistrusts their capabilities in any future
            situations.</p>
        <p>If Petra dies, but the characters weren’t yet working with the Hooded Lanterns, it’s up to them whether or
            not they reveal her fate. Regardless, her comrades are shaken by her disappearance and death. In grief, the
            hard-hearted Lord Commander never speaks of her again. Ansom presses on, but it feels like he’s missing a
            part of himself.</p>

        contamination over the past decade, Oscar Yoren and his apprentices have gained a limited resistance to the
        Haze. They aren’t immune to contamination, but they may rest in Drakkenheim normally. Oscar Yoren is working on
        how to reproduce these results, but his current method requires several years of risky and intense self-exposure
        to delerium.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a98fd3a6-10d6-4eae-bdb9-1f641279ab07">Oscar Yoren and his apprentices are secretive, but
        not outwardly hostile if characters approach them peacefully. Instead, the apprentices offer to sell the
        characters potions. They admit characters into the dining room to talk, but not further into the manor. The
        apprentices do business in a curt yet cordial manner (see “Potion Brewery” below).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a235f15-9004-4a51-b55e-7fbdf5c54d8c">When he meets with the characters personally, Oscar
        Yoren bluntly demands to know who sent them. He staunchly refuses to work with anyone who admits to working with
        the Amethyst Academy or the Silver Order, and asks them firmly to leave. Otherwise, he sees an opportunity. He
        plans to use the characters to recover delerium, monster parts, and arcane reagents for him so he can advance
        his research, and then conveniently dispose of them once they become troublesome.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d6e5cbdf-ac84-41ab-a3ea-a0355287578c">Oscar Yoren uses his research as leverage, revealing
        some of his discoveries about delerium as proof of his knowledge (see the sidebar on “<a

            Research</a>”). In exchange for ensuring his freedom, sparing his life, and making fair payment in coin and
        delerium, he offers to create <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"

        for the characters. He overstates the efficacy of <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"
            href="/magic-items/7755379-aqua-expurgo" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/7755379-tooltip">aqua expurgo</a>,
        but does not reveal its side effects. He scoffs at the idea that anyone else could create the potion. Yoren does
        not willingly give up his writings or formulas under any circumstances. Instead, he lies, claiming the most
        important secrets are “in his head.”</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b6283b7f-b4b5-426b-8031-756108fa729a">If the characters agree to work with him, he
        explains that <a class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/360-eldritch-lily"
            data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/360-tooltip">eldritch lilies</a> are needed to create the potion, and

        the flowers, he makes good on his end of the deal as long as he is paid and unmolested.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="22264a07-1c40-4d37-95f0-4f0965f23ccf">Oscar Yoren is ambivalent about working for either
        the Queen of Thieves or the Hooded Lanterns, but explains that he’s devoting all his attention to his new
        research. He’s only interested in continuing to work with either if they’re willing to cough up extra money and

        <p>Reed Manor is a run-down two-storey stone house surrounded by a rusting wrought-iron fence and an overgrown
            yard filled with shrubberies and brambles. The long, thin windows are boarded over from the outside, but
            light flickers within the first floor. Several chimneys rise up from the slate-shingle rooftop, a light
            trail of smoke billowing from each. A collapsed small outbuilding, perhaps once a stable or shed, borders
            the yard. Sweeping around the estate grounds, there are two doors leading into the manor from the back. Both
            have been nailed shut with rotting planks.</p>
        <p>A short cobblestone pathway leads through the yard up to a small set of steps leading to the central double
            doors. A large, round iron knocker hangs on each. Before the doors is a fountain. The central decorative
            statue has crumbled away into the basin, which is filled with brackish rainwater and algae. A singular obese
            toad basks beside the water, croaking loudly.</p>

                    mineral or gemstone… I have seen the crystals grow like fungus on a dead tree. The process takes
                    some time; weeks, months, years even. I only discovered this by closely observing wild samples near
                    my new home. They do not grow outside the Haze. I wonder if this means there are new delerium
                    deposits in the ruins… perhaps there is more now than when the meteor originally fell.”</li>

                    thousand saplings, a thousand small shards of delerium are nothing compared to a single large geode.
                    Bigger crystals contain exponentially more arcane power. Fracturing the rock is a wasteful endeavor,
                    as it causes valuable samples to lose their great magical potential. Delerium crystals and geodes
                    are ideally suited for great spells and ambitious magical constructions. However, it has been
                    difficult to find these specimens in the outer ruins. Nevertheless, small twigs are good for
                    kindling, to set a fire, to keep one warm… and so the small shards make excellent alchemical

                    from Queen’s Park bearing a wondrous flower - an eldritch lily. The pollen and petals soak in
                    contamination to fuel its own germination. Combined with other rare ingredients, I believe it may
                    prove an ideal remedy against contamination.”</li>

            <aside class="text--quote-box">
                <li><em><strong>Aqua expurgo formula.</strong></em> Oscar Yoren has developed a formula for <em>aqua
                        expurgo</em>, a magical potion that protects against contamination. However, it requires
                    eldritch lilies from Queen’s Park Garden. He needs more samples to refine the formula before he can
                    start producing doses of the potion.</li>
            </aside>
        </ul>
        <p>Oscar Yoren’s research is extremely valuable. Chief amongst them is his formula for <em>aqua expurgo</em>.
            This potent defense against the Haze will permit characters to explore much more dangerous areas in the
            city. The Hooded Lanterns, Queen’s Men, and Amethyst Academy would deeply desire this new potion so they can
            advance their plans inside Drakkenheim.</p>
        <p>The player characters themselves can study Oscar Yoren’s research. Any character capable of casting 3rd level
            spells or higher can learn to make <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"
                href="/magic-items/7755379-aqua-expurgo" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/7755379-tooltip">aqua
                expurgo</a> themselves (see the <a href="/sources/dodr/delerium-magic-spells#MagicItems">magic items
                section</a> for details). However, a key ingredient for the potion is an <a
                class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/360-eldritch-lily"
                data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/360-tooltip">eldritch lily</a>, which only blooms in Queen’s Park.
            If characters want to create this potion, they’ll need to mount an expedition to the Inner City to collect
            this key ingredient.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the Amethyst Academy obtains the formula, they’ll begin producing the potion on a periodic basis. The
                main constraint is the supply of eldritch lilies. This prevents the Amethyst Academy from manufacturing
                vast quantities of <em>aqua expurgo</em>. They’ll ask characters to obtain samples, and if possible,
                seeds or full plants. This way they can attempt to cultivate the flower themselves.</li>
            <li>The Hooded Lanterns might suggest turning over the research to the Amethyst Academy as a possible inroad
                to an alliance. They’re also willing to work with Oscar Yoren and continue providing him with protection
                and materials.</li>
            <li>The Queen of Thieves wants to ensure that these secrets remain known only to her for the time being. She
                may ask characters to kidnap Oscar Yoren for her so she can force him into making the potion for her own
                use.</li>
            <li>The Silver Order is divided over the potion: it’s useful, but involves making use of contaminated flora
                and delerium. They defer to the characters on whether or not to use or destroy it, but don’t produce it
                themselves.</li>
            <li>The Followers of the Falling Fire possess their own means of guarding against contamination, so they
                have no interest in the research.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If Oscar Yoren survives, but was attacked or mistreated by the characters (or later discovers they deceived
            him), he will plot his revenge against them. He won’t act on these plans until he obtains eldritch lilies,
            and tries to convince characters to bring him more delerium and other resources, citing the needs for it to
            further his own work. In truth, he starts using these items to conjure demons, create undead, and conspire
            against the characters.</p>
        <p>If Oscar Yoren dies, the Amethyst Academy approaches the characters about buying his brain and manuscripts
            (even if the characters were not working for the Academy originally).</p>
        <p>If Oscar Yoren is killed and his research is destroyed or abandoned, the formula for creating <em>aqua
                expurgo</em> is lost. However, a player character or another group could also develop the formula again
            later in the campaign by studying samples of eldritch lilies.</p>

        neighborhood known as the Spokes. The region was heavily damaged during the meteor shower, and a large trench
        cuts through the district. Nicknamed the “Scar”, this rough ravine was created by a massive boulder ejected from
        the initial meteor impact that collided with the walls and ricocheted south. This rogue projectile tore open the
        ground and levelled many buildings as it skid across the city, only narrowly missing the Spokes Smithy.</p>

        fortified mining camp by an intrepid and entrepreneurial family of dwarven prospectors. The four Ironhelm
        siblings arrived in Drakkenheim a few months ago, and used their wondrous mechanical weaponry to lay claim to
        the rich deposits of delerium found within the Scar. While this has made them one of the most successful
        delerium extraction teams in Drakkenheim, they’ve made a loose agreement with the Queen of Thieves for
        protection, and now find themselves caught in the crosshairs of all five factions.</p>

        immediately clashed with the bandit gangs who had previously been picking over the delerium in the Scar. After
        wresting control of the claim, they cut a deal with the Queen of Thieves: the dwarves could mine the Scar
        unmolested, so long as they paid fifteen percent of their profits to the Queen of Thieves each week for
        “protection”. However, the Ironhelms have since acquired new weaponry, and no longer feel they need to pay such
        a large cut for protection that has never actually materialised. The Queen of Thieves is furious, and charges
        the characters with stealing, sabotaging, or destroying the dwarves’ gunpowder weapons to make sure they’ll have
        to depend on her services. However, she doesn’t want the dwarves’ mining operations otherwise disturbed.
        Cracking a few skulls and roughing them up is fine, but if multiple dwarves are killed, the characters won’t be
        rewarded.</p>

        supplying (which would include their contract with the Queen of Thieves). She asks the player characters to
        approach the Ironhelms about this deal, and find out if the dwarves have any additional conditions or demands.

        with them in Drakkenheim Garrison. Elias Drexel sends the player characters as envoys to negotiate with the

        simply must not continue. He charges the characters to convince the Ironhelms to abandon Drakkenheim. If they
        refuse, the characters must do what is necessary to drive them out: perhaps by destroying their supplies, the
        smithy fortifications and weapons, or even somehow making the Scar too dangerous for the dwarves to continue
        mining it. If the characters manage to do so without slaying any of the dwarves, Theodore Marshal promises them

        delerium, as the devotees stubbornly refused to back down when threatened by the Ironhelms. Unfortunately, the
        dwarven guns are simply too much for their pilgrims to overcome on their own, and so the Followers of the

        expedition of roughly thirty individuals. The expedition consists of the four Ironhelm siblings, 8 dwarven <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="69237684-c8cc-4d5d-be6d-6d366631fd50">The dwarves work in half-day shifts to avoid the
        effects of contamination and the Haze. At any given time, two of the expedition leaders are present at the camp,
        along with half the dwarves. The others are resting in Emberwood Village, where they have rooms at the Red Lion
        Hotel. Characters could opt to engage with the Ironhelms at either the Spokes Smithy or in Emberwood Village.
        However, because the dwarves are split up, all four need to meet personally to discuss any deal they’re
        presented with first. If the characters want to negotiate with the dwarves, they’ll have to wait until a shift
        changes (when all the dwarves are in the city).</p>

        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="AcceptingtheOffer"><a href="#AcceptingtheOffer"></a>Accepting the
            Offer</h4>
        <p>If the characters successfully defend the site during the night shift, the Ironhelms are happy to accept an
            offer made by the Amethyst Academy or the Hooded Lanterns. As a result, characters have won a new ally.
            However, Reginald and Elouise tell the characters that it’s now their responsibility to help the dwarves out
            if they need defenders in the future. They’ll contact the characters via a <a
                class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2243-sending"
                data-tooltip-href="/spells/2243-tooltip">sending</a> spell if they ever need them.</p>
        <p>At a pivotal moment in the campaign, the Queen of Thieves (or another rival faction) might time an attack
            against the dwarves with another crucial event. If you want to up the stakes during an otherwise
            straightforward mission, the Ironhelms call for aid when the players are already stretched for time.
            Alternatively, they might request aid immediately after an intense battle when the characters are low on
            resources.</p>
        <p>The Amethyst Academy and the Hooded Lanterns reward characters with a faction boon for their excellent work.
            At your option, the Ironhelm dwarves might be willing to teach the characters how to use gunpowder weapons,
            and give them each a gun and ammunition. Later in the campaign, the dwarves could be called up to provide
            weapons for a major offensive as well.</p>
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheQueensNewDeal"><a href="#TheQueensNewDeal"></a>The Queen’s New
            Deal</h4>
        <p>If the characters sabotage the dwarven weapons but don’t otherwise cause major disruptions to the dwarven
            mining operation, they begrudgingly acquiesce to the Queen of Thieves demands. She rewards characters with a
            faction boon, and lets characters keep any guns or ammunition they might have absconded with (or remarks on
            how foolish the characters were if they did not purloin the weapons for themselves).</p>
        <p>However, in the event the sabotage went too far or any of the Ironhelm siblings were killed, the Queen of
            Thieves is greatly displeased and informs the characters that they are now expected to make up the
            difference in profits. She quotes an outrageous figure, saying the characters have cost her thousands of
            gold. She expects them to adequately make up the difference in a timely fashion, and uses this fact to
            blackmail them into doing her dirty work for as long as possible.</p>
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="DrivingouttheDwarves"><a href="#DrivingouttheDwarves"></a>Driving
            out the Dwarves</h4>
        <p>If the dwarven mining operations are extensively sabotaged, the Ironhelm siblings are financially ruined. The
            cost of buying new equipment, hiring new labourers, and building new defenses is simply too much to bear.
            Combined with the threat of further retribution from another faction, this is sufficient to convince them to
            leave.</p>
        <p>However, if it seems like the dwarves could recuperate or repair whatever damages the player characters
            caused, they might seek out aid from another faction to protect them from future attacks. The next time the
            characters arrive, a strike team from a rival faction is on site as additional muscle.</p>
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="WipingouttheDwarves"><a href="#WipingouttheDwarves"></a>Wiping out
            the Dwarves</h4>
        <p>Should the characters decide to simply slay the dwarves, they’re in for a bloody battle. If the tide of
            battle turns against them, Reginald and Elouise contact their siblings outside Drakkenheim via a <a
                class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2243-sending"
                data-tooltip-href="/spells/2243-tooltip">sending</a> spell. Since the dwarves work in two shifts, the
            characters will have to deal with both groups. If one group is slain, the other does not exact immediate
            vengeance - instead, the survivors seek out help from the Hooded Lanterns, the Amethyst Academy, or the
            Queen of Thieves. Each faction is more than willing to send a strike team of their own to help the Ironhelm
            dwarves.</p>
        <p>The next time a rival faction sends out a strike team against the party, add the remaining Ironhelm siblings
            and 1d4 dwarf <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/17045-veteran"
                data-tooltip-href="/monsters/17045-tooltip">veterans</a> to the strike team.</p>

        located within the Inner City. Before Drakkenheim was destroyed, crossing the river via these bridges required
        merchants and travellers to pay the gate tax to enter the city proper, or otherwise make a detour fifteen miles
        south or west to other river crossings. During this time, an old boatman named Pixis Stick made his living
        illicitly ferrying folk across the Drann River on the southern side of town using his rowboat. Often simply
        called the “Ferryman”, he enjoyed meeting the urchins and ne’er-do-wells who inhabited Drakkenheim, and swapping
        stories and gossip with penny-pinching merchants.</p>

        creatures that drift aimlessly about the city. However, he retained a strange semblance of his past memory, and
        is not hostile to passersby. Instead, the Ferryman takes paying passengers back and forth across the Drann River
        just as he did in life. He now only communicates in low moans and grunts, but the Ferryman still seems to enjoy
        company, conversation, and of course, gold.</p>

        edge whenever characters arrive at either bank of the river on the southwest outskirts of Drakkenheim. If the
        characters approach him, the Ferryman grunts, gestures to his boat, and holds out his hand. He waits until each
        person who enters his rowboat gives him anything resembling a gold piece. Once every passenger has paid their
        fare, the Ferryman takes them across the water. He only transports characters to the opposite side of the river,
        and cannot be commanded to do anything else. He growls if someone else tries to take the oars from him, and only
        fights to defend himself or protect his boat.</p>

        pieces placed in about a dozen satchels.</p>

        north and south of the Drann River. Although a section of city walls was destroyed by the meteor, the crater
        left behind is widely considered impassable due to the extreme contamination present. The walls are otherwise
        intact, impeding access to the Inner City for adventurers and faction agents alike except via five gatehouses.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d6631e17-8ce5-4cc2-8760-092d8383da24">Many baroque architectural flairs decorate the
        walls. The battlements feature leering demonic faces, claw-like spikes, draconic carvings, and dutiful winged
        gargoyles that hold up machicolations. Yet these grotesque statues are no mere ornamentation. When Drakkenheim
        was a living city, these magical guardians could spring to life under the monarch’s will. Now, they serve the
        twisted whims of the Haze in mockery of their final order to safeguard the city, and viciously attack any who
        dare trespass over the walls!</p>

        who enter their camp. The fanatics and zealots question anyone approaching about their business. If they seem to
        have good intentions, or are just passing through, they ask if any would like to speak to Berman Weber, and
        offer them seats by the fire to rest for “the long road ahead”.</p>

            that to push the player characters to take the sacrament. He believes and is very open in expressing that
            the age of heroes is coming, and no doubt that the characters are indeed, destined to come with them. If the
            characters refuse Berman expresses that this is fine, and he will see them again when the time is right.

        gate itself is covered in strange shimmering spiderwebs. They cover the entire gate, giving it the look of a
        broken pane of glass with webbed cracks weaving throughout it. Approaching the gate reveals a strange anomaly.
        Through the webs one can catch glimpses of alternate timelines and realities - one might see people walking the
        streets beyond, or the bustle of a living city; others see horrible demonic things enslaving humans; still
        others see a lush overgrown Drakkenheim covered in fungus and plant life, while other glimpses see a frozen or

        for their force to gain a foothold in the city. Regardless of the characters’ allegiances, this battle proves to
        be a major event for all factions, and is the first act in a series of events that lead to a confrontation at
        the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4182735e-0b9d-444e-8b9e-1934eefdf81f">The Battle of Temple Gate might occur after the

    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="499009e0-2ad1-425e-b78b-c7f28a2127da">Following these developments, Knight-Captain
        Theodore Marshal reasons it’s time to make a push for Temple Gate. Depending on who the characters are most
        closely allied with, this could result in many different outcomes. Whatever faction the characters are closest
        with will inform them as described below.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c53521bc-b6f8-4981-adda-7571654f2958"><em><strong>Silver Order.</strong></em> If the
        player characters are allied with the Silver Order, Theadore Marshal summons the characters to Camp Dawn to
        devise a battle plan together. He proposes the player characters spearhead an assault to open the gates for the
        cavalry, while the Silver Order forces hold off any garmyr reinforcements. The Silver Order aims to take the
        gate, but want to avoid damaging or destroying it in the process so it can be used as a forward base. However,
        he’s worried about sabotage from the other factions, and asks the characters to act as envoys to either secure
        aid from the Hooded Lanterns, or check in on the other factions to ensure they won’t interfere.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d69ae4d7-de6f-40c5-b7e0-3aca0d0f3195"><em><strong>Hooded Lanterns.</strong></em> The
        Hooded Lanterns have tried on multiple occasions to push back the garmyr, but the Lord of the Feast has proven a
        formidable foe. Lord Commander Elias Drexel is open to working with the Silver Order on a joint operation, and
        proposes a pincer strike with the Hooded Lanterns working inside the city, and the Silver Order engaging in a
        frontal assault. However, the Lord Commander is concerned about a foreign military force occupying ground in
        Drakkenheim, and wants assurance from the Silver Order that they aren’t here for conquest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0b42ab6b-439b-4005-8451-afb847ef3a5c"><em><strong>Queen’s Men.</strong></em> The garmyr
        are a problem for the Queen’s Men, too, and have caused more than enough injuries and death amongst her gangs.
        While she has ulterior motives of her own, the Queen of Thieves wants to see the Silver Order accomplish their
        goals. She believes that holding Temple Gate will likely stretch the Silver Order to their limit once they raise
        the ire of the Lord of the Feast, and hopes that a victory in this battle will lead to the embarrassing defeat
        of the Silver Order from attrition.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e06e77e2-f8dc-4e6b-b96e-ba7beb15d824"><em><strong>Amethyst Academy.</strong></em> Eldrick
        Runeweaver is curious but concerned about the Silver Order’s plans, and wants to ascertain their goals. He knows
        the Silver Order are keen to destroy delerium, which is a problem for the Academy. However, he’s doubtful
        destroying all the delerium in the city is even possible, so he wants to know if the Silver Order has an
        ace-in-the-hole. Taking Temple Gate and destroying the monsters there is in the best interest of everyone, but
        the Academy doesn’t want the Silver Order getting too comfortable with their place in the city.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5ec870f3-6d4b-438f-ab07-592bbe687ea3"><em><strong>Followers of the Falling
                Fire.</strong></em> Lucretia Mathias is concerned about the Silver Order’s plan, and doesn’t want them
        to gain a footing so close to her flock. She foresees the Silver Order will use this momentum to force a war on
        the Falling Fire and attempt to drive them from the city as if they were no better than the garmyr. Lucretia
        wants to find a way to prevent the Silver Order from taking the gate, and instead have the characters lure the
        Lord of The Feast out of the cathedral and into open war with the Silver Order. This may give them time to claim
        the cathedral for themselves while the two forces whittle each other down.</p>

                href="#IfTheSilverOrderSucceeds"></a>If The Silver Order Succeeds</h4>
        <p>If the gate is taken, the Silver Order are able to hold it, but can not push any further without the aid of
            the characters. They use the gate as a forward command post and their presence draws the eyes of the other
            factions towards their goals and objectives. The next move for the Silver Order is to try to convince the
            characters to help them defeat the Lord of the Feast and take the cathedral. Without the characters’ help
            this task is impossible.</p>
        <p>Lucretia Mathias needs to make it to the cathedral before the Silver Order does, and pushes the matter on the
            characters if they are allies. Meanwhile the Queen of Thieves wants the characters to take the cathedral and
            obtain many items that she would like for herself. Depending on the relationship between the factions at
            this point, it is up to the characters to convince the Hooded Lanterns or Amethyst Academy if continuing to
            help the Silver Order is of any value to them.</p>
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="IfTheSilverOrderFails"><a href="#IfTheSilverOrderFails"></a>If The
            Silver Order Fails</h4>
        <p>Perhaps the events did not go well, or perhaps the player characters found themselves opposed to the Silver
            Order’s goals. If the Silver Order fails to take the gate, the Lord of the Feast claims the victory, putting
            many Silver Order knights on a gruesome display hanging over the city gate. The Silver Order maintain their
            position in Camp Dawn, but unless aided by the characters, fail to gain a footing in the city. If no help is
            offered, the Silver Order call for reinforcements from Elyria to help them take the city by force and begin
            to plan another attack that will take months to come to fruition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the characters have entered the Inner City to explore it, the Silver Order will announce their plans
                to take Temple Gate.</li>
            <li>If the player characters do not intervene, whether or not the Silver Order takes Temple Gate is up to
                you - we recommend whatever option creates the greatest complication for the Characters.</li>
            <li>Unless the player characters intervene, the Hooded Lanterns and the Silver Order join forces to take
                Temple Gate, however lacking the collaboration of the characters, this alliance disintegrates soon
                after, leaving the Silver Order unable to push further although they maintain control of the gate.</li>
            <li>If the characters have not interacted much with either the Hooded Lanterns or the Silver Order, but are
                already exploring the Inner City, choose either the Hooded Lanterns or the Silver Order and have them
                ask the characters if they will help them form an alliance for the taking of the gate. Whether or not
                this works is up for the characters to decide.</li>

        Square Plaza at the heart of Drakkenheim. Created at the behest of an eccentric monarch, this mechanical wonder
        mysteriously stopped one hundred eleven years ago, and its function as a public belltower was replaced by Saint
        Vitruvio’s Cathedral. Many early expedition teams into the ruins used the clocktower as a landmark and bivouac;
        remarkably the tower attic lies just above the Haze. Yet the highest spires of Drakkenheim are no safer than the
        streets below, especially since a bloodthirsty flock of harpies took to roost in the tower.</p>

        surround the square. Scattered across the plaza are the remains of Drakkenheim’s central open air market: rows
        of stalls, canvas tents, pavilions, baskets, crates, wagons, barrels, wheelbarrows, carts, and bones creating a

        this larger open hall is a gathering place for the city guild leaders and merchants, and contains offices,
        vaults, and a large auditorium that served as council chambers for the guild. However, the once-great vaulted
        roof has entirely collapsed, leaving mostly only the outer shell of the great building behind. Perhaps several

        three-hundred-foot tall square tower is about fifty feet wide at the base, with rounded turret corners and walls
        supported by great buttresses. The front facade is a mechanical wonder. Near the top of the tower is a massive
        thirty-foot-wide clock face made from glass, the numerals and hands filigreed with silver, brass, and gold.
        Above are several crenellated balconies, and the roof is a steep spire topped with a wrought-iron weathervane.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="022e8a0f-5210-4627-afbd-77e4cc94e38c">Bordering the central clock is an embossed metal and
        glass dial that depicts the transit of the sun and the phases of the moon through each month. From this dial,
        one can read not only the time but the date, as it shows a stylized interpretation of the seasons and
        constellations. Extending down the clock face is a further system of circular glass plates, gears, and wheels
        that illustrate in mechanical precision the grand cosmic dance of the planets and stars as they hurtle through
        the astral void. Multicoloured glass lenses superimposed over the planet depict the metaphysical orbit of the
        afterworlds and side-realms and their relation to the mortal world. The rest of the tower is decorated with
        elegant carved statues depicting angels, saints, demons, devils, elementals, and the various creatures of the
        worlds beyond. On some levels are rows of gothic windows with trefoil arches filled with stained-glass mosaics.

            windows allow some light to pass into the tower; many along the way are shattered and broken. The stone
            floor is covered in dust, bone, debris, and avian feces. Gears connected by chains, stacks of heavy dangling

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>A complex mechanism of gears, counterweights, and clockwork dominates this chamber. Several thin windows
            overlook the surrounding cityscape. The floor features several steel grates and wooden hatches that allow
            access to the machinery and bells below. A strange granite obelisk is set in place of the main clock
            pendulum; the core of the “ticking” mechanism that controls the clock. Three empty sockets lined with
            delicate copper tracery are cut into the stone. A fine elven script inlaid with thin lines of silver and
            gold are etched into the surrounding surface. Several pennies are precisely balanced atop it. A system of
            pulleys, winches, and levers connects it to the rest of the clockwork.</p>
        <p>A set of shelves here contain several notched metal discs, each kept in a paper folder bearing the title of a
            song. When the clock tower functioned, these discs could be loaded into the receptacle to determine which
            song was played by the bells.</p>
        <p>Several small and curious mechanical automatons wander listlessly around this chamber, examining and
            tinkering with the mechanical components. They are shaped like platonic polyhedrons with spindly mechanical
            limbs, disturbingly realistic glass eyes, and a mechanical mouthpiece.</p>

        <p>Not all the harpies who dwell in the clocktower may be present during the characters’ invasion. Characters
            who clear out the clocktower and wish to use it as a base of operations may find themselves dealing with
            counter-attacks from the former occupants for several weeks afterwards, or even from the Crimson Countess’
            former rivals.</p>
        <p>Taking the clocktower is a major campaign milestone, and the other factions are jealous of the
            accomplishment. A rival faction might attempt to find the characters here or even attempt to wrest control
            of the tower. While the characters can rely on the tower as a defensible place to rest, once the factions
            learn the characters use this place as a respite, they might dispatch strike teams to occupy the tower while
            the characters are absent. The characters would do well to make a good alliance to help them keep this
            holding secure, as if left abandoned other monsters and faction forces are quick to seize the opportunity to
            control this valuable strategic location. Nevertheless, once the characters have taken adequate steps to
            firmly defend their new holding, it is a critical base of operations for their future explorations.</p>

        <p>If any of the factions learn the characters have found one of the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>, it’s a major
            development. Locating this missing item ignites hope amongst the Hooded Lanterns of a realm restored, and
            attracts the intense interest of the Queen of Thieves. Any faction lieutenant can recognize the seal on
            sight, and if they see characters wearing it, they’ll make overtures to speak to their faction leader, who
            can explain the significance and powers of the item.</p>

        <aside class="text--quote-box">
            <p><strong>Ser Clockmaster,</strong></p>
            <p>Thank you for writing to me. I know you and your family have toiled hard for generations to keep the
                clocktower, despite the main mechanism failing a century ago. I must admit, I long believed the
                clocktower was a frivolous bit of architecture, based on a long-debunked cosmological theory.
                Nevertheless, a recent discovery upon the Isle of Skye has ignited my curiosity.</p>
            <p>The original machinery dates beyond antiquity, and many key components appear similar to devices found in
                several ancient elvish sites in Skye, though I cannot speak to their original purpose. Examining the
                clocktower mechanism indicates several delicate parts are heavily damaged and others are now missing,
                including the power source. We are confident components recovered from Skye could be used to repair it.
            </p>
            <p>These components are due to arrive at the Inscrutable Tower on September 13th. Please make arrangements
                for our mages and artificers to begin work on repairs the following week. Unfortunately, you will need
                to vacate the premises for the foreseeable future. We will draw up arrangements for the Amethyst Academy
                to lease the building.</p>

        commitment to the Followers of the Falling Fire are invited to complete a pilgrimage to the Crater’s Edge, where
        they will participate in a ritual known as the <em>Sacrament of Falling Fire</em> at the Chapel of Saint Gresha.
        Characters can participate on their own or as part of another group of Falling Fire pilgrims. While outsiders
        rarely witness the rite itself, the Followers of the Falling Fire will tolerate a respectful observer in the
        hopes that seeing the ritual might assuage any remaining doubt in their heart.</p>

        <p>Few structures are standing in the South Ward of Drakkenheim. Little remains save demolished foundations,
            massive chunks of blasted rock, and piles of rubble and debris. The thick fog of the Deep Haze blankets the
            wasteland. The direction of the devastation is unmistakable, however. Stone, brick, and timbers on any walls
            or pillars facing the crater itself appear melted rather than burned, and in some cases, pieces of rock or
            wood have partially turned into glass. Occasionally, you see the unmistakable glimmer of delerium fused into
            the ground or walls of a tumbledown building. The air here is cold, the mists billow about in hypnotic
            swirling patterns. A peculiar smell fills the air, it’s acrid and pungent as if some strange material were
            burning nearby. Once in a while you hear the sound of crumbling rock or the creaking collapse of a distant
            building.</p>

        <p>The crater basin is a forlorn and desolate place. The raw earth is a deep purple-brown colour. Black glass
            chips and rocky gravel crunch underfoot mixed with bits and pieces of unrecognizable masonry and flecks of
            delerium. Here and there you encounter peculiar vegetation: creeping moss that resembles exposed sinew or
            swelling tissue, with leaves like fleshy membranes and roots like spreading blood vessels. The strange
            plants cling to clusters of delerium and around pools of sludge.</p>

            <p><em>“This dire news only confirms what we already assumed to be true. Drakkenheim is no more.”</em></p>
            <p><strong>Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver</strong></p>
        </aside>
        <p>Characters who return expecting the factions to be united by their report will be disappointed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Hooded Lanterns.</strong></em> Elias Drexel is horrified by the characters’ report, which is a
            despair-inducing confirmation that restoring Drakkenheim will never be a simple matter, and a realization
            that he <em>will</em> need the help of another faction to accomplish it. The Lord Commander isn’t even sure
            he should reveal the characters’ report to the rank-and-file soldiers at large. He’s right. Mutiny in the
            ranks erupts at the news as the soldiers argue about the merits of working with the Silver Order, the
            Followers of the Falling Fire, or the Amethyst Academy. If the characters have made an enemy of any of these
            factions, a few loudly and defiantly proclaim the characters have doomed them all. Unless the characters and
            Elias Drexel can deliver another major victory <em>soon</em>, the unrest festers and the Hooded Lanterns
            disintegrate into fractious warbands.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Amethyst Academy.</strong></em> Eldrick Runeweaver is fascinated by the news of the Delerium
            Heart, and openly remarks that unfathomable arcane power could be harnessed from it (and thereby prevent
            whatever calamity affected the alien world from happening here). After several days, he returns to the
            characters and asks them if they might be prepared to mount another expedition to set up a magical arcane
            relay he’s designed. If the characters didn’t bring back the <em>pristine delerium geode</em>, he also asks
            them to obtain it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Falling Fire.</strong></em> Once characters return from the crater’s heart, Lucretia Mathias can
            explain the meaning of any visions they beheld. She then reveals the purpose of the Sacrament: by storing
            enough faithful souls in delerium, she believes the substance itself will become an earthly vessel for the
            Sacred Flame, transforming the scourge of the universe into its savior. The sanctified delerium will spread
            light through the cosmos. When asked about the fate of this world, Lucretia Mathias remarks that the Sacred
            Flame has always required mortals make sacrifices for the cause of righteousness. Whether or not her claims
            are true cannot be determined until the events are allowed to occur.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Silver Order.</strong></em> Theodore Marshal sees no further argument at this point: Drakkenheim
            must be burned to the ground. The fate of the world rests upon it. Doing so isn’t going to be simple, and
            now the mission is clear: the Silver Order must resurrect Argonath to use his dragonfire to destroy the
            Delerium Heart.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Queen’s Men.</strong></em> The Queen of Thieves can only react with laughter to this knowledge.
            The fact that such a horrific threat lies in the heart of the city is music to her ears. As long as it’s
            there, no one will ever truly be able to control Drakkenheim - except her. The Queen of Thieves aims to
            weaponize this knowledge to sow doubt and discord in the other factions, especially the Hooded Lanterns.
            Whatever the characters saw in those visions isn’t going to happen anytime soon, anyways.</p>

        south of Castle Drakken, a walled off community known as the Kleinberg Estate stands. Amongst the ruins and
        debris, several of the large mansions have survived the devastation of Drakkenheim. One such estate has become
        lively with activity in recent years. Figures have been seen coming and going from it, which has spurred
        whispers and rumours within the taverns of Emberwood village. Conversations between forlorn adventurers and
        sickly survivors speak of a mage working out of the estate who has means to help those who are suffering with
        contamination. The validity of these claims is yet to be proven, and so those seeking help best be wary, as more
        often than not, people who have ventured deeper in search of a cure seldom return.</p>

            and perspiring strange black nodules laced with prismatic colour. The glowing stone illuminates the room.
            Opposite the pool is a wide arched canal from which water flows into the chamber. The air is cold and damp,

        monarchs, but those who were royal consorts have also been commemorated here. Over time, more monuments to other
        well-known women who defined the history of Drakkenheim were constructed here as well. Commonfolk and nobles
        alike spoke of fondly losing themselves in Queen’s Park as they wandered its elegant beauty on summer
        afternoons. Now covered by the Deep Haze, one might indeed become lost here forever.</p>

        <p>This regal garden is decorated with opulent stone staircases with pillared railings that ascend between the
            tiers. The main garden is highlighted by two large shimmering pools, bordered with tiled stone, while
            multiple lilies float upon the glistening water, pulsing gently with an eldritch glow. Several gnarled and
            beautiful cherry blossom trees accent the tiers of the garden in an eternal state of bloom, while petals of
            hot pink, electric blue, and neon violet fall softly, covering the entire area in waves of colour.</p>
        <p>The bubbling of fountains and rustling of wind through trees add a peaceful ambiance to the garden, which is
            decorated with many statues of a tall woman with elegant limbs wearing outrageous dresses and costumes. The
            face of each statue has been chiseled off . Centred on the upper tier is a statue of the same figure with a
            lily in her hand, and like the others the face of the statue has been carved away. Light marble walls
            separate the tiers and are etched with relief carvings of faces of princesses, queens, maidens and many
            others who served the von Kessels. Moss, ivy, and unnaturally bright flowers cling to many of the statues
            and walls. Nestled between the staircases and pools is a set of large beaten brass doors, colour shifted and
            oxidized by years of wear. The doors have a floral patterned border and two massive handles shaped like
            lilies. These doors are the entrance to the grotto below.</p>

        <p>Descending the stairs leads to a circular vaulted chamber decorated floor to ceiling with mosaics. The
            geometric patterns depict magical aquatic humanoids such as merfolk, nymphs, and water weirds delightfully
            relaxing in fantastically extravagant yet everyday activities: playing sports, enjoying meals, taking baths,
            and cavorting with terrestrial lovers. The chamber is comfortably cool and filled with a pleasant moist
            odor; the sound of gurgling water echoes down the hall.</p>
        <p>In the middle of the chamber is a circular fountain set with a nymph-like figure holding a trident and a
            vase. Water pours from the opening to fill the fountain with crystal clear water. Around and within the
            fountain are arranged painted ceramic vases, glass collectables, and loose coins.</p>
        <p>The mosaics extend along short hallways leading to the east and west, ending in smaller rooms of similar
            construction. Arches set with barred iron gates are cut into the walls in three places. Each leads to a
            roughly hewn and stepped cavernous passage that descends gently while twisting sharply south.</p>

        <p>An underground pond fills most of this large artificial cavern, filled by a flowing stream to the west. The
            water glows softly with prismatic light, and across the surface are dozens of purple-pink eldritch lilies.
            The great roots from the trees above have broken through the ceiling in places to drink deeply from the
            lambent water.</p>
        <p>An exquisitely upholstered velvet chaise lounge with gold-painted armrests and plush pillows is set atop
            several overlapping woven rugs. Scattered around the furnishings lies the extensive baggage train of a
            fabulously wealthy noblewoman. A mahogany chest of drawers is overflowing with pompous gowns, fashionable
            dresses, multicoloured wigs, oversized hats, and fantastically impractical shoes. An oaken coffer is
            brimming with elaborate jewellery, and several smaller containers, suitcases, and baskets are overstuffed
            with more clothing, artwork, gems, and coins.</p>
        <p>Several portraits and paintings are arranged about the chamber. Many paintings show a noblewoman wearing a
            golden necklace set with eleven emeralds, but within each the face has been torn off. One painting shows the
            woman posing with a noble family: a young teen man, two girls - one perhaps eight, the other no more than
            five - and a portly and bearded man wearing a crown.</p>

        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Lenore"><a href="#Lenore"></a>Lenore</h4>
        <p>Lenore can be kept tranquil or pacified by characters who play into her delusions, or temporarily <a
                class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip" href="/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition"
                data-tooltip-href="/conditions/1-tooltip">blinded</a> if she sees her own face. It may be possible to
            capture her or bring her out of the Garden, but as a contaminated creature she’ll die in a few days if taken
            outside the Haze.</p>
        <p>The former Queen is a powerful symbol of the old monarchy. As such, should Elias Drexel and the Hooded
            Lanterns learn of her survival, they demand Lenore be placed under their custody in the Drakkenheim
            Garrison. If the characters accept, the Hooded Lanterns reward the characters with an appropriate boon for
            their deed. This act alone cements the support of the Hooded Lanterns, and they’ll look favourably upon an
            alliance with another faction the characters might be working alongside. However, should the characters
            refuse, the Hooded Lanterns cast them as royal kidnappers. Elias Drexel expends every effort to rescue
            Lenore and bring the party to justice.</p>
        <p>If Lenore was killed and the characters inform Hooded Lanterns, the soldiers are devastated, but don’t seek
            retribution. They understand the characters did what they had to do against a contaminated monster. Even
            still, this blunder means Elias Drexel no longer believes the characters have the best interests of
            Drakkenheim in mind. Unless they prove otherwise through greater deeds, the Hooded Lanterns become
            ambivalent about working with the party in the future.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Curing Lenore.</strong></em> Unfortunately, the Hooded Lanterns don’t possess the means to
            reverse Lenore’s transformation, and must turn to the other factions for help:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Silver Order makes an honest effort to use cleric spells to cure Lenore, but this fails. As such,
                they suggest a swift and merciful death is the most honorable course for a contaminated creature such as
                Lenore. They demand the Hooded Lanterns euthanize her as a condition for any future alliance.</li>
            <li>The Amethyst Academy offers to help find a way to reverse her transformation in return for help retaking
                the Inscrutable Tower. They suggest the characters seek out the Pale Man to acquire his research. If
                these works are turned over to the Academy, the mages will aid the characters in developing the <a
                    class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2221559-siphon-contamination"
                    data-tooltip-href="/spells/2221559-tooltip">siphon contamination</a> spell.</li>
            <li>The Queen of Thieves suspects a wish from the Crown of Westemär could be used to cure Lenore, but
                reveals this information carefully. Naturally, if the Hooded Lanterns keep Lenore in the Drakkenheim
                Garrison, the Queen’s Men stage a kidnapping attempt for ransom!</li>
            <li>The Followers of the Falling Fire don’t care much for the old monarchy, but Lucretia Mathias offers to
                call upon her divine powers to restore Lenore to her human form. This requires a great show of faith:
                Lucrecia Mathias only agrees to perform the miracle if Elias Drexel and the Hooded Lanterns leadership
                agree to join the Followers of the Falling Fire by taking the Sacrament.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em><strong>Queen-Regent.</strong></em> If her transformation is somehow reversed, Lenore has the statistics
            of a human <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/16966-noble"
                data-tooltip-href="/monsters/16966-tooltip">noble</a>. While she could possibly take up the throne as a
            Queen-Regent, this is an extremely dubious claim. Lenore was wed into House von Kessel, and so her political
            authority comes from her spouse and children. Worse, while Lenore adores the trappings of power and wealth,
            she loathes actual political responsibility. She wields her influence for personal gain only. Still, she
            could prove instrumental in confirming the identity of her offspring, but she doesn’t know where they are or
            what happened to them.</p>

                data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/7755379-tooltip">aqua expurgo</a> requires alchemical tools and eight
            hours of work by a character who knows the formula and can cast spells of 3rd level or higher. The recipe

            reagents, and two ounces of blood taken from a contaminated monster.</p>
        <p>Oscar Yoren and his apprentices can produce the potion given the materials, as can the Amethyst Academy, the
            Hooded Lanterns, and the Followers of the Falling Fire if they are given the formula.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Cultivating an Eldritch Lily Garden.</strong></em> Rather than continually revisiting the garden
            to acquire more flowers, inventive characters might propose creating a garden of their own. Characters who
            carefully collect two dozen complete eldritch lily plants - not just the flowers - can begin their own plot.
            They’ll need a location within the Haze with ample contaminated water, as eldritch lily plants taken out of
            the Haze wilt and die within twenty four hours. The strongholds of the Followers of the Falling Fire and the
            Hooded Lanterns, as well as Reed Manor, are suitable sites for a safely accessible lily garden, but the
            Amethyst Academy has the means to create one at their remote strongholds as well.</p>
        <p>This ensures a consistent supply of reagents for crafting <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"

            outset of any mission. Characters who wish to create additional doses must either do so themselves or
            provide extra gold and materials to ensure the garden isn’t overfarmed.</p>

        Rose Theatre, which is oddly sheltered from the city ruins by an invisible barrier, guarded by uncontaminated
        elemental creatures and arcane constructs. Here, the characters encounter Ryan Greymere, a talented <a

        been branded a malfeasant wizard, Ryan Greymere doesn’t practice contaminated magic, unlike Oscar Yoren and the
        Pale Man. Instead, she’s crafted a potent suit of magic armour that protects against contamination.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ee36322c-69bd-4308-b285-938139dc8742">It’s up to the player characters how to deal with
        her. They can slay her to claim her magic items and seize her spellbooks, but could gain much by negotiating
        with her. They might even be able to broker an agreement to admit her back into the Amethyst Academy.</p>

        is hiding alone in the Inner City under magical defenses, she expects anyone who has penetrated the magical

        Ryan Greymere’s trailblazing research led to many early discoveries about delerium, and she designed many of the
        procedures used by the Academy to make magic items using the crystals. However, she shocked the Directorate by
        presenting a dramatic plan for the Amethyst Academy to overtly seize control of Drakkenheim by force. Such
        action would grossly overstep the Edicts of Lumen, but Greymere flippantly replied that the realms and clergy
        were in no place to actually enforce the Edicts anymore. As a result, she was branded malfeasant, disavowed by
        the Academy, and most insultingly, the Directorate took credit for her discoveries. She fled into Drakkenheim,
        and now plans on gaining access to the Inscrutable Tower and continuing her research in private.</p>

            Greymere’s Research</h4>
        <p>Characters can learn the following from speaking with Ryan Greymere or studying her writing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em><strong>Formation of Delerium Crystals.</strong></em> “Magic attracts more magic. Under
                extraordinarily rare circumstances, magical energies crystallize into delerium. The stones slowly draw
                more raw magic into the world from distant planes, possible realities, and alternate dimensions. The
                rate is exponential. Considerably more leakage occurs around vast quantities of delerium. These chaotic
                energies are inherently destabilizing. Unfocused magic conjures up paradoxical improbabilities at
                random, leaving behind lingering eldritch contamination. Uncontained, these magical forces manifest as
                the Haze. More delerium forms within, and so the process accelerates.”</li>
            <li><em><strong>Emergence of Dimensional Rifts.</strong></em> “As it expands, the Haze both transforms the
                landscape, but it also conjures magical energy from the Space Between Worlds. I’m concerned that in
                areas where magic was already concentrated or where the borders between worlds are thin, it could result
                in catastrophic dimensional rifts.”</li>
            <li><em><strong>Possible containment.</strong></em> “Delerium presents an existential danger, but also
                opportunity. The concentration of delerium in Drakkenheim could provide an infinite supply of magical
                energy if directly harnessed, rather than simply crafting items individually. I’ve found promising
                results so far at collecting the energy given off by the stones - the problem is storage and
                containment. The abjurations required are just outside my wheelhouse. If it could be accomplished
                at-scale, not only would it be possible to fuel endless magical creations, it might actually slow the
                growth of the Haze, even hold it at equilibrium.”</li>
            <li><em><strong>Hazewalker Plate and Bottled Comet Schematics.</strong></em> Ryan Gremere’s research notes
                include the formula and blueprints to create these items (See <a

            about her relationship with the Academy, and her disdain for the monarchy. She scoffs at the idea of
            restoring the royal bloodline, and feels the world is better off without kings and queens. If player
            characters decide to help Ryan Greymere, she asks that they bring her a <a
                class="tooltip-hover item-tooltip" href="/equipment/357-delerium-geode"
                data-tooltip-href="/adventuring-gear/357-tooltip">delerium geode</a> for each character who wants <a

                data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/7755401-tooltip">Hazewalker Plate</a>. She will construct the armour for
            the characters but she requires access to the Inscrutable Tower.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Rejoining the Academy.</strong></em> Ryan Greymere holds no grudges against Eldrick Runeweaver or
            River, but is very open with her opinions on the Academy Directorate. However, she understands that a lot of
            their decisions are forced on them by the Edicts of Lumen, and regards the Silver Order and the oppression
            of mageborn responsible for limiting her potential to help the world and solve the issues of Drakkenheim. It
            may be possible for characters to convince the Academy to set aside their feud and have Ryan Greymere join
            once more. Ultimately, she would most like to be elected Archmage of Drakkenheim, but she might also
            collaborate with Eldrick Runeweaver. In either case, she proves to be a valuable asset, and her research and
            inventions could greatly advance the Academy’s goals. Unfortunately, Ryan Greymere’s fierce political
            opinions may complicate attempts to have the Amethyst Academy collaborate with other factions.</p>

                data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/7755401-tooltip">Hazewalker Plate</a> requires magically-enchanted
            smithing tools and a well-equipped arcane forge (such facilities can only be found within the Inscrutable
            Tower or other distant Amethyst Academy strongholds). It takes thirty days of work by a character who knows
            the schematics and can cast spells of 7th level or higher. The recipe calls for one delerium geode, 10,000
            gp in alchemical reagents, and five ingots of refined meteoric iron in addition to enough conventional steel
            and materials for making either half-plate or plate. Ryan Greymere can craft a suit given facilities and
            materials, as can the Amethyst Academy.</p>

        Flame, the patron saint of Drakkenheim. Along with the ancient gold dragon Argonath, this righteous warrior
        saved Drakkenheim from a marauding army led by chromatic dragons that descended upon Westemär from the eastern
        vale centuries ago. Argonath gave their life in that battle, and Saint Vitruvio subsequently died slaying the
        half-dragon warlock behind the terrible scourge. Their bones and equipment have been kept as holy relics since,
        as Saint Vitruvio prophesied the gold dragon could be resurrected should Drakkenheim ever fall to darkness.</p>

        built to house their remains. However, it is a relatively recent construction, only completed a little over a
        century ago to replace another large chapel that was torn down during the expansion of the city walls. Long
        before, the site was home to several crypts and crematory gardens, and the dead are still interred in the
        catacombs below the contemporary building. Following its completion, worshippers would travel for miles around
        to make prayers and offerings to the Sacred Flame here. After the meteor fell, these hallowed halls became a

            central dome that looms large over the gently sloping terracotta rooftops of the surrounding townhouses. The
            main dome is flanked by four stocky towers meticulously decorated with religious iconography and angelic
            sculptures. Between each are semicircular apses lined with stained glass windows fifty feet high, thus the
            building has a roughly square footprint. The outer facade has rows of alcoves containing life-size statues
            of valiant paladins and devoted clerics. Broad steps lead up to the columned entrance portico where a
            massive rose window rests above three sets of golden double doors embossed with heavenly visages.</p>
        <p>Splayed out before the majestic building is a sprawling and ramshackle camp of makeshift hovels, smoking
            pyres, and improvised barricades. Tall wooden stakes are driven into the ground along the streets,
            displaying macabre trophies of bones, ribcages, skulls, and body parts. Guttural yelps and furious howls
            echo down the streets, and the overpowering scent of decaying offal, feces, and wet animal fur wafts about

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>The Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio houses a vast interior space. A monumental rotunda topped with a
            two-hundred-fifty-foot-high dome forms the central sanctuary where the Brazier of the Sacred Flame is set.
            The ribbed roof features an elaborate fresco depicting an angelic host descending from on high, lifting the
            wretched and the lost towards a divine light symbolized by a blazing sun. A row of stout yawning windows
            rings the base of the dome, bordered by multifaceted mirrors that create angular beams of light leaving
            spotlights on the floor and walls around the central altar.</p>
        <p>Four halls extend in each cardinal direction like wheel spokes from the rotunda. Colossal marble columns
            decorated with cherubs line the aisles down each and support high vaulted ceilings one hundred twenty feet
            overhead. Murals upon the ceilings of the naves and aisles depict scenes of saints, angels, and martyrs
            performing righteous acts of mercy, compassion, and sacrifice. Each hall ends in a semicircular apse set
            with arched stained glass windows fifty feet high, except the southern hall that serves as the main
            entrance, above which is a rose window.</p>
        <p>Unnatural hues from outside flood this once holy place through the many windows, and cast the chambers in an
            unsettling and otherworldly pallor. The sanctuary has been defiled by the countless carcasses of the
            garmyr’s many slaughters. Broken bones and severed limbs are strewn about carpets of stretched skin and
            furry hide. Debris and refuse are caked into the cracks and crevices, vibrant red blood smears the floors
            and walls. Flensing blades, barbed chains, and meat hooks dangle from the torch sconces. Unrecognizable
            forms of hanging meat decorate the elaborate chandeliers above. At the heart of the cathedral is a tiered
            platform upon which rests a five-foot-wide granite brazier. Instead of a glorious golden flame, piled within
            is a mountain of blood-soaked skulls.</p>

        sealed behind warded doors of stone, which slide open only when a beam of heavenly light is shone into the
        aperture lenses upon them. A beam of light originates above each of the Ascendant Archangel statues (detailed
        below), then characters must direct the beams down the halls by bouncing the light from mirrored shields found
        throughout the catacombs. Solving the puzzle requires placing the varying numbers of shields in specific
        positions then facing them in different directions to open the doors.</p>

        upon these doors save an embedded bronze aperture set with a thick glass lens at the centre. Peering through
        provides a distorted view of the chamber beyond. Engravings on each door depict resolute paladins and righteous
        heroes of the Sacred Flame.</p>

        collected above the cathedral dome and shines down upon the Ascendant Archangels, where it becomes a clearly
        visible magical beam of heavenly light. These beams do not harm creatures or damage objects, and travel in
        straight lines. They can only be reflected off mirrored shields found in the crypts or those borne by the
        Ascendant Archangels. Any other reflective surface causes the beams to fizzle out.</p>

        silver shields with brilliant reflective surfaces are hidden throughout the catacombs. Each weighs twenty pounds
        and is entirely impractical for actual defense, and don’t have any other properties beyond reflecting the
        heavenly beams. Either side of the shield can reflect the heavenly beams, obeying the laws of reflection,
        although solving the puzzles in the crypt only requires the beams be bounced at hard ninety-degree angles.</p>

                Queen of Thieves directly controls this unfortunate captive and makes them behave as if they were
                actually her in person. She coordinates with her spies and assassins to launch an assassination strike
                against a vulnerable faction leader or the player characters. Blackjack Mel does not attend, however.
            </li>
            <li>Elias Drexel, Theodore Marshal, and Lucretia Mathias arrive with a large contingent of their own faction
                troops nearby, ready to storm the cathedral if violence breaks out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All the faction leaders are keenly aware that violence could break out at any moment, but in fact, none of
            them are actually willing to <em>start</em> a fight here. During the discussion, faction leaders should
            bring up the following key questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What are the true motives of the player characters? Whose side are they on, really?</li>
            <li>Which faction should control the cathedral?</li>
            <li>What will be done about the royal documents?</li>
            <li>Who will hold any <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em> discovered so far? Who should rule Drakkenheim?</li>
            <li>How should delerium be used?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During this meeting, the roleplaying traits of the factions, their goals, and the faction leaders should be
            fully presented. Draw bright lines in the conflict, and don’t be afraid to put the characters on the spot:
            each faction leader should address each player character directly at least once with a difficult question of
            some kind.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Brutal Betrayal</strong></em> (optional). If the player characters have greatly antagonized one
            of the factions before this meeting, that faction either secretly mobilizes several elite strike teams on
            standby or plants powerful explosives under the cathedral prior to the meeting. They also orchestrate an
            escape plan for their leader (which in the case of the Academy or the Queen of Thieves isn’t needed since
            they are only present by proxy). During the meeting, the leader demands to be given either all of the
            <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>, the Relics of Saint Vitruvio, control of the cathedral, or any other insane
            ultimatum appropriate for the faction. If their demands aren’t met, their forces attack or they detonate the
            explosives, which create a massive explosion akin to a <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
                href="/spells/2189-meteor-swarm" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2189-tooltip">meteor swarm</a> that fills
            the cathedral and collapses the roof and dome.</p>
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ReignitingtheBrazier"><a
                href="#ReignitingtheBrazier"></a>Reigniting the Brazier</h4>
        <p>Lucretia Mathias and Ophelia Reed both offer to reignite the <em>Brazier of the Sacred Flame</em> and
            reconsecrate the cathedral. This requires some ashes or bone fragments from a saint: either those of Saint
            Vitruvio himself or the gold dragon, Argonath, which can be recovered from the cathedral catacombs. If
            re-lit, the cathedral brazier fills the area with effects similar to <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
                href="/spells/2135-hallow" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2135-tooltip">hallow</a> and <a
                class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2113-forbiddance"
                data-tooltip-href="/spells/2113-tooltip">forbiddance</a>, and becomes a sanctuary in the city against
            the Haze where characters may rest normally.</p>
        <p>If the cathedral was bombed, the brazier is destroyed and can’t be reignited.</p>
        <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Aftermath"><a href="#Aftermath"></a>Aftermath</h4>
        <p>The cathedral remains hotly contested ground: the Followers of the Falling Fire and the Silver Order will try
            to take it from each other after these meetings regardless of how the negotiations turned out. If the Hooded
            Lanterns or the Queen of Thieves aren’t able to gain the information in the House von Kessel vault, they’ll
            launch counterstrikes as well to obtain them.</p>
        <p>Any faction who holds onto the cathedral can establish a shaky safe haven there, but doing so stretches the
            faction’s forces thin. Nevertheless, the player characters can use it as a base of operations. Ultimately,
            holding the cathedral for more than 14 (4d6) weeks proves untenable due to constant attrition, unless the
            player characters take action to drive out enemy factions and complete their allies’ major objectives. By
            taking the cathedral the player characters have a major opportunity, but they must take advantage of it
            before it’s too late.</p>

        crossing the Drann River, and west to Market Square Plaza. Centuries ago the square was the core of the Old
        Town, home to the main marketplace and simply known as Flagstone Square. As the city grew it became a civic
        centre and eventually, a place for public executions. Its present moniker has never been more appropriate. The

        probably run. The Executioner is not a foe to be defeated, but rather an obstacle to be avoided (or perhaps an
        asset to use should the opportunity emerge to lure an unsuspecting foe here!). It is a reminder of the callous
        and uncontrollable dangers present in Drakkenheim. Embrace clever solutions your characters invent to escape or
        bypass this threat, but should your players engage the Executioner directly in combat, <em>do not pull any
            punches</em>. They have made an incredibly foolish mistake by confronting a well-telegraphed deathtrap, and
        should be served their just desserts!</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4037a4d4-b5c4-4af5-ab0d-d35fc0e758be">Characters might also attempt sneaking into a
        faction stronghold for a specific purpose, such as rescuing a prisoner, sabotaging resources or defenses, spying
        on the faction, stealing an important item, or even assassinating the faction leader. Every faction expects this
        to happen and has taken reasonable and intelligent precautions that should provide exciting challenges for
        stealthy characters. Factions that acquire key items in the campaign, such as the <em>Relics of Saint
            Vitruvio</em> or the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em> store them in secure locations usually guarded personally
        by the faction leader, set up extra patrols, and may ask faction spellcasters to use protective spells such as

    <p data-content-chunk-id="24342e89-8aca-4559-89c8-1729d581cfcb">At some point in the campaign, the player characters
        may lead an invasion on an enemy stronghold in an all-out attack to drive an enemy faction out of Drakkenheim.
        The stakes should be appropriately high for such an exciting and decisive moment; a stronghold assault is a
        win-or-die play. You should give the players the opportunity to take the lead in coming up with a battle plan
        with their allies, and put the full resources (and tricks) of each faction front-and-centre.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f142ddf0-cee9-45b3-b243-2a6f1f27671d">However, given the troops involved, most factions
        simply cannot hide when they muster forces for an all-out attack on another faction stronghold unless specific
        and extensive action is taken to conceal it. This gives the besieged faction time to prepare its defenses and
        take adequate precautions, so you should increase the numbers of NPCs present, place faction strike teams in key
        locations, and secure the chamber of the faction leader and the main entrances to each stronghold.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="97a03614-4a63-41d3-aa44-483422384d56">During an all-out assault, it’s best to have the
        player characters face down elite faction strike teams, spearhead an attack on the main gates, launch a commando
        raid to sabotage an important defense, or have a dramatic showdown with a faction lieutenant or the faction
        leader, while their faction allies engage the rank-and-file to hold off reinforcements. The focus of any faction
        stronghold assault should be on heroic action, not a cumbersome mass combat scenario (unless your players
        <em>really</em> enjoy such scenarios).</p>

        <p>This wide sewer passage has been transformed into a makeshift tavern. The main canal is drained, relatively
            dry, and blocked with debris in several places. Wooden planks hammered and lashed across the canal form
            bridges and decks above, accessible through ladder-like stairways. The broad upper sewer walkways have been
            cleared out to make room for about a dozen round tables with stools set around each. Hanging lanterns are
            strung up throughout to light the chamber, and a few coal stoves provide meager warmth. An impressive bar
            has been constructed, lined with barstools from which a curiously dapper mechanical barman serves ale and
            mead. At the far end of the tavern is a small band of ruffians performing lively music upon an improvised
            stage. Several rogues and thieves mingle about.</p>

        Garrison. This building was the former stronghold of the city guard, and so made a perfect base of operations
        for the Hooded Lanterns. The Garrison takes up an entire city block; fortified stone walls extend from a squat
        round keep and enclose several barracks, stables, workshops, and storehouses. Deep beneath the garrison is a
        well-secured stockade prison.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bb9ac3e9-f9cd-4eed-be07-9b5d82752066">The Hooded Lanterns secured a major victory just
        last year when they drove out the monsters occupying the garrison. When the greencloaks discovered that the
        prison cells were sufficiently shielded and insulated from the Haze, Lord Commander Elias Drexel ordered it
        repurposed into living quarters then began relocating his forces here. Since then, the regiment has expended
        considerable resources repairing the defences. It has been a gruelling, dangerous, and time-consuming operation,
        but now the renewed fortress is the perfect strongpoint for launching future incursions deep into the city.</p>

        and meant to withstand infiltration, attacks, and sabotage. It is by far one of the most secure locations in the
        city besides Castle Drakken itself. Fully stocked, it could house and feed hundreds of defenders for weeks.
        However, since the Haze forces the occupants to rest in the underground prison and rapidly contaminates food and
        water stores, only about 300 soldiers occupy the base at any one time. Moreover, the force must still be
        constantly rotated to ensure troops stay fresh and well-rested, as field conditions are not unlike a castle
        under siege. Not everyone stationed here is a warrior, however, and a few especially brave cooks, smiths, and
        other personnel have come to aid the efforts of the Hooded Lanterns here.</p>

        the massive tower would have taken decades to build.</p>

        legendary hidden fortress of the Sorcerer Kings. This extraplanar dungeon was built within the roiling realm of
        chaotic possibility known as the Space Between Worlds in far antiquity by powerful and insane sorcerers to hide
        away their magical knowledge, but was left forgotten and abandoned for a thousand years. When the mages of the
        Amethyst Academy located it several hundred years ago, they tapped into the immense power of its Arcane Nexus to
        shift the whole structure into the mortal world, where it now stands in Drakkenheim. Since then, the Amethyst
        Academy gradually expunged most records and memories of this accomplishment to rehabilitate the tower’s evil and
        ominous history. Yet there are many secrets about this place unknown to even the Amethyst Academy, including
        whatever magical forces now hold the tower together even after a meteor smashed through it.</p>

        <p>The Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst Academy is an immensely tall structure that reaches a dizzying height

            embellishment along its outer face save a deep vertical groove cut into the pinnacle. Seen at a distance the
            tower appears relatively narrow, though it is roughly one hundred fifty feet wide and anchored by sharply
            arched buttresses at the base. The tower has been smashed apart roughly two-thirds up its height.
            Remarkably, the top of the tower hovers above in utter defiance of gravity. Between the upper and lower
            sections is a gaping breach with pieces of floating debris locked in the air; frozen in time at the moment a

        <p>The Library of the Inscrutable Tower is a vast and dizzying place. Staircases zig-zag from wall to wall,
            weaving up the height of the tower between walkways of black marble with railings of dark steel and massive
            floating bookshelves of speckled granite and glass lined up like airborne dominoes. The stairs and shelves
            rumble lowly as they shift positions to converge at suspended balconies and galleries where obsidian-topped
            tables, plush couches, and amber spheres of glowing light are arranged into reading nooks and studying
            desks. Throughout, many stairs and platforms are nauseatingly oriented sideways, some even completely
            upside-down and backwards.</p>
        <p>Every conceivable surface stores books. The balconies, furniture, walls, and even the steps of each stair all
            have cavities, niches, and shelves containing tomes of varying shapes, sizes, materials, and colours, some
            in neat and tightly organized rows, others in disheveled piles and scattered masses of pages.</p>

        <li data-content-chunk-id="dd82cf5e-d01f-4ba0-9f77-0e7e5b739458">The elevators stop at the ground level of the

    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="686e8fc8-1b1e-4d64-82db-11e33f6c8fc2"><em><strong>Stairs.</strong></em> Most staircases
        are thirty to fifty foot long sections, each five feet wide. The stairs connect and disconnect to each other and
        the platforms by some unfathomable pattern. For any given stair section, roll 1d20 each round, and on a 1, it
        moves.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="19c5f173-76c4-4c5d-b081-98face8343e6"><em><strong>Platforms.</strong></em> The various
        platforms have a variety of equilateral shapes - square, triangular, hexagonal - and range from ten to thirty
        feet in diameter. The ground level of the library is arranged into reading nooks and study desks like the other
        platforms.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d914f25a-2f9d-43b1-8fc6-6a7d251574a1"><em><strong>Gravity.</strong></em> Gravity is
        subjective here. Characters can walk normally on staircases and platforms, even sideways or upside-down.
        Creatures levitate in midair instead of falling, but those lacking a flying speed must move by pushing or
        pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a railing or bookcase), which allows them to
        move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="914924e5-5962-426a-91dc-5f0a64f9bc19"><em><strong>Soaring Intellect.</strong></em> A

        every conceivable topic, from artworks, history, natural philosophy, magical matters, mathematics, and more.
        Among the books are introductory and advanced texts, exhaustive commentaries on those texts, poignant
        commentaries on those commentaries, scathing refutations of that commentary, a rebuttal to refutations of the
        commentaries, treatises that purportedly reinvent the topics altogether, and many works of complete fiction and

            to stay the hand of the Amethyst Academy in the short term, who are terrified of losing such a precious
            resource. A cunning foe could extort the Academy for all its worth by doing so. Although Eldrick Runeweaver
            might enact a last-ditch effort by launching a few schemes to reclaim the tower, if he’s defeated, the
            distant Academy Directorate takes the long view and resorts to appeasement.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e6d3fb03-520b-4db4-bc45-f52f533fe799">This cloistered refuge lies on a small hill
        overlooking the Drann River in the South Ward of the city. Originally built when Drakkenheim only occupied the
        north bank, the city streets were built up around the monastery grounds over time. It served as the primary
        residence for the clergy of the Sacred Flame who tended the cathedrals and chapels throughout Drakkenheim. A few
        hundred acolytes and priests dwelt in humble comfort within its austere walls and living cells.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="baf85d5a-5db7-4e8e-beec-02aefab77263">Lucretia Mathias and her close followers began
        gathering here shortly after they completed the first pilgrimages of the Falling Fire. The area is completely
        covered by the Deep Haze and the nearby waters are contaminated, but those who complete the sacrament are immune
        to such hazards and can rest in Drakkenheim normally. As such, the otherwise lightly defended abbey is an ideal
        sanctuary for the most devoted adherents of the Falling Fire. Roughly a hundred sanctified members of the
        Falling Fire dwell within the monastery proper now, but hundreds more occupy the squalid campsite that has
        sprung up immediately outside the monastery.</p>

        Drakken. Once a royal palace, military fortress, and administrative hub, the stronghold is now a grim monument
        to madness and horror. Any who wish to discover what ultimately happened to King Ulrich IV or unearth conclusive
        evidence to prove a royal claim will find what they are seeking here. Those who come bearing the <em>Seals of
            Drakkenheim</em> may even be able seat a new ruler upon the <em>Throne of Drakkenheim</em>, if they can
        defeat the deadly creatures conjured by the Haze and the former castle guardians left unhinged by its influence.

        this chapter carefully: Castle Drakken is a sprawling and dynamic environment with many interconnected
        interactions. There is no set order in which characters must progress through the castle! High level characters
        have many abilities including flight and teleportation, and the following scenarios are designed with these
        capabilities in mind. Characters lacking these powers may find Castle Drakken significantly more difficult.</p>

        might first discover a similar rift within the Inscrutable Tower. In this case, Eldrick Runeweaver may theorize
        that other such rifts could form within the Haze, especially around areas where structures were infused with

        castle grounds and determine what lurks within the palace, especially the throne room and the royal apartments.

        <p>The Space Between Worlds is a roiling non-place. The rift manifests on the other side as an abrupt tear in
            the peripheral perception. A pernicious beam of multihued light stretches across the effulgent sky, marking
            a distant place beyond an impossible horizon where the Amalgamation’s multitudinous manifestations converge.
            There is no meaningful concept of time in the Space Between Worlds - it is beyond the perception of mortal
            creatures - so reaching that place is a journey of eons that unfolds in only 1d10 minutes of time in the
            mortal world. Nevertheless, should an intrepid band make the journey and destroy the Amalgamation here as
            well, the dimensional rift closes one round of apparent time later. Any characters left behind in the Space
            Between Worlds must find another means back, but the scope of such adventures is beyond this book.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Johann Eisner believes Drakkenheim is forever cursed, and has resigned himself to be its jailer. When he
            meets the characters, Eisner explains how it might be possible for him to close the dimensional rift if he
            is invested with the power of the <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accomplishing this task requires each of the six <em>Seals of Drakkenheim</em> and the <a

                foundation pillar.</li>
            <li>This will attune Eisner to the Seals, but won’t grant him the full powers of the throne or the crown
                since a coronation ritual isn’t performed. He is only able to pacify the <a

                creatures anymore, but instead attack monsters who come near. However, he is able to use this power to
                close the dimension rift.</li>
            <li>If Eisner dies or another creature attunes to the crown, the rift reopens.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CoronationCeremony"><a href="#CoronationCeremony"></a>Coronation
            Ceremony</h3>
        <p>This special ceremony takes two hours to perform and requires seven participants. During this time, one
            participant (the “heir”) must sit upon the <em>Throne of Drakkenheim</em> wearing the <a
                class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/7755391-crown-of-westemar"
                data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/7755391-tooltip">Crown of Westemär</a>. The other six participants must
            each be attuned to a different <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em>. The ritual fails immediately if any participant
            becomes <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip"

            throne, or if the heir does not remain seated on the throne for the duration.</p>
        <p>One after the other, each participant attuned to a <em>Seal</em> must approach the throne, pledge their
            allegiance, and offer their lifelong service to the new monarch. Each then makes a DC 20 ability check using
            an ability score that corresponds to their <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/7755405-lord-commanders-badge"

        </ul>
        <p>The designated heir responds to each ability check by making an appropriate check of their own using the same
            ability score. While all 12 checks must be attempted to finish the ceremony, only 8 successful check results
            are needed to successfully complete it and attune the heir to the crown. Encourage each character
            participating in the ritual to roleplay out their vow, and the response of the monarch to each.</p>
        <p>Since the throne is contaminated, each failed ability check causes the designated heir to immediately take 14
            (4d6) psychic damage. In addition, they must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take an
            additional 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and gain one level of contamination. Failure by 5 or more causes the
            heir to take 35 (10d6) damage and gain 1d4 levels of contamination instead. Remember, a creature can’t
            regain hit points while seated on the throne! If the heir is transformed into a monster or reduced to 0 hit
            points, they immediately transform into another <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong></em> Not every <em>Seal</em> needs to be worn by a player character: the
            characters might choose one or more faction leaders or other key non-player characters to wear the
            <em>Seals</em>. In such cases, these NPCs should offer their hopes for the future, express their gratitude
            to the player characters, and celebrate their accomplishments. You might even allow the players to make dice
            rolls for them.</p>

            careful what you wish for...</h3>
        <p>No matter how carefully worded, it’s well beyond the power of <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
                href="/spells/2303-wish" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2303-tooltip">wish</a> to instantaneously or fully
            cleanse Drakkenheim of all contamination, delerium, and the Haze. A wish can restore the original form of a
            single creature who suffered a monstrous transformation, however.</p>
        <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LostSeals"><a href="#LostSeals"></a>Lost Seals</h3>
        <p>Characters foolish enough to offer a <em>Seal of Drakkenheim</em> to the devils have effectively doomed any
            hope for restoring the throne properly. Perhaps such characters could mount an expedition to Hell to
            retrieve the <em>Seal</em> on an adventure of your own creation!</p>

        Falling Fire convert the Knights of the Silver Order to believe the words of Lucretia Mathias by revealing the
        meteor’s origin. Maybe they present irrefutable evidence to the Amethyst Academy that convinces the mages
        delerium is too dangerous to use responsibly. Working with the Queen of Thieves, characters might weave a
        tangled conspiracy and control the Hooded Lanterns from the shadows. How your players might accomplish such
        dramatic reversals is up to them to attempt and you to adjudicate!</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4746657e-5f83-4436-a0c4-30e0b9591000">Even in defeat, the factions still possess distant
        strongholds, fresh recruits, vast resources, and additional allies outside Drakkenheim. Nevertheless, retreating
        from Drakkenheim sends the faction reeling. Before they can return and exact vengeance, they will need at least
        a year to regroup, appoint new leaders, and determine a new strategy. You might decide to end the campaign in

        a potential claimant in the seat of political power. A rightful ruler seated upon the <em>Throne of

        restoring both Drakkenheim and the Realm of Westemär <em>requires</em> a scion of House von Kessel to sit on the
        <em>Throne of Drakkenheim</em>. However, observant characters may notice that at least four other families have
        ruled Drakkenheim prior to House von Kessel. As such, another noble house could make the claim provided they
        possess the wealth, political influence, and military might needed to secure power. This family then establishes
        a new royal dynasty to rule Westemär.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fa5143a5-8c79-4af2-871e-1c39d59335b2">Such a task would require demonstrating
        <em>some</em> connection to the last dynasty (as per above), the political support of at least three factions,
        as well as holding the power of the royal treasures. Especially intrepid heroes might not like the idea of a
        monarchy at all. If your characters have ambitions to set up a new form of government, embrace it, but don’t

        all knowledge of her magical abilities. She then reveals her true identity so she may legitimately rule
        Drakkenheim. Whether or not Katarina von Kessel is a good ruler is uncertain, but she proves a shrewd

        characters rise to take her place and lead the Followers of the Falling Fire, the nascent religion spreads. New
        converts flow into Drakkenheim to take the sacrament - first hundreds, then thousands, then more. The Falling
        Fire continues to face intense persecution from the mainstream clergy, but the resurrection of Argonath by a
        group of supposed heretics shakes the foundations of the faith in the eyes of the laity. In time, millions come
        seeking a place in the new divine order. When these individuals die, their golden delerium soulstones are
        gathered in the crater. However, Drakkenheim is never truly rebuilt; the ruins come to be seen as a holy place.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="87525e17-abd8-45f0-918b-92ba9f892b74">The Followers of the Falling Fire do nothing to
        prevent new delerium formations, and so the Haze spreads unabated. The faithful stay the course as the world
        slowly descends into chaos over several decades. Sanctified devotees may survive within the Haze, but monsters
        grow great and terrible as the whole earth is swallowed by the mists. Even mighty Argonath eventually falls.
        When the world begins shaking apart, the final Follower of the Falling Fire completes the sacrament before a
        vast assemblage of golden delerium crystals containing millions of righteous souls. In that moment, Lucretia
        Mathias’ prophecies might come to pass, or they might not. Either way, the world undergoes a new apotheosis in a
        brilliant corona of multicoloured light.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d76640bb-d01f-44cc-a7ce-bb8d0e2e9956">The Amethyst Academy wants to harness the arcane
        power of delerium, and believes they can contain the dangers involved. Eldrick Runeweaver has designed a
        monstrously powerful version of the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2215-prismatic-wall"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2215-tooltip">prismatic wall</a> spell, one large enough to form a containment
        dome enclosing the entire city. This is a closely guarded secret, and he will not reveal this plan until every
        piece is in place.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f5109a1d-3a84-4e57-8edc-dc44c9fda959">Such a dramatic display of magical power is a major
        political risk for the Amethyst Academy. They won’t carry out this plan without support from a new monarch of
        Drakkenheim, or at least with sufficient backing from whatever authority remains in Westemär. The archmages
        claim the barrier is the best hope for eventually restoring Drakkenheim: it will allow the Amethyst Academy to
        carefully extract the delerium so they can put it to proper use constructing magic items, which they will
        happily sell to anyone who can afford them. Once all the delerium is quarried, the Amethyst Academy claims they
        will lower the barrier and help rebuild the city.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a90b960-e8c5-48e7-ab8b-b94a4fa4304b">The spell requires tremendous arcane power to set in
        motion and maintain:</p>

        <li data-content-chunk-id="c2e6e964-71a7-4868-907b-997bb9188398">The Inscrutable Tower Nexus acts as the fulcrum
            of the spell. The <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/7755404-inscrutable-staff"
                data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/7755404-tooltip">Inscrutable Staff</a> is needed to reactivate and
            control the Nexus for this purpose.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="254664fd-438f-42ff-ac3f-28dfd4533fd5">Characters must install a suitable local power
            source in the Nexus: a <em>pristine delerium geode</em> taken from the Delerium Heart in the crater.
            Thereafter, a new delerium crystal must be supplied daily to maintain the spell.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="0f6d6b63-c0e8-4e40-80b7-91c49590a482">A special arcane siphon must be installed at
            the Delerium Heart to channel its power to bolster the spell.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="833a1044-567a-4e57-b7b1-095c8558776f">8 arcane spellcasters who can cast spells of
            5th level or higher must participate in the ritual. At least one must be capable of casting 9th level
            spells.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1f60b492-672d-4541-9ef4-162c40a8af44">Naturally of course, the player characters are
        called upon to enact these plans and participate in casting the spell, which might prompt a last-ditch sabotage
        attempt from an enemy faction. Once cast, the spell is indeed powerful enough to halt expansion of the Haze,
        effectively turning Drakkenheim into a greenhouse where the Amethyst Academy may harvest and study delerium at
        their sole discretion. Thereafter, only Academy mages and their designated allies are permitted through the
        barrier. A few scavengers and looters find secret tunnels and hidden means of entry, and occasionally, monsters
        escape via the river or underground passages. The city remains a dangerous place, but one largely quarantined
        within the colossal prismatic barrier. However, rather than strip-mine delerium, the Academy carefully
        cultivates it. The barrier remains indefinitely, because the Academy intentionally allows more delerium to grow
        within to maintain their supply. The Amethyst Academy uses its newfound wealth and influence to clandestinely
        reshape the political destiny of the continent, and possibly even unravel the Edicts of Lumen.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4513d935-68fa-42f4-b65a-fc3f724e42a9">Nevertheless, should the prismatic barrier fall
        through sabotage or negligence, the results would be appropriately catastrophic. The feedback force shatters the
        Inscrutable Tower and causes the Haze to violently explode outward for hundreds of miles around. The volatile
        magic greatly accelerates the expansion of the Haze, and the world is destroyed only a few years later.</p>

        rule the ruins save monsters and mayhem. Perhaps several of the plans above fail, no credible heir survives, and
        the player characters and factions decide that Drakkenheim is best abandoned. A new ruler might decide to
        establish another city as the capital of Westemär. Unless they possess both political savvy and military
        strength, Westemär will likely fragment into several smaller realms as a result. Indeed, this is the most likely
        course unless the player characters intervene, though one that unfolds over decades of intrigue, betrayal, and
        war.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e07e118d-74c6-4d73-99c2-89f52bf7c11b">By that time, the situation in Drakkenheim may
        become even more dire as the Haze grows larger and larger. In about a decade, containment will become almost
        impossible when more dimensional rifts and greater horrors begin to awaken within the crater. A few may
        callously conclude that the destruction is still centuries away, and so the Haze is a problem for future
        generations to inherit. Other powerful and wealthy recluses might selfishly plot to save themselves by fleeing
        to other worlds. Perhaps, a new generation of hopeful heroes may come together and try to save the world before
        it is too late.</p>

        mockeries of their former selves. They suffer a wretched and loathsome fate, aimlessly wandering the ruins
        following half-forgotten memories. Most are gripped by despair, fear, and madness which drive them to act
        violently, though a rare few experience lucidity and a gruesome awareness of their miserable state. Their
        distorted and emaciated bodies are sustained by the magic of the Haze.</p>

            mass of furry bodies bound up in mud-spattered cloth and greasy leather surge forward. Their rodent-like
            claws brandish rust-caked blades as many squeaking voices erupt into a cacophony of chittering chirping,

        malevolent cunning and driven by a mad compulsion to consume and multiply. These wretched monsters suffer from a
        constant internal struggle between cowardly survival instincts and violent impulsive urges. Ratlings dream of
        eating everything, and will eat anything, but love eating people. They especially love eating babies. While they
        will subsist on carrion, ratlings take captives back to their lairs so they can have fresh food later</p>

        warring colonies that dig maze-like burrows featuring multiple entrances and tight looping passages. Successful
        colonies grow in number quickly, as ratlings mature in a matter of weeks when ample food and delerium are
        available</p>

        Drakkenheim, often in areas where the eldritch magics are especially concentrated. Many who have encountered
        these elementals have spoken of the city itself coming to life to attack them. Reports of ruins reaching out and
        crushing adventurers, burning flames moving and hunting with minds of their own, or contaminated pools lurching
        to engulf passersby have been heard. Even the blowing air itself has mustered parts of the Haze into shifting
        clouds that stalk adventurers through the streets. These magical creatures are a constant reminder that nothing
        in the city can be trusted, and that nowhere is truly safe.</p>

        appendages. Amongst its horrid and grotesque form one can make out the many faces of long lost gravekeepers of
        Castle Drakken, but their expressions are twisted in horror of their last moments, and their eyes are hollow
        with a dim octarine light emanating from within. Covering the floating mass are hundreds of arms, several of
        them holding softly glowing lanterns. The lanterns glow with octarine flames that cast flickering shadows across
        the crypt. The Gravekeeper wanders amongst the dead, awakening them into grasping souls, clawing their way out
        of the many graves amongst the lordly tombs of the castle.</p>

        meteor. It appears in geode clusters of translucent, sharp-edged crystals which reflect octarine light. The
        eldritch stones softly hum in dissonant tones, and glow brightly at night or when exposed to magic. Deposits are
        found throughout Drakkenheim, often fused into stone streets and buildings like crystalline moss.</p>

        crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a1182e3-7d54-47b9-9596-43b8d82df1a1">Many different people lived in Drakkenheim. The
        neighbouring countryside and the realms beyond are no less diverse, though humans make up the majority of the
        population in the current age. In ancient days, the industrious dwarven folk built great underground empires,
        the alien elves raised mystical towers, while the orcish people constructed monuments and menhirs to honor their
        old gods. Today, their descendants and those of many other ancestries inhabit the continent, though few would
        associate their varied biological distinctions with any single nation, culture, or religion.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Dwarves" data-content-chunk-id="b06634e2-deff-4cfe-83a5-a97c5569e8c0">
        <a href="#Dwarves" data-content-chunk-id="3ca52952-27fa-4255-b0ca-a5f9598c172b"></a>Dwarves</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fa0b464b-f5e0-4149-b6b3-6e55fb886268">Many dwarves tell tales of ancient underground
        kingdoms that hoarded vast mines of gold and gems and fought great wars miles below the surface. The foundations
        upon which Drakkenheim were built date back to these times, and traces of dwarven architecture and engineering
        can still be found in the fortifications, aqueducts, and deep vaults of the city. However, the days of the
        dwarven realms have long passed, and the dwarven people have no great holds of their own any more. Still, many
        dwarves dwell in the mountains and keep the traditions of their ancestors: mining, smithing, and engineering.
        Many more are much less tied to these traditions now, so it is not unusual to see a small number of dwarves in
        just about any community.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Elves" data-content-chunk-id="b2fd3b85-7940-420b-9323-17e3e6eff6fb"><a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="07abe5a3-78ae-4e98-a6a9-6f2584d9ee25">No one knows when elves came to these lands, or
        exactly how they got here. Even the most ancient among them tell little more than vague myths about their
        origins. These stories claim that millennia ago, the elves came into this world through fairy realms and shadow
        gates from a distant and long-lost land. Why the elves left, none can say. Today, the elves live in diaspora.
        Only a handful of elven families dwell in even the most populous regions. Although rare, they are no longer
        regarded as strangers to these lands. In fact, half-elves are now much more common than those of pure elven
        descent. Though elves remember little of their history, they still possess great knowledge of magic. The few
        elven ruins found across the continent contain mysterious portals and arcane lore. The reason they were
        abandoned remains unknown.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Halflings"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7953aeaf-aade-4e7d-b9e7-a937a2beb27e">These smallfolk often form their own communities
        within settled lands, just as often as they live alongside the other people of the continent. Many live a rural
        life, tending farms, orchards, and fishing villages. Dozens of halfling villages surrounded Drakkenheim, the
        bounty of their fields feeding the city. Though these communities were not outright destroyed when the meteor
        struck, they have not escaped its devastation. The eldritch contamination spreading from the ruins and the
        threat of monstrous raiders have forced many smallfolk to abandon their homes. Their once-quaint underhill
        abodes and welcoming hamlets are now eerie ghost-towns.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Humans" data-content-chunk-id="fb7ff884-1f3d-45e6-a175-8465478c392d"><a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e6cb45b0-6b31-47c8-8743-90f350f23b2b">Most of the population of the continent are humans,
        who range in all shapes, sizes, colours, skills, and beliefs. Humans tell countless tales of their origins, and
        tend to regard wherever they were born as home. They formed many of the great noble and royal houses of the
        continent, and the endless conflicts between these families have defined the political landscape of the realms.
        One such family, House von Kessel, ruled Drakkenheim until the meteor and years of civil war ended their regal
        line.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e4f828b7-a52b-4e76-8ab1-eebccf9dcde0">Humans have long mingled with other peoples,
        resulting in half-elves, half-orcs, and half-dragons. Though such people often bear distinct physical traits,
        such individuals are recognized for their shared human origin. Indeed, humanity has often intentionally sought
        to enhance their lineages. During antiquity, many powerful sorcerous dynasties infused their bloodlines with the
        essence of infernal and celestial entities, bequeathing their progeny with an enduring magical legacy. Though
        these old empires have long since fallen, their descendants have since spread throughout the world.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1fbcffec-16aa-40af-9bd9-e757e042c92a">Though their populations are sparse, many other
        peoples inhabit the world of Drakkenheim, including catfolk, dragonborn, gnomes, goblins, orcs, and tieflings.
        No matter their origin, there is no reason any type of character would be out of place arriving in Drakkenheim.
        Players should work with the Game Master to invent how their ancestry choice could have a place in Drakkenheim.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="14685965-8870-4bcb-b104-63c93ad8b88a">The Realm of Westemär stretches north from the
        Drakeclaw and Glimmer Mountains, along the Crystal Coast to northern tundras. The heartland is made up of deep
        dark forests surrounding wide flowing rivers, interspersed with areas of fertile marshland. The land is
        prosperous and rich in natural resources: iron, salt, and coal mines, fine timber, and excellent quarries. These
        industries supported the realm’s once-great military strength and built the impressive architecture of its
        cities. As such, the nobility are distinguished, but materialistic and prideful, in contrast to the hard-working
        and pragmatic common folk.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3a4c5a2b-3825-4172-b4a8-1cd9afc50b09">Drakkenheim was the capital of Westemär and home to
        the ruling family, <strong>House von Kessel</strong>. After the meteor fell, the two surviving scions of House
        von Kessel clashed over succession in a brutal civil war that tore the nation apart. After many assassinations,
        accidents, and disastrous battles, the civil war ended with no clear victor. Most believe House von Kessel is
        now extinct, and the throne remains abandoned and empty in the ruins of Castle Drakken. The lands surrounding
        Drakkenheim are now contaminated, and most villages nearby are deserted.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fc2f46e3-6b09-4d89-91bb-31b916dd8c7b">Lacking a sovereign ruler, the nobility manages
        their own domains directly. They remain deeply divided based on which branch of House von Kessel they supported
        during the civil war. Many grievances remain, and occasional skirmishes occur between the squabbling barons,
        counts, and dukes. However, after nearly a decade of fighting, their coffers are empty and their blood is spent.
        Few possess the will or resources to continue these feuds for the time being. Many noble families possess some
        relation to the royal line, yet none have the political clout or military strength to press a claim upon the
        throne and reunify the nation.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Elyria" data-content-chunk-id="9bb5f829-73ed-40bf-88ad-ca97a5c0ed6e"><a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="8a553cba-ec27-4474-a45e-2f63e45690ef">The realm of Elyria lies on a large peninsula south
        of the Drakeclaw Mountains. The land comprises vast rolling prairies and river basins broken up by rocky arid
        hills and a mountainous coast. Nestled within are pockets of imposing pinewood forests, and great deposits of
        precious minerals such as gold and silver. Elyrians are known for being kind-hearted and outgoing folk eager to
        share the bounty of their land. Most live a rural life in small villages along the rivers and coasts. Indeed,
        the fertile river valleys at the heart of Elyria were an early cradle of civilization, and the countryside is
        dotted with the ruins of ancient cities.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="235f033a-fb1f-4b6a-946b-226d07312a43">The Holy City of Lumen is the capital of Elyria. The
        Faith of the Sacred Flame was founded here, and the shining city is the seat of power for the <strong>Divine
            Matriarch</strong>. The most fervent and orthodox adherents to the faith are found amongst the Elyrian
        people. Beyond Lumen, there are few large cities save several bustling port towns that are hubs for
        international trade. The Elyrian navy is amongst the finest in the continent.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ARisingTheocracy"

            data-content-chunk-id="4bfc7be3-b969-4554-8e14-dc3c87e0266d"></a>A Rising Theocracy</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ed0217e3-d535-493d-bc53-54187b86e7fd">Originally, Elyria was a monarchy, but today, the
        nation is effectively a theocracy ruled by the Divine Matriarch. As leader of the Faith of the Sacred Flame, the
        Divine Matriarch has traditionally been regarded as a pillar of wisdom, truth, and justice, so they often
        mediate difficult political matters. When the Elyrian royal line went extinct, a parliament drawn from the
        Elyrian nobility determined that the Divine Matriarch would appoint a Lord Regent to lead them. Together, the
        noble parliament and the Lord Regent would serve as a ruling body for the nation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f138d1b6-8156-4c64-afdc-43fed6b5d510">However, in recent decades, successive Divine
        Matriarchs have used this power to select a line of caretaker regents who defer to the Faith on virtually all
        matters of state. While members of the clergy take vows of poverty that preclude them from holding actual
        political station, the parliament is now mostly made up of fundementalist nobles staunchly loyal to the
        religion, and the Lord Regent is almost always a close relative of a prominent High Flamekeeper or the Divine
        Matriarch. As a result, the Divine Matriarch wields <em>de facto</em> political authority in Elyria.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="68d5c8ae-fe4a-4f08-9735-b13823563ea3">The realm of Caspia stretches in an expanse between
        the Glimmer Mountains and the Diamond Sea. It is a rugged and mediterranean nation, home to a boisterous and
        affable people led by a constantly squabbling nobility.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2c7bb9ce-e9a9-4cf2-8c60-c986fdc64e81">Caspians elect their High King once each decade,
        from candidates put forth by the princes of their noble houses. The valorous deeds and reputation of the noble
        houses is a major factor in determining the High King. Though Caspian politics are always shifting, especially
        as the next Kingsmoot draws near, it has stood as a remarkably stable nation. As such, Caspians love to meddle
        in the politics of Elyria and Westemär. They often intermarry with the nobles of different realms to gain
        greater clout and influence for the next Kingsmoot.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f5fe66c7-bee9-4e29-9faf-166c58930a50">The realms have been shaped by centuries of war,
        from Elyrian rebellions against ancient sorcerer-kings, to great battles between rival Caspian princes, and most
        recently, the civil war that ravaged Westemär.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="42457a71-9b2e-4c7a-83e6-2c3e8ad94c60">By law and custom, none with arcane spellcasting
        powers may hold a noble title within the realms. Instead, the noble houses prize the martial arts. Many fighting
        traditions have developed: armoured phalanxes, archery, fencing, berserking, and diverse unarmed combat
        techniques. Duels and trial by combat are a particularly favoured means to settle disputes amongst the nobility
        with minimal bloodshed. The realms of Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär have each developed their own distinctive
        styles and practices for such contests.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="510361ae-bba3-452e-9f02-4442a06aecdc">Commerce, rather than conflict, defines everyday
        life for common folk in the realms. Merchant caravels and ships frequently carry cargo across the Diamond Sea
        from the Caspian port of Jackson’s Keep or the independent city-state of Liberio. Other vessels depart from the
        ports of Drannsmund in Westemär and Angel’s Landing in Elyria, and sail the Middle Ocean to the far west. Trade
        caravans from Geldstadt travel across the Twin Vales to distant lands beyond the steppes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a1760da1-e355-4699-8afb-3d3e146196bf">Magical goods and services are bought and sold
        throughout the continent, but only amongst the wealthy and powerful. High-ranking nobles outfit their favoured
        knights with magical arms and armour, and rich merchants buy spells and wondrous items to safeguard their
        valuable mundane wares. The manufacture and sale of arcane commodities is controlled by the Mage Guild, a branch
        of the <strong>Amethyst Academy</strong>. Under strict edicts recognized across the realms, any mage or trader
        dealing in magic pays an annual fee to the Mage Guild, and must follow the prices set by the guild.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="74cad328-b4bb-4302-8b99-ee58112ab937">A few are bold enough to skirt these requirements.
        As a result, smugglers, hired muscle, and rogues can make their fortune in the illicit trade of enchanted gear
        and forbidden magic items. This underground black market has only expanded since delerium has become such a
        valuable and sought-after export.</p>

        customs, these have little authority outside cities and settled farmlands. Not far off the major trade roads and
        rivers, the wilderness remains a place ruled by the laws of nature, not the laws of mortals. The dark forest of
        Achtungwald, the wet bogs of the Elfmire, the massive mountains that separate the realms, the northern tundras,
        and the arid hills of Elyria are dangerous lands, where dragons, trolls, giants, and monsters keep their lairs.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ba7b5ef6-95c9-4c38-932a-0a4534a29230">However, these wild places are also home to many
        people who do not reside under the control of the realms. Living in small tribes, they keep their old ways and
        old faiths, led by stout-hearted warriors and druids who embrace the fury of the elements.</p>

        make the voyage, few folk in the realms know anything of those antique lands.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="718e8e35-4c16-4355-8f7b-cfadeb20ecf5">East of Westemär are the Twin Vales, nestled between

        the Crystal Coast, to the north, is the island of Skye, further beyond is the North Pole. South of Caspia is the
        Diamond Sea; across are realms that often trade with Caspia and Elyria.</p>

        spellcasters are rare. Only about one in every thousand people can cast spells, and roughly two-thirds of these
        only ever master cantrips and first-level spells in their entire lifetimes. The few who can work greater magic
        often wield tremendous personal, social, and political power. Though rare, magic is common currency for
        nobility, clergy, wealthy merchants, and adventurers.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bfa4c419-f479-4fee-83f9-801eef4d92ff">Only a handful of living mortals can cast
        ninth-level spells. Most are secretive recluses or legendary figures. Harnessing more magical might than most
        mortals can even comprehend, they often turn their attention away from earthly affairs to contemplate the cosmic
        order, fighting unseen battles against supernatural foes whose very nature threatens to tear the world asunder.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cc7088d2-5fd4-472c-ac10-4df4b6a4e84e">The common folk regard spellcasters with
        superstition and awe. There was a time when arcane magic users faced extreme persecution, and echoes of those
        prejudices remain. Few even understand the difference between sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards—they are
        collectively referred to as ‘mages’. However, commoners can recognize spellcasters who are clerics of the Sacred
        Flame or mages of the Amethyst Academy by their symbols and attire. Spellcasters who are not (or do not claim to
        be) members of these recognized organizations are often mistrusted and feared by commoners.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3b2ac74a-7368-4ff1-9322-0c939ebc84ae">The arcane magic of sorcerers and wizards draws upon
        otherworldly energies. The ability to tap into these forces is reliant on a recessive genetic trait in mortals -
        such individuals are called mageborn. Signs that a person is mageborn typically emerge in late childhood or
        early puberty, usually as random displays of wild magic. In some rare cases it does not develop until adulthood.
        Mortals who lack the mageborn gene cannot become sorcerers or wizards under any circumstances.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="70451f71-2b49-472a-97d0-fe780ba40d2b">By law, the Amethyst Academy takes guardianship over
        any child born in the realms who manifests magical ability, whether they are a royal heir or commoner. A child
        who bristles against Academy training—or who was not taken in by them—most often becomes a sorcerer.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2c6b051b-478c-4818-882f-e83a3cce872a">Bards and warlocks also work arcane magic, but do
        not necessarily depend on mageborn lineage to do so. Instead, warlocks gain arcane power through pacts with
        eldritch entities, and bards find supernatural inspiration to harness the Words of Creation. Regardless, many
        keep their powers secret.</p>

        powers are not granted by gods. Instead, clerics, druids, and paladins learn to cast spells by channeling the
        supernatural forces of light and shadow that underscore the cosmos. In theory, such powers are attainable by
        anyone, but in practice only exceptionally gifted individuals master even the lowest-level divine spells. As
        such, divine spellcasting is viewed as a disciplined and sacred technique attainable only by those with
        sufficient will and devotion, and only after years of meditation and training. Its practitioners are not
        considered mageborn.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f314fb35-13aa-469c-8025-13d6c850eec6">Violating one’s religious tenets will not cause a

        discordant change in behaviour and morality could cause an individual to lose their divine spellcasting powers.
        More often, a cleric, druid, or paladin who commits some grave trespass risks retribution from other members of
        their religion.</p>

        most of her life she was a ruthless warlord, light flickered in her dark heart. Guided by angels, she learned to

        honor, and righteousness. The religion brings a message of dutiful hope: even the smallest flame may light the

        worship rites. The holy text of the faith is called the <em>Song of Fire</em>. Saint Tarna is typically depicted

        vestments of white, yellow, and gold. Flamekeepers take vows of poverty, eschewing all personal possessions and
        living on the commonwealth of the faith. Chapels and cathedrals of the Sacred Flame are ministered by a
        Flamekeeper, who is assisted by a few devoted acolytes. Smaller villages rely on lay ministers to keep their
        shrines. The highest authority amongst the priesthood of the Sacred Fire is the <strong>Divine

        Inspired by Saint Tarna’s example, many join knightly orders ordained for righteous purposes. Such companies of

        of primal deities who have whispered to mortals through nature for untold generations, such as primal Nodens,
        vengeful Kromac, honorable Nuada, and nurturing Danu, but there are countless more. Their beliefs and practices
        vary widely based on the tenets of the specific patron god, but their myths often surround the elements, the
        seasons, the land, and ancestor worship. Many such beliefs originated with the ancient orcish and dwarven
        peoples of the continent. Others are closely connected to mysterious entities who inhabit extraplanar worlds
        such as Dreamland, the Elemental Chaos, or the Feywild, and are often kept by the elves. Druids are particularly

    <p data-content-chunk-id="50507602-2296-4e3e-9d7d-d93c487ced3a">Throughout the ages, various ‘shadow faiths’ and
        heretical sects have emerged surrounding the Sacred Flame, some of which embrace an opposing force called the
        Exalted Darkness. These cults develop their own mysteries and esoteric practices, or devote themselves to
        worshipping enigmatic god-like beings such as Morrigan the Phantom Queen, the Night Serpent, the Lord of the
        Undead, and powerful entities who inhabit the Shadowlands or the Abyss.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="311ef828-5e6a-4ed8-aaa3-2827465f2230">Some of these chthonic entities seek to devour the
        light and plunge the world into darkness unending. However, not all of these faiths are evil, with practitioners
        who view shadow and light as part of a necessary balance. Regardless, followers of the Sacred Flame condemn
        these beliefs, banishing their rites and practices. In the same manner that deep faith and contemplation leads
        followers of the Sacred Flame to become clerics and paladins, one may also channel the Shadow itself. Clerics
        are heralds of twilight, trickery, magic, and death, and paladins often invoke dark oaths to vengeful causes or
        ambitious conquest. Followers of the Shadow Faith may even become warlocks, embracing dark and fiendish patrons.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ad89d7c7-adb4-4330-93a1-dc604602e9ff">During antiquity, mighty sorcerer-kings ruled a
        continent-spanning empire using their immense arcane power. The sorcerer-kings became tyrants who scarred the
        land with magical wars and held those without arcane magical power in bondage. The iron rule of the
        sorcerer-kings was ended by the clerics and paladins of the Faith of the Sacred Flame a thousand years ago.
        However, those born with arcane magical ability have faced discrimination ever since, and at times, the
        religious ministry has endorsed vicious persecution against mages. Even today, many common folk consider a
        mageborn child a terrible curse.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="80a70663-2cf5-4db1-9ca9-6856d163e587">Outright conflict ended with the Edicts of Lumen, a
        magical treaty between the Amethyst Academy, the continental nobility, and the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Signed
        three centuries ago, this agreement separates the political and economic powers of clergy, mages, and nobles.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3dd2b4fe-46d4-45b5-8d5c-751e7264b561">The Edicts of Lumen comprise six main articles:</p>

        <li data-content-chunk-id="a6c77d69-bf98-4424-bf74-98e36803cd8b">The <strong>Articles of Neutrality</strong>
            require the Amethyst Academy remain neutral and impartial with regards to the social, economic, and
            political affairs of the continent, but also grant protection under the law to all mages.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="b48d5bff-0be6-4c9f-9e4d-e98b6db91715">The <strong>Articles of Guardianship</strong>
            grant the Amethyst Academy the authority to take any child born with magical capabilities as wards to train
            in magic until they come of age, including mageborn of noble houses and royalty.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="4653c81b-2255-497f-926e-3d0ff042453e">The <strong>Articles of Enterprise</strong>

            differently.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="088b1151-01f2-4c6f-bbef-0b2b0550d7b5">The <strong>Articles of Malediction</strong>
            disallow the Academy from teaching magical practices such as summoning demons and creating undead, and
            forbid mages from using magic to directly influence or control members of the nobility or clergy.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="fcf90823-310c-4207-b68a-756be45efa3c">The <strong>Articles of Umbrage</strong> detail

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ad04ea6b-35b4-421a-b709-0deb07fb0563">Sages of the Amethyst Academy have put forth
        differing theories to explain the order of the cosmos throughout history. These included bizarre concepts such
        as the “great wheel”, the “world axis”, the “conjunction of the spheres”, “planetary orbits”, and “general
        relativity”. There is no consensus; every theorist is quick to point out the glaring flaws and logical
        inconsistencies in competing hypotheses.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1f7d4641-f3b9-46f1-868b-4429667ebd6d">Most mortal knowledge of the planes comes from

        subject of many religious myths. The energies from this place may be invoked to create undead.</p>

        amongst themselves. Few mortals understand the distinction between such fiendish creatures.</p>

        Drakkenheim in hopes of uncovering things once lost. Whatever their call to the city may be, there is a chance
        that their history is ripe with danger. Some have colourful pasts that have readied them for the dangers ahead,
        some have crimes and mistakes they seek to hide from in the ruins, and others are bound to those who fight for
        what’s left of the crumbling empire.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f9d6be50-9174-48be-9520-da02d3dc29a0">Rather than seeking your fortune from finding
        treasure, you seek yours by hunting down the brigands, outlaws, and monsters that now hide in Drakkenheim. You
        often take up dangerous bounties and follow wanted posters as long as the price is right. Danger is second
        nature to you and the horrors of the city are nothing compared to the thrill of the hunt, and the coin it can
        gain you.</p>

        together, the authors would like to express our deep gratitude for our viewers, subscribers, Patreon supporters,
        and Kickstarter backers. We would not be where we are today if it weren’t for the encouragement and support you
        have shown for both us and <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em>. Whether you joined us all the way back in 2018 when
        we streamed our first episode or are discovering Drakkenheim for the first time with this book - however you
        found us, we’re so glad that you did and that we’ve been able to share this world with you. We truly thank you
        from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0ce9a9f2-1554-4a23-81f8-e3594564bdea">Furthermore, a huge thank you to Jill Danaitis &amp;
        Joe O’Gorman - our very own Veo Sjena and Pluto Jackson! These two helped shape the world of Drakkenheim and the
        many many adventures within the ruins. <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> truly wouldn’t be what it is without
        them. We’d also like to thank Kyle Drier: the unseen hand of Drakkenheim! Kyle has been instrumental in helping
        produce and edit our livestreams and podcasts. We are so grateful to have such positive, kind, giving and
        wonderful friends to collaborate with and see where the road to Drakkenheim leads.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f68915d3-bc8e-41a0-98b0-efc8623aa28e">Finally, we also want to thank our incredibly
        patient and loving partners - Kierston Drier and Shay Bytheway - who have put up with us through long hours
        spent writing and producing this project. They have been with us first hand through the thick and thin of our
        entire careers on YouTube, and we are so grateful for their love and support over the years.</p>
