    <aside class="text--tcsr-preface">
        <p>Inspiration can come from anywhere: a musician’s song, the advice of a close friend, or just the trust that
            another being places in you. In my experience, few things can compare to the surge of joy and motivation
            that being inspired gives.</p>
        <p>I have often found inspiration in fantasy worlds and books of adventure, mystery, and magic. I grew up
            devouring every novel I was handed, seeking to lose myself in the words of another mind, channeling the
            images they evoked in my mind into my sketchbook. But it wasn’t until I discovered tabletop roleplaying
            games that I felt truly empowered to create my own worlds, places like the ones that I so often found myself
            lost in. Even better, it let me share all the ideas in my head with my friends, and they could do the same
            with me. I was spellbound.</p>
        <p>It’s been about twenty-five years since my first game. Since then, I’ve drawn endless inspiration from the
            imaginations of my friends and loved ones as we tell heroic stories around a table with dice and paper. I’ve
            found a circle of friends who share my love of dramatic storytelling, my belief that failure in games is
            just as exciting as success (maybe even more so), and my delight in being inspired by moments of
            improvisational brilliance. It’s still surreal that we found a way to share that with the world;
            <em><strong>Critical Role</strong></em> has become a phenomenon that’s surpassed my wildest dreams. Over the
            past few years, we’ve built the magical world of Exandria together, warts and all, and somehow it’s become a
            world that millions of others have engaged with and invested their imaginations in. I hope it’s inspired you
            to create your own adventures, stories, and joyful memories. Through Vox Machina’s epic tale, the land of
            Tal’Dorei became a landscape rife with intrigue, conflict, and endless possibility…and we wanted to share it
            with you.</p>
        <p>Years ago, I had an opportunity to bring Tal’Dorei to the page and invite the world to tell their own stories
            in Exandria. The thrill of the opportunity was incredible, but the immense pressure and fear of failure
            (given my absolute lack of experience doing something like this) made it a strenuous journey on an
            incredibly short timeline. I was incredibly blessed to have become friends with the immeasurably brilliant
            James Haeck around that time, and I asked him to join me in this task. My good fortune found him agreeing,
            and with his help and inspiration, it somehow came together. With that, a limited run of the
            <em><strong>Tal’Dorei Campaign Setting</strong></em> went into the world.</p>
        <p>Time has passed, both in our world and within the world of Exandria. Vox Machina’s greatest adventures came
            to a close. Looking two decades later (within Exandria), we embarked on a new adventure with the Mighty Nein
            in the land of Wildemount…but Vox Machina and Tal’Dorei remained deeply dear to my heart. The question
            arose: what would Tal’Dorei look like these two decades later? What changes would have taken place in the
            recovery following the Chroma Conclave and the ascension of the Whispered One? How would the legendary
            heroes of Vox Machina have adjusted to life after the end of their story? What dangers and threats, both old
            and new, would the next generation of heroes need to rise up against?</p>
        <p>Inspiration struck once more, and now that <em><strong>Critical Role</strong></em> had the means to do so…we
            needed to answer these questions for both ourselves and the numerous Critters who often conjectured as we
            did. “Who is on the Tal’Dorei Council?” Well, we can finally answer that! I immediately called James Haeck
            back to the fray, and we were joined this time by the extraordinary mind and talents of Hannah Rose to
            elevate these ideas into something better than I could have hoped. Between us, Tal’Dorei was Reborn. We
            invite you to get lost in this world, learn of its intricacies and secrets, and, I hope, be inspired to make
            this world yours as well.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="70751af7-38c6-4f18-b63f-ced6ab60df99">Tal’Dorei is a land of epic adventure, filled with
        heroes who do great deeds for love, for justice, and—maybe more often than not—for gold and their own egos.
        Villains are draped in shadow and draw upon the power of cruel gods—but they are just as motivated by love,
        their own twisted concepts of justice, and their hunger for gold, power, and glory.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dd72afa7-383f-45fd-9a42-2a9602cb147f">Tal’Dorei is a land created by Matthew Mercer to
        introduce his friends to fantasy roleplaying games, and he filled it with the greatest high fantasy tropes and
        played them to the hilt—and then twisted them, defying his own clichés when it would hit the hardest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3fa5121a-13e4-445c-9f7e-423f2f03103e">This book is for Game Masters who wish to run
        fantasy roleplaying game campaigns set on the continent of <em>Critical Role</em>’s first campaign, and for the
        players who will create characters for those games. The game mechanics in this book use “fifth edition rules,”
        but it also includes enough lore about the world to form the foundation for a game using the rules of any
        fantasy RPG.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="9e2778ad-61dc-487a-a9dc-aaac33aa3cb1">The name Tal’Dorei refers to three things throughout
        this book. Most often, Tal’Dorei means the continent that is home to all of the people, locations, monsters,
        magic items, and more within these pages. It is one of four major continents on the world of Exandria. Tal’Dorei
        can also mean the Republic of Tal’Dorei, the largest nation on the continent. And finally, Tal’Dorei was first
        the surname of a mighty hero who lent her name to the land that she helped liberate from evil.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e3434989-d53a-4e74-b319-9db3155718c8">See “<a href="#AHistoryofTalDorei"
            data-content-chunk-id="06786184-220d-4528-ba12-0fcd6d4a3903">A History of Tal’Dorei</a>” later in this
        chapter for more details about the heroic Zan Tal’Dorei, the land she founded, and her descendants.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="629c588b-ffd2-4618-a168-34e5375880fa">The continent of Tal’Dorei encompasses several
        nations and independent city-states, all of which are home to diverse peoples who view the world in ways
        influenced by their cultures and the lands they call home. The most significant nations of Tal’Dorei include:
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cf4f615c-851d-46a6-9dc9-ba1d77c7a2b5"><strong><em>The Republic of Tal’Dorei.</em></strong>
        From the great city of Emon in the west, across the vast Dividing Plains, and even as far as the isolated
        city-state of Whitestone in the northeast, the Republic of Tal’Dorei spans the breadth of the continent that
        bears its name. It is ruled by a council of elected representatives and is cordially allied with all other
        nations on the continent.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6eeef58f-b443-45fd-8f94-f8dd498dcb91"><strong><em>The Ashari.</em></strong> The
        elementally attuned Ashari people are reclusive and dedicated to their mission of safeguarding elemental rifts
        across the world. Two of the greatest rifts exist in Tal’Dorei, and the Earth Ashari of Terrah and the Air
        Ashari of Zephrah keep watch over them from their secluded homes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e12fc819-9c47-48de-a312-2db8c41170ff"><strong><em>The Deep Halls of
                Kraghammer.</em></strong> Deep beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains is Kraghammer, the ancestral home of
        Tal’Dorei’s dwarven people. Though Kraghammer is home to people other than dwarves, its dark and claustrophobic
        halls act as a deterrent to non-dwarven residents—as does the dwarf clans’ famous inhospitality.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2bce8805-a8e6-44c4-b780-9e4888a95cc5"><strong><em>The Verdant Enclave of
                Syngorn.</em></strong> In the heart of the trackless Verdant Expanse is a city of elves who hid in the
        Fey Realm from a war that nearly annihilated all life on Exandria. Syngorn is welcoming to all who brave the
        Verdant Expanse to reach them, though there is an expectation that those who visit take pains not to flaunt the
        strict and ancient rules of Syngornian society, lest their stay come to a swift and unceremonious end.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7e4e2944-6d26-415f-8e8b-e75053b3ef1e"><strong><em>The Iron Authority.</em></strong> This
        imperial force rules the Beynsfal Plateau in the southernmost reaches of the continent. There they train legions
        of soldiers in an endless campaign to conquer the entire Rifenmist Peninsula. The other powers of Tal’Dorei are
        just beginning to take notice of the movements of the Iron Authority, but most of their knowledge is based in
        rumor. The Tal’Dorei Council has little interest in drawing the authority’s ire while it is preoccupied with its
        conquest of Rifenmist.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b9a3f3db-97b7-475a-84c2-809597c21490">Chapter 1 is an introduction to Tal’Dorei’s lands
        and history. It also describes certain fundamental details about the world of Exandria as a whole, including its
        calendar, the planes, and the cosmos. Finally, this chapter provides an overview of Tal’Dorei’s society
        today—and the brewing tensions and secrets that Game Masters can use to plot their own campaigns.</p>

        characters and non-player characters (NPCs) may have to deepen their connection to the world. Their allegiances
        may be to factions, such as governments or guilds, or to the gods. These divine beings can only affect the
        Material Plane through their mortal followers, or occasionally supernatural messengers like celestials or
        fiends.</p>

        them, and the quests that heroic adventurers might undertake there.</p>

        backgrounds, and feats; and a handful of optional rules for the whole table.</p>

        Masters create exciting and compelling campaigns in Tal’Dorei, and magic items that you can give your players as
        treasure during their perilous adventures—including the unstoppably powerful Vestiges of Divergence.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="bdcb8ba7-298d-4e41-81f4-613e1ed193f1">The world of Exandria is a planet with regular
        seasons and a wide variety of climes, ranging from frigid ice caps to arid deserts, temperate forests, windswept
        plains, sweltering jungles, and storm-tossed oceans. It orbits a single sun, is orbited in turn by two moons,
        and is surrounded by distant stars that twinkle in the evening skies.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0b136012-0b88-4c0d-95b1-0b7d8e2078ee">The ancient people of Exandria told time by these

    <p data-content-chunk-id="07fef5a4-9574-40da-92cb-5d746b1c77f4">In Exandria, the years are most commonly counted by
        a reckoning known as “Post Divergence,” with year 0 being the fateful year that the Prime Deities ended the
        Calamity by sealing all the gods behind the Divine Gate. This book describes the world as it is in the year 836
        P.D. If you’re familiar with the <em>Critical Role</em> campaigns, this year is twenty-four years after the end
        of Campaign 1 (Vox Machina) and toward the end of Campaign 2 (The Mighty Nein).</p>

        between cultures, but the elven calendar described here is the standard means of reckoning dates in Tal’Dorei—as
        well as in most nations around the world, for ease of international trade and diplomacy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e8adb267-903f-439b-98e3-d40a304792d1">Just as in our world, there are four seasons, and
        the year ends and begins just after the winter solstice.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6b92cf00-e3c4-4682-8f59-b892039bcfdf">The first blush of spring in Tal’Dorei is felt as
        new flowers bloom on Wild’s Grandeur, a holy day on the 20th of Dualahei. The official start of the season,
        however, is observed a week earlier and celebrated with games, music, and just-ripened food at the Renewal
        Festival. Summer brings hotter days toward the middle of Unndilar. The noonday sun of the 26th day is called the
        Zenith, and this solstice is considered the first true moment of the summer.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="68627dcc-6bcd-461f-bb64-cd9354047425">The colors change and winds cool as autumn begins in
        the early days of the month of Fessuran, marked by the Harvest’s Close on the 3rd day. The chill of winter
        arrives to bring longer nights and cleansing snow on Barren Eve, the 2nd of Duscar, a nighttime celebration and
        remembrance of those who fell in battle.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e0e5f22b-83bd-48e7-a43f-5fdcff7d2a5d">The seven days of the week are named Miresen,
        Grissen, Whelsen, Conthsen, Folsen, Yulisen, and Da’leysen. Each day is 24 hours long, and most city-dwellers in
        the Republic of Tal’Dorei are expected to work eight hours of that day—except for Yulisen and Da’leysen, which
        comprise the weekend, and on holidays.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8883800e-aede-4ee9-ba8b-15d36cf62143">These social rules don’t necessarily apply to
        cultures where sleeping patterns are different (such as in Syngorn, where most of its people are elves who
        trance a mere four hours of the day), or to people outside of cities—such as farmers, who rise with the sun, and
        traveling merchants and adventurers, who work highly unusual hours.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1e0f8083-066d-4e30-9046-8f4c8c856417">The Exandrian calendar is intentionally quite
        different from our own. The creation of calendars is a messy and often illogical process, with strange artifacts
        of their making that linger on only because of tradition—and because it would be too much of a hassle to get the
        entire world to change their way of counting time and days.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7186b310-036e-483f-990b-d27825efa25f">You don’t need to bother with the Exandrian calendar
        in your home game. It’s perfectly reasonable for you to use a nice, simple seven-day week, thirty-day month, and
        twelve-month year. You may even use our names for the months and the days of the week so that when an NPC tells
        the party to meet them at noon on “Grissen, Misuthar 7th,” they’re basically talking about “Tuesday, February
        7th.”</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a1c46e8-eca3-4e31-a08c-71e37ba64707">However, if you want to immerse your players in the
        fantasy world of Exandria, using this unfamiliar calendar may help you on your quest.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4ffc5005-baaf-428d-8581-2e544c732fd0">When the people of Tal’Dorei gaze into the morning
        sky, they see the sun, a blazing disc the size of a gold piece, looking back at them. It is the domain of the
        Dawnfather, a god of life and light honored politely by nearly all the realm’s denizens.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7d2d3022-9fa7-4576-89dc-7d440729608d">At night, the skies are filled with countless
        distant stars, a gleaming silver-white moon called Catha, and occasionally, a dim, ruddy moon called Ruidus that
        is nearly half Catha’s size. Both moons are the domain of the Moonweaver, a capricious god of trickery and
        illusions, but there are sects throughout the world that believe only Catha represents the Moonweaver’s cunning
        and grace. Catha’s pearly glow is said to bless the just with cunning and caution, and to make hidden the
        goodhearted when they require stealth and subtlety.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="37d78073-068c-47c4-be98-8a1f632f8d8b">Ruidus, on the other hand, is so surrounded by
        disquieting rumors and folkloric tales of misfortune that some believe another unknown god or power rules this
        small, reddish-brown moon. Cultures around the world tell countless legends of prideful rulers who made grand
        plans or attempted deeds under the moon’s full light—when it shines a brilliant vermilion rather than its usual
        ruddy color—and were forced to watch in horror as their endeavors fell to unforeseen misfortune. It is said
        those who fall afoul of Ruidus failed to give it the deference it is due—and so superstitious folk rarely dare
        to make plans while the full light of Ruidus shines above, let alone enact them.</p>
    <div class="flexible-double-column" data-content-chunk-id="4bc132d5-d5ce-4f7b-a4ff-ef55d562d40c">
        <div data-content-chunk-id="1f70de52-2924-4153-b815-be47e7930932">
            <p data-content-chunk-id="15da6319-383b-4d39-9933-43a3890c2b16">Worse yet, some tales forebode dark fortunes
                for those born under the light of a full Ruidus, a curse of ill luck that will follow them throughout
                their lives. Though the cruel practice of moon-sacrifice is no longer permitted in any of Tal’Dorei’s
                cities, some far-flung settlements still secretly sacrifice children born under a full Ruidus to “save”
                them from a cursed life, and to appease the dark and unknowable appetites of the red moon.</p>
            <p data-content-chunk-id="5f858f16-c6a6-4fcc-89d3-6542bbe22068">Fortunately for the superstitious, Ruidus is
                rarely full. While its cousin, Catha, completes a full cycle approximately once a month, Ruidus’s
                haunting, half-year orbit, combined with its eerie and unexplainable tendency to simply not appear in
                the sky on certain nights or glow with unknown light, creating an unexpected full moon, has only added
                to its mythic reputation as an omen of ill fortune.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="a9dc7198-9622-4f6a-a7fe-6976347bbdf7">Though this book concerns itself mostly with the
        world of Exandria, and specifically the continent of Tal’Dorei, high-level adventurers may eventually gain magic
        that allows them to travel to other planes of existence beyond the material world in which Exandria resides.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c708dab8-4c9d-49ee-9234-8dc7125742fc">The planes surrounding Exandria are similar to the
        planes presented in fifth edition lore. Below are brief descriptions of some of the planes that a party of
        powerful adventurers may travel to. These planes go by many poetic and fanciful names.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MaterialPlane"
        data-content-chunk-id="0ae45dfe-afca-46d9-a54a-ebb24944c45e"><a href="#MaterialPlane"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4145fb9e-0786-460a-b352-800065e8d0c7">The Material Plane is a land where natural laws work
        as we expect. It is a place of all four elements, and of plants, animals, and minerals. Exandria is but one of
        many worlds on the Material Plane—though none but the most accomplished astronomers have become aware of this
        fact, much less devised a way of traveling between material worlds.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="ElementalPlanes"
        data-content-chunk-id="528cda40-ef80-4157-ba48-8b5ac54c11b8"><a href="#ElementalPlanes"
            data-content-chunk-id="ddf9121a-4cc2-4043-9056-13d5c804a7f5"></a>Elemental Planes</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2e504501-bc42-48d5-bd55-39af6e1fe538">When the Protean Gods discovered Exandria, it was
        like a barren ship adrift in a sea of churning, chaotic elements. As a part of their creation, the elements were
        thrust away from the world. Some theorize that the Elemental Planes were created from this banished chaos, while
        others believe the elemental chaos seeped into the Material Plane from tears in the fabric of the planes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="630c8b75-fc9d-43a1-938b-1ba2f6420f75">The latter may be more likely, as rifts between the
        Elemental Planes can be found across Exandria. The largest of these rifts are tended to by the four Ashari
        civilizations, and any who gaze within find wild wastelands of pure elemental power: roiling seas of fire,
        towering mountains of gnashing stone, infinite skies filled with cloudtop settlements, and endless, stormy
        oceans of water.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="FaerieShadowandEther"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="932cf398-a0ce-43a7-852f-07093ccfb352">Parallel to Exandria are odd reflections of its
        reality. The Fey Realm is a plane of natural beauty and ferocity, inhabited by fey folk. The Plane of Shadow is
        a dour, sinister mirror of the world that is. And the Ethereal Plane is a hazy film across the material world,
        as if it were viewed through an old, cloudy mirror, inhabited not only by restless spirits, but also by
        predators that target those who cling to the world of the living.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="155c5826-f44d-48f0-84dc-8ce5d276856c">All the prior planes exist directly adjacent to the
        Material Plane, buttressing and occasionally comingling with its inhabitants. All the planes that follow are
        separated from the material world by a vast sea of starlight, barren asteroids, and misty nebulae of
        unpredictable magic. In the ancient past, arcanists had to craft vessels to sail the treacherous sea of stars to
        travel between their home plane and the mysterious Outer Planes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="aa18f160-c92b-46cd-bf06-a2fbfedd7472">These days, magic such as the <a

            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2206-tooltip">plane shift</a> spell has allowed planar travelers to bypass these
        methods, but there are still a number of strange creatures and forgotten, imprisoned demigods who float
        eternally through the Cosmic Sea.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="547e9d44-f275-4001-892b-b02453a52d27">The Prime Deities imprisoned the Betrayer Gods in
        prison planes after the Founding, and retired to planes of their own creation after the Divergence. Over time,
        the divine beings on these planes reshaped their new homes in their own image, creating places where natural
        laws don’t function as one native to the Material Plane might expect.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f89e3f18-45d4-4185-824c-aedc6a12ebb4">All of these planes are strongly aligned to one or
        more cosmic principles of good, evil, law, and chaos, based on the divine powers that reside there. Because of
        the Divine Gate established after the Divergence, no divine powers can depart these planes, for the sake of all
        Creation. The gods’ supernatural creations can pass through the Divine Gate, though the more powerful they
        grow—and thus, the closer they come to divinity—the harder it is for them to pass through. However, mortals and
        lesser supernatural beings who possess magic to travel between the planes can travel to and from Outer Planes
        like the Hells, the Abyss, Elysium, and Pandemonium unhindered by the Divine Gate.</p>

        where all laws of nature break down completely. Mortal senses have no way of properly perceiving the nature of
        these far-distant realms, and most minds that try to comprehend them snap under the strain of so much unfamiliar
        stimulus. These maddening realities and the alien horrors that live within them are mercifully kept away from
        the known multiverse by the unimaginable distance of space.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0113d9f4-a0ba-43ea-a3de-88e498940697">Some creatures of the beyond have lurked on the
        Material Plane since ancient times, perhaps at the invitation of the Chained Oblivion itself, or because the
        divine powers unleashed in the Calamity punched holes in time and space that allowed such aberrations to slither
        into Exandria unimpeded.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fb47c06a-ea71-4811-8eed-d43a9671b563">Major known locations of aberrant activity in

        dimensions” exist as bubbles of floating color within the Cosmic Sea, and can only be traced or penetrated by
        extremely powerful, lost magical arts.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="afd2b240-bb2b-4871-94a6-ea97de143f5f">Where did Tal’Dorei come from? The origin of this
        land is a time-shrouded question that everyone has pondered in some way, from the most exalted, world-traveling
        hero to the common farmer who has never traveled three miles beyond their village. Everyone has their own ideas
        on where Tal’Dorei, and all of the wide world of Exandria, came from. These varied thoughts all have some things
        in common, since they are all born of jumbled misunderstandings of ancient myths told orally from bard to bard,
        then passed from father to daughter, and eventually codified into religious rewritings of history that favor the
        teachings of a given deity.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dce42a0f-a3b1-4534-a637-36523b574ccf">To speak a full and accurate truth of Tal’Dorei is
        an impossible task, yet Tal’Dorei is known for creating folk who regularly do the impossible. What follows is
        the Myth of Exandria, an account based on the investigations and best efforts of Tal’Dorei’s foremost
        scholars—the homegrown Alabaster Lyceum of Emon, and the international knowledge-seekers and anti-propagandists
        of the Cobalt Soul. These two organizations have assembled this history by digging beneath the layers of dust
        and decay that hide battles long past, unearthing texts long thought burned and censored, and exhuming
        historical treasures from tombs of heroes long forgotten. The details are often debated, for the question of the
        land’s origin remains—consuming the curious, calling those hungry for purpose, and fueling the business of
        adventuring to delve into the tantalizing unknown places of the world.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6eaa1a8a-e84b-4249-bfc7-295597365caf">Before the history of the lands of Tal’Dorei can be
        explored, its context in the history of Exandria itself must be thoroughly established. The world of Exandria is
        home to four major continents, dozens of nations, and untold tiny pockets of civilization amid a wondrous,
        dangerous wilderness. Every civilization, from the largest empire to the tiniest nomadic clan, has its own
        interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation
        myths that eventually converge with history, but there is no known definitive story.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d65d43cf-b444-4e4c-b8e1-3fa458cb0a6a">Even so, life ever seeks to understand its
        inception. In this report, the collected minds of the Cobalt Soul and Emon’s Alabaster Lyceum can say, with only
        the most trivial of doubts, that the city of Vasselheim in Othanzia truly deserves its title of the “Dawn City.”
        It is here, to our researchers’ best understanding, where the stories of all mortal peoples begin. Vasselheim
        became Exandria’s oldest surviving city by virtue of not just being built long ago, but by enduring the Calamity
        (which shall be elucidated presently), a miraculous feat that few other charted settlements can claim to have
        accomplished.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d5f48af4-0d53-4e67-a52d-5fe23906d3dc">In short, Vasselheim houses the earliest known
        temples to the gods, and the earliest known records of history that survived this catastrophe. It is these
        sources that this joint research initiative treats as its primary documents, though great effort has been made
        to corroborate their claims through later sources. It is in the chronicles of Vasselheim that the earliest
        account of the myth of the Founding is recorded—and indeed, this history is the most commonly accepted origin of
        the world in the Republic of Tal’Dorei. Though countless regional variations muddy the historical record, the
        broad strokes of this mythic history are undeniable.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f412ff19-622e-4ce1-885e-17dd25ab78bf">Long ago, this world was one of tumultuous and
        chaotic forces, naught but unbridled fire, seething oceans, and churning, gnashing rock. Through the ashen skies
        of Primordial Creation, the gods arrived from an unknown realm located beyond the ether. These ambitious
        divinities—young and still formless—looked down upon this roiling realm and saw potential for great strength and
        outstanding beauty, and the chance to learn their own place in creation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d6049304-e256-47d6-ae89-f3726ec0d6d8">From the divine hands of the Arch Heart sprung forth
        the First Children, the elves. It is thought that they were made in their creator’s image, yet it is just as
        likely that the Arch Heart, and all the gods who shared their ideas with them, actually adopted forms inspired
        by the image of their creations. The First Children walked the lush Green and gazed upon the heavenly Blue as
        the gods tamed Primordial Creation around them.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="fcb102d3-a217-4daa-96b4-eae8923fabc9">Not long after, in the scale of the cosmos, a second
        mortal creation was wrought by the divine All-Hammer: the dwarves, a hearty people imbued with the desire to
        continue the gods’ work—taming a primordial world filled with the craft and invention of the divinity that lay
        beyond the ashen void. In their turn, a third people were given life by the passionate lovers of Order and
        Chaos, the Lawbearer and the Wildmother. Their children were the humans, endowed with hearts of passion to bring
        meaning to the world as it assumed an orderly form. Yet in their hearts burned a spark of chaos, cursing them
        with short life just as it blessed them with the unquenchable ambitions, mirth, and curiosities of the gods that
        crafted them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="064e6c45-6369-4646-ae30-09210001a0ff">As a note from the High Curator of Emon’s Cobalt
        Reserve, the chronicle of Vasselheim states that the gods were given form and name only when the peoples of
        Exandria began to worship them—yet many of the various races of the world ascribe their creation to a single god
        or group of gods. It would be remiss to not at least conjecture that while the Protean Gods lacked distinct
        form, they still had unique thoughts, emotions, and motivations that were later codified through the worship of
        the people.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="10361cf3-bc37-4816-ba6b-5f615826da61">As inspiration flowed from the Protean Gods, other
        creations followed, giving life to Exandria’s many peoples. Here the mythic record of Vasselheim grows unclear,
        for while the elves, dwarves, and humans were undeniably Exandria’s first races, the identities of the many
        Children of Creation that followed were left unrecorded by the Dawn City’s chroniclers.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="32d6819a-a84b-4b71-8493-2144ae0651a5">These myriad young races explored their freshly
        founded world. As their knowledge grew, they attempted to build. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and
        the lives of the children were extinguished mercilessly by the still-chaotic world. Sorrow is said to have
        filled the hearts of the gods as they watched their children struggle against a land that rebuked them. The gods
        ultimately lent their children tiny fragments of their own power, gifts with which they might shape the world
        around them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9bc8e068-7bee-452e-9bbf-c9cf572c6d99">This small mercy of the gods was the birth of magic,
        and with it the people of Exandria learned to bend the angry earth to their will, to temper the wrath of its
        explosive mountains, to tame its unyielding floods, and to make the hard earth soft and bountiful. Wandering
        peoples settled, language became commonplace, survival gave way to art, and governance replaced anarchy. The
        Protean Creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good—but fragile, and in
        need of guardians.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="895d39e5-0b78-41f1-8737-30b852df8dad">Thus were born the First Protectors: the Dragons
        Metallic of Tal’Dorei. These Protectors pledged themselves to defend the weak against tyrants. It is here that
        the mythic tales connect to the oldest, most fragmented passages of recorded history as civilization’s reach
        stretched across the world. The people praised the gods for their newfound safety, and their prayers gave them
        forms, names, and purpose.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="125033d4-7116-426a-a931-167022512220">Yet the realm refused to be tamed. Quaking cliffs
        roared in defiance of mortalkind’s magical gifts. Seas swelled and seethed. Flames erupted from below with
        greater intensity than any had seen before. Beneath the elements, unknown to the Creators beyond the ashen
        skies, lived ancient beings who were born in the primeval chaos of the world the gods had found: the
        Primordials. These elemental titans that once dwelt deep within the land now rose from their unseen domain to
        sunder it once more. The gods watched as their children were crushed between gnashing rocks and fed to formless
        terrors unleashed in the wake of the destruction. Thus were the seeds of Exandria’s greatest cataclysm set into
        motion.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c03b4fbd-a6c6-413c-a8a6-7cdcd54d0c63">Some gods were so full of grief and anger that they
        wished to abandon this world for another. They tried to convince their divine kindred to join the Primordials in
        reclaiming the realm for chaos, so that they could move on to start anew. Others wished to prove they could tame
        the world for their beloved children. This caused a divide among the gods. The schismatic deities, known today
        as the Betrayer Gods, joined their songs and swords to those of chaos and destruction, taking and twisting their
        children into the image of their intent.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="61d7b4c6-6213-406e-9307-9d5b7c26364b">The cosmos itself seemed to recognize the magnitude
        of the battle on Exandria, and beings of Order and Chaos spilled forth from the still-young multiverse.
        Creatures of chaos emerged from a formless void that Exandria’s peoples came to call the Abyss. These demons fed
        upon the suffering of the wounded and the dying, and grew cruel. Sentinels of order emerged from a distant realm
        of celestial harmony. The Prime Deities beseeched these celestials to aid them. In turn, the Betrayer Gods
        forced order upon the demons and made them devils, perfectly lawful soldiers who lived only to cause harm.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d28a0eb3-6ab5-4fe7-ab61-eca40f10e6d2">As the clash of gods and Primordials spiraled out of
        control, the desperate mortal races sought their own way to defend themselves from the rebellious elements.
        Seeing that their creations still suffered, the Arch Heart taught them the secrets of making magic themselves.
        The most intelligent and inquisitive mortal minds followed the path the gods had revealed to them, and created
        incantations and formulae to create new spells on their own terms, without the aid of divine power. These people
        called themselves arcanists, for they were masters of the arcane secrets of magic.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d7a2fb13-05ae-417e-b31c-cf3e4040910b">With their potent new magics, these resourceful
        mortals subdued the Primordials long enough for the Prime Deities to banish their traitorous kin to secluded
        prison planes. With the Betrayer Gods locked away, the gods were overjoyed to see the resourcefulness of their
        children. The defeated Primordials were destroyed, and from their ever-enduring essences, the gods channeled
        their wild and destructive powers into the Elemental Planes that surround the material world of Exandria.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="341c3549-782d-449f-a2f7-ef4580de1c9e">For the first time since the Creation, Exandria
        finally settled into an idyllic peace. From this peace was born the first enduring mortal civilization, the
        heart of which was a grand city called Vasselheim, the Cradle of Creation and the Dawn City.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1e7c08ea-82cd-47a6-baa4-15f8b3f9570a">Culture developed anew, the races ventured beyond to
        explore and discover their own lands, and great music filled the air to give name to this world once and for
        all: Exandria.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2d6af7f3-fbbd-4bf1-a71f-eb601de2c91e">Ages passed, and society flourished. Great kingdoms
        sprung up. Castles were built in a day, accelerated by the arcanists’ newfound power. Even though magic could be
        used to complete the most difficult tasks with hitherto unknown speed, magic-users strove always to innovate. As
        mages practiced and perfected their powers of creation, they soon unlocked the secrets of life itself, giving
        birth to wondrous, dangerous new forms of life and power.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f4b09138-5ca0-4ace-ad5b-41bf13c96689">Yet, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that
        the very magic which allowed mortalkind to prosper also instilled a deep rot within their civilizations. The
        arcanists of the world grew arrogant. They came to see their arcane gifts as proof that the gods held no sway
        over their fate, and that with a sophisticated enough command of magic, they could become as powerful as the
        gods themselves. Though this hurt and surprised the Prime Deities who had imprisoned their kin for the sake of
        their children, they sought to sympathize with the willfulness of their creations, remaining out of love and
        hoping that the mortals would learn the error of their ways.</p>
    <aside class="tcsr--medium-epigraph">
        <p>The foremost scholars of our day would make it seem an indisputable fact that the gods created Exandria. That
            they blessed us with the bounty that all peoples of the world now make use of. So too, they say, was magic
            their gift to us. But such zealots ignore the fact that there is another likelihood: that the gods did not
            create mortals, and their world—but the opposite. That the dreams of mortals mingled in the wild magic of
            the young world, and gave that magic form and order: divinity. Of course, the dogmatic zealots of our day
            will dismiss such ideas as heresy—but not you, reader! The avid mind feeds not on dogma, but on new ideas!

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2d5d98dd-bec5-4b12-8b3a-7355d94038ac">The advent of the arcane seemed to be the key to a
        bountiful age of plenty, but also proved to threaten it, as prosperity soon gave way to greed. Rather than
        universal goodwill and comfort for all, the Age of Arcanum came to be defined by endless petty squabbles over
        wealth and power among the elite, while those without magic hunted for their scraps. Tantalizing rumors of a
        path to immortality slithered through the most decadent circles of magi and nobility. One mortal mage, her name
        lost and presumed to be struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites to challenge the God of Death, felling
        him and taking his place among the pantheon, making of her the first and only living mortal to ascend. The name
        of this original death god was likewise lost to history. Only the title of his now-godly successor, the Matron
        of Ravens, survives.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4ef27967-f440-4ba6-a472-d87195b1e77d">Her victory over divinity was a catalyst for many of
        the horrors of the Age of Arcanum. An archmage named Vespin Chloras, renowned throughout ancient Vasselheim for
        his wealth, skill, and cruelty, was inspired by this display. He sought the guidance and power of the banished
        gods, rending open the gates of their prisons and releasing the Betrayers into the mortal world.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d7008c33-30ca-4d6a-9e5e-3d02d78e4004">In their imprisonment, these Gods of Hatred and
        Despair had warped their prisons into reflections of their depravity. The Abyss, once a formless place of chaos,
        a byproduct of the gods’ Creation, was twisted into a place of evil. Countless other planes of cruelty were born
        from the Betrayer Gods’ hatred, and those realms’ evil depths endlessly churned forth horrors that lived only to
        transform peace into suffering, and righteousness into arrogance and greed.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="361c0ba6-f89b-4100-bbc8-0f8ddf6457bf">Released unto the mortal world once more, the
        Betrayer Gods’ urge to ruin was supplanted by the desire to dominate, and they turned their sights first to the
        archmage who had freed them, making Vespin the first of their many mortal thralls. Records of diabolical texts
        safeguarded within the libraries of the Alabaster Lyceum suggest that Vespin, now long dead, serves the Betrayer
        Gods to this day—now as a devil at the left hand of the Lord of the Hells. These corrupt gods sought out the
        shattered remnants of the devils they had crafted and the demons they conscripted, and secretly created with
        them a fearsome new kingdom on the far end of the world, the capital of which was named Ghor Dranas, the
        Gathering of Shadows.</p>

        Betrayer Gods’ corrupted planes seeped into the world, the lords of evil welcomed mortals whose heartlessness
        and lust for power made them susceptible to the gods’ grand promises. The most fertile soil of all for these
        noxious seeds lay in mortal hearts obsessed with the infinite power of the arcane. With a legion of the damned
        behind them, the Betrayer Gods soon made their presence known to the world with a surprise assault on Vasselheim
        itself.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c7245030-97fd-4222-8655-d0fc342cfb92">Though much of the city was reduced to rubble,
        Vasselheim weathered the initial assault, saved by the intervention of their protectors, the metallic dragons,
        and even a number of the Prime Deities themselves. The creators descended to trade blows with their former
        brethren. The battle, which pitted gods against mortals and heroes against demons, raged ceaselessly for twenty
        days and nights, until the dark forces were forced to retreat, their surprise attack thwarted.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="089cede7-c0fd-479b-8fe3-95c591238d8d">Yet this victory was a tainted one. Evil had been
        repulsed momentarily, but the revelation of such a terrible foe incited an arcane arms race. Trust was shattered
        indefinitely: if mortals could fall under the sway of the Betrayer Gods, who could be true allies? If ruin like
        this could be unleashed under the watchful eyes of divinity, what value did mortal lives hold? Fearing all
        powers but their own, the most self-interested and singular human arcanists warped their greatest creations,
        magical instruments of prosperity and joy, into arms and armor of horrific power. The dwarves’ fascination with
        rock and earth turned toward isolation as they burrowed further into the mountains, using their divine gifts to
        animate legions of autonomous golems to protect their ancestral halls. Elves used their understanding of
        creation’s beauty and intricacies to weave spells of unimaginable destructive force, the likes of which Exandria
        had never before seen.</p>

        Primordials, the focus of magic was warfare. The gods themselves agreed to join their children on the field of

        Deities blessed with their power. Some deities created warriors of their own from light and holy fire. Others
        imbued fragments of their power into the weapons now called Vestiges of Divergence. More still bestowed
        blessings upon mortals and called them champions. One tale even tells of a champion blessed by three of the gods
        in their times of greatest need. Now all but forgotten, this Apotheon was forced by fate into terrible battles
        across the world.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9f707cec-b187-49b3-a647-e5ddc7f80b94">The sheer magnitude of the energies unleashed in the
        ensuing battles of gods and mortals frayed the boundaries holding back the elemental chaos, spilling unbridled
        destruction into the world and bringing utter annihilation. Even the ley lines that direct the flow of magic
        across Exandria like veins direct blood through the body show signs of being warped by the raw power that the
        Calamity unleashed. Some well-preserved ruins of the ancient civilizations remain, such as the Drowned City of
        Cael Morrow in the lands of Marquet, but for the most part, all traces of the old world were erased from the
        face of Exandria.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="be562900-ddcb-460f-933b-d1da46276135">So great was the loss of life during the war that
        even liberal estimates suggest no more than a third of Exandria’s population survived it. This unthinkable
        devastation inspired some civilizations to flee Exandria entirely and seek refuge on other planes, scattering
        the Children of Creation across the multiverse. By the war’s end, the only bastion of civilization left on the
        face of Exandria was the Dawn City itself: Vasselheim.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="98173c3a-a936-4ff9-962e-c6bcef323cc8">In the wake of the Calamity, the victorious Prime
        Deities once more banished their traitorous kin to their realms of deception and hate. The world entered a long,
        dark period of recovery, as history had to be recovered and purpose restored, and the threat of the Betrayer
        Gods still loomed heavily upon the minds of all. Even the Prime Deities felt guilt for their role in the
        conflict, for it was the unrestrained clash of divine power that had unleashed such horror upon the world.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="480cc3cd-b685-4419-9593-7a99f36c446d">The records of the Scalebearers assert that the
        Platinum Dragon and the Lawbearer descended upon Vasselheim and spoke a decision: the Prime Deities would depart
        from the world and establish a Divine Gate that would forever prevent any god from ever acting directly upon
        Exandria again. This proclamation shocked the other Prime Deities and the beleaguered survivors of the war in
        equal measure, but while mortals railed against this announcement, the other gods quickly realized that the
        decision of the two most dutiful and self-sacrificing of their number was unimpeachable and just.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="31749b2c-2ec3-412b-975b-ae899334a351">Thus, in hopes of ensuring such ruin would not
        befall Exandria again, they left their children to rebuild civilization anew within the walls of Vasselheim and
        beyond. The Creators returned to their own realms, sealing all divine powers behind their newly constructed
        Divine Gate. Only in this way could they prevent their corrupted brethren from physically returning to the
        Material Plane.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c1c6bad7-649b-4864-a24c-ebfd62cd7acb">Much time has passed since, and the world has been
        reborn once again. The gods still exhibit their influence and guidance from beyond the Divine Gate, bestowing
        their knowledge and power to their most devout worshipers, but the path of mortals is now their own to make. New
        cities, kingdoms, and cultures have retaken the world, building over the ashes of the old. New songs fill the
        air, and the hope of a brighter future drives people day after day, while buried ruins and forgotten relics
        remind all people of a darker time—and of mistakes that should never be repeated.</p>

        <p>Names of the Divergence</p>
        <p>Of these many formative events, the tale of the Divergence is the most oft-told among the many faiths and
            civilizations of the world. When seeking the truth of this event, the researchers of the Cobalt Soul found
            that it was called by many titles around the world, for many different reasons.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Second Spark.</strong> This name is most often used by those who study the arcane, for it
                was the gods giving them a second chance to use magic for the betterment of the world.</li>
            <li><strong>The Penance.</strong> Priests, clerics, and religious scholars across Exandria refer to the
                departure of the gods by this name, for they see it as a self-imposed atonement for the gods’ role in
                the ravaging of the world.</li>
            <li><strong>The Divergence.</strong> The most common name for this event, the Divergence, is used by people
                of all classes and creeds. This descriptive name simply refers to the gods’ final act of divergence from
                the mortal world.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="405037da-19bd-4921-935b-e98bd4dc1dc9">Following the creation, and subsequent razing, of
        Exandria, a post-Divergence world was now left to rise from the ashes and begin a new era. While every region
        had its own rebirth following the terrible destruction of the Calamity, the continent that now bears the name of
        this setting shall remain the focus.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="610ff694-24d2-49a7-8581-573180e3fb63">The modern calendar began in the year 0 P.D.
        (Post-Divergence), over eight hundred years before the writing of this text. Though the modern nation-state of
        Tal’Dorei did not emerge for some time after year 0, the history of Tal’Dorei truly began with the founding of
        Gwessar.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Gwessar" data-content-chunk-id="6c4e7aa4-1592-4f76-b4bb-c69201ef3970">

    <p data-content-chunk-id="aa07ae75-7ffa-4f10-9f09-9779e29c49db">At the dawning of modern history, what is now known
        as the continent of Tal’Dorei housed the germinating seeds of civilization. It was the hardy, dependable dwarves
        who best weathered the war between gods and mortals, beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains. Dozens of dwarven redoubts
        rose and fell in the tumult of the Calamity and the uncertain era that followed it. For many years, dwarves
        lived in the tunnels beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains, leaderless and chaotic, until the various clans unified to
        form the subterranean city of Kraghammer. Proud of their grand new home, the dwarf clans were content to remain
        beneath the earth. They saw the war-scarred surface world as a source of naught but misery and death, and their
        new underground domain as a place of undiscovered prosperity. This city was dug underneath the mountains, and
        its deep roots, though young, survived where more ancient ancestral halls were annihilated. Clan Jaggenstrike
        were the architects of Kraghammer’s hardy, unassailable redoubts, and easily became the first ruling clan of the
        Kraghammer dwarves.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="53c200dd-b1c9-4db0-b692-a9cfbf1175bc">While the dwarves busied themselves excavating the
        world below, a group of elves appeared suddenly in the south. At the outset of the Calamity, a society of elves
        used a powerful, obscure ritual to transport many of their people to safety on another plane: the Fey Realm, a
        plane of primordial beauty where elven legend says the Arch Heart lovingly fashioned their people before placing
        them upon the face of Exandria. They returned at the turning of the ages under the guidance of an elven
        sorceress named Yenlara Alderwreath.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3ceca06a-5ad6-45f5-abf8-70223a3c98e4">The elves rallied around her both for her defiant
        strength and for her compassion in the face of adversity. It was under Yenlara’s wise rule that elven society
        once again began to reform. Upon returning to Exandria, Yenlara led her people westward to the Verdant Expanse,
        an untamed forest born from the residual elemental power that lingered after the end of the Calamity.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c843c918-bfbf-40f7-9b5a-ee6205f4f5bb">So beautiful was the forest they settled in that
        Yenlara’s people were the first elves known to bear the now-widespread name of syn’alfen—wood elves, in Common
        parlance. Likewise, the beauty of their forest home inspired the name of their first settlement: Syngorn, the
        great elvenhome that stands proud within the Verdant Expanse to this very day.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="183f49b8-8f66-461f-91bf-136db34ad3de">As Yenlara’s people began to explore beyond the
        forest, they found vast fields of grass emerging from the ash-darkened ground, with tall, snowcapped mountains
        visible on the horizon. Overwhelmed by the beauty of the restored world, the syn’alfen called their new land
        Gwessar, the Fields of Joy, a name by which elves (and those enamored with elven culture) still call the
        continent of Tal’Dorei to this day.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="370a9638-2e00-4e02-845d-e555f6820ad7">The dwarves and elves are long-lived people, and
        when they struggled to rebuild their civilizations, there were those among them who still remembered the world
        that was. Humanity was not so fortunate. Human histories, written by wasteland warlords in fading ink on
        waterlogged parchment and vellum, did not survive the years. Yet, somehow, humanity endured. Several centuries
        after the Jaggenstrike dwarves began this period of renewal, a clan of humans braved the angry Ozmit Sea and
        sailed to Gwessar’s western coast from the continent of Issylra, though whether or not they came from Vasselheim
        itself is unknown.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a878c75b-5942-48b5-9fb7-eff865675054">These people had the sea in their blood, and leapt
        from island to island for generations, but something called them to Gwessar. The ruins of their first
        settlement—the port city of O’Noa—still stand today. From O’Noa the seafarers expanded outward, until all of the
        western shores flew their banner. In the north, they found fertile fields protected from the salt of the sea,
        and an inlet unmarred by looming rocks and dangerous reefs, and they began to build. They did not know their
        city would become the heart of a great empire. They did not know the glory and sorrow that would surround the
        city of Emon.</p>

    </figure>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e780bc4b-4558-4526-9bcc-ef91ae7c38ac">The rise of human colonies irritated the elves of
        Syngorn. Forests that had stood for centuries fell under the axes of rash, short-lived beings who sought to
        exploit, expand, and propagate thoughtlessly. These tensions did not build to war, for long were the memories of
        the elves, but humanity remained a thorn in the side of elfkind, chafing at their hard-won efforts to protect
        their society and threatening to encroach upon their sacred woodlands.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0b50aa8b-404e-4ffe-818f-50721d5fd71f">As the first human civilization on this part of the
        world after the Calamity, Emon gave rise to a handful of self-entitled noble houses who went on to establish
        civilization in the name of the Lawbearer—but those who wrote the game stacked the deck in their favor.
        Corruption spread through the upper echelons of Emon, and power-hungry politicians seized each new and valuable
        resource that was discovered in their bountiful new kingdom. They turned their citizens against each other,
        forcing them to fight for scraps while they hoarded the lion’s share.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="84fb0ab8-d208-49f8-a2b0-d8f8bc26723a">Emon was a political war zone, and the greatest
        warrior of them all was a loudmouthed braggart and cunning oligarch named Warren Drassig. The chaos and mistrust
        in Emon allowed Drassig and his agents to seize power and transform the realm into the Kingdom of Drassig, with
        Warren himself as its supreme monarch. Drassig was quick to sever any remaining connections with the elves of
        Syngorn and make new alliances with the dwarves of Kraghammer, marrying Drassig’s autocratic power with the
        dwarves’ immense material wealth.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="53b56561-2c21-4d28-bfe9-06a31a7494c9">The elves were furious, but the ambassador from
        Syngorn to Emon, an idealistic grandson of the still-living Yenlara, hoped to resolve this diplomatically. Upon
        arrival, he was apprehended, tortured, and slain. This final act of treachery drove Syngorn to arms, and the
        continent erupted into a terrible, protracted war between Yenlara’s kin and Drassig’s bloodline known as the
        Scattered War.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ec203b5c-dc3b-4653-ac20-41ed8a7f862e">The Scattered War lasted for thirty-two years, and
        is recalled in bardsong as the Time of Shrouds. The war spanned the Cliffkeep Mountains and parts of the Verdant
        Expanse, with the human colonies spread throughout the soon-to-be-warring territories. King Drassig encountered
        little resistance as he conquered each village, town, and city in turn, giving these isolated settlements no way
        of warning one another of the warlord’s advance.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0e1bb5b8-ccd5-407f-bbdf-bb1e66dbdb59">No common warmonger, Drassig was a cunning,
        heartless master of psychological warfare. Weeks in advance of his armies, he seeded spies throughout the land.
        They traveled swiftly through the secret dwarf-tunnels that crisscrossed the Cliffkeep Mountains, and
        infiltrated settlements throughout the region, turning the people of each settlement against their own leaders,
        eating at them from within, poisoning them against one another. By the time Drassig’s armies reached their
        targets, they were already poised to fall. The lights of human towns and elven groves were snuffed out with
        equal savagery.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6dce7666-5feb-4a5a-9d87-031e299f0e20">Yet, a mere nine years after the war began, King
        Warren Drassig died.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a29d86d9-2c37-42cf-90c3-08e52c66a4ea">It happened at Torthil, an abandoned village in
        Gwessar’s heartlands. For years, rumors had grown that Torthil was a haven for war refugees. The king and his
        soldiers fell upon the village with a vengeance, seeking survivors to slaughter. As they regrouped in the town
        square, Drassig stood among them, blade raised, eyes wild, and voice booming, to rally their bloodthirsty
        spirits. It was at the height of his wicked speech that the first arrow struck, followed shortly by a volley
        that clouded the sky. After nine years of suffering, Yenlara’s wood elves and the rebellious humans of the
        scattered colonies had joined forces and formed an alliance against their common enemy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="55951b35-78e7-47b2-949e-a091718ccbdc">After Warren Drassig fell, he was succeeded by his
        eldest son, Neminar Drassig. Neminar shunned the crude, brutal methods of his father, instead finding his
        interests in more sinister powers. He became known as “Neminar the Black-Fingered,” as his forays into
        necromancy left one arm withered and tainted. Nevertheless, his weaponization of forbidden magic elevated the
        threat of Drassig’s war machine. King Neminar, bent on bloody-minded vengeance, led his army back to Torthil,
        where the corpses of the elven and human traitors were piled high upon the outer walls. Their pyres ignited the
        night as the entire city was reduced to rubble. And so the Scattered War continued, unabated by the death of
        Warren Drassig.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f33f7686-5056-4936-89d7-6b7df1dd026a">The rule of Neminar marked the darkest days of the
        war. He introduced tactics and magic that drove his soldiers beyond human limits, leaving their bodies altered
        and mutated by foul necromancy. Their warped minds craved bloodshed and domination, and their bodies needed no
        sustenance to fuel their bloodlust. Drassig’s forces became the perfect weapons of war, their ranks blessed by
        the divine touch of the Strife Emperor—the first Betrayer God to extend his power to mortals beyond the Divine
        Gate. All the gods soon learned that though they could not walk upon Exandria themselves, they could still grant
        magic to their faithful.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="757a27eb-19a6-4307-b3cf-6fb21fefcd25">In the face of such terrible power, the alliance of
        humans and elves bolstered their ranks with vengeful orphans and eager heroes of all ancestries who suffered
        under Drassig’s tyranny. One such hero who came to be instrumental in the coming conflict was Zan Tal’Dorei. A
        human who rose from the harried streets of Syngorn, Zan quickly showed her mettle as both a warrior and an
        inspirational leader. Rallying the broken ranks of the resistance, Zan lured Neminar and his lead forces into
        the Verdant Expanse.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e27d547f-31cf-419c-b98f-275705576f85">Neminar’s undoing was an arrogant attack upon the
        Shifting Keep, a Syngornian outpost protected by the slippery magic of the Fey Realm. The illusory fortress
        vanished, leaving the Drassig army without a target and vulnerable to ambush. The forest itself seemed to lend
        its fury to the weapons of Zan’s warriors, and Neminar and his blighted soldiers were crushed in one swift
        stroke.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7d2ff21b-468c-4760-b0be-c23dace6de3b">Word of Neminar’s defeat and death spread like
        wildfire across Gwessar, and the banner of Zan Tal’Dorei’s rebel army became a symbol of hope for all of the
        oppressed peoples of the realm.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6cb99976-bdc9-4fb4-93e2-f44bf43c1061">Even so, the last years of fighting were still ahead
        of them, for the late King Warren Drassig’s youngest son still stood to take power, and swore to avenge his
        family.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BattleoftheUmbraHills"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1640b8c9-a199-4464-a9b7-52ffbb987d28">King Trist Drassig, second-born son of the despotic
        Warren Drassig, took the throne with unearned confidence. So enamored was he with arrogant visions of victory
        that he ignored the truth of his tenuous rule: he was neither as brilliant nor as charismatic as his father, his
        armies were stretched thin, and his people rioted. The rebels, led by the young warrior Zan Tal’Dorei, won
        battle after battle, and before long, King Trist found his army backed against the imposing base of the
        Cliffkeep Mountains.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b61ee2b5-7bf3-4309-b6dd-9d26481af588">In the wake of certain victory, Zan and her rebels,
        allied with the elves of Syngorn, pursued Drassig to this valley, but were met with fiends amidst the ranks of
        their enemy. King Trist had a secret weapon—through his family’s dealings with the Strife Emperor, the spawn of
        the Betrayers had returned to the world. They spilled into the battlefield like a river of nightmares, and in
        minutes, the surrounding hills ran dark with blood and ichor, and the bodies of humans and demons alike littered
        the battlefield. Yet, despite all odds, the hero Zan defeated King Trist, ending the Drassig bloodline—and with
        it, the demonic pact the Drassigs had made. It is said that the grass and flowers of the Umbra Hills grow black
        and burnt as an echo of this battle, their sap coursing with the fiendish blood that was spilled that day.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="144a64e6-9604-4747-b410-6cfc2bbe93b4">Society had all but collapsed once more amidst the
        Scattered War. Within the Verdant Expanse, the triumphant rebels assembled a council of trusted and proven
        minds, but the people were accustomed to a singular leader, a king. In the hearts of the people, it was not the
        crown that had failed them, but the bloody-minded family that wore it. The council assented to the will of their
        people, and nominated the war hero Zan Tal’Dorei to take the throne. She humbly accepted the role, but refused
        to take the title of king or queen. Her name, she asserted, was Zan. After some debate, she eventually relented
        to being called Sovereign Tal’Dorei, if such formality was required.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8296d841-fcfc-4aa0-82a9-497e10b465c6">Again in spite of Zan’s protestations, the council
        unanimously agreed the realm should be renamed Tal’Dorei in her honor. Power was divided between the sovereign
        and the council, both of whom ruled from Emon. From there, Emon’s leaders expunged any remnants of Drassig’s
        reign from their city, while the allied armies of Tal’Dorei and Syngorn did the same throughout the realm. The
        leading clans of Kraghammer pleaded for clemency, claiming they were coerced to serve Drassig. They spent many
        years paying reparations and making amends, but the fractured trust between Gwessar’s peoples took generations
        to heal.</p>
    <aside class="tcsr--large-epigraph">
        <p>“A king should not stand apart from their people. A ruler must know sacrifice, for how else are they to know
            those who till the fields, who tend to the cattle, and who raise our children? A ruler should know pain and
            sorrow, for war is bloody and cruel. A ruler who asks their people to fight is one who asks them to die, and
            no person should die for a selfish king or an unjust cause. A ruler should know justice, but also mercy, for
            not all crimes are committed with evil intent, but rather in grief and shame. I am no king. I am the peasant
            in the fields. I am the painter at the easel. I am the young soldier donning their father’s rusted armor.
            You will not find me sitting upon a bejeweled throne disdaining my supplicants, but working beside your
            mothers and fathers, fighting beside your valorous children, and aiding those who have suffered in the name
            of unjust kings.</p>
        <p>“Henceforth, Tal’Dorei shall not be just a name: it is a principle. From this day, Tal’Dorei is a principle
            that stands for honor, an everlasting honor that binds its people. A principle that is a beacon for the
            lost, the helpless, and the forgotten. Tal’Dorei is a principle that you should declare with honor as you
            stand side-by-side with the people of Tal’Dorei as kin. Tal’Dorei is not a name; it is to be proud, it is to
            have honor, it is to be loyal, and loving, and kind. Tal’Dorei is not a name; it is a people. And you are
            the people of Tal’Dorei! I refuse the title of king. If you wish me to rule, I shall do so as a sovereign of
            the people—and if you permit me, if you accept me as such, the Sovereign of Tal’Dorei! For the Honor of
            Tal’Dorei!”</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="25b05544-b184-4056-a256-9c23869de301">Not two years into Sovereign Zan’s reign, a
        cataclysmic evil tested her mettle and the skill of the council. A creature from the Elemental Plane of Ice
        slunk into the Material Plane through a hitherto unknown rift between the planes. It appeared in a mystical
        forest of eternal winter known today as the Frostweald. From its hibernal abode, this elemental spirit spied
        upon the untested realm of Tal’Dorei and saw an opportunity. The spirit dove back to its extraplanar home and
        informed its master of a land ripe for conquest. Errevon the Rimelord, a cruel elemental so mighty that he is
        speculated to have been a scion of the Primordials, one that escaped the gods’ wrath in the Founding, seized
        this opportunity.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bfaf0a92-051b-45be-ab5b-ec703637e59c">On the next winter solstice, Errevon tore wide the
        Frostweald rift and commanded the endless blizzards of his home plane to ravage the prosperous land around it.
        Tal’Dorei’s southern reaches, thus weakened, were easy pickings for the Algid Legion, a mighty army of frost
        giants and animate blizzards led by the Rimelord himself. Their relentless advance covered all they touched in
        snow and death.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2ed52b2f-6662-497e-b741-6828bdb3f05d">Countless brave warriors and civilians alike fell to
        the invaders’ gelid weapons, for they were unprepared for such an onslaught so soon after the Drassigs’
        protracted war. The storm of ice widened year by year, consuming the Tal’Dorei heartland as Errevon claimed all
        lands that fell beneath the ice as his own. North of the rift, he built a towering citadel of frost, forcing
        those he conquered to swear fealty in exchange for warmth and liquid water. The Rimelord’s tyrany lasted for
        three long years as the nascent Council of Tal’Dorei struggled to convince Syngorn and Kraghammer to ally for
        the sake of the realm. This monumental diplomatic mission completed, the combined might of Tal’Dorei, Syngorn,
        and Kraghammer assaulted Errevon’s Citadel and forced the Rimelord back to the rift from whence he came. It was
        in this time of need that the druidic Ashari people first revealed themselves to the people of Tal’Dorei, and
        used their unrivaled elemental magic to seal the rift once and for all. The snow began to melt, the fortress
        toppled into the nearby Foramere Basin, and the people celebrated their freedom from the oppressive cold. This
        victory is now celebrated annually throughout Tal’Dorei as the Winter’s Crest festival.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="af95f4f2-7c56-4721-801d-2418abffe938">Zan Tal’Dorei passed peacefully after a long and
        happy rule, and was succeeded by a long line of her descendants. Many generations of peace ensued, and the
        Tal’Dorei Empire formed as dozens of tiny city-states across the Dividing Plains flocked to the stable rule and
        heroic reputation of Tal’Dorei in the wake of the Icelost Years.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0cebaa65-06eb-4b43-8e1d-45d8117e5de2">The adroit statecraft of the Council of Tal’Dorei
        maintained cordial alliances with both Syngorn and Kraghammer, but, despite their best efforts, couldn’t keep
        the elves and dwarves from regressing to hostility over ancient quarrels. In the time of Sovereign Odellan
        Tal’Dorei, word of a shadow in the south came to the ears of the council. Contact with numerous outlying
        townships at the edges of the empire halted abruptly, and traders that made circuits from Emon to the Rifenmist
        Peninsula in the south vanished without a trace. The council was slow to act in defense of territories that
        routinely flaunted imperial law, but were finally driven to action when allied villages south of the Verdant
        Expanse begged for protection against a “nightmare of fire and malice.” The dour Sovereign Odellan blocked the
        council’s relief efforts, claiming the economic cost of sending a regiment that far south to outsider
        communities was a misuse of resources, especially without proof of a threat. It wasn’t until two years later,
        when reports of a powerful red dragon reached the ears of the sovereign, that the Council of Tal’Dorei was able
        to act.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="92d9182d-0a57-4ffc-a0ab-7831816fed50">By then, much of the Mornset Countryside had been
        reduced to ash by a self-obsessed and power-hungry red dragon named Thordak, who preferred the self-styled
        moniker of “the Cinder King.” According to Cobalt Soul records from the Temple of the Mentor in the lands of
        Marquet, the Cinder King was presumed dead nearly two hundred years prior, killed by the brass dragon
        Devo’ssa—yet it could not be denied that Thordak survived, and that he sought new peoples to enslave, ones with
        fewer defenses.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1073edeb-7036-4903-b078-2b6f81f5fa02">The mighty armies of Tal’Dorei marched finally
        south, but morale was low. They marched toward fiery, painful death, and soldiers grumbled of a heartless
        sovereign who luxuriated in his castle in Emon while his people put their lives on the line for the realm. They
        finally clashed with Thordak and his mercenary armies south of the Stormcrest Mountains, but the forces of
        Tal’Dorei were soon forced into a panicked, disorganized retreat as the rocky, exposed terrain worked to the
        advantage of their airborne foe.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b602af31-ac1f-4a36-b344-8a3a33a9bc66">The valiant soldiers of Tal’Dorei would surely have
        been brought to utter ruin were it not for the heroic intervention of a band of young—yet able—adventurers. Led
        by Arcanist Allura Vysoren, who sits today upon the Tal’Dorei Council, they cornered the Cinder King alone and
        defeated him—though his power was so great that they could not manage to kill the dragon outright. Instead,
        Allura and her companions used powerful magic to imprison Thordak within the Elemental Plane of Fire forever.
        The Fire Ashari of distant Issylra vowed to watch over Thordak’s prison until age could consume even him.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3c501d4b-dca2-452e-9bd4-ed5e9cf71eb7">Forever lasted a mere sixteen years. In that time,
        life returned to mundane quarrels over the price of bread and taxes. During this time of quietude, an old and
        unexpected ally of Thordak’s, a green dragon called Raishan the Diseased Deceiver, found Thordak and conspired
        to release him from his prison so he could conquer the land that had once rebuked him. Raishan formed a plan and
        forged an unprecedented alliance with three other power-hungry chromatic dragons: Umbrasyl the Hope Devourer,
        Brimscythe the Iron Storm, and Vorugal the Frigid Doom.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="01ea70b0-0423-44f5-8479-48c92c972507">After infiltrating the Fire Ashari of Pyrah for
        nearly five years, Raishan finally unlocked the seal between the planes that bound Thordak and set him free.
        Thordak’s physical body was warped by the fiery energies of his prison. Now stronger than ever, he rallied his
        draconic allies, the Chroma Conclave, to destroy or conquer Tal’Dorei as they saw fit—starting with a
        retributive assault of catastrophic proportions on Emon. Nearly three centuries of Tal’Dorei rule in the realm
        ended under the rule of Sovereign Uriel Tal’Dorei II, his life cut short when much of Emon was reduced to
        rubble.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2074f6ad-634e-4863-b5cb-8e38c670557b">The attack not only killed the Sovereign Uriel, but
        also scattered the Council of Tal’Dorei, throwing the realm into chaos. The remnants of the civilized lands were
        divided up and taken as trophies by the Conclave, while the capital Emon was ruled by the Cinder King himself,
        with Raishan secretly manipulating the course of his rule from the shadows.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="203fc21f-f030-43de-9e1f-432cd7280960">The Alabaster Lyceum need hardly introduce the
        heroes of this story. One by one, the members of the Conclave fell to the might and cleverness of a band of
        misfit warriors known as Vox Machina, their might bolstered by a number of the lost Vestiges of Divergence,
        artifacts of incalculable power forged amidst the chaos of the Calamity. After many adventures, these heroes
        gathered their allies and stormed the capital of Emon, slaying Thordak the Cinder King and freeing its people.
        Upon discovering the machinations of the real mastermind, Raishan the Diseased Deceiver, with whom Vox Machina
        had held a tenuous alliance, they gave chase and finally slew this last standing member of the Chroma Conclave,
        ending their reign over the land and restoring rule once more to the Council of Tal’Dorei.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1ed5b5d9-d762-4af6-80fe-64085052046a">The final act of Sovereign Uriel Tal’Dorei II’s life
        was to abdicate the throne and end the line of sovereigns—permanently. To analyze the historic Last Sovereign’s
        final acts is the duty of biographers, not chroniclers, yet it can readily be surmised that he saw flaws
        inherent to his station. Uriel was the son of Odellan Tal’Dorei, the sovereign who singlehandedly prevented the
        council from swiftly handling the Cinder King when first he rose in the wilderness south of the empire.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="442604e0-30dc-4321-8b21-015f90a39381">How could the Last Sovereign not feel that it was
        his office’s immense power to overrule the council that ultimately cost thousands of loyal citizens their lives?
        How could he not compare the singular power of the sovereign to the abuses of power committed by King Drassig in
        ancient times?</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="89d9ddc5-10a1-4eb5-8d75-f96263f6ac82">Regardless of his private feelings, Uriel II’s last
        act as sovereign transformed his family’s imperial dynasty into the Republic of Tal’Dorei. Zan Tal’Dorei was
        reluctant to accept the singular role of rulership at the dawning of the nation, an ideal she had to compromise
        upon to ensure stability for her fledgling nation. Uriel’s relinquishment of power is seen today as a
        fulfillment of that ideal. It will be the duty of future historians to judge if his decision stood the test of
        time.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="aab4de61-28f2-4883-b02d-10a60a17fdc9">The Tal’Dorei Council has guided the fate of the
        nation since Vox Machina slew the Cinder King. For most of the past two decades, the goal of the council has
        been to rebuild that which was lost—and to assure far-flung territories that the nascent republic is just as
        stable as the empire ever was.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="11a2e38b-4164-4102-aa0e-bb7e55a7c638">Recovery has been slow in both Tal’Dorei’s heartland
        and its most distant reaches. Even though cities like Kymal and Stilben were not direct targets of the dragons’
        rampage, the age of unrest that followed made these small cities easy targets for ransacking by roving bandits
        and corrupt magistrates alike. Even today, outlying settlements are slow to trust the good intentions of the
        Tal’Dorei Council.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="20a53c2c-7b14-4551-a6eb-15c29b47eda2">Major cities like Westruun and Emon have been the
        greatest beneficiaries of the Time of Regrowth, for even though they suffered the worst of the Conclave’s
        destruction, the dragons also kept their lairs close by, allowing vast amounts of plundered wealth from their
        treasure hoards to flow rapidly back into these cities’ coffers. Over the last twenty years, these cities have
        hired legions of arcanists to magically restore much of what was lost.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="465bfb98-87d8-482c-96f2-b21226817c93">However, perhaps the one city that can say it
        directly benefited from the Chroma Conclave’s reign of chaos is Whitestone, a formerly independent city-state
        that is now a member of the republic. Whitestone took in countless refugees from Emon after the Conclave’s
        initial attack, and countless more in the aftermath. Sequestered in Tal’Dorei’s cold northeastern reaches,
        Whitestone is an isolated city, but it has rapidly become a powerhouse of political, cultural, artistic, and
        economic influence—to the chagrin of some traditionalists in Emon.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f5e09d4a-14da-4e8a-a0c9-3ee6cc486456">The world was troubled by a disturbance in Issylra a
        year after the Chroma Conclave’s defeat, as a lich attempted to achieve godhood and crush the Dawn City of
        Vasselheim in one fell swoop. His success would have meant catastrophe for the Material Plane, leaving him the
        sole god on this side of the world’s impenetrable Divine Gate. However, beyond hearing news of Vox Machina’s
        involvement in this conflict, few in Tal’Dorei were concerned by rumblings on the other side of the world.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="86fa005d-1c38-4444-bf47-17bc511876e3">Though the lich’s defeat confined him to a remote
        demiplane, there is no way to strip him of his stolen divinity. Occult worshipers yet scurry throughout
        Tal’Dorei’s darkest corners, seeking the favor of a lich-god known as the Whispered One.</p>

        who have studied history know that each age’s conflict sows the seeds of the next. The Republic of Tal’Dorei has
        proven it can prosper in peacetime, but it has yet to be tested by the pressures of war or a supernatural
        cataclysm.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="11cdcd5b-dab7-4482-93d0-deaec9a7547b">After two decades of expensive reconstruction and
        princely investments in skyship moorings, the Republic of Tal’Dorei is deeply indebted to arcanists across the
        land. Chief among them is the League of Miracles, a consortium of thaumaturgists who have claimed untold
        fortunes from reconstruction bounties all over the country.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8d4c475b-fe6e-4f7e-9704-c144965b0b7e">The simple fact is that the cost of rebuilding
        Tal’Dorei was far more than the council or local leaders could afford to pay. Far be it from the Alabaster
        Lyceum to cast aspersions on so beneficial an organization, but there are fears among the Tal’Dorei people that
        the league has already begun to collect on what they are owed in forms other than gold, as more and more league
        mages receive preferential treatment from local margraves and even members of the Tal’Dorei Council itself.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ec7976cc-8c64-46f1-ab48-e52af1e50ce8">Beyond Emon, the landscape of Tal’Dorei has been
        forever scarred by the presence of the Conclave, especially the Cinder King. His hellfire left marks on the land
        that will never heal—magical wounds that bleed fire and ooze chaotic magic. Smaller cities beyond the reach of
        the council have begun to succumb to sinister influences. Demons and devils crawl into the world, summoned by
        occult powers answering fell voices from beyond the Divine Gate. The Betrayer Gods sense weakness within the
        world. The entropic fury of the Chained Oblivion churns beneath Gatshadow. The lost blade of Neminar the
        Black-Fingered calls from the Umbra Hills for a new master. The Cloaked Serpent raises armies south of Syngorn.
        Cults of the now-divine Whispered One spread like poison through the veins of Tal’Dorei’s cities.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b9cab6b6-cb8b-499d-b627-18ddaa2a3329">Yet despite these threats, the legendary heroes of
        Vox Machina have largely set down their blades, guns, and spells and taken up the mantle of leadership. More
        than twenty years have passed since their greatest adventures, and though the surviving members of Vox Machina
        are still canny rulers and cunning warriors, the Tal’Dorei Council can no longer rely upon their skills as
        readily as they once did. Rumors of the heroes’ permanent retirement swirl, inspiring fear and nostalgic sorrow

    <p data-content-chunk-id="efc6aaf7-8321-4e33-a70a-3b41edff517f">Tal’Dorei needs heroes—and this time, Vox Machina

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b069cf08-1b22-4fc1-b24a-182650651a4b">Tal’Dorei is more than just its history; do not
        treat this book as an encyclopedia, nor as shackles that bind you to portray its characters and environments
        with perfect fidelity. As you read this manual, consider why you want to run an RPG campaign set in Tal’Dorei,
        and in the larger world of Exandria. What about <em>Critical Role</em> inspires you as a Game Master? You might
        cherish the bonds of family and love between its many heroic characters. Perhaps you are drawn to the various
        factions that vie for power over Tal’Dorei’s peoples. Or perhaps it’s the way that evils from Exandria’s mythic
        past inevitably rear their ugly heads, always when circumstances are already at their most dire, that most
        captures your attention.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="edfb92a1-a557-400e-be84-4ee24613f3aa">No matter the initial spark that led you here, hold
        tight to it as you read, and search for ways to feed your personal flame of imagination. And when you are done,
        create. Create boldly, using these words as a launching point for your own tales.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6c023322-065c-4a9b-b821-b09ab8998a19">This section is for Game Masters’ eyes only, though
        GMs are welcome to share tidbits with their players to set the stage for the campaign, or to inspire them to
        create characters that will dovetail with the GM’s story ideas.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="27ab9902-574d-4f94-ac6f-d7be3d37594c">The world of Exandria is steeped in familiar fantasy
        themes, with all the elves, dwarves, and wizards you might expect from a fantasy roleplaying game. But it also
        holds secrets that will challenge your expectations, and you may enjoy putting your own twists on these great
        mysteries of the world. Each of these secrets can form the backbone of an entire campaign, or can serve as
        flavor to create the impression of a world that is larger than just the player characters’ story.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6d227f92-fac1-4b53-b4cd-0e0f83b8ce08">Tal’Dorei was nearly destroyed when the gods fought
        one another in the Calamity. Now, the Betrayer Gods are sealed in otherworldly prison planes, and the victorious
        Prime Deities live in self-imposed exile. An unbreakable barrier stands between the mortal and immortal realms.
        At best, a deity can grant their most skilled devotees a small measure of divine power to enact their will upon
        Exandria.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ecbf02d8-876a-4c03-b616-a19fd32f678d">However, there are a number of cults who yearn to
        circumvent this barrier and summon their dark patron onto the Material Plane. Others still seek to unravel the
        forgotten rites of ascension, just as the Matron of Ravens did in ancient times—just as the Whispered One did in
        living memory. What would happen if an omnipotent deity somehow managed to arise on the mortal side of the
        Divine Gate? Or even simply managed to fool the gods into thinking they had done so? Would the gods of good be
        forced to unleash their powers as one to break the Gate, unleashing another Calamity upon the world?</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ecb3855c-283e-4705-9a12-47446868987c">It was the dying decree of Sovereign Uriel Tal’Dorei
        II that the continent-spanning Tal’Dorei Empire be reborn as the Republic of Tal’Dorei. No more would a
        sovereign rule the myriad peoples of this land, but instead the wise Council of Tal’Dorei would enact the will
        of the people and protect them from the dangers of the world. But things don’t always go according to plan. The
        nascent Republic of Tal’Dorei is suffering growing pains, and unless some heroes are able to help, the realm may
        fall into anarchy and chaos.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6890e1bd-301c-4576-ba01-2a9bd184cf90">While fantasy politics isn’t every gamer’s cup of
        tea, the struggles of the fledgling republic can serve several purposes. Players looking for fantasy intrigue
        can meddle in the internal politics of the city of Emon and root out corruption within the council, which may
        have been planted by any number of this land’s power-hungry factions, from the invasive crime syndicate known as
        the Myriad to the shadowy mages within the Arcana Pansophical who splintered off into a new schismatic faction,
        the League of Miracles.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f5b96853-acea-4f7e-88de-27259ec28c4f">Game Masters can also use political elements to
        flavor or provide a backdrop for their otherwise action-focused games. On a smaller scale, corrupt margraves may
        hire bandits to pillage their own villages, requiring heroes to step in. On a broader scale, a threat to the
        stability of the Republic of Tal’Dorei itself may force the characters to stop a megalomaniac bent on conquering
        the republic from within.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="CriminalShadowWar"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e1674ab2-a5b7-410f-b8f3-e9be68b11647">A criminal syndicate known as the Clasp has lurked
        in Tal’Dorei’s underworld since the foundation of the old Tal’Dorei Empire. It’s almost become a cliché, for
        people across the land know the Clasp as the stereotypical face of organized crime. Novels romanticizing their
        allure have been adapted into stage plays and bard-song in all corners of the republic.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9c30d0e6-4f1f-4bf2-b72f-d94d7de15e8c">And perhaps the Clasp has bought its own good
        publicity. After the Cinder King’s famous conquest of Emon some twenty years ago, it was the Clasp that saved
        countless innocent people and led them to safety through their extensive network of smuggling tunnels beneath
        the city. It was the organized action of criminals, just as much as Vox Machina’s heroic power, which saved
        Tal’Dorei—and the Tal’Dorei Council knows it. The Clasp has gone mainstream.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9afeab3b-6154-4476-8a80-c75ebaf223b5">However, the Clasp is under threat from the Myriad,
        another criminal syndicate from the nearby continent of Wildemount. The Myriad sees Tal’Dorei’s slow
        legitimization of the Clasp as an opportunity to seize power in the nation’s criminal underground. Violence is
        on the rise in Tal’Dorei’s cities as the Myriad uses local gangs as pawns in their bid to dethrone the Clasp.

        And then came Thordak. The Cinder King and the Chroma Conclave shook the very foundations of Tal’Dorei. Thordak
        “merely” reduced the city of Emon to slag, but through fear, panic, and malice, the flames of destruction were
        spread across the continent by mortal hands. Today, a generation after the dawning of the Republic of Tal’Dorei,
        the ruins of three civilizations lie buried beneath your feet, and some secrets long to be unearthed.</p>

        of his firearms. Unfortunately, because of his now-deceased archenemy Anna Ripley, the secret of gunpowder has
        begun to spread across Tal’Dorei. Now, isolated groups of tinkerers, both noble and unscrupulous are working to
        develop new technologies from Percival’s research, and other black powder technologies from Marquet. Some of
        these modern marvels will no doubt help the people of Exandria—but others, if placed in the wrong hands, are
        sure to enable the deaths of thousands.</p>

        their history, but by factions and faiths striving to achieve myriad goals, fighting for conflicting ideals, and
        vying for the power to come out on top. The gods of Exandria may be barred from walking upon the land in
        material form, but they can still put their thumbs on the scales of history through their mortal followers. Such
        followers include clerics with the power to cast mighty spells, paladins who wield blades alight with idealistic
        verve, and untold thousands of common folk whose voices can affect the decisions of even the most powerful
        leaders of the land.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="12106724-fa8d-491d-918c-415ae9d1eae0">A number of factions hold just as much sway over the
        daily lives of the people as the gods and their clergy—perhaps even more. These factions range in might and
        influence from the greatest of the great to the smallest of the small. The Tal’Dorei Council institutes
        political policies that affect everyone in grand, sweeping, and often inscrutable ways, while the Golden Grin is
        a group of folk heroes who seek to subvert evil across the land. Whether these factions are governments or just
        tiny organizations, they can add depth and conflict to your Tal’Dorei campaign.</p>

        all gods, including the evil Betrayer Gods, within their respective domains. If the Divine Gate were to be
        destroyed by the unanimous effort of the Prime Deities, all powers would be unleashed, threatening armageddon.
        Thus, the gods patiently watch their creations from beyond the veil, aiding their faithful with what small power
        they can send through the barrier.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a9f26d24-ee9c-4a8c-935f-431f64dbede3">Some lesser idols, such as archdevils, demon lords,
        fiends and celestials of near-divine power, as well as a number of unaccounted-for demigods reside among the

        and her call beckons her followers to discover that which awaits them beyond the known. There are few urban
        temples dedicated to the Changebringer, but her shrines are often found along well-traveled roads and on
        isolated wilderness hilltops. Many merchants, adventurers, and free-spirited folk worship the Changebringer, and
        many a gala toast and tavern song celebrate her as a bringer of luck and fortune.</p>

        seeding them with the first arcane magics and raising the most ancient of forests. It was by the Arch Heart’s
        hand that the first elves wandered from the Fey Realm, and for this reason, they are considered the Parent of
        all elves. Those who seek art in all of their work, whether magic or mundane, often worship at the altar of the
        Arch Heart. They loathe the Spider Queen and her priestesses for leading the drow astray.</p>

        around the world. Peace and order—through structure and law—guide the will of her devout followers. The
        Lawbearer has a tempestuous romance with the Wildmother, a furious love that is only tempered when civilization
        and nature are in balance. Civil unrest and riots blossom within her beloved cities in these times of imbalance.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7c6f823b-43e6-4248-903d-b8a40cda9edb">Master of the skein of fate and the mistress of
        winter, the Matron of Ravens is the god of death. Her gaze follows and marks the end of each mortal life,
        watching over the transition between life and death—and ensuring that the natural transition is undefiled.
        Mourners at funerals across the land invoke her blessing in hopes that she will protect the deceased from the
        terrible curse of undeath.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1e7b098f-9165-45f4-bff9-251d490d50e8">Keepers of ancient lore believe the Matron of Ravens
        was once mortal herself, and thus the only mortal known to have ascended to godhood—before the rise of the
        Whispered One, at least. Her rise instantly obliterated the previous, now-forgotten god of death, and in its
        wake, the other gods quickly and fearfully destroyed the secrets to the rites of ascension.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="68756ad5-a2a8-4757-b65d-bca40e9a9ad3"><strong><em>Depiction.</em></strong> There are very
        few visual depictions of the Matron of Ravens; many temples simply use the raven as a symbol of her blessing.
        Rare images, however, portray the Matron herself as a tall, pale woman wrapped in dangling black linens, her
        onyx-black hair straight and never-ending, her face obscured by a white porcelain mask.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2202d37d-8872-45e4-bee7-11dc0f7edac4"><strong><em>Divine Domains.</em></strong> Many of
        the Matron of Ravens’s clerics are granted powers of Death, Grave, or Twilight.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e1b38ee3-f8d7-4e26-aac9-3fe8217999fe"><strong><em>Holy Day.</em></strong> The Matron of
        Ravens’s holy day is the Night of Ascension, which celebrates her apotheosis. The actual date of the goddess’s
        rise to divinity is unclear, but the Night of Ascension is nonetheless celebrated on the thirteenth day of the
        tenth month. Many people of Emon see this cheery celebration of the dead to be unnerving and macabre, but the
        Matron’s followers believe that the honored dead would rather be venerated with cheer than misery.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="59b43d04-a4c7-4d1d-b220-cd01da71d8c4">The Matron of Ravens is also considered by some to
        be the patron of Winter’s Crest, a holiday that celebrates freedom from Errevon the Rimelord and is observed in
        Tal’Dorei on the twentieth day of the eleventh month.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="80a40b9c-f3a0-49f1-a3c5-892688e42e8a">The Moonweaver is the god of moonlight and the
        autumn season, as well as the patron of illusion and misdirection. Widely worshipped in halfling and elven
        culture, she is also considered to be the deity of love, shielding the trysts of lovers in shadows of her own
        making. Those who work in darkness and trickery often ask for her blessing.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3a25e92e-c4d5-488b-a320-3abaab76b062"><strong><em>Depiction.</em></strong> Depictions of
        the Moonweaver are as numerous as the myths and stories of her meddling within simple unions. However, she is
        most often painted as a young girl of light-blue skin and white hair, with a body and limbs that dissolve into
        silky strands of silver moonlight, caressing and creating the edges of the shadows.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1501fc95-294c-4c6f-8d45-a1b9298bb04c"><strong><em>Divine Domains.</em></strong> Many of
        the Moonweaver’s clerics are granted powers of Arcana, Moon (see <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f2ffd57e-7d63-48cc-85c6-751220e4fe87"><strong><em>Holy Day.</em></strong> The Moonweaver
        has no holy day, but is celebrated by most elves on the night of the decade’s largest full moon. Elven
        astronomers track the moon’s phases and how it grows closer and farther to Exandria, and can predict these days
        with great accuracy. Many high and haughty elves use this festival as an excuse to be sly and mischievous; some
        younger elves use costumes and illusions to prank their peers. The wyvern-riding skyswimmers of Lyrengorn,
        however, venerate the Moonweaver in their own way: with the annual arrival of the Moonweaver’s Ribbons, a
        majestic aurora that illuminates the skies above the Elvenpeaks.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="95ad1454-8723-47ee-9b40-bb565a8340b0">The devil god of the Hells is the master of tyranny
        and domination, and was the first to instill his despotic will into celestials, creating the first devils. His
        words are honeyed and carefully crafted, soothing and corrupting the hearts of mortals and immortals alike. The
        Lord of the Hells rules his domain with an iron fist, and the punishments awaiting those that cross him are the
        stuff of nightmares. Evil entities pay him tribute right alongside his devils, and many warlocks are drawn to
        his power.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="60b64c46-4474-4163-9ce4-f86ba6b5ebab"><strong><em>Depiction.</em></strong> A twisted image
        of the celestial blood that once bore him, the Lord of the Hells is portrayed in many tomes and murals as a
        handsome humanoid with deep red skin and long black hair. Two curling horns rise from his crowned brow, and his
        lips bear an eternal, knowing grin.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a2db4d22-e105-4a17-af73-f12e923fd38a"><strong><em>Divine Domains.</em></strong> Many of

        Hells’ enemies are numerous, even among the Betrayer Gods, many of whom only follow him for fear of his immense
        power. His archnemesis is the Changebringer, whose mischief and cunning has vexed him throughout the eons. It
        was she who defeated him in the Calamity by tricking his fiendish armies into attacking one another.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fc9e537d-0de8-4908-85dd-5574b16e4b5b">The Devil Lord’s greatest triumph during the
        Calamity was fooling and betraying the Everlight and slaughtering all her followers in one fell stroke—a move
        that today has united the followers of the Everlight and the Changebringer in a bond of unbreakable fellowship.

        iron will, even forcing nature itself to bow to his whims. During the Calamity, he grew his armies not by
        rallying demons, but by corrupting noble creatures into monsters and by destroying the wilds to fuel his engines
        of war.</p>

        Emperor is often depicted as a brutish, ogre-like man clad from head to toe in jagged black armor. Heads dangle
        from his belt, and the shadows that obscure his helmeted face do not hide his unblinking yellow eyes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="adb6b777-18be-4880-99d2-5d9e6dc1e3b4">Those who long for conquest often see their own
        people as superior to all others. Thus, somewhat appropriately, depictions of the Strife Emperor are contentious
        and myriad: he is usually portrayed as a member of whatever race currently bears his banner. In the Republic of
        Tal’Dorei, his face most often has a human cast, for King Drassig’s bloodline paid him tribute long ago.</p>

        authoritarianism. The Strife Emperor and the Wildmother clashed many times during the war before his final
        defeat at Beynsfal Plateau. His massive iron armor is still scattered across Beynsfal, and his gigantic helmet

        years ago, a cult known as the Remnants rose up against the world, led by an undead archmage known as the
        Whispered One. This lich had toiled in secret for years within the Plane of Shadow, constructing the towering
        citadel of Thar Amphala there, while secretly spreading his poison throughout the storied lands of Issylra. His
        goal was simple: repeat the lost rites of ascension that the Matron of Ravens used in the Age of Arcanum to
        become a god—and this time, to be on the opposite side of the Divine Gate, so that he could rule the world.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="77171527-8f71-47dc-82a9-e0ae98f71381">His ascension was successful, but the new god was
        ultimately banished behind the Divine Gate by the intervention of Vox Machina. Their victory, though grand, was
        not complete. The Remnants, though bloodied, still venerate their spited master with offerings of secrets and
        unwilling souls to gain his favor.</p>

        damnable and damning, invades the minds of countless people across Tal’Dorei who have been afflicted by the
        Curse of Strife. The curse is especially prevalent in Rifenmist, where the Strife Emperor’s faithful clerics
        bestow it upon their soldiery, transforming them into perfect weapons of war. The curse acts in unpredictable
        ways, turning some into chaotic berserkers, others into obedient legionnaires, and others still into selfish,
        isolationist thieves. Cultists of the Strife Emperor also use their power to covertly spread the curse
        throughout hospitable and kind communities across Exandria, aiming to destroy them from within and make them
        more susceptible to conquest.</p>

        transformations are the result of the Strife Emperor’s torment, which whispers constantly in the victims’ minds.
        The free goblinkin of Tal’Dorei regard those who spread the curse with special contempt—and those who suffer
        from it with immense pity.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="211a6ba6-32c0-4575-8bbb-92c1c4a8ea2e">For centuries, small-minded people in Tal’Dorei have

        bugbears were created in the Calamity as soldiers for this fell god, the curse does not linger in their blood—it
        spreads via those who pledge their souls to the Strife Emperor. Clerics of the Strife Emperor can use the <a

        Creatures who experience kindness or suffer near-death experiences can have epiphanies that allow their true
        self to tear through the bloody shroud of the Strife Emperor’s lies. A curse-afflicted creature who spends one
        week being treated with love and compassion instead of hatred and fear can make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw,
        breaking the curse on a success. The <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2229-remove-curse"

        Curse of Ruin. Great orc warriors have been laid low when bloodlust overtook their reason. Mighty mages driven
        by a foolhardy ambition forsook caution and delved furiously into knowledge no mortal eyes should behold. The
        Curse of Ruin is said to be the birthright of all orcs—a deadly taint carried in the blood of the Ruiner that
        forged their people during the Calamity.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="691adb95-1689-4364-a669-c6c721a8f473"><strong><em>Truth of Ruin.</em></strong> The truth
        is that the Curse of Ruin is a myth. The blood of the Ruiner granted orcs physical strength and superhuman
        endurance, but it imparted none of the Betrayer God’s evil. The power of the myth, however, is more ruinous than
        any magic.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a79cf8a-3b78-40a2-ad42-ad123e4dace4"><strong><em>Consequences of the Myth.</em></strong>
        Countless superstitious folk across Exandria—including many orcs themselves—believe in the Curse of Ruin. This
        belief doesn’t make the curse any more real. The myth’s existence is a convenient way for any one orc to ignore
        the real consequences of their mistakes, or of any act of thoughtless harm—the curse takes the blame. Even worse
        is when this “birthright” is leveled at wise, even-tempered orcs who have done nothing wrong, and their
        frustrated reactions are then taken as proof of the curse’s existence.</p>

        the world by granting power to mortal clerics and by delivering edicts through their celestial or fiendish
        servitors, the Divine Gate inhibits them from exercising their full powers over the fate of Exandria. The same
        is not true for the lesser idols, beings of demigodly power that have, in the absence of true gods, used their
        splendid and profane forms to amass their own cult followings.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f74bc26b-c62d-4ea9-b81c-4b5237a5bde0">Dozens of these powers are worshiped in relative
        secret across Exandria. Some are supernatural beings like archfey or archfiends that have taken up
        near-permanent residence on the Material Plane. Others are unknown fragments of the power of primordial
        Creation, given form. Most are mortal champions that have gained near-divine power through magic, the blessings
        of the gods, or through mythic effort and training. In all of these cases, the worship of mortals elevates these
        beings to something greater than they were before, imbuing them with fragments of divine power—and allowing them
        to grant scraps of that power back to the mortals in whom they take an interest.</p>

        Conquest of the Amber Worm—in which he defeated a servant sent by the Crawling King to punish the present Queen
        of the Emberhold for her impiety.</p>

        only by his most trusted warlocks, and is venerated by all as the Lord of the Deep Dwelling, and as the dwarf
        who will emerge in the Emberhold’s hour of greatest need.</p>

        deposited a beautiful clay amphora in the port city of Stilben. Through this item, he watches passersby,
        occasionally enticing foolish mortals to pick it up and give it a rub. From there, Xundi offers them power, with
        no strings attached—save for a request for them to go on the most thrilling adventures a little mortal can. And
        maybe, if they survive long enough and become powerful enough, the marid will invite that mortal and their
        friends to his Palace of Silver Silt for a grand banquet, all the pleasures they can imagine, and then a request

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c385d092-c3e7-4d81-87ea-4f4c5926c312">In a time before time, when Exandria was naught but
        darkness in the chaos before even the Founding, a luminous being called the Luxon sought answers about their
        existence. They lit the first fires within Exandria with their unquenchable light, and then began to wait. Gods
        came. They created beings that spread across the planet. Those creatures died and procreated and died in an
        endless cycle, of which the Luxon grew curious. Surely, by watching these short-lived beings, they could learn
        the answers they sought.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9d10de4c-cbbc-4a1f-afa6-d91a94a51ab2">So the Luxon divided their own light into beacons,
        dodecahedral crystals of eternal radiance. They cast them across the world and fell into a deep slumber, during
        which they hoped people would find the beacons and bond to them, allowing the mortals’ souls to be reborn again
        and again so they could learn everything there is to learn about existence.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1a7500b7-eef3-48e4-9272-941496b48707">Many such beacons have been found across the world,
        mostly by a people who have learned the ways of the Luxon in a far-off land. However, many of the beacons remain
        unaccounted for. One such beacon was unearthed about ten years ago by Tal’Dorei settlers in the Cliffkeep
        Mountains, far from any civilization. The people of this settlement, Reaching Bluff, call it the Beacon of
        Unknown Light, and treat it as a mystical oracle that will guide their young settlement to prosperity.</p>

        discovery has escaped Reaching Bluff. As adventurers and treasure-seekers begin to trickle in, the settlers
        protect their newfound oracle with cultish devotion—despite the fact that it has never once spoken to them, as
        they have beseeched it to countless times.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="cd4382bc-7af7-4b21-a0ad-d76963e39d2d">Amidst the Age of Arcanum, the people of the great
        Tetrarchy of Qoniira were visited by a being of sheltering power and comforting light. The people of Qoniira
        were on the path to creating the most prosperous civilization that the Rifenmist Jungle—and indeed, all of
        Gwessar—had ever seen. In its peace and magical might, it exceeded even the grasp of the nearby elven domain of
        Syngorn. Magic, entirely separate from the arcane rituals practiced by arcanists of the era, fueled their city’s
        rise to splendor, and the being that came to them looked on in fascination.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="76c826d6-e7b6-41c7-a907-f613b6db673f">It appeared before them in a form that at once
        seemed familiar and majestic. It had a body like one of the catfolk—a wiry humanoid frame with a feline face,
        covered in tawny fur and possessed of a tail and limbs that ended in large paws. Beyond this familiar
        appearance, four broad, avian wings burst from this ten-foot-tall avatar’s back. It was surrounded by a golden
        light that seemed not to illuminate and saturate the world around it, but make it dimmer, ashy, and washed-out.
        Yet in this pallid light came a sharpness of perception, as if it were more real than the material world around
        it. The being appeared in the center of the Qoniira civilization, at the heart of the city of Niirdal-Poc, and
        it spoke a single phrase: “I am the Observer, and I give unto you the Gift.” Then, it vanished from sight.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4dd560bb-39a1-437f-aedd-5389b7bac574">All at once, the gray-gold light of the Observer
        surged throughout Qoniira. Though the citizens didn’t notice a difference at first, as time went by, many people
        began to manifest new forms of magic. This magic was not the controlled, scientific power of far-off arcanists
        in their flying cities, but chaotic, unpredictable, and miraculous.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3c0054df-3c36-4267-bc54-55f6689a2341">The once-sprawling civilization of Qoniira has
        shrunk over the centuries, but its people still draw upon the miracles of the Gift, and they are still watched
        from afar by the unseen Observer. This entity does not reign like a god, but watches impassively those whom it
        gave its unpredictable Gift. As those born in Niirdal-Poc under the auspices of the Observer travel north into
        the Republic of Tal’Dorei, or south into the oppressive realm of the Iron Authority, the gaze of the Observer is
        moved even farther afield—adding ever more variables to its mysterious experiment.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3714975a-3660-493d-aad1-94da7b544b98">In the Age of Arcanum, an archmage named Clemain
        Astural was the first to make contact with an otherworldly power of the Realms Beyond that called itself the
        Sightless. His legendary writings, the well-guarded Astural Scrolls (see <a
            href="/sources/tcsr/taldorei-gazetteer#TheAsturalScrolls"
            data-content-chunk-id="3a504fc4-ccff-464f-9e82-36b443be31f2">chapter 3</a>), say that the entity’s words of
        greeting to him were:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6cef390c-d9d8-44c1-bcd7-1d353ce79a17">“I am the Sightless. Will you not lend me your
        eyes?”</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="03f7ccc9-5426-4884-bba3-ff217017a127">The Astural Scrolls are vague about the powers of
        the Sightless—also sometimes called the Sightless One, the Borrower of Eyes, and the Lurker Behind One Thousand
        Eyes—but they are specific about several things. First, Astural willingly relinquished his own sight to the
        Sightless in exchange for his patron’s magical powers. He gained all the power he ever wanted, but Exandria was
        as alien to the Sightless as the Sightless was to Exandria. Forced to rely upon this entity’s horrific
        interpretations of the world around it, Astural quickly lost his grip on reality.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fe523ead-816b-4406-9ddc-5e09a988ec63">In time, Astural’s unchecked devastation was stopped
        by great heroes of the time, and his scrolls were confiscated. They exist in the Westhall Academy in Westruun
        (see <a href="/sources/tcsr/taldorei-gazetteer#WestruunPointsofInterest"
            data-content-chunk-id="6bb42359-fe55-434f-bd67-cb603a25e503">chapter 3</a>), and the second scroll, though
        secured in a deep vault, still holds the secrets of the ritual Astural used to contact the Sightless all those
        years ago.</p>

        deity with a wiry frame and fiery red hair have spread across Tal’Dorei and the neighboring continent of
        Wildemount. This fey trickster, though not a god, has certainly enjoyed pretending to be one to spread mirthful
        chaos across the world.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b9454ec5-65c0-4df6-84c2-7ccfce454725">Hundreds of isolated individuals across Tal’Dorei
        have heard the voice of the Traveler—or they’ve at least experienced one of his wily pranks. Within the past
        year, a convention of the Traveler’s devotees congregated on the tiny island of Rumblecusp in the Lucidian Ocean
        to exult his name and deeds.</p>
    <div class="flexible-double-column flex-bottom" data-content-chunk-id="58b13479-d1b4-4225-a2bc-e576944efb3e">

            <p data-content-chunk-id="b085591f-a0ba-44f3-bc19-6fa5ef75ee44">And then, suddenly, he vanished. The tales
                of a trickster deity that washed across Tal’Dorei trickled to a halt, and a few of his once-devoted
                worshipers hung up their cloaks in disappointment. Something happened on Rumblecusp that shook the faith
                of dozens of Traveler-worshipers. Some did not return at all.</p>
            <p data-content-chunk-id="2e192252-d66f-47a8-8982-4aade212a6fd">But amazingly, even though the divine
                narrative of the Traveler has been abandoned by all, the Traveler’s devoted have only grown in number
                and gleeful impishness. The current story is remarkably close to the truth: that the Traveler is a
                mighty lord of the fey. This archfey, known as Artagan to a select few, despises the relentless pressure
                of celebrity godhood, and just wants to bring joy and freedom from responsibility to all. He still has
                plenty to learn about mortals, and about when a bit of good, harmless fun becomes not-so-harmless after
                all.</p>

        Vesh. Long has she stalked the shadows of far-off Issylra, amassing secretive orgies of people of all genders
        and ancestries. These grand events have a membership that numbers in the hundreds, all of whom are bound to
        utmost secrecy, and are thrown in obscure retreats that are hidden in cities and towns across the continent.
        Little do the foolish pleasure-seekers in attendance know that the siren’s great fetes of debauchery can end
        with only two left alive: Vesh and her new mate, who will go on to form a mystical blood-bond.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="92c68ff1-90c5-4357-9967-ad53bf318d21">“Beware the Bloody Siren,” sob those few who have
        escaped her orgy of blood, but their warnings have only fueled her legend. In Tal’Dorei, where Vesh’s presence
        is known only as a legend of a foreign land, her name is most often invoked by youths who want to impress their
        peers.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="50d0a203-71f2-4e5f-a559-6d44f7e20c9d">But who can say what would happen if an attractive
        and foolish mortal called too fervently or too frequently to the Bloody Siren? Perhaps she would appear, baring
        her subtly radiant gray skin, stroking her flowing violet hair, and gazing invitingly at the fool with her blank

            it is their seclusion that grants them the ability to lend their powers to others, while they await the day

        maintain control in a land beset by chaos and danger, each faction seeks to drive and manipulate the social and
        political direction of Tal’Dorei. The alliances and tensions that can arise between the following societies can
        guide your adventurers’ destiny across the spectrum of heroism and villainy.</p>

            data-content-chunk-id="bd62f3e1-ddab-4591-935e-652a3a7b479e"></a>Tal’Dorei Council</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="39ac44ae-5c5e-4c27-b1cd-35ee6eebd549">When the new reign of Tal’Dorei was established
        three centuries ago, Zan Tal’Dorei deposed a brutal tyrant. Though she was beloved by the people, she did not
        wish to be given unchecked or uncounseled rule over the realm. Nevertheless, her inner circle obeyed the will of
        the people and crowned her Sovereign of Tal’Dorei. She took to her new role well and swiftly expanded her
        council by appointing some of her trusted allies—and even some dissenting voices—to form an assembly of
        scholars, generals, and philosophers to govern at her side. This Council of Tal’Dorei worked alongside their
        sovereign to rebuild the realm following the end of Drassig’s line, and were instrumental in the following
        prosperity of the nascent Tal’Dorei Empire.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f1601d6a-2bd1-482f-8965-1ca8ab0bcb22">Twenty-six years ago, Sovereign Uriel Tal’Dorei II,
        the latest and last of the Tal’Dorei line, publicly ended the monarchy and passed power over to the council,
        formally divesting his line of power. Tragically, this ceremony was interrupted by the arrival of the four
        ancient dragons known as the Chroma Conclave. The dragons destroyed the city of Emon, and the man who had until
        moments ago been sovereign was one of the first casualties. Uriel Tal’Dorei is survived by his wife Salda, and
        three children—Odessa, Illiya, and Gren—who have used their family's still considerable wealth and power to
        become well-known public figures in Emon. Odessa herself won a seat on the council in a landslide victory.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="136453ef-1de2-477c-9d68-76abbf9bf606">In the generation since the fall of Emon, the
        council has risen to the challenge of rebuilding and governing their new republic. This state’s power is highly
        decentralized; each individual city-state in Tal’Dorei largely acts according to its own interests, with the
        council in place to ensure that pursuing those interests benefits the common good. Some critics of the republic
        say that the Tal’Dorei Council is little more than a glorified city council for Emon, though it is just as often
        praised for governing lightly as a rule, and for using the spy network helmed by the council’s Master of Law to
        root out corruption as needed.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8da6d2d0-d970-4753-99d3-6105cec6beaa">In addition to the historical Six Masters whose
        positions have existed on the Tal’Dorei Council since Zan’s time, a variable number of delegates also cast votes
        in matters of state. Each settlement in Tal’Dorei whose population numbers at least five thousand is offered the
        option to elect delegates to the council if they wish to engage in national politics. The settlement is
        permitted one delegate per five thousand people, and the means of their election is left to the settlement’s
        local government. Additionally, any settlement with a population of over twenty thousand can appoint an
        ambassador to Emon; these ambassadors also sit on the council and have voting power. Once in Emon, each
        township’s delegation is expected to negotiate with one another and find agreement. If an accord can’t be
        reached, they must go through the slow process of drafting proposals to be voted on by seated members of the
        council.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="327d2101-5dce-459e-8173-f8c876123f85">Though Kraghammer and Syngorn remain sovereign
        city-states, the invasion of the Chroma Conclave convinced lawmakers that even tighter alliances between the
        peoples of Tal’Dorei were necessary. One ambassador each from both Kraghammer and Syngorn now also holds a seat
        with voting power on the council. Each city-state has likewise sent a delegation to Emon to vouch for their
        interests.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TalDoreiCouncilGoals"
        data-content-chunk-id="e37a153f-69d6-4afd-9a3e-e141d8d8dbf3"><a href="#TalDoreiCouncilGoals"
            data-content-chunk-id="9de860ad-f08b-4624-8f14-bbebc90ef854"></a>Goals</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6337049a-aac8-437d-9125-c201ffc4bab9">Following Zan Tal’Dorei’s coronation, the Tal’Dorei
        Council existed to aid and inform the sovereign on how best to execute their duties. The council has evolved to
        manage the affairs of the city of Emon and provide a private forum for delegates from across the land to shape
        the future of Tal’Dorei. The council is made up of six masters, whose roles have existed since the time of Zan
        Tal’Dorei, and a variable number of ambassadors from all city-states across the continent who wish to
        participate in the coalition of power that is the Republic of Tal’Dorei.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d87021be-1d2f-4847-aa89-38fe31f13b59">The Six Masters are elected by a popular vote of all
        city-states who have sent an ambassador to the council. These masters are each beholden to a domain of
        responsibility, and they either inherit the existing infrastructure of civil servants, or restructure with the
        approval of the rest of the council. The domains are divided as such: Development, Arcana, Law, Commerce,
        Information, and Defense. Additionally, the first business of the council upon delivering or receiving a
        declaration of war is to elect a Seventh Master: the Master of War, who is appointed to the council by a vote of
        all sitting masters, ambassadors, and delegates. The council members are responsible for these domains
        throughout the city of Emon and work closely with community leaders in other cities to maintain order.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fe1cd8a9-fdb6-417c-8cf8-38347c5be9b0"><strong>The Master of Development</strong> works
        with the masonry and carpentry guilds to oversee all major infrastructure projects within Emon, as well as
        allocating resources to projects needed in settlements that have a delegation in the council. In the past two
        decades, the current Master of Development has added an unprecedented eight Lieutenant Masters of Development to
        his staff to serve the reconstruction needs of each city in the republic.</p>

    </figure>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a616b4a7-fc39-4bbd-862c-3c33165b5384"><strong>The Master of Arcana</strong> keeps vigil
        over the lawful use of magics within Tal’Dorei, informs the council on matters beyond the mundane, and
        occasionally works with the Alabaster Lyceum’s Headmaster. This councilmember is currently embroiled in debates
        over the danger that the League of Miracles poses to organizations like the Arcana Pansophical.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9109b93f-4360-4b22-a2f9-965bcd3c5bee"><strong>The Master of Law</strong> enforces all of
        Tal’Dorei’s written laws from within the Watchful Hall, and serves as high judge on legal matters that affect
        the fate of the entire republic. All lesser courts answer to their authority.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="95b4af12-6d41-4e0a-856f-93482c293f65"><strong>The Master of Commerce</strong> works with
        all major merchant guilds and trading networks within Emon and beyond. They are to maintain healthy trade at
        home and abroad, especially between squabbling delegates, and establish the government’s annual budget.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d925037d-60aa-4fc8-a0ca-0c71a2a6aefc"><strong>The Master of Information</strong> manages
        foreign diplomacy, and also serves as the head of a network of spies that, these days, is supplemented by the
        skilled eyes of the Clasp. Their work as spymaster and chief diplomat seeks to root out threats to the republic
        from within and without.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ce8d49c7-d7b3-4b75-87f5-189e1ce9a863"><strong>The Master of Defense</strong> is head of
        the Emon Guard, High Commander of Fort Daxio, and manages the allocation of federal resources to city guard
        groups throughout Tal’Dorei. They work closely with the Master of Law to mobilize armed troops throughout the
        country if supernatural or nonmilitary threats arise during peacetime.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1b8e649a-e635-4b9e-94e4-1049765d3327"><strong>The Master of War</strong> is a temporary
        position only instated during times of open or impending warfare. As Tal’Dorei has only a small standing army,
        this newly appointed master then assembles a military from city guards and town militias across the nation,
        mobilizing the elite warriors of Fort Daxio as needed. When peace is declared, the position is dissolved until
        it is called for again.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6d7b9b0e-92f1-4cb2-82e0-c60bc8e60fb3">The council maintains free travel, free trade, and
        free communication between its constituent settlements, and between the republic and its allies—both on
        Tal’Dorei and abroad. The incursion of the Chroma Conclave has united the oft-feuding city-states of Syngorn and
        Kraghammer like never before, and all of Tal’Dorei now enjoys free trade and open borders between even its most
        remote enclaves. Thanks to the actions of Vox Machina, the previously solitary city-state of Whitestone has
        joined the republic, to the benefit of both.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1d2e3cf9-6122-410f-b911-0e7992fc6555">The Clasp was once considered a serious threat to
        the council’s rule, but times have changed. These days, Clasp Spirelings in Emon frequently make public
        appearances before the council on behalf of their own organization and their often unscrupulous business
        partners. This is to say nothing of the Clasp’s deep involvement in the Master of Information’s spy ring.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="03ebc1ea-15ac-410e-b37d-b26f2f196fae">The Tal’Dorei Council has comfortable trade and
        diplomatic agreements between the realm of Othanzia in Issylra and the loosely federated cities of the Clovis
        Concord in Wildemount. The recent conclusion of a bloody war between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty
        in Wildemount has given the Tal’Dorei Council cause to send ambassadors to both nations to establish embassies,
        in hopes of creating an historic arrangement with all of the sovereign nations of that oft-maligned continent.
        On the continent of Marquet to the southwest, the great city of Ank’Harel has been friendly and open when it
        comes to trade and commerce, but has shown no interest in any political relationships beyond that.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7d913c6b-211e-4eaf-9940-1700b2732573">Stern, honorable, and quick to anger, Tofor is proud
        to serve on the council. After losing many friends (and one of her own arms) in the struggles against the Chroma
        Conclave, she took the vulnerability of the city to heart, swearing never to allow such a thing to happen again.
        She is a beloved hero of the war against the Chroma Conclave and has served on the council since before the
        death of the Last Sovereign. Most folk in Emon suspect she’ll win reelection until the day she dies.</p>

        campaigned for the Master of Information’s seat, its current holder was Seeker Assum Emring, a loyal servant of
        her father’s. He bowed out of the race, and his blithe quote made headlines in Emon: “I taught her everything
        she knows.” She won in a landslide. Odessa wields the dual blades of Assum’s spy network and the mercenary
        agents of the Clasp with practiced finesse. Nevertheless, her name and the legacy of her father's martyrdom
        weigh heavily upon her. As Seeker, Odessa is calm, methodical, and laconic, but she carries a dignified sorrow.

        Arcana since before the Chroma Conclave’s attack, and is held in the esteem of Tal’Dorei’s people—mages and
        common folk alike. As a member of the Arcana Pansophical, she is also increasingly worried as more and more of
        Tal’Dorei’s politicians fall in debt to the League of Miracles. After decades of investigating supernatural
        abnormalities herself, age has finally forced her to limit her adventuresome excursions. She now is one of the
        council’s foremost employers of adventurers.</p>

        the Herd of Storms some twenty years ago, he found that he preferred the beauty of stone towers to towering
        pines. He also possessed a remarkable gift of mathematical acuity, and used his skills to set Westruun—and
        eventually all of Tal’Dorei—on the path of reconstruction. Edelbern is also idealistic to a fault, and has, in
        his dedication to restoration, been manipulated into handing numerous lucrative contracts to the League of

        the Ashari on the national stage. She spends most of her time in Zephrah, with her people—including her father,
        Korrin, and her newly returned mother, Vilya—but she can and will arrive in Emon at the drop of a hat, if Vex

    <p data-content-chunk-id="839dd01d-7270-45fa-8410-38528750ec0b">All of Tal’Dorei’s greatest mages fought at the
        Battle of the Umbra Hills. They saw the incursion of demons and devils firsthand, and were rightly terrified
        that the spawn of the Betrayer Gods could ever return to the world. It was clear that the Divergence had not
        wholly prevented supernatural evil from infringing upon the world, and that the mages of Exandria must prevent
        future “surprises” of this nature. The mistakes of the Age of Arcanum must never be repeated. In light of this,
        Yurek Windkeeper, high enchanter of Syngorn and a well-respected arcanist, reached out to the realm’s most
        trusted and capable mages, and together they formed a private society called the Arcana Pansophical.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f8c7fba8-80d8-49c8-9a6c-05b1d31b3679">The chief priority of this fellowship of powerful
        arcane specialists is to maintain the Truth of Magic, a strict code enacted to never again allow the rampant
        misuse of magic seen in the Age of Arcanum. General members are referred to as Guides, while the higher circle
        of members who deal in judgment and oversight are called Makers. At least one member is established at each
        place of arcane learning.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fb229586-c0e9-4f0b-ac76-b2ba955ffbd4">Membership is largely kept secret unless out of
        necessity, though the existence of the order is relatively common knowledge. Anyone found to be practicing magic
        is logged and routinely checked up on, as misuse of magic is grounds for arrest, judgment by the Makers, and
        punishment outside of the local law. Even so, the reach and sight of the Arcana Pansophical are not without
        limits, and many dark and terrible dealings manage to escape their notice.</p>
    <aside class="text--tcsr-sidebar" id="TheTruthofMagic">
        <p>The Truth of Magic</p>
        <p>The Pansophical’s myriad rules on the use and misuse of magic are innumerable—detailed at length in centuries
            of amendments made to the full text of the Truth of Magic. Though the Truth’s bizarre intricacies are left
            up to the GM, the Truth’s preamble establishes three unbreakable edicts:</p>
        <p><em>“In the Eternal interest of the Preservation of Harmony within the realm of Exandria, we the Arcana
                Pansophical establish the Truth of Magic, and three Edicts from which none shall stray. Those Arcanists
                found in gross violation of the Truth will be punished by the full extent of this Order—outside of any
                local law.</em></p>
        <p><em>Though the school of Necromancy shall be restricted to none, in the interest of magical study and
                Understanding, the animation of the dead is a Violation of the Truth.</em></p>
        <p><em>The Arcane is a tool to be wielded for the good of the People. To use its Power in the pursuit of wanton
                Destruction or unjust Murder is a Violation of the Truth.</em></p>
        <p><em>In addition, though the Jurisdiction of the Pansophical supersedes the power of local laws, a mage who
                willfully breaks the laws of the land is in Violation of the Truth.”</em></p>

        allies, as the roots of the society began within Syngorn itself. The people of Kraghammer are suspicious of the
        Pansophical’s legalistic Truth of Magic, and they fear that its members hold more loyalty to the Pansophical
        than to their homeland.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="27974d49-98f9-4369-8bb7-885951e7c611">Recently, a group of profit-driven arcanists
        splintered from the Arcana Pansophical to form the self-styled League of Miracles. Their involvement in the
        for-profit reconstruction of Tal’Dorei has made them popular among mages who see the Pansophical as a stodgy,
        elitist institution. The Pansophical, however, sees the League of Miracles as a distasteful upstart that will
        soon buckle under its own ambition.</p>

        churning chaos of the elements. This elemental power is invisible to most, but in some places, the veil between
        this world and the Elemental Planes grows thin—and sometimes is torn entirely asunder. These places where the
        Elemental Planes bleed into the world are called rifts, and they first appeared on a long-ago Celestial Solstice
        when the planes aligned. That day, elemental rifts of untold proportions burst open across Exandria. Wildfires,
        tsunamis, hurricanes, and earthquakes ravaged the lands, and the people of the world struggled to combat the
        elemental beings that poured forth from the rifts. The tide of rampaging elementals was eventually stemmed, but
        the world was gripped by fear—what would happen on the next solstice?</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dd4eee5f-c07c-4a25-a909-c47515c06e81">In the wake of the planar disturbance, a society of
        druids called the Ashari made a covenant to divide and form four separate orders to seal and watch over the
        sources of these unleashed energies. Most of the lesser rifts that opened in that time have been healed, but one
        rift to each of the four Elemental Planes remains in Exandria. The four orders of the Ashari settled near these
        rifts, watching over them and soothing them when they grow volatile. Of these orders, two are in Tal’Dorei,
        where they watch over the rift of earth and the rift of air. A dozen generations later, the Ashari still hold
        watch over these tumultuous locations.</p>

        marine life that surrounds their rift, and their actions always prioritize the health of Exandria’s waters.
        Zephrah’s culture values the freedom of the open sky, and balances their sense of duty with a free-spirited
        sense of play. Finally, the society of Terrah is rooted in planning for the future, and fixing what is broken

        lengths to maintain contact with their kin. Each order is led by a single elemental master, a title that is
        passed on by blood or honor for generations. In every new generation that comes of age, the young leader-to-be
        must embark upon an Aramente. This “noble odyssey” sends them across the world to meet with the other Ashari
        leaders and train until they have earned both the respect and an understanding of their hosts.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="92f11a2f-df05-4d3a-8a98-8f3b2aa83d30">Upon returning, they ascend to the head of their
        order, while the elder retires. This journey often takes years, and should one such Ashari not return within a
        reasonable period of time, a next-of-kin or a suitable elemental adept is chosen to take up the Aramente.</p>

        relationships between the orders, though inner conflict occasionally arises within them. Beyond this, much of
        life within the Ashari is hidden from outsiders’ prying eyes. In recent years, however, Keyleth of the Zephrah
        has taken steps to unite the Ashari with the rest of the people of Tal’Dorei. She has gone so far as to become
        an ambassador for the Ashari people on the Tal’Dorei Council. Part of this work has been expanding the crisis
        orbs system, which the Ashari used to contact their distant kin in times of peril, to connect cities across
        Tal’Dorei in the event of another crisis on the level of the Chroma Conclave.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="56baa425-5ead-46fe-b708-cdc9785958b7">The Ashari of Terrah nurture a seed of disrespect
        and mistrust for Kraghammer, whose miners constantly disregard their warnings against reckless mining. This
        arrogance caused countless deaths in the most recent eruption of the Terrah Rift—and led to the collapse of an
        entire mountain.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="38e0bf7f-c8fb-4cbf-91c7-78cad219ad69">Each Ashari culture has its own favored deities.
        Many Ashari of Pyrah venerate the Dawnfather, for his flames give life to Exandria. Many in Vesrah worship the
        Moonweaver, for her work controls the tides. In Zephrah, the faith of the Wildmother is predominant, for her
        freedom is like that of the wind. And the people of Terrah hold the All-Hammer in great respect for his
        association with creation and the earth. There are many Ashari, as well, who prefer to revere the elements
        themselves, forgoing the worship of gods.</p>

        and well-guarded locations around Tal’Dorei (and sometimes other realms) to establish their semiannual event. A
        combatant or team is required to have a known and cleared sponsor or manager to enter the event. There are two
        tiers of bouts; one tier has teams of six battling via single elimination until a victor is declared. The other
        features single combatants fighting one-on-one, single-elimination, until a victor is declared. Killing your

        the venue would find itself swiftly strangled by the long arm of the law. As such, magical protections and
        sentinels are placed throughout the event to prevent any unapproved entry, or to wipe the memory of those that

        brave humans led the survivors to safety after the wreck. They took refuge in a valley within the Alabaster
        Sierras, and there they discovered the holy Sun Tree, a radiant tree blessed by the Dawnfather. A community grew
        around the Sun Tree, and the respected and beloved de Rolos were asked by their shipwrecked allies to be the

        for many generations, secluded from the rest of Tal’Dorei and Wildemount. This serenity was destroyed when Lord
        Sylas and Lady Delilah Briarwood arrived in Whitestone and murdered most of the de Rolo family. Lady Delilah, a
        necromancer of the Whispered One and a disgraced member of the Cerberus Assembly in Wildemount, and her husband,
        a power-hungry vampire, transformed the quiet city-state into a realm of death. They attempted to take control
        of all of Tal’Dorei by puppeteering the Last Sovereign, Uriel Tal’Dorei II, but were thwarted by Vox Machina.

        Nevertheless, much has changed. The surviving de Rolo siblings, Percival and Cassandra, reclaimed the city with
        the aid of Vox Machina. With the tyrants dethroned, Percival established a council titled the Chamber of

    <p data-content-chunk-id="27003f94-08f1-4b5a-9d00-70bfb5da6783">Hundreds of years ago, a fell power exerted its dark
        will over Wildemount, corrupting its outlying townships and spreading chaos among its people. Undeath washed
        over gravesites like a plague, shadowed beasts stalked the midnight woods, and the influence of fiends befouled
        even Wildemount’s purest souls.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4a6e1334-afdb-46a3-a88a-7cb0bde46527">In the eleventh hour, a priest of the Matron of
        Ravens named Trence Orman prayed for a way to protect his flock. The Matron’s inspiration came in the form of
        long-hidden knowledge: the secrets to blood magic. Taking his gifts, Trence trained his most trusted warriors in
        these techniques, giving a portion of their humanity in exchange for the power to defend their people. This
        marked the origin of the Claret Orders, and the first Blood Clerics, Blood Mages, and Blood Hunters.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ce35e541-f72e-4267-be55-927a9a9225d9">The Claret Orders work in relative secrecy, as the
        nature of their abilities is largely misunderstood, which often leads to persecution. Their numbers are small,
        as the price is great and the Orders only accept those who are strong of heart and have little to lose. Small
        sects of the Orders have begun work far enough West to wander the lands of Tal’Dorei in recent years, keeping
        out of the public eye and remaining vigilant to the signs of familiar darkness undermining the region.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9380e821-ad2b-48a5-85c6-9d31dabe4f93">Despite the Claret Orders’ best attempts at secrecy,
        the esoteric art of blood magic has escaped their clutches. Though rare, rogue blood mages and blood hunters
        have spread across both Wildemount and Tal’Dorei, unbound by the tenets and strictures of the Claret Orders.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="645b3cdb-4165-449c-b89e-0932ce056d68">The Creed of the Claret Orders asks that its
        followers commit their lives to the hunt of entities and creatures that threaten the sanctity of life and joy.
        While the sacrifice is great, the reward is the continued existence of purity and good in the world. The Orders
        strive to protect those who cannot protect themselves from the shadows, taking no credit for their services
        beyond the means to live and travel. Some have strayed, focusing on building a fortune for themselves, but
        should word of such intent make it back to the heads of the Orders, and their actions begin to threaten the
        innocents they’ve sworn to protect, they may find themselves among the hunted.</p>

        frequently seen in the field, working with various adventuring parties and his own blood hunters to wipe out
        monsters wherever they emerge. The combination of his relaxed personality and his aggressive strategy may seem a
        contradiction at first glance, but those who know him see the truth of the immense self-assurance that lets him

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e5b73221-939e-4ef0-83b2-8d570d1baaba">The Clasp is a well-established secret organization
        consisting of spies, thieves, fences, assassins, saboteurs, and smugglers. It was built upon the ruins of the
        Winksman Thieves’ Guild, an organization that flourished during the reign of Drassig, but crumbled under the
        rule of Zan Tal’Dorei. Based largely in Emon—and under it, via a network of subterranean tunnels—the Clasp also
        runs smaller outfits in Westruun, Stilben, and Kymal. Members are branded with the guild’s symbol on their
        mid-back, signifying allegiance and commitment. The Clasp operates like a business-minded family or mafia,
        celebrating loyalty and an ability to keep one’s word. A member pays their debts, keeps their promises, and
        always seeks opportunity for the betterment of the Clasp.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="06bd8a6e-f33e-4ed7-8379-5d0d5602cf64">Leaders of a Clasp sect bear the title of Spireling,
        and they oversee assigned elements of the organization’s functions. Spirelings hold equal power within a sect,
        and there is always an odd number acting within that location to break any disagreements over business ventures
        and actions.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheClaspGoals"
        data-content-chunk-id="42cb4d6e-cdda-4db1-8c94-5687914e6d9d"><a href="#TheClaspGoals"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="8e8a58e9-f88a-4142-8159-3e55def1c437">While most common folk assume that the Clasp is
        merely interested in profit at any cost (and that is a merit of the Clasp), they also wish to preserve the
        function and prosperity of civilization. It is commonly held that a thriving city is a profitable one, and an
        enemy of civilization is a foe of the Clasp. They largely consider themselves a necessary dark underbelly,
        willing to do the under-the-table deeds that more wealthy and powerful citizens cannot commit with their own
        hands. On the other hand, less scrupulous Spirelings also understand that discontent breeds profit, and have
        occasionally kindled the flames of unrest to keep things tense and profitable.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d767ca8f-6c46-4890-b653-cdd46dff0620">Were it not for the branch of the Clasp in Emon, the
        Chroma Conclave’s attack would likely have destroyed the city’s culture entirely. However, thanks to the Clasp’s
        role as a “shadow civilization,” the people of Emon were able to maintain their foothold at home, even under the
        watchful eye of Thordak the Cinder King.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="TheClaspRelationships"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="cdb7d8dc-e0eb-46f0-9347-4f6f7e2d9606">A generation ago, the Clasp was considered by most
        to be an uncouth cesspool of cutthroats and criminals. These days, thousands of people know the Clasp as the
        roguish heroes who saved their lives, or the lives of their parents, from the Chroma Conclave. Nowhere is this
        truer than in Emon, where its Spirelings make public appearances and even, on occasion, deal openly with the
        Tal’Dorei Council. Nevertheless, Clasp agents outside of Emon keep their wits about them, for most local
        governments still view them as underhanded scoundrels—and not without reason. Most guards and town militias will
        arrest known Clasp members on sight; however, most Clasp members know well enough to have a friend on the force
        that will help them escape.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5dc8a0ed-e96d-4b62-8885-b8806fa48f73">The Clasp frowns upon dogmatic religion or cultish
        behavior, as it has conflicted with the organization’s business in the past, and always ended messily.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="db5c950d-a4a7-4ca5-9c43-da54e0243411">Since the arrival of the Myriad within Tal’Dorei
        from Wildemount, the Clasp has been on extremely high alert, seeking information on them and any means of
        banishing this new competition. Gang warfare has broken out sporadically between the Clasp and the Myriad in
        cities from Stilben to Emon over the past twenty years, and though the rival organizations are currently at
        peace, everyone knows the whole thing is just one poached client away from reigniting.</p>

        and storytellers united to subvert his rule and inspire the people to rise against him. This band took the name
        “the Golden Grin” and traveled across the realm to offer escapism and entertainment, all while planting the

        ever-present, using song, comedy, and theatrics to inspire the people of Tal’Dorei to endure hardship and fight
        back against evil. These “Grinners” include among their ranks spiritual leaders, artists, musicians, innkeepers,
        and dozens of retired adventurers who still want to do good outside the public eye. Little is publicly known
        about the Golden Grin, other than myths and rumors, and the Grinners gladly perpetuate these tall tales.</p>

        enlighten and inspire, keeping ears and eyes out for the murmurs of tyranny and cruelty. The Grin’s core
        philosophy is that each and every person is capable of great things alone, and even greater things together.
        Rather than taking direct action themselves, most Grinners use songs and tales of great heroes to galvanize
        people to action.</p>

        members reveal their secret affiliation to outsiders unless circumstances are dire indeed. They use their
        covert, grassroots power to empower local freedom fighters and activists. Some Grinners do occasionally find
        their way into government, granting them a higher vantage point and platform to disseminate the ideals behind

        was carved out of the bedrock of the Cliffkeep Mountains in the years following the Divergence. It is the
        ancestral home of the native dwarves of Tal’Dorei, and the five major bloodlines that founded the city in ages
        past still rule to this day. The ruling families are Houses Greyspine, Zuurthom, Bronzegrip, Thunderbrand, and
        Glorendar. These Great Houses elect an official to the office of Ironkeeper every ten years to keep the
        alliances between houses just and healthy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a325b65b-324e-426e-a2d9-f40583849310">Though the culture of Kraghammer is highly
        traditional and as stoic as the stone it was carved from, it is not without unrest. It seems every dwarven
        generation has its own great social movement where disenfranchised workers or greedy, lesser noble houses
        attempt to unseat the ruling five. Yet for good or for ill, the Great Houses have time and time again shown that
        they can put aside their differences to preserve their mutual rulership.</p>

        as well as the Pools of Solace. House Zuurthom trains the chief architects of the city, and most masonry and
        building is organized through them. House Bronzegrip funds the smithing guilds and maintains the Bronzegrip
        Metalworks, Kraghammer’s largest blast furnace and ore refinery. House Thunderbrand prides itself on training

        a time when, “Kraghammer for the dwarves!” was a common cheer at the pubs. And when they said, “for the
        dwarves,” they meant just the dwarves born in Kraghammer. Times have changed. The prevailing opinion is that a
        unified Tal’Dorei is best for all. Those dwarves whose traditionalism is just a veil for bigotry have found that
        they aren’t welcome in Kraghammer—they’ve subsequently retreated to make their own isolated enclaves in the
        Cliffkeeps.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cb0d1805-020f-44a1-b422-8cbde5b86b15">The Houses of Kraghammer facilitate a healthy trade

        former glory in a matter of months.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3e66d961-bd2f-4358-b13c-4744f0b35b77">The people of Tal’Dorei adore the league. Their
        mighty spellwrought adranachs (a new creature described in <a
            href="/sources/tcsr/allies-and-adversaries-of-taldorei#Adranach"
            data-content-chunk-id="44633e0d-ed46-45a1-80ba-1d2961d49184">chapter 6</a>) can be seen lifting
        thousand-pound bricks of limestone high into the sky to rebuild walls, towers, and even castles in a matter of
        days. Many of the league’s spellwrights have become folk heroes and celebrities for their miraculous acts, which
        range from healing those maimed in the Conclave’s attack to transmuting raw timber, mud, and straw into
        full-fledged houses in minutes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2504f522-1380-4adc-b235-193b55f0be90">For most of Tal’Dorei’s elite, the League of
        Miracles is likewise a great ally. Trade and travel have resumed stronger than before, for the league has
        eagerly subcontracted their talented mages out as guards for caravans and persons of interest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="da828bcd-21b2-46e3-b04e-db352b21bf9d">Yet, not everyone sees the league as an ally. In the
        early aftermath of Thordak’s defeat, the new and untested Tal’Dorei Council put out thousands of bounties on
        reconstruction projects to get their towns and cities back on their feet, and local mayors and margraves across
        the nation agreed to these subsidies to reduce the cost of reconstruction for their already devastated populace.
        They expected Tal’Dorei’s rebirth to be a multigenerational undertaking—yet the League of Miracles snapped up
        these bounties like candy, and the league does not work their miracles cheaply. Bills for hundreds of thousands
        of gold pieces’ worth of bounties found their way to the desks of local leaders and to the Tal’Dorei Council by
        the end of the year. Such vast wealth for thirty years’ worth of rebuilding in three years’ time simply did not
        exist.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1c31b3cf-747b-4870-9f79-9775ce1ed57a">But this was all part of the Wonderworker’s plan,
        and their spellwrights executed it flawlessly. The league needs money to purchase their expensive spell
        components and to pay their talented mercenary membership, of course, but their true goal is the priceless
        currency of power, in the form of political favors from leaders ranging from small-town mayors, to city-ruling
        margraves, and even delegates to the Tal’Dorei Council. Rumors even swirl that one or more of the members of the
        council itself are in the league’s pocket.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="12457e91-d27b-4590-8cc1-78d7f131facb">The league’s members are delineated into a simple
        hierarchy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1a9bbfdd-0c1a-4fc1-89b1-2ca7f463fb34"><strong>Mercenary Mage.</strong> Spellcasters drawn
        from across Tal’Dorei form the backbone of the League of Miracles. The league works as an agency, handing
        mercenaries lucrative jobs, collecting the payment themselves, and paying out in a timely fashion—minus twenty
        percent. These mercenaries come from all walks of life. Some are aspiring adventurers seeking a less
        life-threatening first gig, while others are skilled arcanists with shady pasts, including Remnant cultists and
        double-dipping Myriad agents with a talent for magic.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6f514f4c-c6f8-41db-ad29-877fc095adac"><strong>Spellwright.</strong> The most talented (or
        best-connected) members of the league are awarded the title of spellwright. Only two dozen such masters of the
        arcane exist across Tal’Dorei. These spellwrights know the secrets of how to create adranachs, mighty constructs
        of magical energy that were used publicly to rebuild Tal’Dorei’s ravaged infrastructure—and are also used in
        secret as hunter-destroyers of the league’s enemies. These spellwrights sign a blood pact that connects their
        minds to the mysterious communications of the Wonderworker, which all spellwrights are blood-bound to interpret
        and enact.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d9f8e12d-d0e2-40ca-b633-a64067ff2bb3"><strong>Grand Thaumaturge.</strong> The official
        title of the league’s shadowy master is the Grand Thaumaturge, though most colloquially refer to them as the
        Wonderworker. None know their true identity, or their ultimate goal. The spellwrights understand that the Grand
        Thaumaturge has a master plan that must be followed. Only these spellwrights have the privilege of hearing their
        master's psychic messages. Over the years, they have interpreted them to mean that the League of Miracles must
        become the secret puppet-masters of all Tal’Dorei.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e86c413b-1ab8-4ddd-87c5-efd8bfbface2">The League of Miracles is comprised mostly of
        mercenary magi pulled from all corners of Tal’Dorei, with some even coming from abroad as news of the league’s
        reputation spreads across Exandria. For most of these arcanists, their goal is simple: to make money. The goals
        of the league’s spellwrights are more elaborate. They listen for the cryptic words of the mysterious Grand
        Thaumaturge and dedicate themselves to deciphering and enacting their grand design. The spellwrights’ current
        aim is one of total control—once all of Tal’Dorei’s social and political elite are in their pockets, they can
        shape the land as they see fit, all to the cheering adoration of the fawning people of Tal’Dorei.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="LeagueofMiraclesRelationships"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="76e05a57-3770-4728-a3b3-0a4beecd287c">The League of Miracles tries to keep cordial, if
        distant, relationships with every major power on Tal’Dorei. Their public image is shiny and unimpeachable. Many
        members of the Tal’Dorei Council are already in their pocket and cast votes that further the league’s
        self-interest. The Arcana Pansophical—especially Allura Vysoren, who also sits on the council—are deeply
        distrustful of this unregulated, uncommonly powerful organization.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1f0d4538-8df2-4144-81fb-fffa4b9cf58a">The League of Miracles has a tense relationship with
        the Chamber of Whitestone, as they have long sought access to the residuum unique to that territory. The
        spellwrights fear outright hostility with the legendary heroes of Vox Machina, and have supposedly abandoned
        their quest to mine Whitestone’s naturally occurring residuum.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="37a8dd93-784f-46dc-ad0a-5aaf61c7df58">As “no questions asked” employers of mages, the
        league is in the good graces of many less scrupulous arcane factions, including the Remnants. Necromancers,
        blood mages, Ruidus cultists, and other unsavory magi now exist under the league’s protection.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5b765644-a50b-4774-9e06-af123076b1a7">All spellwrights hear the authoritative—yet
        enigmatically distorted—voice of the Wonderworker. The Wonderworker has supposedly appeared in the flesh only
        three times throughout the league’s twenty-four-year history, as a humanoid draped in robes of starlight and
        wearing a mithral mask. In those moments, they have produced true miracles—raising a castle from the ground in a
        matter of seconds, halting the rampaging silver dragon Saldarthoryn in her tracks and healing her twisted mind,
        and stopping the Center Slab of Kraghammer from collapsing into the Pits in a catastrophic mining accident that
        would have cost countless lives. These legendary acts inspired utmost awe and faith in all who witnessed them,
        leading the spellwrights to create adranachs in the Wonderworker’s image and enact their cryptic will.</p>

        longs to reach the bottom of Shadebarrow, a mysterious crypt somewhere on the Dividing Plains. His obsession

        Honor Kinnabari has a lot to prove. She was granted a chance to prove her quality in the eyes of the
        Wonderworker when the league was contracted to rebuild the Market Ward of Westruun after it was devastated by a
        herd of magma landsharks that descended from the Cliffkeep Mountains. Her red eyes and sheet-white skin and
        horns complement a traditional red-and-white mage’s robe from the reclusive dwarven clans of the Alabaster
        Sierras. She is fully dedicated to the league, but she is as honorable as her name implies; her fellow
        spellwrights fear that she could turn traitor, should the unsavory truth of the league be laid plain before her.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ff402c7b-4c57-4129-ae6d-c7a7be355369">The Cobalt Reserve in Westruun is home to a monastic
        order so old, enduring, and tirelessly dedicated to the preservation of knowledge that most people in Tal’Dorei
        simply take it for granted. Just as birds have always flown and grass has always grown, the Library of the
        Cobalt Soul has always sent its agents across the world, taking minutes at public trials, archiving broadsheets,
        exploring ancient ruins, and copying scrolls. To all but the most dedicated scholars, the work of the Cobalt
        Soul seems like dreary, banal stuff.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="07419356-a087-49e3-8ccc-4884585fb1db">Nothing could be further from the truth. Beneath the
        veneer of being a dopey order of bookish monks, the Cobalt Soul is one of the most dogged espionage
        organizations in the world. The secret agents of the Cobalt Soul, its expositors, are spies who wield the truth
        as a weapon more potent than any blade. The Cobalt Soul was born in Wildemount, just after the end of the
        Calamity, when the Knowing Mentor was maimed by an evil god. Her most loyal followers went into hiding and vowed
        to continue her divine work in knowing all there is to be known—and most importantly, to use the truth as a holy
        weapon against lies and propaganda.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3cd30d6a-7a85-477a-a358-af0fcca472c8">Each archive of the Cobalt Soul has a common

    <p data-content-chunk-id="0072247d-674a-4857-aa40-a9998e986f78"><strong>Monk.</strong> The monks of the Cobalt Soul
        are their most visible members, for they travel the land in search of knowledge both modern and archaic. Not all
        monks are engaged in fieldwork, especially new recruits. Those who work entirely within an archive aid in the
        organization and preservation of information. Few know that these monks are dedicated to the Knowing Mentor; the
        common opinion in Tal’Dorei is that they are ascetics, obsessively dedicated to the chronicling of knowledge,
        not devotees of an obscure god.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="41d05e6e-493d-4491-a65b-587b0f9715f8"><strong>Expositor.</strong> Trained in the art of
        espionage, the expositors of the Cobalt Soul use their infiltration expertise to uncover the secrets of
        governments, world leaders, and obscure cults. In times of great crisis, undercover expositors have even incited
        revolutions by sharing the knowledge they discovered with people toiling under evil regimes. This true mission
        of the expositors is a secret even to low-ranking monks, who see them simply as well-trained field agents.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ea28b025-f590-43d1-816c-2db8ec55c3dd"><strong>Archivist.</strong> Though they are not
        involved in field work, archivists play the vital role of organizing the overwhelming flow of information that
        the monks and expositors return to their archive. They also train new monks and perform administrative tasks,
        like negotiating with sellers of artifacts and with government officials to ensure the stability of their
        archive.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1c55c322-c877-407e-935b-0f7036e9e6cd">The public mission statement of the Cobalt Soul is
        to archive knowledge for the betterment of all peoples of Exandria. The secret mission of the Cobalt Soul is to
        use their accumulated knowledge to root out tyranny and ensure the freedom of all people.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="22fa262d-b85d-4910-98b2-fbfafa5f9378">As instructed by their reclusive god, the Knowing
        Mentor, the Cobalt Soul in Tal’Dorei makes their archives available to everyone, so that knowledge can be used
        to improve and enrich the lives of all. Despite this, the curators of the Cobalt Reserve privately determine
        what knowledge is too volatile to be freely disseminated. Typically, this privileged information is magical in
        nature, but it also includes secrets recovered by expositors that must be strategically employed as a weapon
        against unjust leaders, cults, and power-hungry factions.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5238eb5a-26cf-4c48-86b7-d729e4e71513">The Cobalt Soul itself is not immune to corruption
        and complacency. Nowhere is this truer than in the Cobalt Soul’s birthplace of Wildemount, where it must work
        hand-in-hand with the authoritarian Dwendalian Empire. Its highest officials say that the Cobalt Soul has
        outlasted every tyrant on Exandria, and that they must be content with small acts of insurrection—subtly
        subverting propaganda and sharing the truth with any who will listen—while waiting for the right moment to
        strike a fatal blow. Nevertheless, this mantra of patience has caused some of its more radical members to
        abandon the order entirely. Typically, deserters of the Cobalt Soul are expositors, who see the ugliest side of
        the world firsthand again and again.</p>

        City of Vasselheim on Issylra, and the great city of Ank’Harel on Marquet. Each of these archives acts
        independently under the orders of their commanding High Curator, though they must ultimately answer to the joint

        Dwendalian Empire, the Cobalt Soul knows better than to think that means it is free of corruption. From the
        Cobalt Reserve, their archive in the city of Westruun, the Cobalt Soul keeps close tabs on members of the
        Tal’Dorei Council, the leaders of Syngorn and Kraghammer, and other powerful individuals across the land.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4a140908-5193-4159-8955-7d67185ee9ce">The Cobalt Soul actively opposes the
        Remnants—followers of the Whispered One, a tyrannical god of secrets who is diametrically opposed to the goals
        of the Knowing Mentor. They are also concerned by the meteoric rise of a guild of arcanists called the League of
        Miracles, whose political maneuverings have made puppets of dozens of delegates to the Tal’Dorei Council and
        political leaders across the land. This worry has only deepened as rumors reach them of the league filling their

        Cobalt Soul is a high-cheekboned, bald woman who would appear fully human if not for her slitted, silver eyes
        and the silver scales that run across her head, neck, and upper arms. She is regarded as one of the fastest
        minds in Tal’Dorei, for she has the rare gift of perfect recall. Monks tremble when her clear, unpretentious
        voice rings through an archive chamber, for Greisalda remembers acts of justice and personal slights with equal
        intensity, making her a powerful ally and a furious enemy. She is concerned that corruption is spreading
        throughout the Tal’Dorei Council.</p>

        pronouns interchangeably. Though she's fresh blood to the expositors of the Cobalt Reserve, she has already
        taken advantage of her license to kill on her espionage missions. They are slim for an orc, but still more
        muscular than many of their human colleagues. Their assignments take them across Tal’Dorei in search of
        political corruption. She is currently stationed in Emon to observe a person of interest on the Tal’Dorei
        Council, where she alternates between lurking on rooftops and striding through ballrooms in fine suits.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6f1172d5-683f-40f8-b431-25fe642402ab">Wildemount’s greatest organized crime ring is now
        becoming known throughout Tal’Dorei, but it came from humble beginnings. The Myriad began in the Dwendalian city
        of Yrrosa, as a small shipping company specializing in exotic goods and services, exploiting and selling
        curiosities from the distant continents of Othanzia and Ank’Harel. Over time, as legal trading became more
        difficult, the Myriad’s illegal occupations became their best business. Through years establishing underworld
        contacts and tactical blackmail, the Myriad evolved into a powerful, well-veiled criminal faction. Over the past
        two decades, the Myriad’s aspirations have spread beyond Wildemount, and they are now deeply entrenched in
        Tal’Dorei’s criminal underworld.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="575635f4-a40e-4683-b643-b903b8e02c22">Known for displays of opulence and social grace,
        this misdirection enables the Myriad to seduce and control the lives and wills of whomever is deemed valuable to
        their plans. Dozens of truly amoral cutthroats and thieves noticed when the Clasp began to work hand-in-hand
        with the Tal’Dorei Council. They felt the dagger of accountability pressed against their backs, and broke with
        their former guild. Now, the Myriad has filled the vacuum of truly lawless criminality that the Clasp left in
        its wake.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e0bb3547-5448-458a-a302-c806ca34b3a3">The Myriad operates as a loose network of gangs
        whose bosses run their own localized sects, without direct oversight from the mysterious heads of the society.
        Tithes and information are expected to be delivered to the leadership at a steady rate from each satellite of
        the organization, and should the success slow, threats of enslavement or destruction soon follow.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7288ffc1-6c59-42f9-9339-84e860cfafb4">The Myriad seeks wealth in hideous excess. The means
        are unimportant, as long as they’re lucrative. No trade is too abhorrent, from bloody theft to kidnapping and
        slavery. And though they lack the political capital to bribe and puppeteer politicians the way they did in
        Wildemount, the Myriad are confident that they can get even the supposedly noble Tal’Dorei Council in their
        pocket.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6b1d98d4-1837-4d9d-975b-1bb644d94a12">Most fronts for the Myriad are businesses that
        publicly deal in antiquities and exotic textiles. Behind these masks is a ruthlessly efficient black market of
        slaves, magical beasts, weapons, and illicit substances. Overt violence tends to draw unwanted attention, and
        the Myriad avoid it when possible, preferring to discredit, blackmail, or frame those who cross them. Should
        that fail, however, kidnapping or assassination can be a quick and traceless final alternative.</p>

        underworld of Tal’Dorei, the Myriad is well-versed in the covert art of making money by any means necessary. The
        Clasp is well aware of their presence in the broadest sense, and the two thieves’ guilds have spilled blood in
        the streets of every city in Tal’Dorei at some point in the past twenty years. These days, the bloodshed has
        subsided into a cold war of espionage and counterespionage, as each organization tries to sabotage the other.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3c8e41ed-0a38-4e7f-817d-76577a40bd9b">The Myriad has only been routed from cities a number
        of times—they no longer have any presence in Whitestone or Syngorn—and each time, it has been by a concentrated
        citizens’ uprising. In both instances, when they sought the source, Myriad leaders were furious to discover an
        empty safe house containing only a single gold coin, marked by a grinning face: the calling card of the Golden
        Grin. Even across the Lucidian Ocean, the old enmity between the Myriad and the Golden Grin remains today.</p>

        power known as the Whispered One attempted to ascend to godhood by conducting the Ritual of Seeding from high
        atop the citadel of Thar Ampala within the Plane of Shadow. The Whispered One surrounded himself with a cult of
        fanatical mages and empowered murderers to protect him during his apotheosis. Despite these protections, he
        failed. His cult, however, survived, and helped him return to power centuries later, after the defeat of the
        Chroma Conclave. He succeeded in his bid for godhood, but was kept from utterly dominating the Material Plane at
        the last second by Vox Machina, who banished him beyond the Divine Gate, where he was shackled by all the same
        limitations as the other gods.</p>

        Their fanatical ranks, bolstered by his true apotheosis, now seethe in secret, convinced that there is a way to
        grant their god the ultimate power he sought. Many of them have wormed their way into positions of power within
        Tal’Dorei’s political institutions, churches, arcane organizations, and criminal outfits. Many more have joined
        up with the dubiously moral, profit-driven arcanists of the League of Miracles. They exist in shadows, lurking,
        waiting, longing for a new dark prophet to lead them to glory.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c17fdcac-2809-4955-b2fc-482631369843">The elven city-state of Syngorn was established in
        the Verdant Expanse by the sorceress Yenlara, the wood elves’ first leader after the Divergence. Today, the
        physical and cultural wellbeing of Syngorn is safeguarded by the three offices of elders called Wardens, united
        by the High Warden. Their primary duty is to protect the city and the surrounding lands from intrusion.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="37c01916-11cb-47f3-93df-d3d412a9f20b">The Wardens believe that preserving the ancient
        culture of Syngorn is of utmost importance. Even as their fate grows ever more closely tied to the fate of all
        Tal’Dorei, the traditions that make Syngorn unique must be conserved. The three offices of the Wardens are the
        Verdant Lord, the Voice of Memory, and the Guildrunner. The office of Verdant Lord commands Syngorn’s formidable
        military, which is maintained and scattered throughout the Verdant Expanse, ready to be called to Syngorn’s
        defense at a moment’s notice.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ee1cab06-cd36-4ef6-92d4-e4838f8be2ac">As preservers of culture, the Wardens also encourage
        public respect for the arts, including the art of magic. It’s not uncommon for a Syngornian to rise in social
        status after being publicly praised by a warden for a masterful artistic creation or performance.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ef5fcaa9-2fb1-4e45-a9ca-e532c29ac3b2">Syngorn has long been an isolationist society. As a
        mostly elven enclave, they have often been criticized as xenophobic, or even racist, toward outsiders. There is
        truth to these claims. Nevertheless, the rise and fall of the Chroma Conclave has goaded even some of Syngorn’s
        most conservative voices into strengthening the bonds of trade, travel, and kinship with the other free peoples
        of Tal’Dorei. Even the people of Kraghammer, who many elves still remember siding with the tyrant Drassig in
        centuries past, have been welcomed as friends and allies for the loyalty and courage they displayed in the
        battle against Thordak.</p>

        <p>I’ve wandered over many a shore and plain in my journeys, and my mind still finds itself drawn back to
            Tal’Dorei. Ain’t no place in this world more vibrant; the land feels young. Unscarred. Mind you, that sort
            of calm causes my old bones to itch, too. Folk in that land are kind and honest, and its vistas are second
            to none, yet…well, I’ll just say that cities are cities, and the wilds are the wilds. Tal’Dorei’s got plenty
            of both. Keep a sword or a wand with you wherever you go, adventurer.</p>

        the lands of Tal’Dorei, the adventures to be found therein, and the many centers of civilization to be found
        across its vast wilds. Consider this chapter a compilation of a wide variety of assorted notes, research, and
        scattered publications of historians of the Library of the Cobalt Soul and the Alabaster Lyceum.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7136e3d8-9306-4a6d-9dcf-946773663ac5">Boundless possibilities await eager adventurers of
        all kinds who explore Tal’Dorei, from the vast fields of the Dividing Plains to the treacherous crags of
        Tal’Dorei’s many mountains, from the storm-wracked Lucidian Coast to the immemorial depths of the Rifenmist
        Jungle. Countless nomadic civilizations exist within these realms of magic and monsters, as do dozens of tiny
        villages, thriving towns, and bustling cities. The people of Tal’Dorei do what they can to survive, and share
        the tales of treasures and adventure with any who will listen. Consider this gazetteer a compilation of tales
        and fragmented histories, passed down from bards and scholars. Your campaign can follow its descriptions to the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="599eb6d3-c56a-44b0-8eb6-2fb24c31870b">Every permanent settlement in Tal’Dorei has a few
        basic statistics that impart a top-level impression of that place. This includes what type of settlement it
        is—typically a village, town, or city—its population, and its rough demographics. Don’t feel restricted by these
        demographics if you want your character to come from a specific location but you don’t see their race listed
        there. People of all races can be found in just about every community in Tal’Dorei, and your character can come
        from anywhere.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8adc25d7-0deb-40aa-80cf-18df454265f3">Additionally, cities and large towns often have a
        number of small rural communities outside their fortified walls and population center. The population numbers of
        these larger settlements include the people in the outlying areas. On the other hand, the official populations
        of a village or other small settlement just includes the people living in the village itself.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f1cd1a8c-df5d-4fd4-bbc1-804008aded16">In fact, though there are a few villages and small
        settlements listed in this gazetteer, Tal’Dorei is home to hundreds, if not thousands, of tiny settlements too
        small to detail or place on the map. The Game Master can make up any number of villages or other communities
        wherever they wish in Tal’Dorei without changing any of the lore presented in this gazetteer. And of course, the
        GM can also create large settlements unique to their version of Tal’Dorei—the only difference is that they
        should be prepared to think about how their version of Tal’Dorei is different, now that they’ve added another
        hub of population, trade, politics, and culture.</p>

        of Drynna. The community thrives on the bountiful wildlife around the lake, and the Drynna fisherfolk are
        responsible for most of eastern Tal’Dorei’s freshwater fish supply. The social guidance of the city revolves
        around the Sunrise Lodge (or simply “the Lodge”), a membership of community leaders who meet to discuss and vote
        on important social and legal matters. The Lodge has also sent a variety of increasingly frustrated petitions to
        the Tal’Dorei Council, since their community’s small size means they have traditionally lacked a delegate of
        their own on the council. However, the recent surge in prospectors has increased their population enough for a
        member of the Lodge to attend council sessions, and the Lodge is doing everything it can to make sure the boom

        tupelo trees reaching up from muddy waters that range, in places, from one to ten feet deep—or more. The hot,

        countless bandits and petty thieves. As such, caravans and messengers must remain on constant alert for the
        possibility of an ambush. With such dangers lurking in the swamp, travel to and from Stilben is rarely made

        five or more feet above the muck upon stilt-like roots, like freshwater mangroves. Their sparse placement gives
        them the appearance of a village of scattered huts. The fresh water mingles with salt here, leaving only adapted
        vegetation. The smell of moss and rot fills the air, while strange, feral creatures leap from tree to tree, or
        patiently wait from within their dome-like tree-root dens to snatch wary travelers. An organized group of gnoll
        marauders called the Moonsteeth keep their cavern hideout here, striking out at easy targets outside of Drynna

    <p data-content-chunk-id="092e2cdb-814a-47ac-8efa-61c578330c05">Stilben stinks to high heaven. Most sailors who pass
        through it—be they honest traders of the Clovis Concord in Wildemount or pirates seeking their next
        conquest—call this dismal burgh the Rotted Lot. The stink and the crime that run through this town make the name
        an apt one, but things aren’t all bad in Stilben. The largest port on this coast of Tal’Dorei, Stilben is the
        focal point of international trade with Wildemount. Even though Stilben’s permanent population is a scant ten
        thousand, its more transient population of sailors who stay for a few days or weeks at a time is just as large,
        and fully triples Stilben’s total population in the summer months.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="64785ce4-12c1-44a7-8520-21266bae34ee">Predictably, the vast majority of Stilben’s business
        caters to folk who won’t stay for long. There are brothels aplenty, at least one inn and one tavern each on
        every street, and countless other comforts for the weary traveler. The town is nestled in the sticky depths of
        the K’Tawl Swamp, and its putrescent stink mingles with the humidity and the ever-present buzz of insects to
        produce an air of misery around Stilben’s outer districts. Pushed out of Stilben’s cozy, cosmopolitan heart, its
        poor and disenfranchised citizens—derisively called muckdwellers by the town’s bigshots—struggle to eke out a
        living in the K’Tawl’s murky waters.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3040108b-9366-49f6-8aa2-4c9aeeb28cf1">Central Stilben houses most of its businesses,
        residences, and attractions. Those living in Stilben’s heart like to present a clean, “civilized” view of their
        town, maintaining it as a thriving commercial hub. The cross-continental Silvercut Roadway leads from Stilben
        all the way to Emon, and its robust trade of rare goods, textiles, and spices has given rise to a formidable
        merchant ruling class. Though the aging Margrave Wendle Truss is Stilben’s ruler in name, it is the guilds that
        hold true power. Their vast wealth and sizeable “protection” force have impelled the bombastic-yet-ineffectual
        margrave to acquiesce to the guilds’ will in order to maintain peace, as well as to preserve his own station
        within the city.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="49817c01-41c8-41a4-bcc0-94f08985cef8">Order is kept by the Waterwatch, Stilben’s official
        constabulary, but corruption is common within their ranks. The past few decades have been hard for the Clasp in
        Stilben. Though the local Spireling has kept a tight grip on the margrave and the Waterwatch, the Myriad has
        used bribes, intimidation, and every dirty trick in the book to winnow away the Clasp’s power. Now, Stilben is
        little more than a crucible for the power struggle between the two criminal organizations.</p>
    <aside class="text--tcsr-sidebar" id="OriginsofVoxMachina">
        <p>Origins of Vox Machina</p>
        <p>The citizens of Stilben do not know that some of Exandria’s greatest heroes, Vox Machina, first met in their
            humble city and went on their first adventure in the muck of the K’Tawl Swamp. Back then, even the exalted
            Vox Machina were just two-copper adventurers, quickly forgotten by Stilben’s haughty elite. One dwarf named
            Heinrich Runescribe, a junior member of the Alabaster Lyceum’s revered Lorekeeper Society, practically
            worships the heroes that defeated the Chroma Conclave, and has made it his mission to record all of their
            travels. He has found a wealth of evidence that the heroes of Vox Machina first gathered in Stilben under
            inauspicious circumstances and were dragged into an unexpected battle against the Myriad.</p>

        of Tal’Dorei, like great spires of rock reaching for the sky. The tall, thin mountains burst so aggressively
        from the surrounding fields and swampland that even travelers from distant lands recognize them as a landmark of
        eastern Tal’Dorei. They are a welcome sight for any ship’s crew making their way to shore. The mountain valleys
        recess into marshy gorges that house all manner of creatures migrating from the K’Tawl. Reclusive hill giants
        and stone giants also make their homes in the marshy valleys. As the mountains rise higher, strong winds blow
        across the battered rock, leaving strangely smooth peaks that harbor griffon lairs, harpy dens, and convocations
        of giant eagles hunting the lower lands.</p>

        close friendship shared between Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest, and the genius inventor Percival de Rolo of
        Whitestone has led to a number of modern technologies being adopted in Zephrah. Windmills now dot the
        cliffsides, milling grain purchased from farms on the Dividing Plains. Keyleth continues to work with Percival
        to improve the lives of her people through technology and innovation. The operation of two of these mills is
        also kept private from the rest of Zephrah, and they’re used to refine whitestone into residuum for the

        to make further diplomatic ties between her people and the rest of Tal’Dorei. These attempts at breaking down
        the traditional isolationism of the Ashari have been met with skepticism from within, slowing the process to a
        crawl. Allowing any outsiders into Zephrah at all has been seen as a huge step. Beyond this, Keyleth has pushed
        for greater economic and political involvement, so that the needs of Zephrah can be heard in the Tal’Dorei
        Council. Resistance toward political integration has mostly been internal within the Ashari, but Keyleth
        considers any progress at all a good start.</p>

        past Voices of the Tempest have trained martial forces and druidic warriors to defend their home against the
        monsters of the Summit Peaks. As Keyleth attempts to build bonds between her people and the rest of Tal’Dorei,
        she has expanded the training of new skydancers and created a unit of druidic warriors capable of responding to
        any emergency across Tal’Dorei. If a threat like the Chroma Conclave were to rise again in Tal’Dorei, the
        skydancers of Zephrah would be there to help save the nation’s people.</p>

        the waters of the Lucidian Ocean break between the rocky shores of Tal’Dorei, a lush treeline fills the valleys
        between the chalk-white bluffs of the Alabaster Sierras. This gelid northern territory has for decades been
        beyond the reach of the Tal’Dorei Council, and fallen under the rule of the Chamber of Whitestone. However, over
        twenty years ago, thousands of Emonian refugees fled to Whitestone to ride out the devastation of the Chroma
        Conclave. These refugees included the bereaved family of the Last Sovereign. Since those dark days, the Chamber
        of Whitestone has enjoyed a close relationship with the Tal’Dorei Council. Lady Vex’ahlia de Rolo, a member of
        the Chamber of Whitestone, also sits on the Tal’Dorei Council itself, further strengthening the bonds of unity
        between this once-isolated land and the rest of the realm.</p>

        swarming with harpies, cold-adapted wyverns, and other hungry monstrosities. Beneath the peaks, the valley opens
        into the thickly wooded pine forest known as the Parchwood. This dense, temperate rainforest is beautiful and

        the Parchwood Timberland, gathering rain and snow runoff from the nearby mountains, they nearly all empty into
        the massive Mooren River Run. A powerful river that tears through the heavy forests of the Alabaster Sierras,
        the Mooren River Run flows fiercely southward, out of the woods and into Mooren Lake, near the Lucidian Coast.
        Freshwater fish are in ready supply along the river’s path, and Whitestone maintains a well-guarded dock for

        encompass the northeast edge of Tal’Dorei end at the towering seaside cliffs called the Salted Bluffs. These
        cliffs mark the coastal boundary of the Alabaster Sierras and are home to seemingly infinite cliffside caverns
        that overlook the ocean, sometimes hundreds of feet up. The waters along the base are rocky and dangerous to
        traverse by boat, and only the most skilled of captains even consider sailing through these treacherous waters.
        These factors make the Salted Bluffs an ideal hideaway for pirates, who have taken to these bluffs to hide away
        their riches or build a base of operations.</p>

        the remains of these harpies’ brutal kills, for they sweep up unsuspecting creatures and dash them against the

        grown into a robust, if isolated, city. The sights of the city range from the gothic majesty of Castle
        Whitestone to the radiant glory of the Sun Tree, and from the quaint townhouses of the city center to the humble
        homesteads of its outlying townships. Because Whitestone is limited in fertile farmland, locally grown produce
        is scarce, leading to the necessity to develop a good trade relationship with the rural communities of the Turst
        Fields.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3d6224b9-71ac-4dfe-b718-4a0125c7d2d1">Though the region’s scarcity of vital resources made
        for a harrowing first few years, the de Rolo family stumbled upon a miraculous mineral they called whitestone.
        This geological marvel both gave their city its name and quickly became its most important and most sought-after
        export. Before long, the de Rolos’ sale of whitestone allowed them to quickly amass a significant fortune and
        construct a princely keep within their city.</p>

        Most prominent these days, however, is a rudimentary electric light grid. Using acid pits in the relatively
        unexplored caverns beneath the city as a sort of battery, six dozen electric lamps throughout the city are given

        leaders of the Whispered One, were ousted from Whitestone over twenty years ago. Though they are no more, the
        evil they committed still lingers. The nearly six years they ruled Whitestone sapped life and hope from its
        people. Though homes have been rebuilt and the Briarwoods’ undead monstrosities have been eradicated, the trauma
        of the vampires’ reign of terror will linger for generations. Some people of Whitestone were so deeply affected
        that they turned to necromancy and vampirism themselves, and have fled into the Alabaster Sierras to learn the
        secrets of the Briarwoods’ foul magic—and to emulate their takeover of Whitestone. The enigmatic Grey Hunters,
        the secretive elite warriors of the Chamber of Whitestone, have worked tirelessly to pull out the Remnants by
        their roots, but permanently eliminating them seems an impossible task.</p>

        clash between the stalwart Dawnfather and the engine of callous destruction known as the Chained Oblivion. This
        battle came to a dramatic and explosive conclusion in the Alabaster Sierras. The unstable arcane forces
        unleashed in their battle created the valley that now houses the Parchwood, thrusting the surrounding mountains
        upward and infusing them with incredible amounts of residuum—the physical residue of arcane energy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="de8bf6b4-2442-4a46-9a87-0f5afeb73a58">The sheer amount of leftover arcane power within the
        whitestone of the mountains is incredibly receptive to enchantment. Magic items that incorporate at least an
        ounce of whitestone into their construction require only one-quarter the creation time of other magic items.
        Some alchemists in Emon have discovered that dissolving whitestone with specific acids can leave behind pure
        residuum, which can substitute for expensive spell components when such materials are not readily available.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7bcacddf-b2ec-40ee-8ef6-6ba78600a965">If a spell has a component cost that consumes the
        component, its caster can substitute the required component for an amount of residuum of an equal value. One
        pound of pure residuum is worth approximately 500 gp in most markets, though it becomes extremely expensive and
        difficult to find outside of Emon or the city of Whitestone itself.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3567624d-d77a-46c8-8b2c-85572bac02ac">Residuum can also be heated and blown into glass,
        forming a shimmering, greenish surface. Residuum slates or orbs can be used in stationary enchanting tables.
        Archmages willing to pay exorbitant rates—easily 20,000 gp or more—may acquire an enchanting slate that can be
        used to expedite the creation of all magic items. Using such a table allows anyone crafting a magic item to do
        so in one-quarter of the usual time.</p>

        obelisk wards. Hastily constructed during the time of the Chroma Conclave to avoid detection by their roving
        wyvern armies, five whitestone obelisks mark the perimeter of the city and castle grounds. These obelisks form a
        dome of illusory magic when powered by an arcane spellcaster, hiding the city under the guise of continued,
        undeveloped Parchwood, and shielding everything within from arcane detection. The obelisks haven’t been used
        since the attack of the Chroma Conclave and are beginning to be covered by graffiti and overgrowth.</p>

        incomplete unless all five obelisks are powered simultaneously. This siphoning is a taxing experience, and for

        Whitestone rely upon the Pale Guard to resolve any (admittedly rare) crimes and disturbances of the peace. The
        Pale Guard are a force of sentinels who answer to the Pale Lord of Wardship. Since criminal activity is fairly
        low these days, most of the Pale Guard are given other civic tasks to help Whitestone’s people.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f59c1019-ceae-49d0-8880-4afff607f25a">These tasks range from helping newcomers navigate
        the city streets to escorting visiting dignitaries to diplomatic functions. While performing a duty that

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2a9baa90-609c-4737-bffb-5d7aa6cc98da"><strong><em>Whitestone Rifle Corps.</em></strong>
        The defense of the city from outside invaders and threats from the darkened boughs of the Parchwood Timberlands
        is attended to by the Whitestone Rifle Corps, who are trained in the deadly long-range rifles created by
        Percival de Rolo. They are only permitted to wield the weapons while patrolling the city walls or castle
        battlements—except in times of emergency, or when granted special permission by the Chamber of Whitestone.</p>

        force called the Grey Hunters makes up the most secret of Whitestone’s defenses. Trained in the arts of
        hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship, espionage, and etiquette, the Hunters have a reach that extends across all
        Tal’Dorei, but they exist only as a rumor in the eyes of the public—and they answer only to the Grand Mistress
        of the Grey Hunt.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f57bb4c9-0168-46b4-b22e-1b4044320c91">The firearms wielded by members of the Grey Hunters
        are custom-made and named by their owner. Their rifles’ stocks are made of Parchwood inlaid with whitestone and
        enchanted against wear with residuum. The lock mechanism bears the Whitestone crest. Hunters are trained to
        meticulously care for their weapons, and many learn enough to make personal modifications, or even build one
        from scratch. A Hunter must never lose their weapon. If they cannot prove it was destroyed, they aren’t
        permitted to return to Whitestone until it is recovered—although they may request help from other Hunters in
        retrieving it. If they come across a weapon of Whitestone in the wrong hands, they are honor-bound to return it
        to the city.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d35b509f-b0a9-43f4-87c3-ba01a15ef4bf">This covert organization is headquartered in the
        ruins of a failed city expansion deep beneath the eastern Parchwood. This base is used for training, for weapon
        storage, and as a repository for their mission logs, so that a complete record of every Hunter and their weapons
        can forever be kept. As with many of his inventions, Percival de Rolo fears that the Hunters are a powerful—and
        even necessary—tool in the hands of the righteous, but a terrible weapon, should they be perverted to suit evil.

        more concerned with personal duty, small comforts, and the creation of new art and technologies than with the
        pursuit of easy profit. The Myriad has tried several times to gain a foothold in Whitestone, but they’ve been
        foiled time and again by the consistent counterespionage efforts of the Grey Hunters. Nevertheless, they
        continue to try, and their presence has inspired petty theft throughout the city.</p>

        Whitestone prefer to address crime at the source—poverty and suffering—rather than punishing criminals.
        Likewise, most petty criminals are seen in Whitestone as worthy of rehabilitation, not punishment.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b7ebb8e4-f5a0-444a-86a6-962e2da72185">Whitestone was originally constructed around the
        newly discovered Sun Tree, and has slowly expanded outward ever since. Castle Whitestone was built atop a small
        hill overlooking the city to the north. Over the years, farmers and homesteaders have cleared more and more of
        the Parchwood to the south of the city. Even today, as Whitestone’s population has swelled, the Parchwood
        remains defiant, dark, and threatening. It is in little danger of being overrun by mortals, and its eerie
        creatures strike back whenever the people of Whitestone press against it too greedily. The Grey Hunt was formed
        to keep the deadly denizens of the woods at bay, though now their purview reaches farther than just the
        Parchwood.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fee2949a-e09c-42b7-b7d8-b1f94162b8a5">Dawnfather Square is the central district of
        Whitestone. The square surrounds a small hill, and the golden glow of the revered Sun Tree that sits atop it can
        be seen throughout the city. Many of Whitestone’s original settlers already worshiped the Dawnfather, and the
        discovery of the Sun Tree was seen as a sign. Today, Dawnfather Square is filled with quaint, bustling shops and
        small townhomes.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="43983dc0-754e-4364-9151-1d50cfbb1120"><strong><em>1. Castle Whitestone.</em></strong> This
        gothic fortress was erected not long after the city’s founding, and has long been the seat of power for the
        sovereign de Rolo family. Percival and Cassandra de Rolo have opted to end their absolute power over the city by
        sharing it with the Chamber of Whitestone—on which they each hold a seat.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="14655602-73aa-48d5-a90b-31f3bd785500">The castle’s interior has a certain stark regality
        to it. While the hunting trophies and tapestries that decorate its walls are clear signs of the de Rolos’
        ancestral wealth, there is a solemn, beautiful hollowness to its corridors. Cassandra de Rolo says that
        something of her brother’s melancholy seeped into its whitestone walls, and the castle will always carry the
        weight of his sorrow—and of the Briarwoods’ evil.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bb39c58f-756b-4c7c-8bde-b908edb36dc4">The castle itself is generally off-limits to the
        public, but its grounds are more accessible. The Whitestone Rifle Corps train in a firing yard behind the
        castle, and many people of the town flock to watch—only to be politely rebuffed by the Pale Guard. Open to all,
        however, are the gardens—except for Percival de Rolo’s latest project, the Widow’s Garden. This walled garden
        was named for Lady Melanie de Rolo, who originally cultivated its deadly blooms to slowly murder her husband.
        The Widow’s Garden used to be a macabre menagerie of poisonous plants from across Wildemount. It fell fallow
        during the reign of the Briarwoods, but Percival has resurrected it with Keyleth’s horticultural aid.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a5b722d-6844-4b64-ac3d-7233e41665d8"><strong><em>2. The Sun Tree.</em></strong> After the
        Chained Oblivion nearly consumed the Knowing Mistress during the Calamity, a furious and vengeful Dawnfather
        pursued the fleeing Oblivion across the mountaintops and over the sea, to the peak of Gatshadow, where the mad
        god was eventually defeated and imprisoned once again. The land wept with pain as the two wrathful gods laid
        waste to Tal’Dorei.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="77663b7d-5d67-4244-8407-9539f1787dd4">After his victory, the Dawnfather returned to
        Whitestone and placed a single seed into the ground where the Knowing Mentor was nearly destroyed. The god wept,
        and from the seed grew a symbol of protection—a tree with radiant orange foliage and a golden glow that
        surrounds it when in bloom. The Sun Tree became a beacon of light within the dark forest that enclosed it. While
        the extent of the tree’s divine power remains a mystery, it stands as an emblem of unity and hope, both within
        the city of Whitestone, and upon its official crest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3cb7c996-d630-4a04-bc8b-1e24bb7424e5"><strong><em>3. Temples and the
                Greyfield.</em></strong> A patch of land outside the eastern wall of the city sees generations of
        Whitestone’s dead interred within a graveyard known as the Greyfield. Custody of this cemetery is shared by the
        Temple of the Dawn and the Altar of the Raven, sanctuaries maintained by the clergy of the Dawnfather and the
        Matron of Ravens, respectively. Since most people in Whitestone consider the Dawnfather their patron deity, the
        Temple of the Dawn is the largest of these shrines. The smaller Altar of the Raven is right next door, and most
        well-to-do devotees of the Dawnfather look upon the dour, dark-robed clerics of the Matron of Ravens with a
        mixture of awe and unease.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9e1e8a21-3de6-4bd4-a62a-f6884da2a19d">The temples’ grounds also house a number of
        mausoleums containing the remains of long-forgotten noble families, though the last generation of lost de Rolos
        were not recovered following the rule of the Briarwoods. Traces of the Briarwoods’ defiling magic still linger
        within the Greyfield, and the Pale Guard are posted here at night to quell the restless dead that occasionally
        claw their way to the surface.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c3308d52-5230-4330-82d8-a8a0a02e62ff"><strong><em>4. The Heart of
                Whitestone.</em></strong> A majestic clock tower called the Heart of Whitestone stands proud and tall
        over the city. It is Percival de Rolo’s favorite invention, one he dedicated much of the past two decades to
        constructing to honor his loyal friends, their sacrifices, and the trials they endured together. The area around
        it is known as Forlington Square, named for one of the first families to settle in Whitestone. This bustling
        courtyard is lined with shops and street performers that attract locals and tourists alike.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6ba5811a-f6c8-420b-af79-b707a4969d42">The clock tower’s construction was completed five
        years ago, but Percival continues to tinker with it, adding both functionality and self-indulgent
        embellishments. The tower has individual movements for most major holidays (see <a
            href="/sources/tcsr/welcome-to-taldorei#Calendar"
            data-content-chunk-id="ef7ab7c5-0979-4807-b050-7a731a613604">chapter 1</a>), including depictions of famous
        moments and persons from Whitestone history. The clock tracks the movements of the moons, stars, and spheres.
        The mechanics of the clock are only truly understood by Percy himself, though small clubs of scholars and
        esotericists take great joy in unraveling its mysteries. Further, it has long been rumored that Percival
        secreted a vault within the tower’s innards to safeguard his most dangerous inventions.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="acb805b4-888a-4a57-8a99-282a8964c5db"><strong><em>5. Snowdrop Memorial
                Trail.</em></strong> In the east of the city, winding between the Grey Hunt Estate and the temple to the
        Matron of Ravens, is a private trail through the woods. Only locals know of this trail, and even among them, few
        know that the path was made by Keyleth of Zephrah on one of her many visits to the city. Countless snowdrop
        flowers line this secluded track, and they are tended to by Lady Vex’ahlia when she has time away from her
        duties to both the Chamber of Whitestone and the Tal’Dorei Council. The significance of this memorial garden
        isn’t listed on any plaque, but most in Whitestone have an inkling that it’s dedicated to a beloved champion of
        the god of death.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c5184e44-0f25-4df6-8884-d2774e3288dc"><strong><em>6. Grey Hunt Manor.</em></strong> The
        estate of the Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt is rarely used by the current holder of that title these days, as
        all her nights not spent away on Tal’Dorei Council business are passed with her family in Castle Whitestone.
        Members of the Grey Hunt still use it as a formal meeting place—though meetings of true import take place in
        their secret lair in the eastern ruins (area 11).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="606932b7-2c05-4b2d-9998-84fa8a7e2d14"><strong><em>7. House of the Lawbearer.</em></strong>
        This temple is both a place of worship and a stately courthouse. All who enter are sworn to tell the truth by
        the vigilant clerics of the Lawbearer—for the entire building is under the protection of a vast, permanent <a

            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2305-tooltip">zone of truth</a> spell. This protection is fallible, but it sends
        a clear message to all who enter.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c0b1c087-2f25-4593-b049-d5d38658c7d5"><strong><em>8. Slayer’s Cake Bakery.</em></strong>
        Founded by members of Vox Machina, the Slayer’s Cake has quickly become one of the most beloved bakeries in
        Tal’Dorei, and it has a satellite shop in Emon. It ships bread and pastries to Nicodranas in Wildemount via
        teleportation circle weekly, and the bakery’s owners are thinking of expanding.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="48eeb4b4-8ce8-4fed-a423-0d867a4f4e78"><strong><em>9. Lord Trinket’s Public
                Park.</em></strong> A section of the Parchwood to the west of the city was cleared in the aftermath of
        the Whispered One’s defeat in anticipation of a major expansion. However, more of the Emonian refugees left the
        city than anticipated, leaving these plans untenable, but the forest already cleared. At the request of
        Vex’ahlia, Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt, the space was transformed into a public park that she uses to play
        with her now-venerable brown bear, Trinket—and a lifelike marble statue of that same bear, clad in magnificent
        armor, stands in its center.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0a6ee489-9698-4171-bbfd-747d70f53f1a">Portions of this city expansion did eventually come
        to pass, and now several manor houses have been built near the edge of the park to house visiting dignitaries.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ec41f5ec-dc0a-47a8-864c-ced625b3885d"><strong><em>10. Galdric’s Gate.</em></strong> The
        new, northwestern gate of Whitestone opens onto the Timberland Trail, which grants hunters easy access to the
        city when they return from expeditions into the Parchwood.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ab69e321-ae03-4859-a656-e758bb14c3cc"><strong><em>11. Eastern Ruins.</em></strong>
        Whitestone’s first expansion in recent times happened just after the fall of the Whispered One, to accommodate
        the city’s large refugee population. However, a mix of social unrest and monstrous incursions from the Parchwood
        stymied the project, and the bones of the expansion were left to fall into ruin. No attempt has been made to
        reclaim the ruins, but the Grey Hunt have made a secret base of operations in the basement of a magnificent
        temple not yet dedicated to any god.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c3b4c5ca-1f6b-401e-858a-310bda5151ef"><strong><em>12. Hearth of the
                Everlight.</em></strong> Established by Pike Trickfoot in the years following Vox Machina’s victory over
        the Whispered One, this humble temple stands as a bastion of welcoming light and shelter to those seeking solace
        and direction. Within its stone walls, the faithful of the Everlight study her philosophy of compassion and
        fierce protection. Still, the temple is far from tranquil—the congregation also hosts monthly fêtes and revels
        as a part of their worship in the image of their exuberant founder.</p>

        Percival de Rolo doesn’t usually involve outsiders in his creative process. However, when his youngest daughter
        Gwendolyn takes one of his latest creations and disappears into the dungeons of Castle Whitestone, he has no

        Mountains in the southwest, the Cliffkeeps in the north, and the Summit Peaks in the south, contains miles and
        miles of rolling hills, tallgrass prairies, sky-blue rivers, and fertile farmlands. Within these plains, the
        hardworking people of the realm tend to their fields and businesses while adventurers and village militias
        battle back the wild beasts and wandering bandits of the region. The safest way to avoid being beset by monsters
        is to travel the Silvercut Roadway, which slices through the endless plains, connects the coasts, and shepherds
        caravans between them. Of course, the roads are coursing with highwaymen and bandits, so which route is safer is
        entirely up to the traveler to decide.</p>

        cities and nomadic clans alike. All people of the plains fear the Ravagers, and even the smallest villages train
        people old enough to hold a spear how to defend their homes. Beyond the grassy plains, owlbears and other
        monstrosities stalk the forests and foothills that dot the plains and border it on many sides. Packs of centaurs

    <p data-content-chunk-id="dce4db50-0117-4f1a-930a-dcb46189afc6">Surrounding the base of the southernmost stretch of
        the Cliffkeep Mountains is the Bramblewood, a dark and tangled forest named for its jagged, thorny-barked trees.
        The Bramblewood’s impenetrable canopy and thick, gnarled roots give it an ominous appearance, but its eerie
        boughs are populated with countless deadly beasts. It’s a grim warning to all who would dare approach Gatshadow,
        the mountain of despair: come no closer if you value your life.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c9e6f1ac-c521-42f9-a28e-8d88e1348960">Yet despite this, without the abundant game and
        plentiful timber of the Bramblewood, the nearby city of Westruun would likely not exist. A trade city with
        nothing to trade rarely lasts long, and the Bramblewood ensures that local carpenters, artisans, and tradesfolk
        always have plentiful resources. For those brave enough to venture into the Bramblewood, a pair of well-tread
        paths have resisted its overgrowth; one leads to the iron-rich Murdoon Mines at the base of the Cliffkeeps,

        the Rimelord, the elemental behemoth that nearly toppled the fledgling realm of Tal’Dorei just two years after
        its founding. It was here that the combined forces of Kraghammer, Syngorn, Tal’Dorei, and the Ashari hurled the
        Rimelord back into the Elemental Plane of Ice and brought an end to the Icelost Years. The massive lake left
        behind by Errevon’s melted citadel is now the largest source of fresh water in central Tal’Dorei.</p>

        and fishing communities that trade with Kymal and Westruun. The great lake is fed by three rivers that give life
        to the Dividing Plains: the Byhills, the Tundrun, and the Wildpath. After especially hard winters, these rivers
        run hard and fast, and the overflows spill into the Foramere Waterway, which flows into Owlset Bay, near
        Stilben.</p>

        Kraghammer were bitter rivals, the elves and dwarves here took no part in their homelands’ hatred.</p>

        Inverspire can be found by explorers savvy enough to navigate the labyrinthine tunnels—and that it’s surely
        filled with monsters and vast riches. Legends aside, countless abandoned mineshafts do snake through the stone
        like the veins of a dead titan. When the winds grow strong, you can sometimes hear a terrible, growling moan
        from the air pressing through the empty channels. People from Kymal rarely venture close enough to the mountains
        to hear the noise, but sometimes on clear, silent nights, the monstrous sound echoes through Kymal’s brightly

        Among scattered relics and the rubble of forgotten villages lie references to the Founding: the first age of the

        the grumbling ghost of a gold-rush boomtown. These days, it’s a haven for gamblers and criminals: a city of gold
        built atop a mountain of mud.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="be47c9df-8b91-45ec-ae13-932ad0588fdd">Over two centuries before, the discovery of rich
        gold veins within the Ironseat Ridge sent a rush of eager folk to its base. Kymal began life as their base camp,
        and over the next century it grew into a lively, booming city. Gold and minerals came out of Kymal, and all the
        pleasures of home followed. Music, theater, sex, food, liquor, drugs, trinkets—if you could want it, you could
        find it in Kymal. Anything you could spend money on was there, and people spent money like the world was ending.
        The rich binged anything they could get their hands on to pretend they were important, and poor folk indulged in
        whatever comfort they could find from their wretched existence in a town where money meant everything.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f0fc4eb7-8c18-4c13-9a29-7dd4897f17f3">In time, of course, the veins ran dry. Ten years
        after Kymal boomed into being, it went bust. The miners packed up and left. Not many of them had struck it rich;
        in fact, most folk were worse off than they had been before. In the intervening centuries, Kymal has gone
        through too many cycles of boom and bust to count. New veins of gold or mithral or adamantine have been found in
        the mountains, and people rush in to claim it. Or a cunning entrepreneur comes up with a scheme to put Kymal on
        the map—and it works, for a few years, before the con runs its course and people are right back to where they
        were before.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6fd14c82-a063-4f72-b950-8e263a97181f">Most folk here make a modest living in rural
        villages surrounding Kymal’s city center, or trawling the nearby Foramere Basin for fish, and are trying to
        build interest as a trade center like Westruun, though without much luck. Kymal’s most recent change of fortune,
        however, has yet to run dry. Some seventy years ago, an entrepreneur from Ank’Harel named Calis Krishtan opened
        a small casino called “The Maiden’s Wish.” It started something of a gold rush of its own, one that continues to
        this day.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="07ffd477-cc08-443b-a03b-c52b3967d9db">The city has grown over the past seventy years,
        becoming a hub of entertainment and games of chance in Tal’Dorei. So great was Calis’s revival of Kymal that the
        Tal’Dorei Council appointed his son (and heir to the Maiden’s Wish), Jaktur Krishtan, the Margrave of Kymal.</p>

        gambling empire. Krishtan has recently made headlines across Tal’Dorei by relinquishing his position as
        margrave. It’s an open secret that Jaktur Krishtan has never had a head for governance, simply enjoying the
        lavish, gold-plated life his casinos’ profits bring him. He could easily have allowed his advisors to continue
        running Kymal for him while he continued to throw magnificent galas, make nightly appearances at the Maiden’s
        Wish, and put his stamp of approval on glitzy parades down the city’s main street.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d24b0595-3451-464e-a966-49d44bb9e55c">Investigators have flocked to Kymal to uncover the
        truth of Margrave Krishtan’s sudden change of heart. All suspect that the truth is a salacious secret, one which
        would shake Kymal to its foundations. Krishtan himself seems unperturbed. He continues to live large as he
        always has, his detractors don’t disparage him any more than usual, and the public that loves him hasn’t changed
        their tune.</p>

        after all, the title that she should have had for the past thirty years, and she hopes that the Tal’Dorei

        casinos owned by ex-Margrave Krishtan, or working as bodyguards for Kymal’s politicians and wealthy cardsharps.

        there is still scum beneath its glitzy and imperfect façade. Small-time cutpurses lurk in the shadows, waiting
        to make off with the small fortunes won by the casinos’ luckiest patrons. The war between the Clasp and the
        Myriad smolders within Kymal as well, but Acting Margrave Almiji has played her cards carefully and
        intelligently. Through an intricate web of bribes, promises, and threats, she has managed to suppress even the
        faintest trace of gang violence within her city.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="75ef3770-f706-41b0-8c70-15d755cc1c49">Of course, crime still occurs in Kymal. It’s just
        not public and bloody. The Clasp and Myriad both own casinos in town—named the Wishing Well and the Dragon’s
        Hoard, respectively. Not many know of these casinos’ less-than-savory proprietorship. Even those who do fail to
        realize just how deeply rigged its tables are—or how many pickpockets and swindlers hide in plain sight in their
        gilded halls.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="682425be-ac04-46ea-9593-59d37365d600">Moreover, the Clasp and Myriad alike have immense
        illicit drug operations within Kymal. The Public Defense is technically bound to arrest anyone caught selling or
        possessing these substances, but the bulk of these arrests fall on small-time crooks working for these criminal
        organizations, almost never the high-ranking members.</p>

        <p>Illegal Drugs</p>
        <p>If you want to include drugs in your RPG campaign, consider discussing with your group in a session zero (see
            <a href="/sources/tcsr/character-options#SessionZero">chapter 4</a>) to make sure everyone is okay to
            encounter them in-game. If any player says no or doesn’t enthusiastically buy-in, err on the side of caution
            and leave the drugs out. It’s also important to check in with your group whenever drug use comes into play,
            just to make sure everyone is still having fun. Additionally, while use of drugs might be fine with
            everyone, also make sure you know how comfortable your players are with explicit descriptions of needles,
            issues of addiction, and any other topics related to drug use.</p>
        <p>The Clasp and the Myriad deal in a variety of illegal, mind-altering drugs, and Kymal is the epicenter of
            both organizations’ clientele. Though the creation and possession of these drugs is strictly prohibited in
            most of Tal’Dorei, they have found popularity within all levels of society, particularly in Kymal, where the
            Public Defense frequently looks the other way for a small bribe.</p>

            Oracles used it to enhance their divinations, for it helped them leave their physical bodies behind and
            become closer to gods and spirits. Drinking tea brewed from the root causes intense hallucinations, which

        <p><strong><em>Suude.</em></strong> Exandria’s most infamous drug, suude is a glittering powder made from
            residuum (see <a href="#AnEnchantingExport">above</a>). It was first developed by power-hungry archmages in
            the Age of Arcanum as an incense burned to enhance focus during ritual spellcasting. The secret to its
            refinement has been lost and rediscovered a variety of times since the Calamity, and many different types of
            suude have been developed by arcanists in search of ever-greater power. It has terrible addictive and
            mentally degenerative properties, even when used sparingly.</p>
        <p>After burning suude within a vessel and inhaling its fumes as an action, you take 22 (4d10) psychic damage
            and must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you become <a

            as an action. During this time, the world seems to move in slow motion, and your vision is twisted in
            kaleidoscopic colors—yet your focus is never distorted. If one dose of suude, or more, is used within 1 hour
            of another, the DC of the Constitution saving throw is increased by 5 per additional dose. If you fail this
            save by 10 or more, you instantly drop to 0 hit points.</p>
        <p>On a success, you gain the ability to use one of the following Metamagic options as a sorcerer for the next
            minute, requiring no sorcery points. The type of Metamagic you gain access to depends on the type of suude,
            and once you use it, you can’t use it again until you inhale suude again.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="92ff54f2-4f74-4cca-aa55-64319dc5bb82">Born from the wild peoples of the Dividing Plains,
        free folk who shunned the constraints of society, the Rivermaw is the greatest of the Dividing Plains’ herds. It
        now boasts a membership of nearly ten thousand, along with a number of satellite herds that owe their allegiance
        to the Rivermaw.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b845a7ca-103a-42ca-8cf2-0c07cf047c36">Though the Rivermaw is now a mighty force for good
        on the Dividing Plains, they had humble beginnings. Just two generations ago, they numbered little more than
        three hundred half-giants, orcs, gnolls, humans, and nomads of other races that made their home in the Torian
        Forest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5b89037f-a7d4-4ebf-8456-97ad460eec43">It wasn’t until they were conquered by the Herd of
        Storms, helmed by the tyrannical goliath Kevdak, that a more violent way of life was forced upon them for a
        number of years. Once Kevdak was slain, the remaining members of both the Rivermaw and the Herd of Storms
        recanted his brutal ways and become the Rivermaw Herd known across Tal’Dorei today. It is led by two goliaths:
        Zanroar, son of Kevdak, and Skyhaal, daughter of Zanroar.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="184e87ae-0f04-41d6-a359-c8ba41153245">To the northwest of Drynna, not far from the
        Dawnmist Pines, the farming community of Turst Fields toils over extremely fertile land fed by the Mooren River
        Run. Providing much of Tal’Dorei and Whitestone’s grown food and produce, the community must import most all
        other commodities outside of wood, making it a lucrative stop for trade caravans traveling along the Parchwood
        Way to Drynna—and an easy target for swindlers. As such, nearly two hundred Shields from Westruun are
        permanently stationed here to keep the peace and prevent unlawful activity. Nearly as common as the arrival of a
        trader’s wagon is an armored carriage transporting brigands, grifters, and horse thieves back to Westruun for
        trial.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d1373961-1d07-4b9d-b845-c6769f61f534">Turst Fields has a significant gnoll population. As
        mutant beings created by demonic rituals, gnolls are shunned as monsters in most humanoid settlements on the
        Dividing Plains. Nevertheless, without the Dustpaw gnolls, Turst would not have survived its first summer. When
        the village was founded, it was easy prey for the Ravagers. Their leader sought blood tribute from the people of
        Turst, but the villagers refused to offer a sacrifice. This cell of Ravagers had recently sought the favor of
        the Demon Lord of Slaughter, transforming a number of the plains-dwelling hyenas into gnolls in that pursuit.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f2d04e28-ab12-41d8-ac69-acff70fb7f87">When the villagers of Turst refused to give up their
        own, the Ravagers unleashed the gnolls upon them. But something unusual happened. After the gnolls first drew
        blood, one of them began to weep. Then another, until all of the gnolls were howling in sorrow and fury. These
        beings, though infused with demon ichor, turned against their creators to defend their helpless prey.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="80fd6fd9-37f9-4320-883e-965bd92e622c">To this day, the Dustpaw gnolls have lingered in
        Turst, slowly becoming trusted members of their community. Their unsettling fangs and canine faces upset many
        who travel to this village, but any who deride the gnolls do so at their own risk. Not at the risk of mauling
        from a gnoll—though any humanoid being will fight back if pushed too far—but because hateful agitators will soon
        find themselves surrounded by the spears of the Turst militia.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="a145ed1f-67fa-41de-958d-18587a4866a7">The city of Westruun is the center of Tal’Dorei, a
        crossroads of culture along the Silvercut Roadway that welcomes adventurers, traders, and vagabonds of all
        kinds. Despite its name, Westruun is more east than west, and was in fact named after Palest Westruun, the
        trader and philosopher who founded the city. Westruun suffered under the rule of the goliath tyrant Kevdak’s
        Herd of Storms. Worse, its outlying towns and great stone buildings were ravaged by the acidic breath of
        Umbrasyl the Hope Devourer, an ancient black dragon of the Chroma Conclave who exacted tribute from her lair in
        the eerie mountain of Gatshadow. Despite the damage inflicted by its evil rulers, Westruun was one of the first
        cities in Tal’Dorei to recover from the Conclave. Though its government is deeply in debt to both the League of
        Miracles and a number of adventuring parties, the city has long since reclaimed its place of importance as an
        economic, academic, and political power within Tal’Dorei.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ebbd730f-100f-4bf1-af7d-12e3508bc4e4">Westruun underwent a political revolution in the
        wake of the Chroma Conclave’s defeat. The former margrave, Brandon Zimmerset, was a tyrant who claimed absolute
        power for himself following Kevdak’s defeat at the hands of Vox Machina. The title of margrave is a holdover
        from the authoritarian rule of Warren Drassig centuries ago, and those who hold that office are appointed for
        life by the council. A group of local idealists called the Retrievers banded with adventurers and mercenaries to
        overthrow Zimmerset a decade after he took power, and instated their leader as the lord mayor instead. Elections
        for the position of Lord Mayor of Westruun are held every five years, with no term limits. All adult citizens of
        the city who have lived there for at least five years have a vote, though only a fraction of the people actually
        use it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e399774c-e85f-4f8f-a3a2-38aee22e8623">The Retrievers continue to be a political force in
        Westruun, and several of Westruun’s delegates to the Tal’Dorei Council are members of this faction. They are
        campaigning to abolish the office of margrave from all settlements in Tal’Dorei. Though they have broad support
        in the council, the council doesn’t have the authority to unilaterally demand its constituent city-states to
        change their system of government. The revolution-minded Retrievers are somewhat stifled by the need to
        compromise with other cities.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7b51f6ce-5724-4a34-ac03-0b90f756d5b3">Lord Mayor Lysandra Kallos is a middle-aged goliath
        and former leader of the Retrievers. She has never lost a vote for reelection, and holds executive power over
        the city’s defenses, along with the ability to dissolve any business or guild, and to exile any person or group
        of up to ten people from the city at her discretion. She rules Westruun with the aid of a council of ten
        advisors.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e82ce583-eb44-4bdf-b4c1-16b18f5db250">The lord mayor commands a city guard of about 1,200
        trained soldiers known as the Shields of the Plain, though most folk just call them the Shields. Westruun’s
        soldiery is spread thin across the walls of the city itself, stationed at the gates of the dozens of outlying
        settlements and conducting raids against small cells of Ravagers across the plains.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eef03a07-0373-4d53-beaf-77006bd63c75">Many people in town would like to gather their
        forces and put an end to the Ravagers’ death cult once and for all, but the Shields are spread too thin to mount
        an effective offensive. Even in their current state, dozens—if not hundreds—of mercenaries, bounty hunters, and
        adventurers pass through Westruun every year in search of bloody work that the Shields are too beleaguered to
        handle themselves.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ddfc7c29-ed38-4f55-acda-74193a241288">Before he was ousted, Margrave Brandon Zimmerset
        authorized hundreds of reconstruction bounties—offers of gold to anyone who could rebuild the immense damage the
        city suffered during Umbrasyl’s attack and the Herd of Storms’ occupation of the city. Bounties were placed on
        the city’s siege-breaking stone walls, majestic towers and parapets, and even its iconic post-and-beam houses,
        many of which were razed completely during the attack.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9cfbfcfa-8a9f-4206-84fc-313fd6f05c6f">The margrave expected these bounties to be slowly
        completed over decades, but they were all snapped up and completed in a few short years by mercenary mages
        serving a group called the League of Miracles (see <a
            href="/sources/tcsr/allegiances-of-taldorei#LeagueofMiracles"
            data-content-chunk-id="66448609-d7dc-4704-af0b-0169075e7c2f">chapter 2</a>). The margrave was saddled with a
        crushing debt, one that he was both unwilling and unable to pay before being ousted by the Retrievers. As his
        successor, Lord Mayor Lysandra Kallos inherited Zimmerset’s immense debt to the league, and is constantly
        seeking to find ways to alleviate their pressure—especially as the league continues to use the debt as leverage
        to buy the allegiance of her advisory council.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1aeb03e2-e63c-4719-9184-dfc70cd1c2b7">The Clasp has become a major and public force in
        Westruun since the criminal organization’s dubiously virtuous makeover following the Cinder King’s defeat in
        Emon. Many Clasp agents enjoy the reputation of folk heroes across the Dividing Plains, and make public
        appearances in taverns and town squares throughout Westruun.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="103eeabc-0542-474a-8200-44e2db385510">Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Clasp is
        still a criminal organization. They have controlled and efficiently run their shadowy trades for decades right
        under the Shields’ noses. Their network of fences runs from coast to coast, Stilben to Emon. Their hideout
        changes every few years, when the Shields manage to track them down. Their current hideout is secreted away
        behind the storefront of the Saddled Plainscow, a popular tavern owned and operated by Clasp agents.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f50f1791-bd92-4349-aa23-8e5a9dd587fe">Folk in search of real folk heroes often seek the
        covert agents of the Golden Grin (see <a href="/sources/tcsr/allegiances-of-taldorei#GoldenGrin"
            data-content-chunk-id="88475ce0-b81d-4fb9-b821-8b149d026dda">chapter 2</a>), who tend to wait and watch in
        local taverns. The Grin sometimes gets a bad reputation in Westruun, since people need help every day, but the
        Grinners prefer to wait for just the right moment to reveal themselves and strike against evil.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3c9498c2-8338-4263-9d16-84418c5f9388">Miles of farmland and fields surround Westruun’s
        towering stone walls—except to the west, where the city is bordered by the Bramblewood and dwarfed by the
        mist-shrouded peak of Gatshadow. Nearly two dozen villages and towns surround the city’s walls.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6d52c9d2-2776-4988-b2fd-619d9bbc241f">The city’s interior is divided into six wards:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d716f503-e9f3-4ff6-b26e-2d23384598ca"><strong><em>Scholar Ward.</em></strong> Westruun’s
        northwestern ward is home to the Cobalt Reserve, Tal’Dorei’s largest public library and private archive. It’s
        also home to a number of other erudite institutions that instruct knowledge-seekers from across the Dividing
        Plains. Westhall Academy is the most renowned of them all, but in the shadow of these revered institutions is
        the College of the Savvy, a school for the arts founded by the storied bard and champion of intuition referred
        to only as the White Duke.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4faa68eb-ee6d-4dc2-9aae-ec316bf583fc"><strong><em>Temple Ward.</em></strong> The city’s
        small southern ward is replete with major temples to the Prime Deities and homes for their clergy. The most
        important gods of the Dividing Plains are the Lawbearer, the Wildmother, and the Platinum Dragon, and it’s made
        obvious by their huge, resplendent sanctuaries in the Temple Ward. The greatest temples here are the First
        Bastion, the Wild Arbor, and the Platinum Dragon’s Rest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="534c9c75-c286-4a46-a826-4fb103347611"><strong><em>Opal Ward.</em></strong> Westruun’s
        central district is also its municipal heart. The ward has no residential housing, but is home to the Lord
        Mayor’s Residence, the Hall of Reason, and the public square.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c4b41d19-6d7e-49c7-926b-fd5281984829"><strong><em>Residential Ward.</em></strong> The
        northeastern section of Westruun is the city’s most densely populated ward, housing over two-thirds of its
        population. There are no major landmarks in this ward, though every neighborhood in the ward has its own unique
        culture. Even though tourists might not visit the landmarks here, there are countless local bakeries, shops, and
        pubs beloved by its residents.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c4576b25-edb0-4888-8715-753ca3ca4802">This ward is rife with crime. Westruun’s poorest
        citizens are pressed together in tight quarters, sometimes as little as a single city block away from the city’s
        wealthiest manor houses. The Clasp and the Myriad prey upon the poor and affluent alike, often stoking the
        tensions affecting the city’s downtrodden to create chaos that masks their crimes. The Shields are stretched too
        thin to properly deal with these agitators. Unlike in the Temple Ward, free expression of religion is not a
        guaranteed right here, even within the privacy of one’s own home. Though the Lawbearer, the Wildmother, and the
        Platinum Dragon are all benevolent deities, many of their Westruunian followers are not particularly tolerant of
        other faiths.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9847063e-586b-4737-9356-2a0a1719ce45"><strong><em>Market Ward.</em></strong> Westruun’s
        southwestern ward contains the majority of its businesses, trade stands, and production warehouses. Some of
        these businesses are historic fixtures of the city, rebuilt by the League of Miracles in years past, but many
        sell overpriced wares to cater to tourists, adventurers, and the city’s wealthy elite.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ee87ad21-d61d-428e-a4f2-c25c50c4435e">It’s currently in fashion for store owners to live
        in a second story above their shops, though less scrupulous businesspeople have turned their residences into
        gambling dens, black markets, and illegal brothels. The most significant building in this ward is the Exandrian
        Exchange, a marble-walled auction house where hundreds of vendors hawk rare and unusual items from across
        Tal’Dorei. A satellite location of Gilmore’s Glorious Goods, a famed magic item shop in Emon, is a beloved
        attraction of this district.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="65ed761e-8058-4c3c-b597-c2d237b2c277"><strong><em>Underwalk Ward.</em></strong> The city’s
        newest ward is underground. It’s an extension of the residential sprawl built from repurposed sections of the
        sewers, underground military bunkers, and the wine cellars of mansions annihilated by Umbrasyl and the Herd of
        Storms.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="00349731-1375-400f-b2aa-4935996965b2">The Underwalk was frantically excavated during the
        invasion of the Chroma Conclave in hopes of keeping the populace hidden. It has been largely abandoned for the
        past twenty-four years, save for those too poor to return even to the Residential Ward, but an effort has been
        made in the past two years to create a unique and vibrant ecosystem in the Underwalk. The optimistic
        entrepreneurs trying to popularize Underwalk housing hire adventurers in great quantities, for every day, new

        Ward is Tal’Dorei’s largest house of knowledge, and it is maintained and fiercely defended by the monks of the

        university in Tal’Dorei can hope to compete with the prestige of Emon’s Alabaster Lyceum, but the Westhall
        Academy does its best. Its sand-colored stone walls and copper-patina dome are an unmistakable landmark of the
        Scholar Ward. They imply a stately and refined institution with an unpretentious, workaday attitude. Most of the
        Westhall Academy’s students come from humble backgrounds, and the lord mayor does her level best to ensure that
        the academy is funded enough to let anyone from the plains who shows great promise attend, free of cost. Mages,
        architects, poets, artists, agriculturalists, and people of all disciplines can find an education at Westhall.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b32bda0e-eae3-4c50-a924-dfb179f4dcff"><strong><em>3. Yuminor Observatory.</em></strong>
        Westruun is a fairly flat city, and one tower on the edge of the Scholar Ward looms high above the nearby
        Westhall Academy. It looks forever skyward, the arcanists inside constantly charting the movements of the
        heavens. A quasi-religious order of diviners and astromancers named the Scions of Yuminor study here, supported
        by the academy’s headmistress, Estella Ladimar, who is herself a blood descendant of the heroic wizard Atz
        Yuminor. The observatory is open to all, and the diviners here will gladly give a star reading for 10 gp, once
        per day. Receiving this reading allows you to roll 1d20. Note the result—you can exchange it for any d20 roll
        made by a creature you can see. This divination fades after 24 hours. Despite the Scions of Yuminor’s
        affability, something seems odd about them, like they have stared into the stars just a bit too long and seen
        something they wish they could forget.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="353ad528-8dae-4242-b094-c0ef7c7e84e6"><strong><em>4. First Bastion.</em></strong> The most
        magnificent of the temples within Westruun’s Temple Ward is the First Bastion. Dedicated to the Lawbearer, this
        opulent sanctuary is a common attraction for visiting folk of all faiths. Its magnificent, even decadent,
        gold-and-marble exterior is a sight most people can’t imagine exists upon the Material Plane—it seems like
        nothing less than a building from the realm of the gods themselves. The First Bastion was a secret home for
        refugees during Kevdak’s occupation, and many Westruun survivors have turned to the faith of the Lawbearer after
        being protected by her grace.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c569ec99-4dcd-413f-98df-869685e2104e"><strong><em>5. Lord Mayor’s Residence.</em></strong>
        The Lord Mayor’s Residence is a squat manor in the Opal Ward. It was originally named the Margrave’s Keep, and
        as such, it is a defensible and highly fortified compound buttressed against military barracks. The interior has
        been livened up significantly by the lord mayor, but the exterior is still a spare, military edifice.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3a262bcb-d8bd-4177-8f48-b16c21d6ffae"><strong><em>6. Hall of Reason.</em></strong> This
        beautiful courthouse in the Opal Ward is constructed in sweeping Lyrengornian style and bears a marble statue of
        the Platinum Dragon above its steps. The square before the courtroom steps is a forum for public gatherings and
        bears a fountain depicting Palest Westruun, the founder of the city, atop an onyx horse.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4647df16-0189-4ee5-849f-8808ce5c4429"><strong><em>7. The Black King.</em></strong> Palest
        Westruun was not a king, but his new statue in the Opal Ward is often called the Black King, a subtle jab at the
        city’s previous “Black King,” the tyrannical dragon Umbrasyl. The high priest of the First Bastion blessed both
        the Black King and Westruun itself when the statue was unveiled on the anniversary of Westruun’s reclamation,
        saying, “May the Lawbearer grant us all strength of spirit when chaos next threatens our peaceful civilization.
        When that time comes, may the Black King unsheathe his sword to rally our people and lead Westruun to victory.”

    <p data-content-chunk-id="68736c43-ef41-44f1-a260-208803e2d961"><strong><em>8. Survivors’ Legacy.</em></strong> The
        names of all those in Westruun who survived the reign of Kevdak and Umbrasyl are carved on a wall in the first
        chamber of the Underwalk. Legend has it that the memorial was created by Percival de Rolo when the people of
        Westruun first hid here from the wrath of the Chroma Conclave after Umbrasyl’s death, but it has been expanded
        in the years since, now including the names of all who perished in the struggle as well.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="128e78ca-54ce-46f0-b082-5796478db093">The Survivors’ Legacy is a symbol of hope, warding
        away the sorrow and evil of the Underwalk beneath, and to this day common, folk make trips here to honor their
        lost loved ones. Some of the more generous folk give aid to the homeless living here as well, and some more
        adventurous travelers make prayers to the Dawnfather and the Matron of Ravens here before delving into the

        beasts of burden, have disappeared from Westruun’s outlying villages. Left in their place were nothing but a
        series of five-foot holes in the ground and traces of acid scarring. Farmers and caravanners alike are
        frightened and confused; these recurring attacks threaten to destroy Westruun’s agriculture and disrupt
        commerce. Jeremiah Sook, head of the regional Rancher’s Guild, is willing to pay a hefty bounty for the
        culprits.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="867aa908-7bd9-41a5-9e98-26e70161d652"><strong><em>An Assistant’s Plight

            data-content-chunk-id="09b7e78b-77db-45db-bbe9-79a934a4a462">chapter 2</a>). Normally, none are invited to
        the tower, but the characters, wherever they may be, receive a missive from the Realmseer’s assistant, Jekt. The
        letter claims the Realmseer has gone missing within the tower, and the building itself now bars Jekt’s entry—and
        apparently, the Realmseer’s exit. Upon arrival, and confirmation of Jekt’s request, the tower seems to
        constantly shift its interior structure, almost acting like a sentient entity. Challenge after deadly challenge
        is thrown at the party as they traverse the labyrinthine paths of the tower, only to find that the Realmseer
        himself is actually trying to keep something far more dangerous imprisoned within.</p>

        Underwalk Ward. With the depth seemingly bottomless, and initial investigators going missing, high priest Umentu
        Helmdoff seeks the assistance of brave and able-bodied adventurers to find answers and save the people still in

        Cliffkeep Mountains are an impenetrable barrier between the Republic of Tal’Dorei and the frozen Neverfields.
        The southern foothills are dotted with forests and pockets of civilization, standing resolute against the
        unwelcoming topography. Deep within the earth itself, the dwarven stronghold of Kraghammer flourishes and
        expands, just a few scant leagues above ancient caverns that plunge into a domain of unknowable horrors.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e0d0a82a-11db-4a0d-8bb8-b4862e4017d9">The Cliffkeeps are the largest mountain range in all
        of Tal’Dorei, and innumerable types of beings make their homes upon the crags, in mountainside caves, and in the
        miles upon miles of tunnels that descend into the earth below them. Dwarves, half-giants, goblins, and kobolds
        are the best-known peoples of the Cliffkeeps, but the mountains are also home to the fire giants of Vulkanon,
        wandering ettins and hill giants, hungry cyclopes, frost giant marauders from the Neverfields, and cave-dwelling
        trolls.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c1c8f1d1-4be3-46ec-9fe7-cae86e64781d">Near the earth elemental rift and the Ashari village
        of Terrah, the mountains themselves seem to rise up in defense as earth elementals spring from the living
        stones. Northward, peaks reach higher and winds grow colder as snow and ice take the lands to become the frozen
        waste of the Neverfields. These challenges keep the common folk at bay, the secrets and spoils held within these
        crags calling to the brave, the clever, and the foolhardy.</p>

        Fort Daxio is a massive stronghold and series of military structures that, under the rule of the Tal’Dorei
        Council, trains Tal’Dorei’s most elite warriors. The fortress was constructed following the Scattered War as a
        strategic bulwark against opportunistic humanoid and giant bandit forces in the Cliffkeep Mountains, and as a
        hidden reserve of military might in the event that Emon was ever threatened.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a3b54782-e385-407e-8608-553f554dba20">Though Tal’Dorei doesn’t maintain a standing
        army—rather, it assembles one in times of strife from mercenaries, adventurers, and local militias—the forces of
        Fort Daxio are an exception. The legendary Daxio Outriders are a corps of cavaliers some four thousand strong.
        Half their forces remain stationed in Fort Daxio and its surroundings at any given time, serving as a historic
        barrier between Emon and the bandits and creatures of the Cliffkeep Mountains. The other two thousand Outriders
        are spread across the continent, typically in battalions of up to one hundred riders, safeguarding villages,
        patrolling the Silvercut Roadway, putting pressure on the Ravagers of the Dividing Plains, or protecting
        traveling diplomats.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6176bdfd-6c31-4a25-a377-53dcb7f723ee">Fort Daxio itself is led by General Elle Gorgofon, a
        dour but diplomatic tactician. She served faithfully under the fort’s previous leader, Warmaster Mikael Daxio,
        for nearly thirty-five years before he was killed at the hands of a vampire hoping to throw the fort into chaos.
        Daxio was resurrected, but is enjoying an extended holiday in Syngorn rather than returning to arms.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f7509d5d-2646-4c51-b28d-51c11a4ef7cc">The Daxio Outriders are divided into four different
        regiments: The Dusk Regiment, the Gale Regiment, the Aegis Regiment, and the Tide Regiment. Each regiment is led
        by their own assigned general, all answering directly to General Gorgofon (who in turn answers to the Master of
        War on the Tal’Dorei Council in times of conflict).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c2e30f80-6f3c-4ed7-b7c3-fe3bd0d20c2f">The Dusk Regiment is responsible for covert
        operations across the country and is led by General Fei Yujian, a cheerful, affable man. The Gale Regiment is
        trained in skyborne combat in addition to horseriding; after the Chroma Conclave was defeated, Fort Daxio
        trained a variety of griffons, hippogrifs, and wyverns to ward against airborne threats. It is led by General
        Jillian Sylph, a calm, tactical human with air elemental ancestry. The Aegis Regiment is charged with remaining
        in Fort Daxio to protect Emon, and is led by General Elle Gorgofon herself. The Tide Regiment is trained in
        spellcasting and ship-to-ship combat, in case Emon is ever threatened from the western seas. This final regiment
        is led by General Kay Clearsight, a half-elf trained in the arcane arts at the renowned Soltryce Academy in the
        Dwendalian Empire of Wildemount.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="15d685f5-73e8-4141-979b-5062d5e302fc">The mighty mountain known as Gatshadow is a spire of
        death that looms over the Dividing Plains. Westruun sees it always upon the horizon, and the most vicious
        monsters of the Bramblewood grow cruel in its fell shadow. Folkloric tales about the evil powers within
        Gatshadow are told in all cultures of the Dividing Plains: stories of giant spiders in the forest, of beings of
        pure shadow that dwell within the mountain’s tunnels, and of the tunnels themselves, which are so labyrinthine
        and shifting that no one who enters will ever escape. These days, most of these stories are told to keep
        children from wandering into the forest alone—but they are far from simply children’s tales.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4dd4ae79-19e9-4dce-b32c-3a49fb90afb2">Gatshadow was transformed into a place of evil in
        the Age of Arcanum. Acek Orattim, a priest of the Betrayer God known as the Chained Oblivion, made the mountain
        his seat of power. The Oblivion’s inexorable might corrupted the mountain, stretching its stone-like putty until
        it was a jagged needle that towered over all other mountains, and etching a mind-bending labyrinth of twisting
        passages into the mountain’s heart.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="62432007-a045-4001-8a6b-cc86066ba28f">Acek spread the Oblivion’s nihilistic despair across
        the Cliffkeep Mountains and the Dividing Plains below. All bowed before their influence their minds lost to
        unfathomable contemplation of the end of all things. Untold thousands died at the hands of Acek and his god,
        willingly entering Gatshadow—which then became their tomb.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7fb1af17-f244-432c-847d-9f9d3ddb5601">The bitter cold of oblivion threatened to consume
        the land, but it was repulsed by the Dawnfather and his warriors of light. The Dawnfather struck a telling blow
        against the Oblivion, and doggedly pursued as it retreated to Gathsadow. He shackled and banished the god of the
        end within Gatshadow’s depths. It was said that Acek’s mind and spirit were so saturated with his master’s
        essence that the god’s banishment tore his body asunder. Today, only the empty maze of deadly chambers and traps
        remain beneath the mountain, forgotten and awaiting discovery.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4be8d35c-becc-4699-b287-9bc654b01fbc">The high bluffs of Gatshadow have in recent years
        been the home of many a villain, most recently Umbrasyl the Hope Devourer, the black dragon of the Chroma
        Conclave. Legend says that Gatshadow’s interior tunnels spiral infinitely downwards, into a void of utter
        darkness. Immortal, white-eyed devotees of the Oblivion pace endlessly into Gatshadow’s tunnels, carrying
        lightless torches, whispering that the secret to freeing their god from the Divine Gate is sealed in the depths
        below. The stone doors that bar entrance to Gatshadow’s lowest reaches are sealed by magic so great, even the
        most inquisitive of the Arcana Pansophical can’t breach them—and it is well that they cannot, for who knows what
        terror would be unleashed if they were opened.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="18ac7ecc-7023-4c55-a644-dfaba550e468">However, there’s a reason no one has dared to
        recover the Hope Devourer’s corpse. When Umbrasyl died, the caustic acid and magical blood within his body
        seeped through the caverns of Upper Gatshadow, devouring stone and transforming the mountain’s upper levels into
        a vitriolic maze teeming with oozes, half-black dragon warriors, and the restless spirits of goliaths from the

        Orattim. Agents of the Arcana Pansophical have sensed that the lower gates of Gatshadow have been breached, and
        frantically call for Tal’Dorei’s greatest heroes to rush to the evil mountain. As the characters hurry to the
        bottom of the mind-sundering labyrinth within, they discover that they race against not only the new Herald of
        Oblivion, but also the Remnants she betrayed.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="08502c80-5b1f-475c-9504-06dae269c3be">For many years, Jorenn Village was just a tiny
        pioneer town trying to profit from the shadegrass of the Umbra Hills. Over the past century, the village has
        exploded in size and population, after plentiful silver veins were discovered within the nearby rocky hills.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bc164861-1471-484e-8a20-68202acaf9a5">Hardworking common folk and opportunistic
        prospectors alike flocked to Jorenn, despite its unsettling proximity to the Umbra Hills. Jorenn is far enough
        away from Emon that the influence of the Tal’Dorei Council rarely touches it, giving opportunists and outlaws
        freedom to subvert and control both the village government and the local economy. Thirty years ago, a small
        circle of vigilantes and mercenaries declared themselves protectors of Jorenn, and took the name Shadewatch,
        hunting and slaying creeping dangers in the night and returning to great fanfare. Over the past three decades,
        others seeking fame and glory joined the ranks of the Shadewatch, and the group ballooned into the unofficial
        town law enforcement.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0a2d7af2-a807-4ee4-9bce-7b25fb9517a6">The Shadewatch is deeply corrupt, and it has been
        almost since its first year. The vigilantes personally stoke the fires of fear, all while demanding increasingly
        galling tribute for their services—and breaking kneecaps if they don’t get it. Today, the people of Jorenn are
        just as afraid of the Shadewatch as they are of the creatures the watch keeps at bay.</p>

        Tal’Dorei, from the Myriad to the League of Miracles, with an interest in cruel subterfuge. It’s clear that
        she’s planning something: every night, she consults a ball of polished white quartz, and every week she sends a
        trio of her agents to the Umbra Hills—or to the base of Gatshadow.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="35db0025-a67e-4256-835a-8bc43ff637a7">Dozens of dwarven redoubts rose and fell in the
        tunnels beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains during the Calamity, and in the uncertain years that followed it. Legend
        holds that a great civilization called Uthtor once reigned supreme in the Cliffkeeps, and that all of the deep
        settlements are fragments of Uthtor’s glory, fractured by the Calamity. Over the centuries, these fragments
        divided and coalesced dozens of times until, finally, those who remained came together to create Kraghammer.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3081b6ac-fd90-4259-ad94-3f64629e01b8">Clan Jaggenstrike united thousands of dwarves,
        gnomes, and other dwellers of the deep halls in the creation of Kraghammer. Having quietly died out centuries
        ago, the clan now holds a position of mythic reverence within the city. Kraghammer’s founding was dedicated to
        the All-Hammer, divine creator of the dwarves and patron of creation and ingenuity. This god’s industrious
        spirit filled the people of Kraghammer and blessed them with rich veins of platinum, mithral, adamantine, and
        other precious metals that have sustained them since the city’s founding.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c7f1dcec-a6ce-4522-aca3-3970e763a121">An ominous walk of a thousand stairs climbs the side
        of the mountain to the gates of the city—carved from the mountain itself, just wide enough for two dwarves to
        walk abreast. With the path too steep and treacherous for carts or common beasts of burden to traverse, traders
        and trappers use giant goats to transport their goods to and from market, while wealthy dwarven merchant lords
        employ serfs and laborers to carry their goods. Kraghammer’s impenetrable adamantine gates stand at the end of a
        perilous bridge overlooking a hundred-foot chasm, guarded by three watchtowers carved directly into the
        mountain.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e2a3674d-c657-405e-bc8d-d5fc400da7fc">Within those gates, the massive stronghold is made
        up of three cylindrical levels called “slabs” that descend deep beneath the mountains. Kraghammer’s granite
        walls are lit by roaring fires, enchanted torches, and shimmering candlerock, which glows with internal fire.
        Even when the evening fires are extinguished, the amber light of the Bronzegrip Metalworks at the base of the
        city bathes Kraghammer in its warm glow.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="8b5cca95-5f04-4368-b62f-621d667c2522">Kraghammer law is written by a consortium of the
        five most powerful houses within the city, each appointing a delegate to serve on their behalf. That tenuous
        union of houses is kept by the city’s executive officer, the Ironkeeper. The Ironkeeper is elected by the houses
        and carries a term of ten years, with no term limit, though most Ironkeepers contain their rule to three to five
        terms.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0d00e6c4-5afd-4b21-b831-490fc5311836">The current sitting Ironkeeper is Palluda of House
        Zuurthom. She rose to prominence advocating for the rights of workers in the wake of the Chroma Conclave, and is
        a strong advocate for uniting with the Republic of Tal’Dorei to strengthen their might against future
        supernatural threats. She is sitting comfortably in the midst of her second term and enjoys strong support from
        members of Kraghammer’s working class—and staunch opposition from traditionalists, who cling to the city’s
        fading culture of isolationism.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="97eab4ec-2376-45af-8a8a-2a23ee119f10">The laws of the city are enforced by a military
        class of elite warriors called Carvers that act as guards, soldiers, and jailers under the guidance of the
        Ironkeeper. Becoming a Carver is a lengthy, rigorous, and taxing pursuit, and many who choose to join fail to
        complete their training.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9ab52b3e-18c4-4299-b6cc-5ad505d28bc1">Most who join the Carvers are dwarves from families
        with centuries of history within the Carvers. This isn’t just because of the pressure to uphold their family’s
        honor. Most hopefuls are also those who value Kraghammer’s ancient traditions and rigid social order—a set of
        beliefs largely held by dwarven clans with long family histories. Once officially named, a Carver is given a
        homestead built into the center slab of the city, a set of immaculate armor and weapons, and a steady income.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="80eb1d86-b0ba-42ad-94bd-d4c634d6d0aa">In the years following the defeat of the Chroma
        Conclave, the famously isolationist and xenophobic houses conceded to formally make an alliance with the
        Republic of Tal’Dorei. An ambassador from Kraghammer now sits on the Tal’Dorei Council, and rumors are beginning
        to circulate within the city that the heads of the Great Houses of Kraghammer are in talks with the Tal’Dorei
        Council to make Kraghammer an official constituent city-state of the republic.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b56a88cf-3c71-4bcc-a34e-e72fb0431819">It’s not easy being an outsider. Kraghammer has long
        been a city of dwarves, for dwarves, and anyone else within the city is an interloper. Some traditionalists
        within the city still think that surface-born folk should spend as little time in Kraghammer as possible, so as
        not to dilute the ancient splendor of their culture.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a46be126-b77b-4a15-b62b-ef8c12d6c903">Yet times are changing. A coalition of people,
        ranging from dwarves to gnomes to traditionally surface-dwelling people who have made Kraghammer their home,
        have demanded that the Great Houses amend the city’s most xenophobic laws. Despite the angry protestations of
        the city’s most bigoted dwarves, the Great Houses have acquiesced to the requests of their people. This is due
        in no small part to these protestors having the support of the current Ironkeeper—Palluda Zuurthrom has long
        been a proponent of Kraghammer entering the Republic of Tal’Dorei and ending their centuries of relative
        isolation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fd92e5d4-1224-4be4-aa94-9b854d036ef2">No non-dwarf has ever served as a delegate of the
        houses, let alone the Ironkeeper. Progress is slow, especially in Kraghammer, but it is happening. The most
        despicable of the city’s xenophobes have left of their own volition, creating other dwarven settlements
        throughout the Cliffkeeps where they can keep to themselves and “their own kind” in peace.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="238c624e-f959-4df1-8708-c6be26bfc34c">Citizens of Emon who visit Kraghammer often marvel
        at how lawful and organized the dwarven enclave is. Crime is ostensibly low within Kraghammer thanks to the
        Carvers’ protection, but this peace comes at a cost. Crime is low because the courts of Kraghammer almost always
        reach a guilty verdict. As a long-lived and durable people, most dwarves, particularly those with a family
        reputation to uphold, would rather plead guilty and endure years, even decades, of hard labor than disturb the
        fabric of their society by fighting conviction.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="02c3ea25-90b9-436d-a2cc-1c671b18357a">Beyond this, corruption is rife within the Carvers,
        and they are able to brutalize even innocent people with relative impunity. This corruption is shielded from
        public scrutiny by the vast wealth and political influence of House Glorendar, their patron house. Because of
        Glorendar’s close ties with the Carvers (and the mutual benefits thereof), corruption has been hard to uncover
        within either organization.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6ccb5fe9-1215-480d-96b7-95778986e4bf">Over twenty years ago, however, a gnomish journalist
        named Ida Mudrake uncovered something damning within the vaults of House Glorendar, bringing some hope that
        change may yet move steadily forward. She has been forced to flee the city and now lives with a security detail
        in Emon, but she works tirelessly to bring the crimes of House Glorendar to light. Many in Kraghammer hope that
        this evidence, whatever it is, will shake both Glorendar and the Carvers to their foundations. Many more fear
        that even true justice is not worth the chaos that bringing Glorendar’s misdeeds to light will cause.</p>

        blanketed in thick snow, the bone-piercing chill does not extend into Kraghammer itself. Heat from the
        Bronzegrip Metalworks and the other blast furnaces in the Bottom Slab rises and permeates the entire city,
        though the Top Slab still grows cold in the winter. The city itself is carved out of the granite core of Mount
        Kraghammer; though the dwarves rarely see the night sky, the inner walls still sparkle like starlight in the
        amber glow of the furnaces.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="39e750db-4467-4585-999d-b129ecd00691"><strong><em>Top Slab.</em></strong> Also called the
        Arch, this uppermost tier is the entry level of the city, built on a massive ring. Like a hub with many spokes,
        countless neighborhoods and tunnels spread out from the Top Slab. A fine layer of soot tends to coat much of
        this slab, due to imperfect ventilation from the industrious center slab; despite this, this level is where most
        people make their homes, with thousands of stone-built abodes dotting the walls, while popular taverns like the
        trendy Firebrook Inn and the historic but austere Ironhearth Tavern fill alcoves pushed into the rock. For
        hundreds of years, most non-dwarves within Kraghammer were relegated to living in a Top Slab neighborhood called
        the “Otherwalk.” These days, non-dwarves live all over the city, and the Otherwalk has been renamed the
        Cavernwalk. It’s still mostly inhabited by non-dwarves, and it has a vibrant culture all its own.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="abb4d5ce-daf9-4937-87df-118d6b7c3d5d">As members of the Kraghammer working class,
        “Topslabbers” either make the long commute to labor in the Bottom Slab or work in the Toppers’ farms above the
        mountain. Others are indentured servants to wealthy dwarves in the Middle Slab, and only return to their
        families on the Top Slab on their monthly day of rest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="da84a4e3-6ea6-4ce1-ae46-92768f690258"><strong><em>Center Slab.</em></strong> Also referred
        to as the Heart, this middle tier is the widest and most varied rung on the journey through Kraghammer. It is
        stratified between the residences of Kraghammer’s old money (its long-established noble houses), and the new
        (the wealthy merchant class). At the exact center of the slab is the Pyrethrone, seat of the Ironkeeper. The
        geometric symbolism of the Pyrethrone being at the dead center of the city is a fact most visitors to Kraghammer
        hear <em>ad nauseum</em>. Radiating out from the Pyrethrone are the various fortress-manors of the dwarven noble
        houses, with several Carver barracks in easy reach.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f2645fc2-a038-4488-901b-c51d0bf61269">Below, the outer rings of the Center Slab are
        occupied by most of the city’s non-mining businesses, from smithies, breweries, and jewelers, to tailors,
        butchers, and tinkerers like the Cracksackle Union. The Hunter’s Club is also well known as the chief provider
        for non-imported meats to the city, sending parties into the mountains or the nearby Torian Forest for wild
        game. The extravagant marble temple known as All-Hammer’s Will stands on the center slab of the city, the
        grandest of all shrines to the most worshipped deity under the mountain. Enormous in size and impeccable in both
        detail and architectural design, this hall calls to artisans and crafters throughout the city for inspiration.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5ffc9054-c057-45dd-89c1-dd92205bb6ba">Of the five noble houses, only two conduct their
        affairs entirely in the Center Slab. The magically talented Lord Steddos Thunderbrand and his family are known
        to rarely leave their mansion, except on business with the Ironkeeper. Wallera Glorendar used to oversee the
        combat training of all Carvers within Kraghammer, but hasn’t been seen in public for twenty years. Her daughter,
        Kazya, runs all her affairs within the public eye.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7cd224ca-8eb2-499b-a106-b8310264e4b2"><strong><em>Bottom Slab.</em></strong> Best known as
        the Pit, this tier is the industrious powerhouse of Kraghammer, boasting the most forges per square mile of any
        location in Tal’Dorei, courtesy of the Bronzegrip Metalworks and their competitors. Most of these forges are
        potent, highly industrialized, and mechanized blast furnaces. The expansive Keenstone Quarry is chief among the
        numerous mining operations that have tunneled through the depths of the mountains—depths whose true dangers are
        obscured by centuries of legend, and therefore not fully understood.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5613a287-69b1-4a66-8a91-2ac4529664da">A network of fungus-farming paths called the
        Glowgrove works its way around this level, passing through all sorts of caverns. The mushrooms are harvested by
        the Toppers, the dwarven agricultural league that got their name from the small topside farms they tend above
        the city.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eac59c73-c2df-4dc2-ad48-db519d3b5564">Three of the five dwarven houses have business
        interests in the Bottom Slab, though they direct its operations from the next tier up. Nostoc Greyspine is the
        grim overseer of Keenstone Quarry. Haddi Bronzegrip is the foredwarf of the Bronzegrip Metalworks; she claims to
        be the wealthiest dwarf in the North, a claim no one has ever been able to successfully dispute. Blenton
        Zuurthom is an architectural savant, and one of the older and kinder nobledwarves; he tries his best to oversee
        every major construction project in the Bottom Slab.</p>

        Most dwarves worship the All-Hammer, and his teachings of community and ancestral piety have been all but
        completely subsumed into Kraghammer’s culture at large. For outlanders with different faiths, however, the
        monolithic religious culture can feel inescapable. Shrines to all the Prime Deities have spread throughout
        Kraghammer since the fall of the Chroma Conclave, but the Starshrine was the first.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0d97680b-d5e7-4d42-b9f7-498d6340f103">When the world trembled at the might of Thordak the
        Cinder King, tremors rocked the upper layers of Kraghammer, causing certain caverns to collapse—and in some
        cases, to reveal places of great beauty. The Starshrine is a vast grotto whose granite walls mysteriously
        sparkle with a perfect replica of the stars in the night sky. It can be found within the Top Slab’s culturally
        diverse Cavernwalk district. Once per year, when a character prays to one of the Prime Deities here, there is a
        1% chance per character level that their prayer is answered, as the cleric’s <a

                Slab).</em></strong> The headquarters of the Cracksackle Union looks unlike anything in Kraghammer. It’s
        made of a dozen glistening steel domes, like sleek, metal igloos, and the light of unusual experiments flicker
        through its slitted windows at all hours of the night. Most within Kraghammer consider the building an eyesore,
        but all interested in technological tinkering and ingenuity love it for its uniqueness. If nothing else, it
        plainly displays the oft-baffling ingenuity of its tinkerers.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bd6e45d7-1ff2-47f9-b98c-2c5c037f88ec">The Cracksackle Union was founded by gnomish
        refugees from Wittebak nearly four hundred years ago. While intrinsically tied to the Bronzegrip Metalworks for
        resources, contacts, and distribution, the Cracksacklers have made themselves indispensable to the dwarven elite
        with their inventive contributions to mining and masonry technology.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="94b6e193-59b4-457e-85cc-8e2efd23eb74">On any working day, a dozen tinkerers, many of them
        gnomes, will set up shop in the courtyard, selling strange and untested devices they have made in their
        workshops. The GM determines which non-magical curiosities can be purchased here, but some include:</p>

                Slab).</em></strong> Despite all of Kraghammer’s wondrous crafts and goods, its most significant export
        is raw stone—most of which is excavated from Keenstone Quarry, making the quarry’s overseer, Nostoc Greyspine, a
        very rich dwarf indeed. As the legend of Vox Machina spread across Tal’Dorei, Overseer Greyspine got an idea:
        open the quarry to adventurers. Vox Machina famously entered the vast network of dangerous tunnels beneath
        Kraghammer from a fissure at the depths of the quarry, and countless imitators have tried to follow in their
        footsteps—some emerging with fabulous treasure, but most never returning at all.</p>

        advertised the quarry far and wide as the “Gateway to the Depths,” and posted an entrance fee of 25 gp per
        adventurer. Of course, neither Greyspine nor the staff of the quarry bears any liability for death,

        The Bronzegrip Metalworks just carved deeper into the mountain to expand their furnaces, only to discover the
        most magnificent cavern: a mile-wide cave filled with bioluminescent purple mushrooms. Industry had to move in,
        and the Bronzegrips hired Wyrmhide Thunderbrand and his pyromancer brigade to torch the cavern. The mushrooms
        never stopped burning, and the myconoids that lived in the fungal forest never stopped fighting. Characters

        leads below the earth. Deep. Deeper. Until the light of day is entirely gone, and then deeper still. Across
        chasms miles-deep and full of magma, beneath great hanging gardens of glowing malachite, lies the Emberhold. It
        stares imperiously over an underground kingdom of the duergar, dwarves who long ago broke away from the rule of
        the Great Houses of Kraghammer.</p>

        span the glassy lava-plains that the Emberhold is built upon, with mighty armies constantly coming and going,
        sometimes returning with just a few bloody survivors, other times returning with captives in chains—and other

        and prickles their skin. Few ever arise even to Kraghammer, for they are taught that only death awaits them
        there. Nevertheless, many duergar doubt the narrative that has been fed to them since birth, and make attempts
        to escape to the surface. Those duergar that have left the ways of the Emberhold behind and learned of the

        Spider Queen, but also the aberrations with whom they have made strange alliances in order to sustain their

        their warriors had learned the rare art of wyvern riding. When Warren Drassig’s legions marched to conquer

        art into a ceremonial one; great athletes called skyswimmers train year-round for the annual coming of the
        Moonweaver’s Ribbons, great streaks of mutlicolored light that illuminate the northern sky on the winter
        solstice. The skyswimmers and their wyvern mounts seize the strands of light on their spears and paint radiant,
        esoteric portraits in the wintry sky, drawing intrepid outsiders from across Tal’Dorei to camp on remote

        spellwrights frequently return by means of the palace’s teleportation circles, or upon the back of their

        to the palace at the behest of one of the four chief spellwrights, but unless one’s presence is demanded by
        name, these summons are not mandatory. The one summon which cannot be refused, however, is the annual calling of
        the Wonderworker. The nameless, faceless leader of the League of Miracles holds a near-prophetic sway over the
        spellwrights that cannot be understated. When all twenty-four spellwrights are gathered within the conference
        chamber, the Wonderworker intones a slew of cryptic yet unquestionable commandments that all of their followers
        must interpret and obey to the best of their ability.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6f39a658-c546-48a7-bb2d-908c3057b147">Wittebak was once a peaceful city of three thousand
        or more rock gnomes, a safe haven for the small ones that was built into the mountain rock and heated by a
        series of geothermal pools. The Wittebak gnomes weathered great wars by not getting involved, investing in
        contraptions and laughter rather than wars and empires. They found joy in inventing complicated ways to simplify
        their daily lives. Yet, for all their efforts, trouble eventually came to them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f19ed543-fa1c-4703-a589-0dcc36d739fd">Around four hundred years ago, a displaced band of
        hill giants found and luxuriated within Wittebak’s hot springs and made a homestead on their banks. It is said
        that Wittebak was founded underneath the full light of Ruidus, for by pure misfortune, a flaw in the stonework
        of the gnomish city cracked under the force of the giants frolicking within the pools. Worse still, the cave-in
        did more than simply crush a few buildings beneath. The seismic force of thousands of tons of rock collapsed
        into the caverns, cracking open buried pockets of volcanic gas.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dbeebd15-04ee-4fcc-8610-74e7017b770f">Over a thousand gnomes suffocated that night, or
        were incinerated in isolated gas explosions. The survivors fled into the mountains, assailed by hungry giants as
        they ran. The gnomes have found unlikely refuge in Kraghammer, but Wittebak has been abandoned entirely, choked
        by caustic gas and locked in a terrible moment in time. The ten-times great-grandchildren of the giants that
        caused the gnomes to flee now call the hot springs their ancestral home. To them, it is named Gundergrunch, and
        they flourish within their unchallenged territory.</p>

        relatively unharmed, and the full glory of Wittebak’s tinkering shops can be seen here; some even include
        marvels of technology unseen for centuries. Creatures that need to breathe can survive the gases in the widest,
        uppermost level for a number of hours equal to their Constitution modifier, and take 3 (1d6) poison damage each
        minute after that time. The hill giants that live within have adapted to the gas and do not fear it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c92d0029-ca37-420a-9d23-88690a246ba5"><strong>Homesteads.</strong> The air in the middle
        level is heavy with gas, and the quaint gnomish homes on this level are filled with the decomposed remains of
        those too slow to escape. The entire area is lightly obscured with clouds of gas, and tiny streams of hot water
        leak from the walls, tumbling into the level below.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="049e1425-77e4-4ca9-8c51-352b6633d383"><strong>Engine Core.</strong> The bottommost tier is
        a mechanical marvel, a titanic wheel of rusted iron and shining steel with no known purpose. This level is

        option; Gondalorr, prince of the giants, has a tender heart and loves the idea of repatriating Wittebak’s
        gnomes. His sister Gondabrau, on the other hand, is cruel, and would like nothing more than to pop wriggling

        dragonblood, kobolds, and even a few young dragons trying to expand their treasure hoards battle for dominion
        over this ruined vale. When the mountain was the lair of the Cinder King during his first incursion into
        Tal’Dorei, the lizardfolk and kobolds flocked to his side, worshiping his might and cruelty. Though Thordak is
        slain, his influence yet lingers, and his legend draws treasure hunters and would-be tyrants to this place.
        Gold, jewels, and magic items from all ages of the world lie in wait within the dozen or more secret vaults of
        the Cinder King’s lair. When the king of dragons still held dominion here, he had thousands of loyal scaled
        minions at his beck and call, moving invaluable treasures into deeper and deeper holds. Beyond the main cavern
        of the lair, even the Cinder King himself had to magically take humanoid form to traverse the winding tunnels
        his servants carved through the rock.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="66c0bcde-34f0-4e98-a2d4-32f15fbcbecd">The descendants of Thordak’s servitors now fight an
        endless war over his treasure. Every year, it seems a petty new “Cinder King” rises to power within the Ashen
        Gorge, but they are always dethroned before their minions can enter the ancient vaults, still locked after all
        this time. To steal Thordak’s greatest treasures, an adventuring party would have to either broker a peace
        between the warring clans or somehow sneak into the mountain undetected.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d35198c8-2a2e-45d6-9d17-9ae832b5d017">The following major factions fight for control over
        the Ashen Gorge. They make and break their alliances with one faction or another, and then break their new
        alliances just as readily. You can use these factions to inspire adventures set in the Ashen Gorge.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b5faad25-792c-4447-807c-5f6e1f9e8865"><strong>Scions of Flame.</strong> This cult of
        black-scaled lizardfolk claim to have been Thordak’s elite guard in ancient times, and are the current rulers of
        the gorge. They’re led by a five-hundred-year-old druid named Burning Oak, and while his awesome magic keeps the
        other tribes at bay, his frailty makes him vulnerable to attack—and the other tribes know it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6ca10e56-1119-4d52-9174-04baca71c0a9"><strong>Tinysoot.</strong> Every ten years brings a
        new generation of kobolds, and while the Tinysoot tribe’s warriors are not the mightiest, their overwhelming
        numbers have allowed them to overwhelm even the greatest of the Flame Scions’ champions. The Tinysoots’ leader,
        a stubborn young Queen of Soot named Yabber Tinysoot XIX, wears around her neck the key to Everflame Crevasse,
        Thordak’s deepest treasure vault.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c51544b5-b6a2-4bdf-9de5-a831d5bf49c4"><strong>Black Snow.</strong> When Thordak’s ally,
        Umbrasyl, was slain atop Gatshadow, his caustic blood seeped into the corpses of a dozen goliath scouts from the
        Herd of Storms. The black dragons’ magic, combined with the foul power of Gatshadow itself, transformed the
        goliaths into a squadron of undead black dragonblood warriors. Skeletal wings sprouted from their backs, and the
        Black Snow tribe flew instinctively to the Ashen Gorge. They were drawn to the Ruby of Oblivion, a pitch-black
        ruby of immense unholy power—now stored in the Obsidian Geode, a treasure vault guarded by a legion of golems
        and elementals. This squadron of hateful revenants is small, but each one of them wields the strength of twenty
        lesser warriors.</p>

        Chloroxodon, and Snagglefang, a trio of young green dragons, long to plunder Thordak’s lost vaults for their own
        hoards, and demand tribute from the other factions of the Ashen Gorge in exchange for their aid in battle. All
        three are the children of Tatterwing, a feared dragon of the Kirmont Valley, and even if they find themselves on
        opposite sides of a skirmish, they never fight one another, only annihilating the pathetic humanoids beneath

        slopes has transformed this once-lush forest into a morass of rotting vegetation, sulfurous mud, and gnarled,
        weeping trees. So many cruel murders have been committed within the Dreamseep that the very land is cursed,
        forsaken by the gods. Negative energy pools there like water, and the dead drink deep of it. The marsh is
        populated by more than just the walking zombies of killers and their victims—awful amalgamations of dozens of
        bodies, both humanoid and bestial, are birthed within the Dreamseep’s putrid womb.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="197ae8cd-cd9c-429a-a32a-1a40e363d7bf">Somewhere in the middle of this accursed realm is a
        sinkhole that plunges deep beneath the earth. At its deepest point is the Tomb of Udah, a fabled necropolis of
        countless chambers, littered with traps and treasures that have claimed the lives and imaginations of untold
        hundreds. Every death within Udah’s accursed walls only adds to the legions at its dread master’s command;
        characters who explore its tunnels face not only undead warriors in armor from a bygone millennium, but steely

        Dawnfather. Even though the temple to their patron god has crumbled, the people of Bronbog keep the faith; their
        belief in the sun god’s afterlife is their greatest comfort against their meager lives. Yet, for all the gloom
        that surrounds the Dreamseep Marshlands, the Bronboggi maintain a determinedly optimistic disposition. There’s a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c574c262-b02b-4ebd-9c0e-11825dc3c47e">Along the northern base of the Stormcrests is a
        forest locked in perpetual winter, cursed to eternal cold by the invasion of Errevon the Rimelord during the
        Icelost Years. Within the forest, ponds magically freeze into perfect mirrors, reflecting the snowy sky above,
        and the snow-draped trees shelter families of fey hiding from enemies in the Fey Realm. At first, the Frostweald
        seems a wonderland of crisp snow and aromatic pines and firs, yet the serene landscape belies sinister danger.
        Herds of basilisks roam the woods, and travelers who encounter mysterious snow-covered statuaries or copses of
        petrified trees must think fast or join this grisly statuary—permanently.</p>

        Frostweald are hunter-gatherers called the Shivergut. Many of their people are orcs who have lived within the
        Frostweald for generations, but their ranks also include humans, elves, and dwarves who adopted their ways
        centuries ago during the Icelost Years. Most are helpful to travelers, if reserved. Others, however, are dour,
        selfish isolationists who have been apart from other folk for so long that they care more for the thrill of
        bloodshed than a warm conversation over a crackling fire.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a6d5cd1e-5e37-41a1-bcd0-4f75c1ea11ab">The Frostweald is also home to a host of benevolent
        fey, most of them pixies or dryads, using the forest as a safe haven away from the Fey Realm. If pressed for
        answers on why they left the Fey Realm, their answers are cryptic and dissatisfactory, but always ominously
        suggest a “Great Shadow” has descended upon their lands—perhaps even a host of warriors from the Plane of
        Shadow? A nymph named Arethusa watches over a cluster of three mirror-like pools that form a pathway into the
        Fey Realm, each to a different Archfey’s forest. She is suspicious of all mortals, and both her trust and a
        favor are required to gain passage.</p>

            Mentor. If any living creature knows why these ancient monoliths reside here when no other ruins of the
            Knowing Mentor have been discovered, they have kept the knowledge secret from the other scholars of the

                tablet was stolen later that week, along with the rest of Vohr’s findings, but Jorlund keeps a

        legends survive of the mage of Wrettis say he was known as Clemain Astural, the Sight Shephard, and that he was
        a powerful arcanist who peered into a realm beyond the planes in search of power to end the war that ravaged his

        its constituent city-states. A number of plans to expand into Rifenmist have been brought to the Tal’Dorei
        Council, but strong opposition from the Syngornian delegation and the Master of Defense have consistently buried

    <p data-content-chunk-id="9c45763c-060b-41dc-b63e-0b92597178e4">A number of communities exist on the Rifenmist

        unpopulated Mornset Countryside rather than fight against his tyranny. These are the communities that some
        Emonian merchants wish to bring into the fold of Tal’Dorei proper. Farther to the south (and occasionally
        roaming north into Mornset) are the Orroyen elves, a collection of nomadic tribes. The Orroyen and the elves of
        Syngorn see one another as family, and the Syngornian delegation refuses to allow the council to interfere with
        their cousins’ way of life.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b7419aa8-7087-4b63-9514-19d2c69db62c">Beyond the Mornset people and the Orroyen are a
        number of other small, individualistic settlements that live in fear of the imperial power that commands
        Rifenmist: the Iron Authority. Tal’Dorei’s Master of Defense warns the council of provoking this slumbering
        empire, for they are preoccupied with their unholy conquest of the Rifenmist Jungle in the name of their patron
        deity, the Strife Emperor. A number of Orroyen elves and other people of Rifenmist long for Emon’s aid in
        breaking the grip of the Iron Authority, but fear that allowing the Republic of Tal’Dorei to gain a military
        foothold in Rifenmist would simply be trading one imperial master for another.</p>

        Emperor, aided by his legions of brainwashed goblinkin, clashed with the Wildmother and her Free Children.
        Though the Wildmother was victorious and the goblinkin were freed, the site of the Strife Emperor’s defeat was

        the Strife Emperor behind. Centuries later, however, a number of goblinkin still remained among the towering
        iron of the Strife Emperor’s fallen armor. One platoon of hobgoblins, the Iron Regiment, devoted themselves
        wholly to the Strife Emperor, and pledged to revive his glorious legacy of conquest. They press-ganged as many
        of their kin as they could into armies and created the seed of an empire—one which they watered with blood.</p>

        of age and currently being groomed to become a great general. However, Zuun’dak has grown up with trepidation
        regarding the brutality of his society, and after being briefly captured by an outlying Orroyen scouting party
        and learning of the gentler world abroad, he’s begun to long for escape and reformation. When the party stumbles
        upon a disguised and fleeing Zuun’dak, they must decide whether to turn over such a valuable bargaining tool to
        the Orroyen, or aid and groom the defecting heir as a rebellious force against his father.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="516766f5-6f7d-4c4c-a7f5-85c70228ab41">After a long journey south from Syngorn, or north
        from the Rifenmist Jungle, thick foliage gives way to rolling hills and winding rivers. No great cities are to
        be seen here, only an untouched wilderness pockmarked by fortified towns. The Mornset Countryside is home to
        many people whose ancestors fled the rule of Drassig. Most of these people value their privacy—especially from
        Emonian landscape painters who enrich themselves by romanticizing and exoticizing their idyllic way of life.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6fb448f9-f8e6-4bf9-af59-bb6421ee4d8c">The Free Folk of Mornset, as they call themselves,
        include a wide variety of people who have spurned the ways of their forebears. The bulk of these people are the
        descendants of refugees from a long-ago war, but a number of Tal’Dorei people who long for freedom from the
        pressure of modern life have uprooted their lives and journeyed to Mornset to start anew. Likewise, some Orroyen
        elves who dislike the nomadic lifestyle find homes in the small communities of Mornset.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="26a68182-69ee-47db-8c77-cdf3bbbeee12">Beyond those who follow their hearts to this realm,
        Mornset is also home to a number of criminals fleeing persecution. Most Free Folk don’t ask questions about
        newcomers’ pasts, and welcome them regardless. However, if these particular outlanders don’t leave their past
        behind and continue to harm others, or bring bounty hunters (or worse) in their wake, every village in Mornset
        has a well-trained militia that will eagerly remove dangerous folk from their midst.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="783e721c-285d-4bce-a403-e0de2dd2d5e5">Bound by the necessity of survival, the people of
        this land share a common code of honor called the Fundaments. This code holds all to a baseline of respect for
        all travelers and outcasts, and codifies ancient principles of hospitality. Each denizen of the countryside
        looks out for their neighbor, and if a person in need arrives upon one’s doorstep, the hospitality of food and
        shelter must be provided.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="10e48ecb-e048-4e1c-9a2f-dd9313866fbb">It is understood that the Fundaments may be taken
        advantage of by ruffians and power-hungry upstarts. Nevertheless, this code of honor has served the Free Folk
        well for centuries, and anyone who scorns it is looked upon with disdain and mistrust. Most of the Mornset Free
        Folk are humanoids, but many free settlements have alliances with the local hill giants, cyclopes, and ogres
        that help protect them against the Iron Authority to the south.</p>

        unexpectedly—and suddenly—flying into a rage both mindless and destructive. Many within the village are
        confused, fearing a plague of violent madness, and they seek adventurers (especially parties with clerics or
        skilled healers) to save them. Investigation by the party reveals that each individual driven to these fits is
        connected to the town alchemist’s dark past and a failed herbalism experiment from ten years ago, when she lived

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ecf9081a-ed50-4bd2-a418-909e79e02fe2">The northernmost and largest town in the Mornset
        Countryside, Byroden borders the Gladepools and marks the first stop for any traveler on their way to the
        Rifenmist Peninsula. It’s also a hub of trade for the entire Mornset Countryside, and even some trappers and
        artisans of the Verdant Expanse. The town has a dense town center surrounded by palisades and tall wooden walls,
        but most of the community lives in homesteads and farmhouses spread across the surrounding fields. Byroden is
        mostly self-sufficient, and has a wealth of farmers, fishers, artisans, and miners, giving them everything they
        need to survive. Trade provides the opportunity for some luxuries, with raw materials serving as their primary
        currency.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="46d4eb00-df95-4ea8-82b6-78b93fe67e84">While pleasant and welcoming on the outside, this
        lifestyle is protected by a fierce and intense drive to defend the community’s way of life at the first sign of
        threat or danger. Most citizens are armed at all times, trained to rise as a communal militia at a moment’s
        notice from the war ringer, a sentinel charged with the town’s protection.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0cdf42ba-7164-4c6e-b42f-ebbcdf802cd1">Despite (or perhaps because of) the ever-present
        dangers that threaten Byroden, the town holds frequent festivals, feasts, and fairs, including the highly
        anticipated Gem of Byroden pageant and the midsummer Peachiest Pie bake-off. On festival days, small children
        roam freely within the protective town walls as their parents enjoy the chance to let loose and celebrate life

    <p data-content-chunk-id="52d02661-a386-4c6a-9281-b604d2010907">A few miles north of the center of Byroden is a
        gaping chasm. An earthquake thirty years ago split open Deercrest Hill. The chasm is referred to officially as
        Deercrest Ravine, but is known to most superstitious folk in town as Hillmaw Chasm. After the earthquake, locals
        stayed as far away from the chasm as they could—until four years later, when a group of adventurers found vast
        veins of precious gold and sturdy iron within. Soon, all people of Byroden strong enough to swing a pick or lift
        a shovel made their way into the chasm.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="414d362a-2b81-44d6-b50a-79a62f78fb12">Most miners hire an armed escort because the chasm
        is known to be home to grumpy earth elementals, as well as unpleasant, slimy creatures of the dark. Most serious
        beliefs about the chasm being haunted have dissipated over the past thirty years. Still, rumors persist, and as
        folklore becomes myth, some say that myth can become reality.</p>

        knees by Thordak the Cinder King. This incursion was about two decades before the Cinder King’s destruction of
        Emon, and it was stopped by an adventuring party led by Allura Vysoren, now a senior member of the Tal’Dorei
        Council. Many in Byroden still see Allura, Lady Kima of Vord, and Drake Thunderbrand as heroes. The graves of
        the companions they lost in that fight, Sirus Kaldrem, Dohla Lorian, and Ghenn Talevesh, hold places of honor in
        the town cemetery.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="355a05f9-1b03-4fb2-8da3-c3ed60dd5c01">While Byroden has long-since been built anew, the
        terror of that day still lives on in its elders and adults. All but the youngest generation of Byroden takes
        great caution against another such monstrous attack—as well as against any attack by the Iron Authority to the

        invasion, the town’s war ringer deputizes the characters and offers them a handsome sum of money to investigate
        the scouting camp. Their goal is simple: learn the interlopers’ mission, either by interrogating their commander
        or by finding a written command note. And, if the characters can capture or eliminate the scouts before the

        investigate—only for them to disappear as well. Just a day before the characters are asked for help, the
        townsfolk of Byroden discovered with horror that the vanished mercenaries have also appeared in their dreams.

        called the Qoniira made Rifenmist their home. During the Age of Arcanum, the Qoniira Tetrarchy grew from a loose
        coalition of towns led by arcanists, clerics of the Wildmother, and druids who spoke with the jungle around
        them. These towns were inhabited by humans and the animal-bodied humanoids of the jungle. The first stones of
        the Qoniiran heart-city Niirdal-Poc were laid by the broad, towering elephantine people, and places for new
        settlements were scouted out by catfolk seers whose eyes glistened with starlight.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="844df876-e1ed-47b0-8240-2c1c4d62ac81">In time, the Qoniira civilization grew into a
        Tetrarchy, with four great satellite cities and the central heart-city of Niirdal-Poc. The tetrarchs established
        their cities with mathematical precision. A constellation of the night sky guided them—Surrac’s Shield, a
        four-starred diamond with a fifth star in its center. The constellation still shines over Rifenmist and southern
        Exandria today. The four outer cities of Qoniira match the points of Surrac’s shield precisely, and Niirdal-Poc
        is aligned with its center star.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="79a8f29e-6b74-49de-9e8d-88058e533ec1">The Calamity struck at the peak of Qoniiran
        civilization, yet rather than take up arms against gods and mortals, the tetrarchs opted to remove themselves
        from the world—not unlike the elves of Syngorn to the north. Something happened in Niirdal-Poc, some sort of
        magic that even the Qoniirans of today do not understand.</p>

        Its satellites are little more than crumbling ruins. Something shifted in the magic of the jungle when the
        Qoniirans chose not to fight in the Calamity. The Rifenmist Jungle closed its boughs against the world,
        shielding the city. When the Strife Emperor died on the Beynsfal Plateau to the south, the Qoniirans knew
        nothing of it. All the tumult of the world passed them by.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="488949b1-5ad5-4994-af92-25ea9dfbb770">The Rifenmist Jungle sunk Niirdal-Poc into a deep
        basin, and its thick canopies shield it from above, while its intertwining boughs hold the heart-city tightly in
        its embrace. Few are permitted by the protective, ancient magic of the Qoniirans to enter the city. Its people
        live contentedly within Niirdal-Poc, only occasionally traveling outside their basin to trade with Orroyen
        nomads or, in mythically rare instances, with the town of Byroden.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fc4717ec-76e5-406a-a9be-4e75e70aa46a">The four ruins which surround Niirdal-Poc are:</p>

        north of Niirdal-Poc was the agricultural hub of Qoniira. Some farmers have opted to live outside the basin and
        tend to these still-fertile lands. They are few, for magic is able to supply food for most people of
        Niirdal-Poc.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4ae384df-40dc-4284-ad6d-3fad66654f9a"><strong>Niirdal-Teek.</strong> This outer city, east
        of Niirdal-Poc, was an academic center of the Qoniiran civilization. Most of the city is one vast university
        that once was populated by over 30,000 people. Some explorers venture into these ruins to find lost knowledge.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e4621075-5ab5-4f6b-8c14-7db345aa3352"><strong>Niirdal-Sarqet.</strong> Located south of
        Niirdal-Poc, this outer city was a center of faith for the Qoniirans. All that remains of the sacred city is a
        vast, floating cube called the Hexahedron of Sarqet. It is adorned with statues of the Prime Deities and the
        Betrayer Gods alike, and none living know what is inside its unbreachable walls. Even today, modern Qoniiran
        priests teach that balance is the true way of the world, telling their people to invoke the names of the Prime
        Deities for blessings, and of the Betrayer Gods for curses.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="82d7154a-c66d-4b04-bbba-a4d8c5f32d73"><strong>Niirdal-Hup.</strong> Precious little
        remains of this fortress-city, the heart of the Qoniiran military. A common parable reminds those who hear it to
        not fight fate—for of all the ruined cities, only the city of warriors was reduced to dust.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4b005e6f-9e8d-4481-b0cd-d0f6b63e8963">All of these ruins are filled with statues from the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e0ee7818-5ef8-488a-abe7-cbcde14309aa">The Tetrarchy of Qoniira, in ages past, was ruled by
        four tetrarchs, each of whom ruled one of the civilization’s four outer cities. In times where the fate of
        Qoniira was at a crossroads, they gathered within the heart-city to guide the course of their civilization
        together.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="63bd8a79-c3bc-4999-acac-4c6b0d6597a3">The relative autonomy of the four outer cities and
        the looseness of the coalition that bound them seems at odds with the perfect precision with which the cities
        were built, so precisely matching the stars in the sky. The Qoniirans have always been an easygoing people who
        typically follow the flow of fate, rather than fight against it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="501adc8a-a16d-4e09-ba6f-4e2469575cab">Today, the tetrarchy survives, even though the four
        outer cities are in ruins. They gather daily in the Hakredic Dome, an architecturally magnificent granite
        rotunda adorned with an outer layer of grayish-purple porphyry stone and lifelike, reddish porphyry statues.
        There, the tetrarchs and their advisors work to keep life simple and content for their people.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="361f1b7f-7ad8-4670-8bdd-a92b68a744db">The tetrarchy is a hereditary office, but city-wide
        elections are held between eligible heirs to determine which heir should take up their parent’s mantle.
        Elections are also held when a tetrarch’s line ends without heirs—often giving advisors a chance to gain power
        by virtue of their service to the city.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2a832f98-9d2a-4a19-a41f-9ddaba8d1243">Magic suffuses the city of Niirdal-Poc. Its magic is
        something older than the gods, or the Calamity, or anything wielded by mortals today. However, the mortal mages
        of Niirdal-Poc wield the same arcane force gifted by the gods, and its druids and clerics touch upon the power
        of the gods behind the Divine Gate, just as Exandria’s other mortal peoples do.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7d83f0ff-c1c8-471b-bcba-cced85498c28">Both ancient and modern magic mingle in Niirdal-Poc,
        for the patterns of the ancient powers are mysterious, and its methods are unknowable. Some call it the Light of
        Fate, others the Blessing of the Stars. The most common name is simply “the Gift.” It was the Gift that
        protected Niirdal-Poc in the Calamity. It is the Gift that causes miracles to occur, like a person surviving a
        fall from the heights of Vedrim’s Pinnacle to the streets of the city. It is the Gift that causes the Hexahedron
        of Sarqet to hover mysteriously; it is the Gift that surrounds the Statue of the Observer, a four-winged feline
        humanoid figure in the city’s center, with a broken halo of ashen-gold light—and that causes that same light to
        flicker within the lamps of the city.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4d0ea8fc-3906-4482-8e59-06906b376e9e"><strong>Nomadic Tribes:</strong> Population 11,850
        (64% elves, 12% half-elves, 10% humans, 14% other races)</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c05196ec-63f8-4373-a86d-af5ec991878c">Born from a wandering colony fleeing the Calamity,
        these wood elves have not just survived within the jungles of Rifenmist—they have flourished. Learning the
        dangers of the surrounding lands, refining their hunting techniques, and maintaining a healthy arms-length
        relationship with outsiders, the Orroyen call the jungle their domain and protect it furiously.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0614fee2-d482-4c58-a988-34d24486d82a">The Orroyen tribes have no central government, and
        their membership shifts as different clans move through the region and encounter other tribes, sometimes trading
        members as they go. Elders are given the most oversight and respect among a traveling tribe, the eldest given
        the title of <em>dura</em>, and the duty of leading their tribe. Each nomadic group maintains a population of
        anywhere between a hundred and a thousand people. Temporary lodging is constructed at each resting point, called
        a <em>tomenda</em>. Most Orroyen groups remain at a tomenda they’ve constructed for about two years, before
        depletion of resources or the arrival of dangerous creatures or soldiers forces them to move on. Countless
        abandoned tomenda can be found throughout the jungle, and Orroyen clans will frequently make camp in old tomenda
        made by a different tribe—it is considered a gift from the jungle.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f04f62ac-a3ee-4708-b41e-1dbdf7874fe8">To come into prominence within the tribe, or request
        admittance into the tribes as an ally or member, a hopeful entrant must complete a series of ceremonial trials.
        These trials change from dura to dura, but are designed to test strength of body and mind. It is not uncommon
        for those who attempt these trials to return maimed, or to not return at all, and many elders bear the marks and
        scars of their trials long past. Few outlanders from the north, known as <em>orfindes</em> to the Orroyen, have
        been allowed into any of the dozens of Orroyen tribes, and the elders have little intention of changing this,
        for they have heard distant tales of the ancient tyranny of Drassig and the supernatural horrors the people of
        northern Gwessar invite upon themselves.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="73202443-4586-41dc-b410-e6cb867be41a">Nevertheless, the Orroyen are practical, not
        prideful. They trade often with the Free Folk of Mornset, and sometimes even travel as far north as Byroden to
        trade rare goods. There, some Orroyen meet people from Syngorn or beyond and share stories of their lands. Love
        can bloom in these meetings of separate worlds, and sometime results in an orfinde being brought into an Orroyen
        clan. And sometimes curious Orroyen leave simply to see the world beyond the jungle.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="99cad519-841f-487f-b951-b08db4609da8">The jungles that cover Tal’Dorei’s southern expanses
        are a vast wilderness. Many elves call this lush landscape their home, particularly those of the nomadic Orroyen
        Tribes. There is no doubt that this jungle is as magical and mysterious as Tal’Dorei’s temperate forests, for
        the jungle’s greenery is home to countless mystical spirits, ferocious monsters, and arcane mysteries. The
        vine-strangled floors of the jungle are clustered with swollen trunks, spine-laden ferns, and carnivorous plant
        life that waits for the unknowing wanderer to make an incorrect step.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a6583f98-d390-4697-a705-45114a6a7e27">The sweltering heat of the sun-baked peninsula grows
        even more oppressive beneath the jungle’s humid canopy. Clusters of venomous insects buzz through the
        mist-shrouded trees, alongside large lizards, and wild beasts in search of carrion. Sunken valleys lead to
        pockets of marshland or quicksand pit traps, while others are wrought with a dire, spreading fungus. Those who
        have lived all their lives in this environment know its dangers well and have hundreds of years of precautions
        to take against them. On the other hand, those who venture into the jungle from northern Tal’Dorei rarely
        return, and those that do warn others to never make the same mistake.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="60067664-54f3-4b6a-8dac-7846f0c9e36a">The farther south one travels into Rifenmist, the
        denser the jungle grows. Though some elves and humans of northern Tal’Dorei have attempted to colonize the
        jungles for their vast resources in decades past, they were quickly rebuffed by the Orroyen elves of the jungle.
        Their message is clear: no cities are to be built south of the jungle’s edge—and if the northern jungles are
        cleared or burned, the trees’ vengeance will be swift and just. The Tal’Dorei Council reacted quickly as
        well—the elves of the jungle are to be heeded. The few settlers who have joined the Free Folk of the Mornset
        Countryside are deeply superstitious about the southern jungles, and rarely travel deeper than they need to in
        order to parley with their Orroyen allies.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="48b846ec-9110-4dbe-8edd-e272fb94f8a9">Even the Iron Authority, who has been at war with
        the trees of the jungle itself for decades, has not managed to destroy their foe. The Orroyen nomads fear the
        conquerors of Beynsfal Plateau and the massive armies supplied to them by their authoritarian leaders. Their
        raids ebb and flow as imperial leaders rise and fall. Each new era begins with a bold and cruel warlord rallying
        their people against their age-old enemy. War is waged, and countless innocents and Authority soldiers perish in
        a senseless fight. And then resources run low, morale dips, and the legions return to the Beynsfal Plateau to
        lick their wounds.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a75a4cbb-064a-4bd9-bc2d-cbdca2bda6fb">Legend holds that the jungle will never die, so long
        as even one of the Orroyen lives within it. So far, history has only proved the jungle’s enduring strength.</p>

        tampered with the seed and unleashed powers beyond their control. The titan has begun to develop and wake from
        its eons-long slumber. If the process isn’t halted, it will fully awaken and terrorize the continent. However,

        <p>The Iron Authority is a despicable society that embodies all the evils of ruthless authoritarianism. This
            includes the subjugation of innocents, racial supremacy, poverty, and slavery. People at your gaming table

        Iron Emperor Tz’Jarr is the supreme military commander of the empire, loyally served by the four royal generals

        laborers, sent to chisel iron scraps from the Strife Emperor’s fallen armor, or to venture back into the lower
        jungles to forage for food. The elite of the Iron Authority sometimes play at benevolence by granting
        comfortable jobs indoors to slaves skilled in the arts—such as personal portrait-painters, musicians, or
        sculptors. Such kindnesses are rarely a sign of true mercy; they are more likely a simple (and meager)
        expression of guilt.</p>

        like heirlooms from generation to generation. Elves are treasured possessions by the Authority’s despicable

        heavy price. The Authority’s hobgoblin elite are well suited to such a climate, but their goblin and bugbear
        slaves suffer as they toil—as do the Orroyen elves, whose life in the shady, humid boughs of the Rifenmist
        Jungle has left them unprepared for the blistering heat of the plateau.</p>

        of massive, unbridled forest shroud the landscape in mystery and shadow. This dense greenwood was for centuries
        traversed by few but the elves of Tal’Dorei, for it was known to be their domain, and theirs alone. Even in the
        time of Zan Tal’Dorei, when her rebels and their elven allies saved the realm from tyranny, it was understood
        that the coasts were humanity’s domain, and the woods were that of elvenkind. Times have changed, however. The
        alliances formed to oppose Thordak the Cinder King united virtually all of Tal’Dorei’s disparate peoples, and
        many more than simply elves now walk the shaded paths of the Verdant Expanse. Even so, much of the Expanse is
        protected by the watchful eyes of the Wardens of Syngorn, as it has been for hundreds of years.</p>

        untamed wilderness, and bands of dark elf raiders from Ruhn-Shak prowl the forest under cover of night. This
        enchanted wood holds the decay of the seasons at bay, and its trees are green year-round.</p>

        cluster of broken ponds and lakes that ever draw fresh water from the Stormcrest Mountains to the east, along
        with saltwater from the Ozmit Sea to the west. The strange mix of habitats across this somewhat marshy grassland
        has led to unusual ecosystems and odd, dangerous denizens, which in turn has drawn the attention of many
        fishermen from the Rifenmist region, and of Syngornian hunters from within the Verdant Expanse.</p>

        Tal’Dorei. Syngornian tradition tells of an oracle’s spirit that is bound to the lakes, and when given
        sufficient offering and respect, the oracle will emerge to grant sufficiently reverent supplicants a cryptic

        their boughs. These ancient trees cluster and twist into a labyrinth of knotted roots and branches, while a
        tangled canopy of drooping foliage and gray moss blocks the sky from view. Strange powers dwell within the
        Mirescar, and beasts and travelers that wander into its depths often emerge with their hearts and flesh touched

        operations, beyond Syngorn’s walls, called the Shifting Keep. It is built within and around a cluster of
        massive, living trees that form the heart of the Verdant Expanse, and enchanted with the most powerful illusion
        magic that could be mustered by Syngorn’s military arcanists and their guild of Spellbenders. Enchantments woven
        into the keep’s foundations allow it to cloak its presence, seemingly vanishing and reappearing elsewhere within
        the forest at will.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4be99ddf-6f03-4afc-8418-4ef9bbb3c771">The Shifting Keep can’t teleport, but it can turn
        invisible and project an illusion of itself to any point within a mile of its true location. This remarkable
        enchantment has made it almost impossible for invaders to besiege the keep, and it played a major role in
        Syngorn’s victory against Neminar Drassig in the Scattered War—tales of the unassailable Shifting Keep are told
        in Syngorn to this day. Nearly a thousand trained elven warriors, hunters, and spies call the Shifting Keep
        their home, though many spend their time patrolling and exploring the Verdant Expanse. These rangers are
        vigilant, seeking signs of whatever foolish invaders would dare trifle with the might of Syngorn.</p>

        The remnants of the fallen Court of Ullusa fled to the Fey Realm for a generation following the end of the Age
        of Arcanum, returning only when Yenlara found the realm safe to return. These four hundred survivors built a new
        home, taking inspiration from their temporary home among the fey, and formed the foundations of Syngorn. Though
        elves have spread all across Tal’Dorei, even as far as the frigid Neverfields, there was once a time where
        nearly all of them resided in Syngorn.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e2c05137-7c24-445f-8fc2-7321eee47041">This beautiful city of curving stone is built in
        harmony with the trees of the Expanse and sits against the western base of the Stormcrest Mountains. It is all
        but impervious to external assault—not simply because of its 40-foot-high walls of ivy-covered jade, and not
        only because it’s also surrounded by living trees of the Verdant Expanse and beacons of detection that keep
        constant vigil for intruders. No, Syngorn is virtually unassailable because every entrance to the city is warded
        by a series of threshold crests: massive emblems of a crescent moon, flanked by two trees, over a deep cerulean
        stone. These enchanted stones act as an anchor to the Fey Realm, where Syngorn’s founders once recovered,
        allowing the city itself to vanish tracelessly into the Fey Realm as a final act of preservation.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="deae1897-7a79-44d4-b72f-354f227f4196">The Guildrunner manages the city’s treasury and
        oversees commerce within Syngorn’s borders. The Voice of Memory is a heralded keeper of history and culture, and
        is often seen interacting with the elven people, gathering new memories for the archives. The High Warden has
        always been of Yenlara’s bloodline, and is responsible for keeping order within Syngorn and its territories, as

    <p data-content-chunk-id="47b61899-53d9-424e-bd31-8bf525364c7b">Syngorn is steeped in elven tradition that dates
        back to before the Divergence. The arts are lauded and revered, the pursuit of knowledge is respected and
        encouraged, and some training in refined martial techniques is culturally expected. The idea of trade between
        other cities and nations is understood to be both healthy and beneficial, but most foreign trade and travel is
        relegated to outer areas of the city.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="60a3b4bd-deaf-4f4b-b4b7-c26da43e4869">There was a time that few foreigners ever saw
        Syngorn’s innermost reaches, but that time has passed. Syngorn’s gates are open to travelers from across
        Tal’Dorei—though all who visit the city are bound by Syngorn’s strict cultural laws to respect their
        millennia-old traditions. Any who disrespect the ways of Syngorn are warned but once, and are thrown out of the
        city thereafter. Delicate crafts by Syngornian hands are sought after by collectors around the world, so many
        Syngornians take up the trade for both profit and honor.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="50cd0f8b-496b-4aac-8674-aa1455bfb7e6">In a populace made up of people who are
        extraordinarily long-lived, having children is a rare and highly-regulated process. Prospective parents must
        gain approval from the office of the Voice of Memory to procreate, and any unapproved children are sent out of
        the city to be raised in outposts or foreign cities. All elves call such an occasion “regrettable,” and truly do
        treat it with sorrow—but the laws of Syngorn are clear on this point, and few elves are willing to speak out
        against rulings which have stood for a thousand years.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5b4b1b62-b784-4d59-bf46-58133ef8dbbd">If Syngorn appears free of crime, it’s because elven
        criminals have hundreds of years of experience at lurking in the shadows. A thriving market for illegal goods
        runs invisibly through the city’s guilds. Though time often seems to stand still in Syngorn, crime moves with
        the same celerity as it does in other cities—it must, if the criminal underbelly wants to stay one step ahead of
        the Wardens of Syngorn.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fc0d6722-c146-4bd9-a9b0-2de4909b9390">The most common contraband to pass through Syngorn
        are shipments of suude, stolen goods, and dwarven trinkets. Many come to Syngorn to purchase these goods for a
        low price on the black market, but those unwilling to make a journey and risk being stopped by the Verdant Guard
        can wait for these goods to make their way up to Kymal, where they can be purchased at an outrageous markup of

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e0882c0b-ccc8-43e4-bea7-32cecd3c8a1d">Most people in Syngorn have their basic needs taken
        care of by the city’s government, to ensure the wellbeing of their people. Nevertheless, some people still fall
        into poverty, and these destitute individuals are often preyed upon by pickpockets, swindlers, and smugglers who
        seek to use them as patsies for a paltry sum of gold.</p>

        winter is present, but minimal.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9f5f006f-6c06-43ff-ae88-7c3774d33f3b">Syngorn is broken up into six main districts and has
        a variety of neighborhoods:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="30ce1513-8853-4b1d-8347-6ffdf8f367eb"><strong><em>Memory Ward.</em></strong> The mind of
        Syngorn is contained within a ring of marble walls in Syngorn’s northeast reaches. A winding stair, the One
        Thousand Steps, leads up to its lofty gate. Standing in the center of its grand court is the mystical Sequoia of
        Remembrance, a three-hundred-foot-tall redwood within which are stored the lives and memories of every elf in
        Tal’Dorei. At least, those whose bodies are brought before the sequoia and are granted the Rite of Remembrance,
        as performed by the Voice of Memory and her disciples, have their memories preserved and added to the
        collective. Nearly all elves in Syngorn receive this rite, and a vast number of elves who live elsewhere write
        into their wills that they must be subject to the rite after their death.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="47d2bdab-e6cf-4aa2-a6fb-1ee6b9c2c3db">Wisps of violet light flit about the sequoia’s
        ancient boughs, and those who look closely into their centers have been known to catch glimpses of eras past,
        troubles present, and things that yet may be. The great redwood and its spirits are watched and tended to by the
        Dreamweavers, elves who have dedicated their waking and sleeping lives to the protection of their heritage.
        About five hundred Dreamweavers and five thousand scholars, merchants, and other elves call this district their
        home.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="00a8025c-9f23-4ff4-9215-6acf12b9d7c7">The elves are a culture obsessed with tradition and
        the past. As such, the Dreamweavers are among the most well-respected factions within Syngorn. Their leader,
        Ouestra, the Voice of Memory, is likewise the most revered and socially powerful of the Wardens.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7276827f-3eb8-4b09-a981-a373d8490907"><strong><em>Beryl Keep.</em></strong> This
        fortress-district houses the martial might of Syngorn. Situated on a hill in the northwest of the city, thick
        walls of leaf-green beryl separate the district from the rest of the city. Within these walls are rows of
        barracks, archery ranges, trance chambers, forges, mess halls, and all the other necessities to train an army of
        long-lived elves. At the far northwest of the district is the Beryl Keep itself. The near-unassailable fortress
        proves the saying that even the most utilitarian of elven things are beautiful to mortal eyes. Six eucalyptus
        trees of unknown age mark the boundaries of the keep, and between them grows a thick curtain of ironbark. A
        dense canopy of impenetrable steelfern forms its roof. Legend says that when Syngorn’s need is greatest, the six
        ancient eucalyptus trees that guard the keep will uproot and march as mighty treants to defend the city.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="db035f39-ba21-46ab-8669-d3a5b2b67291">The Beryl Keep is commanded by Verdant Lord
        Celindar, Syngorn’s master strategist. He possesses a <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"
            href="/magic-items/4864-crystal-ball-of-true-seeing" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/4864-tooltip">crystal
            ball of true seeing</a> within his war room, which he can use to scry upon any part of the Verdant Expanse
        and to pierce any illusion. From this vantage point, he commands his forces like a chess master, always one step
        ahead of the threats within the enchanted forest. So far, Syngorn remains safe because its enemies are wild and
        disorganized. Were they to unify, the might of the Verdant Guard would truly be put to the test.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d66d7e28-de5b-4e26-bf00-51c0236c7ab3">The armies of Syngorn are about five thousand elves
        strong, though only about three thousand are within this district at any time. The rest are stationed at
        outposts within the Verdant Expanse and the Fey Realm.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="75b50d1e-2cbc-4bd1-895e-e334465c101e"><strong><em>Tarn Ward.</em></strong> Syngorn’s
        central ward is a peaceful commerce district surrounding Lake Ywynnlas and split by the channels that feed it.
        From sunrise to sunset, no business is conducted here, save for food service at public houses and beds at inns.
        During the daylight hours, elves socialize, play, sing songs, write poetry, paint great works of art, and
        meditate here. Elves are long-lived, and if half the day is not spent in peace and self-improvement, it is
        thought that the day was truly wasted, no matter how productive one might have been in matters of business.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0476e1cf-684a-45c0-bb17-fca47ad4c692">At nightfall, however, the Tarn Ward changes. The
        Tarn Thoroughfare opens at moonrise, lit only by the heavens and by magical, floating lanterns. The streets are
        silent but for the ethereal elvensong that guides those who know how to listen through the streets. Elves and
        half-elves raised in Syngorn know this musical language, but those unfamiliar with it must use a <a
            class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2035-comprehend-languages"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2035-tooltip">comprehend languages</a> spell to follow the melody. When the river
        of sound guides a customer to a vendor, they speak in hushed Elvish, like an audience whispering at the theatre.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="862be31b-fd2a-43af-87dd-0ed7bd566643">Most shops along the Tarn Thoroughfare are
        affiliated with one of three guilds—the Spellbenders’ Guild, the Elvencraft Alliance, or the Mithral
        Fellowship—and the sly Guildrunner Rawndel sits at the head of all three. The Warden of this district, Rawndel
        lives in a permanent <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2179-magnificent-mansion"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2179-tooltip">magnificent mansion</a> with a façade adorned with splendid fey
        grotesques, and is respected by elven merchants and nobles alike. The elves don’t seem to mind his monopoly on
        Thoroughfare trade, as their lives haven’t been affected much, but High Warden Tirelda worries of the long-term
        consequences of Rawndel’s power-hungry behavior.</p>
    <aside class="text--tcsr-sidebar" id="SyngornianGoods">
        <p>Syngornian Goods</p>
        <p>Any basic goods can be purchased in Syngorn at twice their usual cost. These goods, however, are of fine
            elven make. Weapons have a +1 bonus to damage rolls, horses and other mounts increase their movement speed
            by 10 feet, and other items are possessed of unearthly beauty and preternatural durability. All common magic
            items can be easily found here, and any uncommon magic item has a 50% chance of being found here in the
            ward’s many market stalls. Finding magic items of greater rarity requires a character to make a DC 21

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1e0c6e6c-d957-4ef2-9a17-c4597041e882"><strong><em>Emerald Citadel.</em></strong> The great
        palace of Syngorn looms high over the north of the city—a mighty castle of faded white marble, now covered with
        climbing ivy and sprouting plants. As the highest point in the gradually sloping city, its emerald-tipped spires
        can be seen from anywhere below. Visitors to the citadel first climb a grand set of stairs, curved like a
        flowing river of marble, before reaching its brass gates. The Verdant Guard aggressively protects the castle’s
        main entrance, rejecting any commoner who does not have an invitation to the palace marked with the High
        Warden’s seal. High Warden Tirelda’s monocled majordomo, a silver-haired elf named Ibbimas, screens all of the
        High Warden’s supplicants.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cb677a32-e947-4d41-af29-4789514cf340">The palace’s high, vaulted ceilings are supported by
        pillars of gleaming marble carved in the image of tall elm trees, such that the ceilings are a canopy of
        polished stone. Beautiful portraits and busts of past Wardens line the walls, along with opulent tapestries of
        Yenlara and the creation of Syngorn. The citadel is made up of four main levels. The basement levels hold the
        castle dungeons, as well as grand vaults containing fabulous treasure, historical artifacts, and overwrought
        gifts—the latter given by emissaries uncertain of how to present a gift fine enough for an elven monarch. The
        first floor holds lush quarters for ambassadors and visiting dignitaries. The second floor’s chambers are
        dedicated to business of state, including the High Warden’s throne room. The towers above the citadel contain
        studies and quarters for the High Warden and her family.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="08e4985e-a41d-4306-9b96-c0bc6c058f21"><strong><em>Feygrove.</em></strong> A once-splendid
        manor house in southern Syngorn is now completely overgrown with plant life. Massive mulberry trees sprout at
        odd angles out of windows and through gables, and fairy lights dance around the house at all hours of the day.
        When Syngorn returned from the Fey Realm after the Conclave’s defeat, the elves unintentionally brought a little
        of the Fey Realm with them. A number of fey creatures slipped through a gate from the Fey Realm to Exandria,
        then wriggled through Syngorn’s defenses and made their home in the mansion of an elven noblewoman named Lady
        Ladri Il’shavfa. She has tried for years to reclaim her home, but even the patience of elves wears thin; the fey
        are simply too numerous and too tenacious to be kicked out for good.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="81dfa458-8c70-42f0-b53a-5d953f2498da">The fey interlopers, however, are having the time of
        their lives. Far from merely throwing nightly parties—though they do that, too—they have made Il’shavfa Manor a
        place for them to experiment with wild new magic. Their leader, a pixie prince named Windybranch, has found
        great pleasure in planting strange fey plants in the house and watching as they integrate with the mansion. The
        house is now a living, breathing, thinking thing—a new friend for the fey! It keeps the elves out and it’s a
        great conversationalist! To the fey, this arrangement has no downsides! The fairies have named this manor after
        the Archfey who first allowed them into the city. To them, their new home is Artagan’s Lodge (and it’s said that
        the Archfey Artagan occasionally stays within its walls when he visits Tal’Dorei).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5efed783-1f73-4529-8fcd-cc04f6c98474">Since the Feygrove was first “founded” over twenty
        years ago, the fey have spilled out of Il’shavfa Manor and made an entire district of the city into their home.
        By this point, only the most stubborn of elven nobility still gripe about “the fey menace” within their midst.
        Most of Syngorn’s residents are delighted to have a district filled with the fey, even if it causes the southern
        end of the city to be a little more chaotic than usual. The fey here seem to have kind hearts, and their chaos
        rarely crosses the line from churlish pranks into cruelty.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a18cf8b7-fe1d-404a-b9f7-c5c492ecc712"><strong><em>Reverie Walks.</em></strong> The
        artistic and spiritual center of Syngorn is a winding labyrinth of living trees and stones. Elves who seek a
        day-long (or days-long) journey of meditation may wander the Reverie Walks, entering a trance-like state as they
        do so. Those who seek true enlightenment may dedicate years of their near-immortal lives to wandering the
        ever-shifting labyrinth, finding peace in isolation or in search of the Stone of the Arch Heart in the
        labyrinth’s center. An elven monk named Lyssev Sorveline has walked the labyrinth for five hundred years,
        seeking answers to questions even the gods do not know. Some elves leave gifts of food for the Wanderer within
        the labyrinth, allowing them to continue their eternal meditation in peace.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e8a77ce0-a22b-4e98-a658-29c58413a648">No Warden holds sway over the Reverie Walks. Legend
        holds that the living stones and trees that shift the labyrinth are devotees of the Arch Heart that swore to be
        their god’s eternal wardens.</p>

                Guildhall.</em></strong> The Elvencraft Alliance is supposedly the oldest guild in Syngorn. They are
        entrusted with creating works of art that spread the culture of Syngorn far and wide across Tal’Dorei. The front
        rooms of their guildhall are a museum of fine elven crafts from ages past, and they’re open to all who wish to
        appreciate Syngorn’s cultural heritage.</p>

        stone and leering fey statues, yet if one were to look inside, they would find it completely empty. The door,
        which is constantly locked to all but the Guildrunner and his guests, is actually a portal to an
        extradimensional space containing a manor of supernatural beauty and luxury.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="33f21643-a33e-43c3-93aa-828d788557d3"><strong><em>3. Mithral Fellowship
                Guildhall.</em></strong> The master metallurgists and smiths of the Mithral Fellowship are tasked with
        arming the Verdant Guard and the armies of Syngorn. In peacetime, they turn their talents to creating things of
        beauty from metal and jewels, sometimes in tandem with the artists of the Elvencraft Alliance. Due to their
        military involvement, none but authorized members of the fellowship are allowed within their guildhall.</p>

        This winding stair is the only way in or out of the Memory Ward. Each step is inscribed with an ancient elven
        idiom, aphorism, or impossible philosophical question. Anyone who enters the Memory Ward is told to read the
        aphorism upon the first step and ponder it the entire time they are climbing the stairway. If they find peace in
        their answer, they are to read the inscription of the second step on their next journey, and so on. There are
        few, even among the elves, who have pondered the inscriptions of all of the steps to their satisfaction.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="41ac1222-2711-4f2f-ac7a-b1b52a254b4b"><strong><em>5. Spires of Yurek.</em></strong> Roads
        lined with dormitories and vendors radiate out from the branches of the Sequoia of Remembrance to the walls of
        the Memory Ward, providing essentials for not only the Dreamweavers, but the elven scholars who teach, study,
        and experiment with magic within the Spires of Yurek. This academy was named for Yurek Windkeeper, founder of
        the Arcana Pansophical and personal counselor to the Voice of Memory herself. The school is small compared to
        Emon’s magnificent Alabaster Lyceum, but its seven marble towers are no less awe-inspiring. Characters who visit
        the Spires of Yurek can learn any historical fact by studying its tomes for one hour and then making a
        successful DC 20 Intelligence (<a class="tooltip-hover skill-tooltip"

        Most visitors to Syngorn doubt that Ouestra, the Voice of Memory, truly dwells in a tower of moonlight. It is
        the truth. Her tower does not exist under the light of the sun, and then appears as a semi-solid pillar of
        Catha’s silvery glow, occasionally veined by lines of Ruidus’s ruddy light when the smaller moon is full. Its
        inside has supposedly never been seen by any but the other Wardens of Syngorn, and a thousand rumors circulate
        throughout the realm of the magical and divine marvels that must be contained within.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="afe93a15-1ee6-430e-b393-6a269b43452d"><strong><em>7. Spellbenders’
                Guildhall.</em></strong> The Verdant Expanse is saturated with magic. The ley energies that suffuse the
        greenwood make it easy for arcanists to create works of spellcraft by themselves, when it might take a
        half-dozen mages working in concert in other lands. Many of Syngorn’s most trustworthy magi are members of the
        Spellbenders, a guild dedicated to creating new spells and using them to create works of art, defend their
        homeland, and improve their peoples’ lives. Their guildhall is only accessible to those with the express
        permission of Guildrunner Rawndel.</p>

                Heart.</em></strong> In the heart of the Reverie Walks is a column of pure diamond, carved in the
        radiant likeness of an androgynous elf. Though the Arch Heart is worshiped throughout Tal’Dorei as a god of
        magic and art, they are something more to the elves of Syngorn: a progenitor of their people, a deity of
        fatherhood and motherhood, yet also of neither—a liminal god that by their very nature both embraces and
        destroys binaries. Elves that are “born of the Arch Heart” are honored within Syngorn, and many who seek that
        honor wander the Reverie Ward in search of the Stone, longing for physical transformation, social power, or
        arcane might. Some search for centuries and never find it, but in times of peril, the Arch Heart always makes
        their wisdom known to those who truly need it.</p>

        carves through the body of the Expanse, Tormor Falls is an incredible multi-level series of waterfalls that
        cascade down the eastern side of Orencleft Mountain for hundreds of feet. Swelling with every major rainfall,
        and beautiful to behold at all times of the year, Tormor Falls is also host to a number of caves that hide
        beneath the mist and spray, leading beyond the forest and under the Stormcrest Mountains.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a0d279c4-442f-426d-80cc-a788eb9ada85">A squad of Verdant Guard patrols the base of the
        falls, and many have explored the caverns in the past. Some return with nothing; others discover old relics and
        trinkets from the earliest days of Tal’Dorei, or even from the time of the Calamity. It’s rare for a patrol to
        fail to return, but when they do, no search party has ever been able to make contact with survivors, or to
        reclaim their remains. The guard has begun to whisper that the cave entrances move, shifting with each rising
        sun. The superstitions surrounding the caves around Tormor Falls have grown so great that expeditions which fail
        to return are no longer searched for at all, and no patrols go inside the caves without a critically important
        reason.</p>

        glimmering of sun across the Ozmit Sea, stretches across the central western coast of Tal’Dorei. This coast is
        where humans, halflings, and gnomes first set foot on the continent of Tal’Dorei, and it bears the marks of

        the western coast of Tal’Dorei is closest to the continents of Issylra and Marquet. Dozens of tall-masted
        trading ships set sail to and from its calm shores each day—as well as the majestic skyships that daily soar in

        policies that affect the whole of Tal’Dorei. It is often ignored that the council also governs Emon and resolves
        the day-to-day issues of the city. These are some current events both great and small affecting Emon today;
        these topics can add flavor to the discussions and rumors the characters hear around town, and could even
        inspire new adventures for them to take on.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="00b8cd13-3585-4822-8456-7d0da15fdb11"><strong><em>Elemental Disturbances.</em></strong>
        Over twenty years have passed since Thordak the Cinder King was killed in the caverns beneath Emon. His wreckage
        in the Cloudtop District, as well as the Scar of the Cinder King, a swath of elemental destruction outside the
        city walls, have been tended to by members of the Fire Ashari, gradually healing the stubborn wounds of his
        influence. Yet the primordial fires that seeped from his body continue to linger in the caverns beneath the city
        where he died. Every year or two, an incursion of wild fire and hateful <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip"

        causing mass chaos, expensive damages, and life-or-death battles for the city guard.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ea7a5b97-d5cd-4924-b3d1-b44daf3be324"><strong><em>Mercenary Mages.</em></strong> A
        generation ago, the fledgling League of Miracles hired hundreds, if not thousands, of mercenary mages to aid in
        the reconstruction of Emon and other cities across Tal’Dorei. These days, Tal’Dorei is rebuilt, and the few
        infrastructure problems aren’t enough to employ all the mercenaries left behind by the league. These out-of-work
        mercenaries now linger around dismal dive bars and make trouble for the locals. Most people would rather see
        them gone, but it’s hard not to feel sorry for their situation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9cb02d77-7d89-40bd-be92-b2059c65393a"><strong><em>Walls and Slums.</em></strong> The
        city’s outer walls have fallen under heavy criticism from politicians and civilians alike in recent years. Many
        people are concerned that the walls’ true purpose these days is to separate the slums outside the walls from the
        “respectable” districts within them. Popular opinion is now that the great City of Fellowship should do more to
        help its less fortunate, but council politicians continue to stall. In private, Master of Commerce Vex’ahlia de
        Rolo fumes that she wants to help, but can’t cut through political red tape with her legendary bow and arrow.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e0ed430d-5165-4eb7-a7e0-40e2e48d35d8">While in antiquity Emon was the heart of a human
        empire, the city has grown to encompass people from all over Tal’Dorei, and all over the world. Its citizens
        include people of nearly all known races from Exandria’s many nations, thriving on the new innovations and ideas
        of its citizenry. It has been this way since the sovereignty of Zan Tal’Dorei, when the alliances she formed
        invited dozens of displaced elves, dwarves, orcs, and goliaths into her city. Since then, Emon has developed
        into a city whose people valued innovation and collaboration, especially in small, cohesive groups—virtues that
        some historians within the Alabaster Lyceum believe have given rise to the prominence of the modern adventuring
        party.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="47927c86-d81a-4d7f-91da-ef6057ab8757">While Emon is becoming more commercial and the use
        of gold as currency has been ubiquitous throughout Tal’Dorei’s history, many communities within the city are
        still close-knit enough to use the barter system. During the reign of Drassig, the humans of Emon adopted a
        dwarven oath called <em>rudraz</em>, an intimate promise between two people to repay a deed or trade. Though the
        rudraz is not a contract, the dwarves believed that an oathbreaker would be forever barred from passing beyond
        the Brightguard Gates of Hilmaire, the gates that allow dwarves to pass to the afterlife. Humans in Emon treat
        the rudraz more lightly, often using it to seal matters of business or politics rather than personal promises,
        but breaking this oath still carries massive social repercussions. Few look kindly upon a person with the
        epithet “Oathbreaker.”</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="86bdc0f8-0f6d-48d9-a367-a407e79ac112">Emon has mostly recovered from its destruction at
        the talons of the Chroma Conclave and Thordak’s subsequent occupation. A number of Tal’Dorei’s most significant
        factions played a role in Emon’s rebirth, and their members enjoy positions of prominence throughout the city.
        Emon was rapidly rebuilt to its former glory, due to the expensive but effective intervention of mercenary mages
        serving the League of Miracles. Thanks also to the Clasp’s underground networks and established hierarchies,
        Emonian society and culture was able to bounce back more swiftly than any other major settlement in Tal’Dorei.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="21850ae6-f6b8-4875-a354-f54e9d089225">And the Tal’Dorei Council, formerly an advisory
        council to the sovereign, is now the ruling council of the land. Folk heroes and career politicians alike sit on
        the council. Over the past two decades, the council has, with many missteps, enacted the will of the
        people—allowing Tal’Dorei to transition from a monarchical power to a republic without war or insurrection.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fca35535-6718-40d8-bf80-ebb47214364f">However, the swiftness of Emon’s rebirth has put the
        Tal’Dorei Council in a precarious position. Not only are they socially indebted to a criminal faction—one whose
        members now command immense celebrity among the common folk—the council now owes vast amounts of gold to mages
        of the League of Miracles. League conjurers created thousands of tons of stone and steel, and each one of their
        transmuters rebuilt everything from taverns to townhouses and sewers to stately manors as quickly as a hundred
        laborers. Thordak’s hoard of plundered wealth has dwindled to nothing, repaying the league, and they have done
        the same in cities across the land. Some members of the council have already caved to pressure from factions
        within the Clasp and the League of Miracles, and subsequently turn a blind eye to the crime and magical abuse
        that run rampant throughout the city. Barely a single human generation old, the young republic is already
        struggling under the weight of ruling in a just and noble manner.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7fe7790b-8d5c-4f68-b0f8-ded18248980b">The Republic of Tal’Dorei has no standing army, and
        doesn’t elect a Master of War—a military commander-in-chief—to its council outside of wartime. In peacetime, the
        Master of Defense is responsible for the acquisition of mercenaries and adventurers for tasks which require the
        use of force. They also have the ability to conscript existing militias and town guards into military service
        and call them to Emon’s defense at any time, though typically only while the Master of War is being elected.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="97019ad8-3475-4ef4-8905-3600861a3025">The only standing forces pledged exclusively to the
        defense of the realm are the elite forces of Fort Daxio. Mobilizing the armies of Fort Daxio to Emon’s aid
        generally requires the city to withstand a week-long siege. However, in case of internal strife, there are
        stables positioned every fifteen miles along the Othen Trail, allowing Daxio’s legendary outriders to arrive at
        Emon in a mere two days’ time by switching out their exhausted steeds.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="19bd600c-85ca-4dca-a50a-2763ec02c1cf">Emon is encircled by 60-foot-high stone walls that
        stretch from the eastern fields to the western shore—though a number of discussions in the Tal’Dorei Council
        have revolved around the strategic irrelevance of great stone walls. They didn’t protect Emon against the Chroma
        Conclave over twenty years ago, and they wouldn’t have done much against an army of cultists and winged
        gloomstalkers had the Whispered One led an army against Tal’Dorei. As skyships grow more popular and affordable
        around the world, even the council’s Master of Defense is considering demolishing the city’s walls—making the
        strange case that such fortifications are prized more for their historic and cultural value than for their
        strategic importance.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cfbf03e1-11ff-460b-92c6-392966c03595">These walls are patrolled by lightly armed and
        armored members of the Arms of Emon, the city’s official watch and constabulary. They are divided unofficially
        into the Arms upon the Wall and the Arms on the Streets, the latter of which are assigned to patrol the city
        streets to dissuade petty criminals and respond to violent crime.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6460a65f-95e2-4199-9619-6e3c728cb0ba">Hundreds of miles of tunnels of varied provenance
        run beneath Emon. Most are the forgotten remnants of paved-over neighborhoods and secret passageways made by
        thieves’ guilds during the reign of Drassig. Others are the lairs of tunneling monsters. The origins of others
        still are lost forever, for they have already long since been turned into sewer passages to whisk away the
        refuse of Emon’s citizens.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4881eacc-eab7-4620-96ef-1a4957875fda">The vast majority of the tunnels closer to the
        surface are known to the Clasp and used to rapidly move about the city unseen. Somewhere deep in this network of
        unlabeled roads is the Clasp’s secret headquarters, where all manner of thieves, cutthroats, fences, and spies
        gather beneath their banner. Though the Clasp operates in major cities across Tal’Dorei, Emon has always been
        their home, and saving their neighbors from Thordak’s reign of terror gave the Clasp the dubious benefit of a
        heroic reputation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d1245f44-46cb-4451-b58b-b3be5190d524">However, the Myriad crime syndicate from Wildemount
        has spent over two decades relentlessly clawing their way into the Clasp’s territory across
        Tal’Dorei—dismantling their networks, poaching their clients, and assassinating their informants. The Myriad
        hasn’t managed to completely eliminate the Clasp’s hold in any of the cities they’ve targeted, but that hasn’t
        stopped them from bringing the ongoing power struggle to the Clasp’s doorstep. Myriad agents bargain in shadowed
        alleys, gamble in upscale taverns, and lurk in the very tunnels that the Clasp relies on, waiting for their
        chance to unseat the Clasp once and for all.</p>

        climate—the city is known for sudden, pounding rainstorms just as much as for its beautiful, sunny days. The
        city is blessed with cool summers and warm winters, thanks to its proximity to the cool Ozmit Sea. Though snow
        rarely falls on the city itself, it relies on springtime snowmelt from the Cliffkeep Mountains to fill its
        reservoirs throughout the year.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7a2b5c71-feb0-4b6c-8a9b-e95655fa5c00">Emon is made up of the following districts:</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="21be0748-88f3-43c2-aa57-b7bcece46900"><strong><em>Abdar’s Promenade.</em></strong> The
        Promenade is an open marketplace district and massive bazaar that dominates eastern Emon, named for the
        legendary spicemonger from Marquet who helped fund the construction of Emon. To this day, the name of Abdar is
        synonymous with both generosity and business savvy. Nearly everything a person could want can be found within
        the tents, carts, warehouses, and shops of the promenade. Its intertwining roads stretch for miles, and it has
        dozens of tiny neighborhoods, each with their own distinct cultures and identities. The promenade is heavily
        patrolled by the Arms of Emon, for its sunny reputation is shrouded by an equally significant reputation for
        literal back-alley criminal deals.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="44c35c79-6fa1-4224-944a-a3423ee64014"><strong><em>Central District.</em></strong> This is
        the largest residential district within Emon’s walls. It houses most of the city’s merchant class, including
        traveling traders, ship captains, and guild journeymen. The Central District is a patchwork of thousands of
        personal homes, tenements, and guildhalls of all shapes and sizes, peppered with small taverns and inns on
        nearly every street corner.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4705268c-bf9f-4a40-a0ca-48651c3e2cf5">These neighborhoods lay clustered together among
        tightly set streets, occasionally broken up by park grasses or the Ozmit Waterways that snake through the region
        between the promenade and the port. Visitors to the Central District are advised not to go out at night; the
        wide disparity of wealth from home to home here has seen a recent rise in crime, and the city watch seems
        reluctant to find a constructive solution. Residents who know the lay of the land have an easier time at night
        and can help visitors avoid the most dangerous streets.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e13d7497-7c63-40c0-af6f-baee019c4690"><strong><em>Cloudtop District.</em></strong> Out of
        all of Emon’s districts, the Cloudtop has, in some ways, changed the most over the decades. In Drassig’s time, a
        monstrous fortress loomed over the manors of his sycophants. In the age of Zan Tal’Dorei’s descendants,
        countless mages transfigured that decadent citadel into a sleek, elegant palace. By the time the Chroma Conclave
        came, decadence had once more crept up on Emon, and though the Palace of the Sovereign remained much the same,
        the Cloudtop District was once again a nest of luxury and the throne of the social elite. The latest additions
        in that era were skyship platforms, so that the wealthiest and most connected in Tal’Dorei could travel in
        exclusive luxury—soaring through the skies rather than enduring arduous journeys over land or sea.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7d0d6639-b6c5-4237-a17e-53043b81889e">All of that was reduced to slag by the advent of the
        Cinder King. Thordak made the Cloudtop District his home, and the palace itself his throne. His very presence
        caused magma to surge from the caverns beneath Emon, where previously no fires burned. Thordak ruled there for
        only a matter of months, but those few months were enough to annihilate unknown millions of gold pieces’ worth
        of art and creations of untold value—though the greedy dragon took care to command his minions to save the most
        beautiful works for his treasure hoard.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eeae834a-1a01-4572-8e4b-8a82df463748">Today, the Cloudtop District is rebuilt, though the
        most stubborn elemental influences of the Cinder King linger in Thordak’s Crater. A new castle called Cloudwatch
        Palace has been built atop the city of Emon, and it contains the chambers of the Tal’Dorei Council, as well as
        grand dining halls and guest quarters for visiting dignitaries. Much of the castle is a museum, displaying what
        regalia and objets d’art survived the wrath of the Cinder King. The private chambers of the palace also contain
        a number of teleportation circles that leading councilmembers can use to return to their homes at
        night—particularly if they live in far-off cities such as Whitestone.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8c29c07d-f2d0-4a97-83cb-d0e8766b279c"><strong><em>Temple District.</em></strong> Some say
        that this northern district contains more temples than in the rest of Tal’Dorei’s cities combined. This is a
        flagrant exaggeration, but at first glance, most people believe it. Emon is a city of many people, from many
        different places, with many different faiths. Even folk who worship the same gods worship them differently, and
        have built their own temples. Legend has it that shrines and temples used to be built all across Emon (and there
        are still some small sanctuaries elsewhere in the city), but a cleric of the Dawnfather declared her temple the
        greatest in all Emon. Her boast was met with scorn from a nearby church of the Stormlord. Their clerics, always
        eager to rise to a challenge, built an even greater temple across the street, and soon, people of all faiths
        were building the most magnificent structures they could, all in one tiny corner of Emon.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5cd1213f-74e8-4833-906c-ab0d4585b2f6">Today, cathedrals to the Lawbearer and the Platinum
        Dragon stand at apex among smaller temples to the Dawnfather, the Stormlord, the Wildmother, and the Matron of
        Ravens. All Prime Deities have at least a moderately sized house of worship here, and even some of the Betrayer
        Gods are worshiped in secrecy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8b1a0b18-c08f-4a17-bd48-6b4fd3e58fce">Anyone who seeks shelter here, be they rich or poor,
        can find sanctuary in the Temple District. Even the faithful of gods of strength, such as the Stormlord and the
        Platinum Dragon, have mercy for those who need the aid of others to help them stand on their own.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bab24a85-042e-4d7e-9777-51dadab4e3f5">Travelers and sailors come to leave tokens and gifts
        at shrines to bless their journeys, while people of all walks of life seek the graces of the Changebringer
        before undertaking risky endeavors. The meek search for wisdom in the great halls of the Knowing Mentor, as the
        artists and wistful folk give praise to the Arch Heart. However, not all folk are drawn toward religion, nor
        trusting of it, and temples past have been exposed as frauds—or worse, cults who venerate power.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ad5594e0-3564-4305-b1da-1df0020721ed">Recently, an off-kilter faith to a lesser idol
        called the Traveler has found purchase in the Temple Ward—primarily in the form of puerile graffiti in back
        alleys. Other quasi-religious spiritual entities have small cult followings in the Temple Ward. They are
        generally allowed to flourish to whatever degree they can, so long as their beliefs don’t advocate for any
        behavior that would break the laws of Emon.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3ea0fb2e-869c-4b70-82ab-9291cbd76a7f"><strong><em>Erudite Quarter.</em></strong> This
        district is home to members of the educated upper-middle class and destitute academics alike. Several
        institutions of higher learning have their stately campuses here, ranging from well-to-do boarding schools to
        Tal’Dorei’s most premiere academic and arcane institutions.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8b00ab5e-d125-4c02-9090-2cfa0ca2e1d7">Beautiful towers in ancient Syngornian style stretch
        to the sky across a cityscape of centuries-old halls of learning and student boardinghouses. Here, the finest
        schools and colleges draw the wealthy, the gifted, and the brilliant—and none more so than the Alabaster Lyceum,
        often lauded as the largest and most accomplished institute of arcane study on the continent. Though the
        district’s walls were shattered and its libraries crushed during the invasion of the Chroma Conclave, the
        Erudite Quarter has thankfully been mostly reconstructed, thanks to the efforts of the Lyceum’s staff and
        students.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f8e932c2-e3fa-46a2-a97e-80550ca70216">Members of the Lyceum, under the direction of
        Headmaster Thurmond Adlam, performed the reconstruction themselves not simply because they sought to project an
        image of good work ethic and self-sufficiency, but because the heads of their colleges distrust the League of
        Miracles. Their motives and sources of funding are, in the eyes of the Lyceum, too opaque to be trusted. Their
        suspicion has often been derided either as elitism over the diverse array of mercenary mages the league hires,
        or as sour grapes over losing out on countless lucrative reconstruction contracts.</p>

        Emon has no standing army, the Military District is one of the city’s smallest wards. Nevertheless, it has the
        capacity to house and train a vast number of soldiers if an army needs to be levied from the people of
        Tal’Dorei. The Military District is mostly filled with several prisons and jails, including the infamous Black
        Bastille, as well as tightly locked barracks and instructional facilities for the Arms of Emon.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c5a68fca-765f-48ee-b25b-535e25ac0005"><strong><em>Cemetery District.</em></strong> This
        smaller section of the city is filled with graveyards and small religious sanctuaries so that people with means
        to purchase a gravesite or a mausoleum can bury their dead in whatever luxury they can afford. Countless
        gravestones line the rolling hills of the district. They are sectioned off from the roads by tall iron fences,
        with mausoleums of more affluent families dotting the grassy hillsides. As surface space grew limited in
        centuries past, the city excavated a network of catacombs called the Undervaults. Upkeep, expansion, and general
        safeguarding of the sites are all overseen by the Gravewatchers, a guild of gravekeepers that have held
        political and social hegemony over the district for generations.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c673310f-ec09-4c9e-bd19-8ee21975ca3a">Their attempts to expand the Undervaults have had
        mixed results over the centuries. Most new excavations meet without incident (likely because the Clasp has
        learned to keep their tunnels far from this district). However, excavations in recent decades have broken into
        the Crystalfen Caverns, an eerie cave system filled with mind-bending inscriptions and horrific beings. The
        breach was promptly sealed off.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d8a989c1-1e41-4749-9ac0-d3cb8509e8ae">Yet the sealing of the caverns did not stop some
        members of the Gravewatchers from seeing an opportunity to gain fame and glory. Most who ventured into the
        caverns were never seen again, and those who have returned shudder unspeakably of the horrors they escaped.
        Still, passage is occasionally granted to the Clasp or adventurers willing to pay the Gravewatchers for entry to
        the dangerous realm below.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="67fe2b88-ced8-4761-82f2-7522098c8b45"><strong><em>Port of Emon.</em></strong> Emon is
        bordered on the west by the Ozmit Sea and is generally sheltered from the worst of its storms. The vast Port of
        Emon allows hundreds of thousands of gold pieces’ worth of goods to flow through the city every single day. Well
        over a hundred ships fill this port at any given time, and the dock crews are ever working, carrying crates and
        goods away to Abdar’s Promenade, or to empty vessels for exportation. The northern sector of the Port is mostly
        allocated to the Everline, a powerful fisherfolk’s guild. They frequently feud with the Onyx Banner, Emon’s most
        powerful shipping guild, over which docks they are permitted to use. Both guilds keep their hands clean, but
        it’s an open secret that both hire adventurers and mercenaries to trash the other’s ships and warehouses to
        intimidate them. Adventurers in need of fast cash who don’t mind dodging the Arms of Emon can find good work as
        muscle for either of these two guilds.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e3be8085-7f40-4794-a2d3-bcf4ce884c30"><strong><em>Outwall.</em></strong> During the reign
        of Drassig, a massive city of tents and hovels grew outside of Emon, filled with those too poor to pay Drassig’s
        extortative taxes. By the end of the Scattered War, the slum had grown to a third of the city’s size, and nearly
        half its population. Even during the reign of Zan Tal’Dorei, these slums continued to grow, as refugees of the
        Scattered War tried to earn enough money to find stability within Emon’s walls.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e70e18b8-1427-4f29-b409-87cd42b14c41">Though their conditions were still meager when the
        magnanimous Zan Tal’Dorei ended Drassig’s iron rule, the city’s denizens chose to remain, having created a
        community with its own culture of inexpensive living and brotherhood in poverty, away from the bustle of the
        city’s inner streets. A microcosm of Emonian society now exists within the city of Outwall, including its own
        trade square, shrines for worship, and makeshift farms on the outskirts.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3baa5099-21c8-4819-9da1-404e7bf08e7a">As early as two decades ago, Outwall was called the
        Upper Slums—a derogatory name given to it by Emon’s Cloudtop elite. People within Outwall tried to transform the
        term “Upper Slums” into a symbol of civic pride, but it never stuck. The name Outwall eventually emerged after
        community leaders demanded an audience with the Tal’Dorei Council in an event that came to be called the Outer
        Wall Debates—for they demanded the council convene in the slums’ own town square.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="07c69ab9-bbae-4b72-8651-b157124e2cfd">These days, Outwall is becoming a trendy place to
        live, thanks to its vibrant culture and relatively inexpensive housing. Its locals are fighting hard to keep
        young people with money to burn from the Central District from gentrifying their home. It hasn’t come to
        violence yet, but the angrier members of the Outwall community clandestinely meet with adventurers to burn down
        the stylish houses and mansions that are driving out local residents and businesses.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1f6b6d5c-0cc1-468c-9157-160ff6ef6696"><strong><em>Southgate Farms.</em></strong> Inspired
        by the civic action of the people of Outwall, the farmers of Southgate were able to break from the ugly name of
        “slum” in the past decade. This community of farmers and ranchers, formerly known as the Lower Slum, exists
        outside Emon’s southern gates. It first formed when a large refugee band from Othanzia was barred entry into the
        city in the midst of the Scattered War. Instead of dispersing, they decided to lay down roots while Drassig’s
        armies were out fighting a losing battle against Zan Tal’Dorei. These squatters eventually formed a community of
        farmers who petitioned Zan Tal’Dorei for land in exchange for providing produce and grown goods to the people of
        the city.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5466866e-6374-4aaa-867b-d0a91f5218ef">Thanks to the aid of the First Sovereign, the
        descendants of those Othanzian refugees have become one of the most significant sources of fresh food for the
        people of Emon. Frustrated by being saddled with the name of “slum,” and inspired by the Outer Wall Debates, the
        leading families of the Lower Slums demanded recognition by the Tal’Dorei Council as well. They were met with
        little debate, and these humble farmers are now a respectable part of Emonian society—even if they live outside
        the city’s defensive walls.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0ef87094-5666-4109-8530-b11519886fc5">This southern region of the city is also home to a
        famous site of modern history: Greyskull Keep, the former base of operations for Vox Machina in Emon. This
        fortress was gifted to them by the Last Sovereign as thanks for saving his life. The various heroes of Vox
        Machina have moved on to other homes (and now typically gather in Whitestone for holidays), and they allowed the
        keep to be turned into a museum of their heroic exploits.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8c7b0ce6-bfb3-404c-8d28-43f9b77fb758"><strong><em>Shoreline Farms.</em></strong> Less
        respectable than the Southgate Farms are the communities along a stretch of murky shore north of Emon. These
        people of Outwall have tried for decades to turn terrible, salty land into effective farmland, to mixed results.
        They have successfully cultivated the few vegetables that grow in saltwater-soaked soil, leading to bountiful
        harvests of savory quattet gourds and the hard-to-grow brineroot. However, the farms’ distance from the city
        gives them little protection from dangers that city folk think little of. Adventurers are always wanted to
        protect the farms from petty criminals and wandering monsters, but the farmers have little to pay. Generally,
        only utterly novice adventurers find their start in a place like the Shoreline Farms—but all heroes have to
        start somewhere.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="441beaac-a616-4372-91f5-8defd773035a"><strong><em>The Grotto.</em></strong> This sprawling
        series of underground chambers composes the Clasp’s headquarters beneath the city of Emon. It’s rumored that
        over a dozen entrances to the Grotto are concealed amidst the labyrinthine tunnels, which are both naturally
        occurring and a part of Emon’s sewers. That doesn’t even begin to get into the hundreds of other entrances and
        access shafts abandoned and filled in for fear of discovery. The very nature of the Clasp’s business is to keep
        shifting out of sight, and as such, the actual core of the organization moves from base to base between multiple
        subterranean structures, ever building further underground, or repurposing a long-abandoned hideout whenever
        necessary.</p>
    <aside class="text--tcsr-sidebar" id="Skyships">
        <p>Skyships</p>
        <p>Within the Cloudtop District lies the Skyport, a series of landing pads and observation towers that form a
            raised harbor for docking skyships. These beautiful vessels come in a wide variety of sizes, but generally
            are built to a similar scale as a coaster merchant ship. Skyships are held aloft and guided via the
            levitating power of three or more enchanted crystals, called brumestones, installed along the hull or
            topside of the ship. The enchantments required to produce and maintain these brumestones is a closely
            guarded secret by the Alsfarin Union within the Marquesian city of Ank’Harel, and while the Alsfarin Union
            does occasionally sell skyships to foreign businesses, they retain absolute control over their
            maintenance—and of the total number of skyships in operation.</p>
        <p>Skyships are generally reserved for goods and individuals who require expedient travel without the hassles of
            sea-faring dangers, but the cost to utilize a skyship is prohibitively expensive for anyone but wildly
            wealthy merchants and landed nobility, fomenting a sense of elitism in those who often make use of their
            services. Due to the exclusivity of skyports within major metropolises, few skyships in service will deviate
            from dedicated shipping routes between major cities.</p>
        <p>Purchasing a skyship costs 100,000 gp, and requires a personal connection with the Alsfarin Union in
            Ank’Harel. A skyship travels at a top speed of 10 miles per hour, can carry total cargo of 10 tons, and
            requires a crew of six to ten humanoids to operate at peak performance. Most skyships have maximum
            accommodations for up to 30 passengers. Most skyships only travel between existing skyports (see “Emon
            Skyport,” below), and charge a fee of 2 gp per mile for a passenger ticket. Chartering a skyship to a
            destination off the standard sky routes costs 15 gp per mile, if the captain is available and willing to
            undertake the journey. Shipping cargo costs 1 gp per mile per 100 pounds of cargo along normal sky routes,
            and twice that to other destinations.</p>

        While the city is home to countless taverns and inns for the weary traveler or practiced performer, few are as
        grand and well known as the Laughing Lamia. Almost as old as the city itself, this fine establishment has traded
        hands numerous times over the years, and has expanded with each transition, leaving the massive, four-story
        institution a hodgepodge mass of odd rooms and themes, all centered around a raucous central tavern room filled
        with dozens of tables. Currently under the ownership of a brash and cheerful lass called Luthania Wells, this
        hot spot for traveling traders and adventurers alike rarely sees an hour in the day (or night) where there isn’t
        something interesting going on within.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a19a5fc9-274a-4f0b-8893-4bbd45070a83"><strong><em>2. Azalea Street Park.</em></strong>
        Azalea Street, within Abdar’s Promenade, is one of Emon’s oldest neighborhoods, and is full to bursting with
        small businesses, quaint homes, and hole-in-the-wall restaurants, such as the Laughing Lamia. Amidst the chaos
        of daily life, Azalea Street is also home to a peaceful park overlooking the Ozmit Waterways. When the stress of
        constant battles becomes too much to bear, adventurers in the know take a moment to visit the Azalea Street Park
        and recover, maybe even swapping stories with other relaxing heroes. Legend has it that heroes who meditate
        among the flowers and drink in the sea air return invigorated by the spirit of the Wildmother. A statue of the
        Wildmother and Lawbearer dancing together graces a fountain in the center of the park. Once per week, a

        stark black stone and adorned with intricate brass metalwork, this grand blacksmithy is one of the most striking
        buildings in Abdar’s Promenade. Decades ago, a restless craftsman from Kraghammer of the name Grahf Tiltkettle
        grew weary of solitary pursuits and worried that interest in blacksmithing would give way to the emerging trend
        of mass-production. Tiltkettle retired in Emon and dedicated his respectable fortune to ignite the spark of
        inspiration in those who wished to learn the ways of the hammer and anvil, hoping to instill the joy of the
        All-Hammer in a new generation. He funded the creation of Anvilgate, a massive, public blacksmithy where any
        folk who wished to try their hand at the smithing of metals could do so under the All-Hammer’s guidance.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3cd7e66d-8631-49f9-9bfe-eb36ee0a90aa">Cheaper ores and materials were often donated by
        friends of Tiltkettle to aid the volunteer mentors in teaching their craft to the less fortunate, while folks
        who wished to bring their own ingots were welcome to do so. The location has become popular enough to begin
        expanding its facility to include kilns for ceramics and looms for weaving. While the tools are open for anyone
        to use on the premises, all are warned of the curse that will beset any wanton thief who steals from under the

        most magically active structure in Tal’Dorei shines like a pyramid of pure sapphire in the bustling center of
        the Erudite Quarter, its walls thrumming with arcane energy. It is the Traverse Junction, and all visitors to

    <p data-content-chunk-id="ef6feebe-66f4-4436-bf4e-48bae7fdb647">The telemagi who curate the circles are always in
        search of new teleportation sigils to different lands; they are willing to pay a handsome sum for the services
        of powerful and magically skilled adventurers willing to seek out and catalog new circle sigils for their

        gleaming white halls and elaborate gardens of the Alabaster Lyceum signal to all who see them that they gaze
        upon the greatest institute of higher learning in Tal’Dorei—though numerous scholars in Kraghammer and Syngorn
        would heatedly dispute that claim. Regardless, this place is the heart of homegrown academia in the Republic of
        Tal’Dorei, boldly striving to make a name for itself alongside the ancient scholarly traditions of Issylra,
        Marquet, and Wildemount. The Lyceum (for those who can afford the impressive tuition) is an unparalleled center
        for study and research of history, economics, alchemy, art, and—most of all—magic and the arcane. Many of
        Tal’Dorei’s greatest scholars and bards paid their dues in these halls, and the history of the Lyceum and its
        graduates are featured in all manner of superstitions and folktales.</p>

        the wake of the Chroma Conclave’s destruction of Emon, the towering palace that stood as home to the sovereign
        and the center of governance within the city fell to fire and ruin. In the decades since, construction began
        with the aid of the League of Miracles to construct a new palace to help house the Tal’Dorei Council and be a
        symbolic center for all major political affairs within the region. The Cloudwatch Palace now sits atop the
        once-smoldering hill where Thordak once claimed his roost, a symbol of Emon’s enduring will and optimistic hope
        for the future. Within these high-arched halls, countless chambers hold space for diplomats, meetings, and in
        the case of holidays, grandiose celebrations that draw the attention of powerful figures all across Exandria.

        last unsettling element of the Cloudtop District is the elementally scarred remains of Thordak’s Crater. Even
        after two decades of healing from the Ashari of Pyrah, Thordak’s fires still burn beneath the Cloudtop. The
        smoldering entrance to the caverns remains cordoned off from the public because of its unsightly appearance and
        sulfurous stench, and because fiery creatures occasionally try to claw their way out into the fresh air. The
        crater is often forgotten, but every few months an adventuring party makes their way inside to seek treasure or
        glory within the volatile caverns—and such expeditions are a favorite topic of conversation (and clandestine
        betting) among the politicians, political aides, remaining city nobility, and nouveau riche of Emon.</p>

        elevated port is complete with docking platforms solely for the use of skyfaring vessels. The original Emon
        Skyport was the first of its kind in Tal’Dorei, and its successor is every bit as revolutionary as the original.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c15293ae-d920-47a2-ad50-22e40c33b5f7">The Emon Skyport was destroyed when the Cinder King
        claimed the Cloudtop District as his fiery throne, but like so much of Emon, it has since been rebuilt. Unlike
        other parts of Emon, this reconstruction was a joint venture between the Arcana Pansophical and the Alsfarin
        Union, a Marquesian guild responsible for the engineering and distribution of all skyships in Exandria.</p>

                Sovereign.</em></strong> Uriel Tal’Dorei II, the Last Sovereign, was slain by the noxious breath of the
        green dragon Raishan during the attack of the Chroma Conclave. Uriel’s wife, Salda, survived him and petitioned
        the reformed Council of Tal’Dorei to build their last sovereign a tomb befitting his benevolence and
        magnanimity. They complied, and the monumental Tomb of the Last Sovereign is now home to not just Uriel’s ashes,
        but to tribute from all who loved him. Those with wealth gave gold, while those whose hearts outweighed their
        purses gave more personal tribute.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e661b29b-bcec-47dc-9998-941e65925d66">Over twenty years ago, the Gravewatchers closed the
        tomb to all, supposedly to prevent vandalism, but have not reopened it after more than two decades. The Last
        Sovereign’s eldest daughter, Odessa Tal’Dorei, is furious. Despite her position of power on the Tal’Dorei
        Council, she is unable to dispute the act because of the power the Gravewatchers have as keepers of the dead. It
        has come to the point where she seeks to secretly employ adventurers to uncover the Gravewatchers’ true
        intentions—which involve the psychic influence of an aberrant creature of the Crystalfen Caverns.</p>

        the Temple of the Stormlord always has a fighting ring in its center, the annual Godsbrawl transforms the
        earthen, torch-lit sanctum into one of Tal’Dorei’s most unusual tournament grounds. On the Day of Challenging,
        the god of athleticism’s holy day, the brawny priests of the Stormlord invite warriors and worshipers of the
        entire pantheon to the Godsbrawl, asking that each temple offer forth their greatest warrior to act as their
        god’s proxy in the tournament. The clergy of the Dawnfather and the Lawbearer send their champions, but rarely
        take it seriously, for they scorn the storm-priests’ notion of “might makes right.” Conversely, the champions of
        the Stormlord and the Platinum Dragon have a fierce—though friendly—rivalry, trading the title of Supreme
        Champion back and forth each year after a bloody (but rarely fatal) final round.</p>

        Named for its ash-blackened walls, the ominous Black Bastille is a single-story prison within the Military
        District that holds Tal’Dorei’s most dangerous and irredeemable criminals. The compound has no windows, no open
        courtyards, and only one entrance: two imposing steel doors, flanked by watchtowers. During the reign of the
        Chroma Conclave, the prison was one of the first buildings attacked, setting hundreds of Tal’Dorei’s worst
        criminals loose to sow chaos across Emon. The Black Bastille has since been rebuilt, but dozens of its most
        deplorable inmates still run free, and the Arms of Emon are eager to recover them. Some include the human
        demon-summoner Felrinn Derevar, betrayer of the Arcana Pansophical; the half-elf pyromancer Illaman Falconsong,
        exile of the Fire Ashari; and the vampiric tiefling Ixrattu Khar, cultist of the Whispered One and Tal’Dorei’s
        foulest mass murderer (see <a href="/sources/tcsr/allegiances-of-taldorei#IxrattuKhar"

        Anyone who wishes to uphold justice and keep the peace can apply to join the Arms of Emon. But before a recruit
        is given their armor and takes a vow to protect the city and its people, they must endure a grueling training
        regimen within the tall, featureless stone barricades of the Walls of Tribute, referred to wryly by recruits as
        the Quarry. There, they are trained in the physical aspects of peacekeeping, instructed on the habits of the
        city’s criminal underbelly, and drilled in the laws and ideals of Emon.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cbe07980-faf0-42be-a75e-af1d76d8e478"><strong><em>13. House of Discipline.</em></strong>
        Emon does not have a standing army of its own. The skills imparted to the Arms of Emon are sufficient to
        maintain a rowdy populace, but they are carefully trained to use nonlethal force to restrain, rather than kill,
        all those whom they apprehend. Thus, when war comes to Tal’Dorei, the council appoints a Master of War and
        levies an army from the Arms of Emon, as well as the militias of its constituent settlements. They must report
        to the House of Discipline, where they are taught martial combat alongside the harsh realities of warfare. Those
        who endure their time in the House of Discipline are forged into an army ready to protect Emon and the rest of
        Tal’Dorei from the greater dangers of Exandria.</p>

                Goods.</em></strong> The broad, single-story façade of Shaun Gilmore’s wondrous magical emporium belies
        the extravagance of its interior. Within, the air is thick with a dozen competing perfumes, each more pungent
        than the last. The interior is impossibly large—certainly larger than its exterior walls would have you
        believe—and filled with seemingly endless rows of arcane curiosities and artifacts, many of whose cryptic
        functions have been lost to time. Everburning candles in an array of unnatural colors light the shop, casting
        tantalizing shadows over every bubbling phial and mystical orb. Those who enter the shop are first met by
        Gilmore’s long-time assistant Sherri, a half-elf draped in deep purple robes. If they are lucky, or particularly
        convincing, they may even meet the hero Gilmore himself.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="571b5181-c84f-4a62-90a7-40fd22274be1">Even rarer a sight than Sherri or Gilmore is the
        latter’s husband, a handsome elf named Darius. He is shy in public, a perfect counterbalance to Gilmore’s
        bombast, but is said to have a singing voice and skill with the lyre that can make any mortal weep. Whether or
        not his husband is present, Gilmore is ever eager to recount his part in the fall of the Chroma Conclave, often
        winkingly embellishing his role in the final battle with Thordak himself.</p>

        items. Its stock varies, but typically includes magic items of very rare rarity and lower for the price range
        listed in the fifth edition core rules. Additionally, there are always unidentified items in Gilmore’s vast
        back-room storage that he says he’ll “get to eventually;” these may include one or two long-lost legendary
        items. Artifact-quality items are beyond even Shaun Gilmore’s usual fare, but he might know clues to a specific
        artifact’s location, whether through his own extensive knowledge or his rumored relationship with the Tal’Dorei
        Council as an expert consultant on matters of arcane objects. Magic items are expensive, and those strapped for
        cash may inquire about sponsorships and quests done in Gilmore’s service.</p>

        what looks to be the broken remains of a large, leathery red egg, not far from a collapsed tunnel beneath the

        <p>The Sisters Grast</p>
        <p>Mythic tales of a pair of ancient hags swirl through learned circles within Emon, typically to frighten
            Lyceum students off of wandering forbidden vaults at night. Some folk, however, take these whispers
            seriously. A number of explorers and treasure seekers wandering the subterranean ruins of Crystalfen have
            encountered one, or both, of these wretched witches, returning with tales of fright, dark dealings, and
            unholy pacts.</p>
        <p>In reality, these creatures are elven scholars who stumbled upon the Ruins of Salar long, long ago. Their
            discovery and research of the profoundly magical location twisted their minds and bodies, infused them with
            power, extended their lives, and granted a glimmer of knowledge of some immense, unknowable purpose to the
            lost city. They’ve become obsessed with the mysteries of the ruins. The elder, Trysta, remains below to
            continue to excavate and study, while her sister Forscythia travels back and forth from Emon under the veil
            of a half-dozen illusions to acquire goods and gold in exchange for her unsettlingly insightful
            fortune-telling. Anyone who seeks the sisters with ill intent is rarely seen again, but those who stumble
            upon them often find themselves temporarily in service to them, a pact made out of fear and
            self-preservation.</p>

        and other aberrations sprung up from a door between worlds and conquered this subterranean web, drove their
        slaves to construct Salar, the Unseeable City, and slowly pressed upward toward the surface. Their plot was
        unintentionally ended when the final battle of the Calamity sent powerful waves of magical force throughout
        Exandria, causing much of the underground caverns to collapse and the aboleth civilization to fall under rock
        and rubble. Fragments of the City Which Eyes Cannot See still remain, however, with surviving terrors slowly

        formed from millennia of psychic energies existing near element deposits. Curious explorers who discovered the

        directly beneath the splendid Port of Emon, rest the eternally slumbering ruins of Salar. No mortal has beheld
        these ruins—once the capital of a mighty aboleth dominion—and returned to the surface with wits to tell the
        tale. Salar is known only in myth and legend as the Unseeable City, because mortal eyes cannot look upon its
        alien architecture without destroying their fragile minds. Salar is treated as an urban legend by Emon’s
        scholars and archeologists. Nevertheless, many believe in its existence, for numerous scholars have returned
        from expeditions into the deep caverns with their minds shattered by otherworldly power.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fc229cbe-893b-4d26-bd40-5bfb630c4597">Those who have returned from Salar brought back
        journals filled with increasingly crazed notes. The most intelligible of their writings indicate that all that
        survives of the ruined city are emerald marble structures of unfathomable design, seeming to shift and shimmer
        as the eye tries to comprehend, moving through time as they remain static in space.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a734a0f9-495f-4791-87c0-a517cb053bcd">The once-renowned archaeologist Karaline von Ethro
        claimed to have visions of Salar, describing a subterranean city with twisting pillars that stretched higher
        than any tower, kissing the seat of the surface world from the bedrock of the earth. At the peak of the central
        pillar floats a giant pearlescent disc. This so-called Moon Disc bathes the entire city in unsettling, milky
        light that refracts eerily through the emerald spires.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="febf4382-fa57-4d7f-b0d4-ea67a1c7992c">Karaline von Ethro is long since dead, and her
        journal—by far the most coherent record of the Unseeable City—is an apocryphal artifact. The Arcana Pansophical
        kept it in a closely guarded vault, which only added to its mystique. However, the journal was stolen long ago,
        and since then, dozens of manuscripts said to be the Von Ethro Journal have been sold in black markets across
        Tal’Dorei. Anyone lucky—or unlucky—enough to find the genuine journal would learn a terrible secret that the
        Pansophical has held onto in silence for decades: dozens, perhaps hundreds, of aboleths survive within Salar.
        Their master, Durrom of the Emerald Eyes, lives on in secrecy while expanding its army of thralls and learning
        all it can about the ignorant surface dwellers. Durrom’s ultimate goal is to shatter the forgotten Pillars of
        the Earth beneath Emon and cause the city to collapse into its subterranean domain.</p>

        settlers were greeted with mistrust by the elves of Syngorn. When King Warren Drassig took the throne of Emon,
        no city suffered greater devastation than the contested region of O’Noa. It was the site of one of the Scattered
        War’s bloodiest battles, and the arcane energies unleashed reduced the city to ruins and permanently scarred the
        land. Built within a cursed bay, and deprived of fertile land, it was agreed after the war that neither the new
        nation of Tal’Dorei nor Syngorn would attempt to rebuild the city, instead letting it stand as a reminder of the

        miles-long lagoon that wends its way through the base of the bluffs, carrying hosts of dangerous ocean life with
        each pass. Conversely, the tidal phenomenon also brings a valuable bevy of deep-sea fish on occasion, which gave
        birth to the fishing community of the Shalesteps. The mountains’ strange peaks are decorated by copses of

        Issylra is considered by most to be the land where all civilization emerged and spread in the time of the
        Founding, making it the religious core for many, and the focal point of historical study for others. It was also
        where most of the flying cities of the Age of Arcanum first rose from the ground. Its people rose high—and fell
        hard from those dizzying heights, and to this day, many there still hate and fear the power of arcane magic.</p>

        theocracy of Vasselheim. Nestled among eastern taiga forests of the Vesper Timberland, the city of Vasselheim
        stands as the oldest known seed of civilization and religion, and the only city to withstand every catastrophe
        that has rocked Exandria since the gods brought life to it. As the spiritual center of most of the world,
        Vasselheim is ruled by a coalition of high priests of the many Prime Deities. These hierophants are viewed by
        their people as the defenders of their virtuous society, and of all of Othanzian culture.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="9e5ecbaf-6692-4ae2-b3ac-605f6facd133">Following the winds and waves to the southwest of
        Tal’Dorei across the Ozmit Sea eventually leads one to the chain of islands called the Hespet Archipelago and to
        the shores of the continent of Marquet. The pebble beaches of the Bay of Gifts greet travelers with the charming
        sights of untouched nature, and the port city of Shamal invites all to engage in the pleasures of civilization,
        with beautiful ballrooms and gilded gambling halls.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d7229365-7cae-4e1c-ba06-d592d8645a3f">Beyond the port of Shamal lies the rocky edge of the
        Aggrad Mountains, whose canyons and caverns house untold numbers of predatory creatures, before giving way to
        the immense Marquesian Desert. This sandy wasteland is rumored to have once been verdant jungle brought to ruin
        by the spear of the Ruiner in the Calamity. Some stories tell of a great hero that sacrificed himself to save
        Marquet from utter annihilation, but only scattered fragments of this tale endure.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d9133ce1-9c59-4579-af85-067d0e0a4689">Near the center of this intense desert, surrounded
        by a sprawling network of small villages, is the grand city of Ank’Harel, known as the Jewel of Hope. This city,
        built atop the Drowned City of Cael Morrow, is the center of culture, history, and power for all of Marquet.
        Ruled by the mysteriously undying J’mon Sa Ord, Ank’Harel is a magnificent haven of music and culture. It’s not
        without its dangers, but it is a paradise compared to the monster-infested sands that surround it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eafbc1d5-68f5-41ed-9d98-5b137973d190">The Hands of Ord, the city’s guards, also protect
        nearby villages and townships within the desert, but they can only reach so far. Further south, beyond the reach
        of Ank’Harel and the Hands of Ord, the sands give way to scrubland and marshes tangled with the volatile
        mountains surrounding the smoking Suuthan Volcano and the dangerous clans that worship it. Westward, beyond the
        arid desert, lies a vibrant landscape of verdant jungles, craggy mountains, and magical mysteries that the
        people of Marquet have spent eons unraveling. Within the jungles of Marquet are dozens of cultures, some
        nomadic, some seafaring, and some with great cities of their own. One such city, founded by orcish survivors of
        the Ruiner’s wrath during the Calamity, is known across Exandria for its mathematically immaculate architecture.
        This realm welcomes scholars and travelers from across Exandria, who are eager to learn from the minds of some
        of the greatest architects the world has ever seen.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="927edaee-15ca-4e92-b4fa-f0cf08f5ad8b">Few sail into the dangerous waters southeast of
        Tal’Dorei, past the ever-present fog bank called the Fool’s Curtain, and into the Shattered Teeth. This cluster
        of broken lands is made up of forty-three islands, varying in size from small, mile-wide reef-toppers to the
        large, city-holding isles like Ruukva. Two societies dwell within the Shattered Teeth. The first is the Ossended
        Host, a vast fishing culture that values their independence—even to the point of isolationism—and
        self-empowerment through the worship of the power of dreams and nightmares. The second is the Wanderman
        Assembly, a centuries-old trade company that, upon being stranded across the Shattered Teeth after losing their
        way in a typhoon, grew into a brutal, ruthless society dedicated to gaining profit at all costs. It masquerades
        poorly under the banner of honor and brotherhood.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="217cd413-a29e-4991-8b4d-657efe9a3e2e">This tension has led to bloodshed in recent years,
        and each group is paranoid that the other is bent on destroying their way of life. What brims beneath the
        surface of this conflict is the nature and source of the dreams the Ossended Host have been harnessing for
        generations, and what that answer may mean for the struggles of the people of the Shattered Teeth.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5521355b-0b2c-46f1-bf79-a1a0d76a96f7">Due east of Tal’Dorei, the lands of Wildemount are
        highly geologically varied, from the tropical Menagerie Coast, to the dour and rainy valleys of Western
        Wynandir, to the blasted wastes of Eastern Wynandir—better known as Xhorhas. The people of Tal’Dorei trade
        frequently with Wildemount, though the waters of the Lucidian Ocean are prowled by pirates, sea monsters, and
        forgotten aquatic demigods. Such a journey leads to the Clovis Concord, a federation of city-states that govern
        the Menagerie Coast, where a lively culture of trade, entertainment, and the arts flourishes amidst the illicit
        activities of local smugglers and the ever-present Myriad syndicate.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d96b64f5-22c7-4481-a730-1340cc1eec6c">The Dwendalian Empire, an authoritarian power that
        seeks to expand its reach across all of Wildemount, reigns over the center of the continent. The empire is ruled
        by King Bertrand Dwendal, but tensions boil between the Crown and the Cerberus Assembly, the empire’s league of
        arcanists and covert operatives. Though the assembly’s power waxes and wanes, they are constantly maneuvering to
        become the true, shadowy power behind the Dwendalian Crown.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="090c18aa-fe3a-4be0-9178-6c9aa5b33474">The empire’s control over the resource-rich valleys
        in the center of Wildemount has helped make it a military superpower. Likewise, the natural defenses of the
        surrounding mountains make their lands easily defensible. For centuries, the idea that the empire is invincible
        has fueled recruitment propaganda for its military, the sanctimoniously titled Righteous Brand. King Dwendal’s
        edicts have created a highly nationalistic society—one which permits only the worship of Crown-approved deities,
        submits to mandatory military service, and jingoistically endures immense taxes to support the Crown’s wars.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e2064ab0-93df-4132-9d3a-b9fc6e699271">Across the mountains east of the Dwendalian Empire
        are the wastes of Xhorhas, ruled by the Kryn Dynasty. This society was founded by dark elves who escaped the
        grasp of the Spider Queen through the grace of a supernatural being of light called the Luxon that granted them
        the ability to reincarnate into new bodies, life after life. Those who are reincarnated seek to broaden the
        knowledge of the Luxon by living bold lives and gaining new experiences. Today, the Kryn Dynasty is filled with
        not just dark elves, but goblinkin, orcs, ogres, kobolds, and all manner of other peoples considered to be
        “monsters” by the Dwendalian Empire.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="160d6799-2b5a-4294-b420-0dc7bd0d8400">Beyond the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire,
        and the tensions that burn between them, are the lands of the Miskath Strand and the islands of Eiselcross. Both
        are realms twisted by forbidden magic, and inhabited by eldritch abominations and other creatures that are
        anthema to mortal life. Yet, despite the danger, the most courageous adventurers of Wildemount—and indeed, all
        of Exandria—see exploration as the pinnacle of heroism. At the fringes of the known world, where monsters from
        the edge of reality lurk…this is where true adventure begins.</p>

        for any fifth edition RPG campaign. This process typically involves choosing your character’s race, lineage, or
        ancestry; selecting your class, background, starting equipment, and spells (if applicable); and giving the
        character a name and backstory. If your Game Master has any house rules or special requests that change this

        These descriptions don’t include game statistics, which can be found in the fifth edition rules, but rather

        stories by communicating openly with their Game Master before the campaign begins, and maintaining that
        communication between game sessions. Doing so ensures that everyone’s stories are being told in a fun way, and
        that everyone is having fun at the table. To get that same experience, be sure to talk with your Game Master
        about what’s important to you while you build your character and flesh out their backstory. That way, your GM
        will be able to build a story that centers you and your allies as main characters, rather than just bystanders.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c78fb621-17cb-4495-a3c3-73f54f3ad72d">Tal’Dorei is home to manifold humanoid peoples, from
        the elves who emerged from the Fey Realm into the untouched lands of Gwessar in the wake of the Calamity, to the
        humans who first came to Tal’Dorei on stout ships from the distant shores of Issylra. The familiar fantasy races
        of elves, dwarves, humans, and halflings are the most populous beings on Tal’Dorei, but they are far from the
        only peoples to make their mark in city and wilderness alike.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="82000db3-3a87-4c6a-9236-6c19b6137352">Over the past thousand years of history, the peoples
        described in this chapter have left an indelible mark on the world. And though many of these races appear
        monolithic at first glance, all are incredibly varied. A first-time visitor to Tal’Dorei might initially
        perceive all elves as haughty and fascinated with heritage, because that’s the dominant culture in Syngorn, the
        largest elf-majority city on the continent. However, the elves living in villages and cities across the land are
        often exceptions to that apparent rule, and it’s dangerous—not to mention rude—for travelers to assume that any
        of Tal’Dorei’s varied peoples fit into simple boxes.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e3998c0d-8dab-4264-830f-97398643904c">For generations of roleplaying gamers in many
        different RPG campaign settings, certain of the fantasy peoples in the world of Exandria have long been
        considered “monsters” or “evil races.” Goblins, orcs, and bugbears are examples of peoples whose very nature was
        supposedly tainted by inherent evil, and were thus morally unambiguous targets for adventurers to kill and loot.
        This mindset treats these people as no different from monsters like basilisks or giant spiders.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ae04100d-533e-4305-97f0-4267df2703e8">The humanoid people of Tal’Dorei aren’t set up that
        way. Any creature with the humanoid type is a thinking, feeling person. Creatures with the dragon, giant, or fey
        type are also unambiguously sapient, and thus can have any alignment. It’s just as likely for a human to be a
        neutral evil bandit as it is for an orc to be a chaotic good swashbuckler, or for a hobgoblin to be a lawful
        good knight. And if you like, you can take this even further in your games and say that any fantasy creature
        with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher is capable of free thought, and should have just as wide a range of
        alignments as other sapient beings.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="64a60382-2f46-433d-be0e-976c35879bbe">The stories in <em>Critical Role</em> are filled
        with shades of moral gray, but Tal’Dorei still has plenty of unambiguously evil creatures. Most demons, devils,
        and undead are suffused with cosmic evil, and always try to subvert righteousness. Likewise, unthinking
        creatures such as oozes and constructs, and creatures of instinctual intelligence such as beasts, many
        monstrosities, and plant creatures, all make morally unambiguous foes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7361d286-3e85-4a10-944e-2ca741c732ce">Likewise, there are plenty of evil humanoids in the
        world. Cultists of evil gods, including the Remnants who worship the Whispered One, and merciless, blood-soaked
        bandits such as the Ravagers are clear and immediate threats to both the safety of the player characters and all
        free peoples of Tal’Dorei. Depending on the tone of your story, the characters might cut such foes down without
        mercy—or they might try to rehabilitate them. The difference is that these villains’ choices, not their
        ancestries, determine whether or not they are evil.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6b46a241-5cd5-4880-bfb1-b1f3206c325b">The various peoples of Tal’Dorei don’t have racial
        cultures. Rather, someone’s culture is based on the cities and regions in which they spend their formative
        years. For most of Tal’Dorei’s history, members of the different fantasy races lived in largely monolithic
        enclaves. However, the more recent past has instilled in people the need to break down old barriers, work
        together, and live together.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6d83502a-1ba5-45d8-a1bd-367ec05fcb82">All cities and large towns have a majority
        population of certain races, typically based on the peoples who founded those settlements. This includes such
        notable sites as the elf-majority city-state of Syngorn and the dwarf-majority city-state of Kraghammer. Some
        people in Tal’Dorei might assume that certain races have common cultural traits that unite them, but many others
        know that this isn’t the whole truth. A dwarf raised in Kraghammer and a dwarf raised in Stilben are likely to
        have very different attitudes about family, food, faith, and all the other factors that make up a culture.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="60843cc3-5cd6-4753-842e-e236a5751e35">Even when people of the same race gather in
        neighborhoods within a city, those people don’t necessarily share the common culture of their best-known
        homelands. In many neighborhoods in the great city of Emon, for example, elves and half-elves are a majority.
        But since not all those elf-kin come from Syngorn, they don’t all share a monolithic Syngornian “elf culture.”
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bb86c5a4-4dcf-49ee-b12e-a814d4f12d75">That said, beings with distinctly magical traits
        often form cultures that include their unique abilities. This includes folk such as dragonblood, with their
        ability to channel elemental power. And because goliaths are known for their powerful, muscular bodies,
        goliath-majority societies often worship the Stormlord, god of strength, and engage in festivals that center
        around feats of athleticism.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="a758b9fe-be6d-4a9e-b537-762e9f1951f1">The dragonblood of Exandria are a people of unknown
        origin, and countless myths surround their ancestral creation. One particularly pervasive tale states that
        dragonblood were created by the Scaled Tyrant and the Platinum Dragon during the Calamity, serving as loyal
        soldiers who eventually earned their freedom. Regardless of how they came into being, though, the dragonblood
        lived for many centuries in relative isolation in the southern wastes of Xhorhas, on the continent of
        Wildemount.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="274a7ab7-9a10-49cb-89d4-c20fce2297b6">Today, dragonblood live all over Exandria, though
        they remain a scarcer sight in Tal’Dorei than in Wildemount. Their spread across the world was hastened by the
        assault against the free peoples of Exandria by the Chroma Conclave. During that conflict, the ancient white
        dragon known as Vorugal the Frigid Doom destroyed the magical city-state of Draconia, the ancestral homeland of
        most dragonblood.</p>
    <div class="flexible-double-column flex-bottom" data-content-chunk-id="f59f9551-709a-4374-a968-f1b3529d57d5">

            <p data-content-chunk-id="575f29fa-7efd-4309-a37a-3c546550b517">The destruction of Draconia and the loss of
                many of its people was a tragedy. But to roughly half the dragonblood of Exandria, it also marked the
                end of an oppressive regime. Dragonblood of Exandria can either be born with a tail or without. In
                Draconia, those with tails were called draconians or draconbloods, for they were seen as closer in form
                and power to true dragons. Those without tails were given the name of ravenites and enslaved. Their
                blood and toil built the mighty towers of Draconia, yet the ravenites enjoyed none of their city’s
                splendor.</p>
            <p data-content-chunk-id="33b4c047-d32b-421d-81fb-e2f2ed196b12">The ruin of Draconia thus marked the start
                of an era of freedom and self-determination for the ravenites. In Tal’Dorei, it’s apparent that any
                differences between the ravenites and the draconians have nothing to do with bloodline or draconic
                power. Those differences are cultural, and rooted in a past whose conflicts still haven’t been resolved.
                The oppression that existed in Draconia remains largely unknown within Tal’Dorei to this day, and
                outside of major cities such as Emon, dragonblood can go for months, even years, without seeing another
                of their kind.</p>

        destruction of Draconia have been scattered across the world. In the time that’s passed since the fall of the
        dragonblood city-state, a generation of draconbloods have grown up in Tal’Dorei’s towns and cities, disconnected
        from their parents’ privileged upbringing. Only a scant few draconians—typically ones able to teleport away from
        Vorugal’s attack—escaped with any sort of wealth. Most other refugees were lucky simply to escape with their
        lives.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="31cbd8f5-737a-4dd9-8939-b3119a0ce10a"><strong><em>Clinging to the Past.</em></strong> A
        social divide continues to grow between draconians who have wealth and those who don’t. Many of those with
        wealth greedily cling to the shadows of their former tyrannical glory, but other draconians seek instead to bury
        the past and create their own destiny, on their own merits.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b343480a-6eb4-44a9-9deb-db683d7a91af">Following the end of the Draconian order, the
        ravenites ventured into the world eager to make the most of their newfound freedom. In the generation since,
        many have formed a new homeland in Xhorhas known as Xarzith Kitril, content to reclaim the lands of their birth.
        Those ravenites who departed Wildemount have found a new home in the cities and the icy north of Tal’Dorei,
        where they enjoy the freedom and privileges of equality that this land provides.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="79dce536-d13c-45f2-95d5-17de057266e2"><strong><em>Rebuilding from Scratch.</em></strong>
        Most ravenite children grew up poor, either in slum towns at the edges of cities like Emon and Westruun, or
        helping their parents laboriously carve out rural lives in the Dividing Plains or Cliffkeep Mountains.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5811a492-8bc8-4239-b578-7138bbc852d9">When the world was nearly rent asunder by the
        Calamity, the dwarves of Tal’Dorei disappeared underground to wait out the worst of the conflict. Many dwarven
        citadels once dotted the subterranean world, but over the centuries, they dwindled, either merging together or
        falling into decadence and ruin. In the centuries following the Calamity, these dwarf clans, isolated beneath
        the surface of Exandria, gathered into a single, steadfast redoubt: Kraghammer. In one way or another, just
        about every dwarf in Tal’Dorei can trace their family back to that great city-state.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f05fc0ea-112f-4bbc-9960-878190b2f5c6">The mountainous stronghold still stands as the heart
        of settlement in the Cliffkeep Mountains, and many dwarves consider it a place all their folk should visit at
        least once a decade. Kraghammer’s legendary status gives it a highly conservative, unchanging culture, but even
        so, the dwarf people are far from monolithic.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3befd183-856b-490a-8368-148a9d2b71c0">Some dwarves like to distinguish themselves as hill
        or mountain dwarves, based on whether or not they grew up outside or inside of Kraghammer. <em>Gurdhe</em>, a
        Dwarvish word translated into Common as “hill,” colloquially means “beyond the mountains” in most Dwarvish
        dialects. And many dwarves, even the so-called mountain-dwellers renowned for living their entire lives
        underground, make journeys out into the “hills” of Tal’Dorei to trade, gain artistic inspiration, or visit the
        children of long-dead friends they bonded with decades or centuries prior.</p>

        tradition—even to the point of xenophobia. As a common saying goes: “Those who live beneath the mountain are as
        unmoving as the mountain itself.” Whether they’re dwarves, gnomes, or folk of other ancestries, the people who
        dwell in Kraghammer typically embody this stubborn, dogmatic stoicism.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="da1cbaf4-f163-4bea-a6dd-34623c2fb91b"><strong><em>Tradition.</em></strong> Kraghammer
        society is steeped in a culture of dwarves protecting their own, and those dwarves’ traditions of meticulous
        chronicling, geometrically precise artistry, dynastic great houses, and resilience against even the greatest of
        threats has proved itself a central pillar of their society. For long centuries, new peoples and new ideas in
        Kraghammer meant potential danger, threatening the death of monarchs and incursion by nefarious subterranean
        infiltrators. The first time that Kraghammer proudly opened its gates to a new people, the oligarch Warren
        Drassig led all of Tal’Dorei into the greatest war since the Age of Arcanum. The city’s relative safety during
        the assault of the Chroma Conclave only cemented its people’s belief that isolation is strength.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fae5740e-b1a6-4591-9816-eccc1354cb96"><strong><em>Change.</em></strong> In the present
        day, many of Kraghammer’s residents feel stifled by its dominant culture, which continues to be insular and
        suspicious of outsiders and new ideas. In the past few decades, a tide of refugees fleeing crises such as the
        Wittebak disaster and the Cinder King’s attack on Emon have brought new voices and perspectives to the formerly
        unyielding halls of Kraghammer. These people now call the dwarves’ ancestral realm their home, and many of
        Kraghammer’s dwarves have seen the innovation and transformation that new residents can bring. Change comes
        slowly in Kraghammer, but it does come in time.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="76613e89-1d2d-49b9-b2f4-83bc70d7ad12">Dwarves might leave their underground realm for
        myriad reasons, with many making homesteads in the foothills of the Cliffkeep Mountains or venturing even
        farther afield. Hill dwarves who left the mountain themselves, or who had parents or more distant ancestors who
        did so, have a certain shared camaraderie in their connection to the open sky above, the sun and wind around
        them, and the soft loam beneath their feet.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="20bc53a5-f000-4618-915b-6207b7a286fb"><strong><em>Exploration.</em></strong> It’s common
        for dwarves who live upon the hills and fields of Tal’Dorei to wander throughout their lives, never putting down
        roots for more than a decade or two at a time out of their centuries-long lives. Dwarves with tanned skin and
        sun-bleached hair are so common a sight in taverns across the Dividing Plains that the Dwarvish word
        <em>gurdheledr</em>, translated as “hill travelers,” has come to mean “mercenary” or “bounty hunter” as commonly
        as it refers to simple wanderers.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5828c3c8-5729-47c3-81fd-1f01d8bea147"><strong><em>Community.</em></strong> Dwarves are a
        common sight in cities such as Emon and Westruun, and even in smaller towns across central Tal’Dorei. Not unlike
        mountain-dwelling dwarves, these city dwellers are often as unmoving as a granite boulder on a rock shelf—unable
        to be budged unless given a tremendous push. Dwarves typically adopt the culture of wherever they live, though
        their long lives sometimes make them more resistant to social change than shorter-lived peoples.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7970a335-9490-435d-a73a-d3266d4eaba4">Deep beneath Tal’Dorei is an underground realm lit
        only by magelight, magma flows, luminescent creatures and fungi, and the roaring fires of duergar forges. It is
        thought that a group of dwarves delved far into the depths of Exandria countless centuries ago, predating even
        the chronicles of Kraghammer. Whether by choice or by necessity, they made a home in the caverns they explored
        there. Something about the magic that suffuses their eerie realm changed the deep dwarves—who are called the
        duergar now. That name was originally an epithet, bestowed by the mountain dwarves who rediscovered and battled
        those deep dwarves, but the duergar now wear it with pride.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="60145afd-a809-4e77-a46d-f1dbf4685064"><strong><em>Survival.</em></strong> The deep caverns
        of Tal’Dorei are an inhospitable place, filled with creatures whose aberrant forms defy imagination and whose
        alien minds reject mortal morality. The duergar became hardened by their struggle for survival, and their
        rejection at the hands of the Kraghammer dwarves hardened their hearts forever. The smiths of the Emberhold do
        not forge art or works of beauty—only weapons and armor to turn back the onslaught of those who wish to see them
        dead.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="56512b44-3be6-484d-b273-2674b167c834"><strong><em>Alliance.</em></strong> The duergar have
        suffered alone for so long, hating all and hated by all. Nevertheless, in the undercurrents of the Emberhold,
        the idea spreads that there must be more to life than fire and death. Many duergar nurture a secret hope of
        finding some way to ally with their other dwarf kin—if only someone were brave enough to reach out a hand
        without fear of it being cut off.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="66c6ead6-ff76-4d3b-bb6b-1bc008103212">Exandria’s lands are rife with elemental power.
        Primordial energy constantly flows into the world from elemental rifts, and such primal power inevitably alters
        its surroundings. This is also true of peoples who spend long years in proximity to such sources of power, and
        of those who travel the planes long enough to find the seed of elemental power take root within their blood.
        Such folk are the beginning of an elemental ancestry, harboring the potential to give birth to children who are
        suffused with latent magic.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="26f0c952-7c0a-41cd-9024-3aa7d33ab7d8">Children of an elemental ancestry bear the features
        of their parents’ ancestry, but have clearly become something new. Their appearance is altered by their power,
        granting them skin that shines like the sun on the surface of the sea, hair that crackles like flame, or eyes
        that glitter like gemstones. Then comes the manifestation of elemental powers, which can make a child the envy
        of their peers—or someone to be feared.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d52de1e5-d08b-4dd5-85f3-d569f5b9d04f">While people of elemental ancestry are rare in
        Tal’Dorei, they are most common among the Ashari due to the elemental affinity of that folk. Some possessed of
        elemental power enjoy the attention their uniqueness garners them. But for others, even the most benign interest
        draws painful attention to their otherness.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="35734e59-7b0a-4df3-b284-0cf4a63dc9c2"><strong><em>Belonging.</em></strong> People with an
        elemental bloodline are often raised by parents in a regular community, and so grow up with all the aspirations
        and prejudices inherent to their culture. For many such people, the traits that make them unique also make them
        a pillar of their community—for example, a baker who instinctually understands the will of her oven’s fire.
        Within superstitious lands and cultures, however, a person’s elemental powers might make them the target of
        scrutiny, fearmongering, or jealousy, eventually driving them to strike out into the world to seek a place where
        they truly belong.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7bd4ed0c-3318-4eff-9f48-e541792ed22c"><strong><em>Called to the Ashari.</em></strong>
        Those elemental-touched people who leave their communities often seek out the Ashari, the isolated keepers of
        rifts to the Elemental Planes. Elementally attuned children are born with great frequency to the Ashari, who
        understand the utmost importance of giving those children the education and training that will let them
        understand their gifts.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5d7abcd6-9c29-47d3-81fe-9576582f37dd">All people of elemental ancestry are welcome among
        the Ashari, including the Air Ashari and Earth Ashari found in Tal’Dorei. However, even those whose elemental
        ancestry connects them to water or fire can seek out Tal’Dorei’s Ashari peoples to help them on their journeys
        of discovery. In time, such a journey might lead them to the Fire Ashari on the continent of Issylra, to the
        Water Ashari on the Islands of Anamn in the Ozmit Sea, or to Ashari who have journeyed from those lands to
        Tal’Dorei.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="290bb995-8ca8-4940-aacb-a895fe7c9c80">Elementally attuned folk who don’t seek or can’t
        find the Ashari might instead find their way to the reclusive giants of Tal’Dorei. Though the giants do their
        best to keep their distance from the lives and problems of humanoids, they have been known to take a shine to
        people whose shared elemental affinities give them common ground.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="387b76c0-5dd6-45f8-8ddf-6c22248e9c8d">When the Calamity threatened to annihilate all life
        on Tal’Dorei, the elves of this land gathered in their last remaining city, Syngorn, and used long-forgotten
        magic to transport themselves into the Fey Realm. Time runs strangely in that realm, and for an unknown stretch
        of history, the elves of Syngorn lived with their fey kindred in peace. When they eventually returned to
        Exandria, they found a land devoid of all but animals and the grandeur of nature. The rotten majesty of the Age
        of Arcanum, burned away by the wrath of the gods, had given way to new growth.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c6391a4c-3f2e-4a5f-9bcf-a7ec6f465255">To the elves, the lands of Tal’Dorei are still
        called Gwessar, and elves who dwell here are called the <em>gwes’alfen</em>—the elves of the Fields of Joy. For
        centuries, this folk watched with delight as other peoples populated Gwessar, beginning with dwarves, then
        humans from across the sea, and so on. Then they looked on in horror as mortal ambition was perverted into
        greed, and war followed in its wake.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="33ff84a4-5d65-45cb-900a-5cdb294380f6">Syngorn and the Verdant Expanse that surrounds it
        are the ancestral homeland of Tal’Dorei’s elves, many of whom never venture beyond that homeland. Young elves
        are most likely to journey afield to see what else the world has to offer, and while most of them return to
        Syngorn, some make new homes in the many towns and cities of Tal’Dorei—or they become hermits, their status as
        mystical beings with a thousand-year life span commanding an almost mythic reverence from other folk.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d5e9c1bd-05bd-4a0f-a0dc-b9c56e4f6dba">The elves’ tendency to focus on the past has given
        rise to many stereotypes of those folk being haughty, aloof, and unconcerned with the day-to-day joys and
        sorrows of the shorter-lived races. But though this is certainly true for some elves, it’s hard for other folk
        to consider the perspective of an elf who has personally witnessed whole cultures and civilizations rise and
        fall. Most elves are born with the same passion for life as any other being. But as centuries pass, life becomes
        a stream of historic events to be witnessed and contemplated, and not to be interfered with unless absolutely
        necessary.</p>

        Expanse call themselves, almost universally revere the ancient history of Syngorn, and the story of how its
        escape to the Fey Realm saved their culture from extinction. No elf who lives in Syngorn can forget this past,
        and Syngornian culture can sometimes feel overbearing to those who see it only from the outside. More than a few
        woodland elves also feel stifled by their homeland’s unrelenting focus on history, magic, the fey, and the
        preservation of elvenkind. Such elves are most likely to leave Syngorn and make their homes in other parts of
        Tal’Dorei.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="33f782cc-2f69-4bdf-ad30-ae1566fabce6"><strong><em>Departure.</em></strong> Many elves who
        leave Syngorn (or who had parents who left) still consider themselves syn’alfen, whether they live in Emon or
        other cities, or even the ancestral homes of other folk, such as Kraghammer. The cultural imprint of Syngorn is
        hard to escape, and most of these expatriate wood elves hold a certain amount of love for their home even as
        part of a complicated relationship.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b62bfd5e-513d-4faa-8d92-f6bfc9f361da"><strong><em>Reunited Family.</em></strong> South of
        the Stormcrest Mountains lies the massive jungle of Rifenmist, home to the nomadic elf Orroyen tribes. The
        Orroyen believe that they split off from the Syngorn elves centuries ago, with both peoples meeting each other
        again only within the past century. Though initially suspicious, both elf lines soon came to see one another as
        long-lost family.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d7d48488-ca78-4bad-94e1-f669d8c07cd6">The onslaught of the Chroma Conclave disrupted
        communication with the Orroyen elves, and news from the south has grown more dire since. Orroyen refugees
        continue to flow into Syngorn, fleeing the tyrannical Iron Authority that rules Rifenmist.</p>

        Lyrengorn elves or high elves, are a people who broke off from Syngorn long ago, and who journeyed from southern
        Tal’Dorei to settle in the frigid Neverfields, north of the Cliffkeep Mountains. The city of Lyrengorn that they
        founded is every bit as majestic as Syngorn in the south, but for better or worse, Lyrengorn lacks its sister
        city’s millennia of culture—and its cultural baggage.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="835a9832-4eb0-41d2-ac4e-309a672da093"><strong><em>Art and Expression.</em></strong>
        Lyrengorn is nestled in the spires of the Elvenpeaks, spreading under the mysterious northern lights known as
        the Moonweaver’s Ribbons. The city is always aglow with magical light, and its people are taught spellcraft from
        a young age, for magic is the foundation upon which Lyrengorn was built. The spells of heat and comfort woven
        into its residents’ clothing and architecture are essential to living comfortably in such relentlessly cold
        lands.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e7a2dff5-0e7b-48d1-bd01-c5b1f77b8eae">The elves who make their home within the pines of
        the Elvenpeaks are best known for riding through the wintry skies on wyverns. Every year, people from across
        Tal’Dorei travel to the Elvenpeaks to watch skyswimmers, elite wyvern riders who shape the glow of the
        Moonweaver’s Ribbons from the air.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e74ab69c-701f-435b-8a02-f2ed6d59d853"><strong><em>Magic and Transformation.</em></strong>
        High elf culture values magical prowess above almost all else, but the high elves lack the dogma of many of
        their Syngornian cousins. Their society encourages experimentation, both in terms of magic and self-expression.
        Likewise, lyren’alfen who become adventurers often do so in pursuit of inspiration or self-discovery. High elf
        societies are filled with elf magi who use magic to transform their bodies, exploring different gender
        expressions and social roles—and they encourage all who visit Lyrengorn to join them in discovering all the
        different facets of one’s self.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a8053040-2345-48fe-a2a2-9a27162e1b77">Many high elves become religious sorcerers,
        exploring their latent powers through their faith. Others develop their arcane skill by seeking admission to the
        Alabaster Lyceum in Emon, where they study the theory of magic with the best minds from across Tal’Dorei.</p>

        elves, have a complicated relationship with the other elven societies of Tal’Dorei. Though the elves are one
        people by heritage, the dark elves refused to join with the elves of Syngorn during the Calamity, instead
        escaping into the trackless caverns that stretched beneath Tal’Dorei. There, they became the unwitting prey of
        the Spider Queen, a Betrayer God of immense cruelty.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="37de7f5a-51fa-4c5e-be36-f4f77c6132bb"><strong><em>Betrayed by the Gods.</em></strong> In
        times long past, the drow were a wise, beautiful folk with long, silvery hair and radiant ashen or violet skin.
        But their underground enclaves grew decadent and cruel, and their leaders fell to the alluring whispers of the
        Spider Queen. The <em>myrk’alfen</em> allied with their venomous goddess against the Arch Heart and their elves
        in the Calamity. When the Spider Queen was defeated, the <em>myrk’alfen</em> of Tal’Dorei were exiled
        permanently from the surface world, confined to their imperious realm within the earth.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a1fb0d4e-ca73-4f58-bdd0-8e5da833bbd0"><strong><em>Struggle to Survive.</em></strong> More
        evil powers than just the Spider Queen lurk beneath the surface of the world. With the drow in exile, the
        whispers of the Crawling King and the Chained Oblivion first reached the ears of their nobility as the dark
        elves struggled to stave away the aberrations that encircled their cities. Now, generations later, the dark
        elves are a people seemingly on the brink of annihilation. Neighbors slaughter one another in the streets as
        they succumb to paranoia. For when aberrations can take or shape any form, who can be trusted? Unable to stop
        their citizens from rioting, the drow elite have grown ever more authoritarian, commanding their royal guards to
        keep order by violently suppressing their people.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="aa72f89a-e10d-4e27-9e04-997634f0ed2d">Against this ongoing chaos, some dark elves who fall
        deep into the abominable thrall of the Spider Queen become truly monstrous, their skin and eyes turning deathly
        pale as they become little more than puppets for their tormenting goddess. Others willingly offer themselves to
        the aberrations to end their suffering, and are transformed into shapeshifting doppelgangers. And the most
        power-hungry drow nobles often succumb entirely to their devotion to the Spider Queen, willingly drinking her
        abyssal blood to become driders in her service.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="84464d3d-dd02-48de-8997-65994ac2bb5f"><strong><em>New Light for the Shadow.</em></strong>
        The people of Tal’Dorei have recently received emissaries from dark elves who live in the eastern reaches of
        Wildemount, in a nation called the Kryn Dynasty. Their Bright Queen, Leylas Kryn, broke free of the Spider
        Queen’s corrupting influence and led her people to glory and self-determination in the distant lands of Xhorhas.
        This rebellion was inspired by the discovery of the Luxon, a mysterious being of light and rebirth that the Kryn
        drow worship as a god.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="365567a8-c0ed-430c-9bf8-f3e647e73cf2">Though the dark elves of the Kryn Dynasty have
        problems enough of their own, some of the Kryn seek the aid of Syngorn and Lyrengorn on expeditions into the
        depths beneath Tal’Dorei. Their goals are noble, but none can deny that these are missionary expeditions in
        search of new followers—and in search of new Luxon beacons, the scattered fragments of that new drow god.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="032585bd-ef93-4706-ab0d-6e35cfdd7cb9">Many adventuring drow harbor a violent hatred of
        aberrations, and have abandoned the Spider Queen’s faith to become paladins in service of the Dawnfather or the
        Luxon, setting aside their affinity for the shadow to search for hope in the light of the sun.</p>

        long faces, firbolgs are a humanoid people with a unique, somewhat bovine appearance. They aren’t insular by
        nature, but they feel most at ease when surrounded by the natural world, leading the vast majority of firbolgs
        to never leave their forest homes except under circumstances beyond their control. As a result, many folk in
        Tal’Dorei don’t even know that firbolgs exist. Those firbolgs who do live in the realm’s cosmopolitan cities
        either grow annoyed or accepting of people constantly questioning who—or what—they are.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="a03da85f-0c10-4d07-b98c-a145bed366ae">Firbolgs’ fuzzy bodies are acclimated to cold
        weather, and they often overheat in warm climes. They are most commonly seen in Kraghammer, Zephrah, Whitestone,
        and Stilben, both as residents and as traveling bards and merchants. But they are otherwise a rare sight south
        of the Cliffkeep Mountains, though some firbolgs enjoy a comfortable life in Emon after learning a few handy
        spells to keep cool in the summer.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c2dd1b74-2322-4f54-8bd7-7ffb3e977f10">The largest and densest population of firbolgs in
        Tal’Dorei is found in the eternally winter-bound forest of the Frostweald. These firbolgs have a friendly but
        cautious relationship with the capricious fey who also dwell there.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c7576e4d-3cf4-4c63-a12a-199d0289ebf5">Gnomes and gnomish culture are relatively uncommon
        in Tal’Dorei, for although humans and rock gnomes both hail from Issylra, relatively few gnomes have the chance
        or the desire to leave their homeland. Moreover, their short stature has often proved a social hindrance in the
        lands of taller folk. But where they have settled, gnomes easily prove their mettle through deed and humor,
        becoming welcome members of the settlements where they choose to make their homes.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="8090b6b8-ca72-4240-af11-418c3950696e">The first gnomes to enter Tal’Dorei migrated from
        Issylra during the Age of Arcanum, and endured the Calamity within the deep caverns of the Cliffkeep Mountains.
        These folk called themselves rock gnomes, and founded a marvelous settlement called Wittebak. Their society
        prized cleverness above all other things, eschewing the arts of magic for a focus on tinkering and an
        understanding of natural phenomena.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="83795076-dc81-40eb-9129-a4fb4d8edac5"><strong><em>Dizzying Heights.</em></strong> By the
        end of the Calamity, the city of Wittebak was the most technologically advanced place in all of Tal’Dorei, even
        as the elves and dwarves were emerging from their isolation. However, such greatness could not last. The rock
        gnomes boasted of their superiority to the “ignorant” stone giants who also called the mountains home, and
        incurred their elemental wrath. In the earthquakes that followed, Wittebak and most of its people were
        destroyed.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8ae2b8f6-ef42-4867-a2d7-06bafd2444d7"><strong><em>Eyes Ahead.</em></strong> Most of those
        who survived the Wittebak disaster made their way to Kraghammer, relying upon the generosity of the dwarves to
        survive. A few others traveled to Emon and Kymal, and helped build those cities in their earliest days. To this
        day, most gnomes with any connection to the heady era of Wittebak still call themselves rock gnomes in its
        honor. These gnomes carry a certain cultural memory of their city’s fall from grace, which drives many of them
        to strive constantly toward greatness.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ea14e1f8-9542-45c4-8bbc-8a4f172d88d5"><strong><em>Eyes Behind.</em></strong> A fair few
        rock gnomes dwelling in Kraghammer—elders in particular—take a different view of their people’s fall from grace
        and glory. These gnomes work bitterly and tirelessly, fueled by spite and pride, with the intention of either
        reclaiming Wittebak or proving that the city’s lost technology is superior to any magic or other force on
        Exandria.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="73c0d485-5555-4dd5-b819-89474082c0a1">Forest gnomes are not native to Tal’Dorei, but
        unlike rock gnomes, they are believed to hail from the Fey Realm, much like the elves. A half dozen small forest
        gnome communities can be found in the Verdant Expanse, hidden from the prying eyes of elves and human explorers
        alike. But how gnomes ended up in the Fey Realm to begin with is a mystery that even they can’t begin to answer.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ec4b8d17-5d93-4281-b767-922e2e1b2d69"><strong><em>Magic, Not Tech.</em></strong> The
        biggest difference between the gnomes of the forest and their rock gnome cousins are their philosophies toward
        magic and technology. After spending untold centuries in the Fey Realm, forest gnomes have a great respect for
        magic, especially capricious, unpredictable magic like that of the fey. Forest gnome culture sees technology as
        predictable and boring, even if its usefulness must be conceded from time to time.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5cdcb715-300f-4eae-983e-d2fd12f48682">Forest gnomes respect the rock gnomes’ dedication to
        science, and are more than happy to help their kin in their search to understand how nature works and how to
        manipulate it. But in the end, knowledge is not as important as canniness in forest gnome enclaves.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="75dd8199-7f2c-4adb-9d55-848dc5079510"><strong><em>Worldly Explorers.</em></strong> Not all
        forest gnomes are as close to their fey identity as the gnomes of the Verdant Expanse, and a number of more
        worldly clans have spread to other forests across Tal’Dorei. Most notably, a number of familiesfamilies,
        including the Trickfoot clan, have made the Bramblewood outside of Westruun their home for generations. These
        clans are more practical than their fey kin and less uptight than their distant rock gnome cousins, giving these
        gnomes a curious personality perfect for the life of a traveling adventurer.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Goblinkin"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7729304e-39a0-4ce8-bb60-ffd34f18f30b">Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears are three distinct
        races with a united past. They live across Tal’Dorei, most often in isolated communities, though many people in
        the realm have become used to the sight of goblin children playing catch in the street, hobgoblin mercenaries
        hanging around job boards, and bugbear apothecaries running shops in the hills.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eb312a5c-a562-41b2-aec2-d16b434b2ee3">The origin of the goblinkin is shrouded in myth and
        legend, but it’s generally accepted that these peoples were created by the Strife Emperor during the Calamity to
        be his perfect soldiers. The few records of that time hint that the goblinkin were once a single folk called the
        dranassar, a humanoid people of golden skin and green, violet, or yellow eyes who lived in eastern Wildemount.
        They dwelled in great numbers in the city of Ghor Dranas, which came to be the seat of the Betrayer Gods’ power
        in the Calamity.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8e04f1e4-8b9b-47b8-b954-97445007c9b8">For centuries, goblinkin were viewed as monsters by
        most other people of Tal’Dorei—particularly explorers and adventurers who regularly invaded and destroyed
        goblinkin settlements. But this ugly sentiment has undergone a radical shift in the past generation, during
        which countless goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears have fought alongside the other folk of Tal’Dorei in defense
        of their homeland against the Chroma Conclave and other threats. Today, goblinkin are a welcome sight in
        Tal’Dorei’s cities, and those folk who nurture old hostilities are invariably taken to task by the people around
        them.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="bb3cbbbe-3814-4aee-abfe-8be1344fa474">Goblins are a green-skinned people, short of stature
        and typically having thin, dexterous fingers and strong, nimble legs. They fit easily into settlements with
        significant gnome or halfling populations, whose residences and furniture are already appropriately sized. With
        long traditions of living in isolated family units in forests and mountain caves, many city-dwelling goblins
        dwell in large houses holding at least three generations of family and many different branches of their family
        tree.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f08ef3ce-fbbb-48ff-b389-9b4de0d89334">Most hobgoblins are alike in stature to humans and
        have similar variations in build, ranging from thin and scrawny to broad shouldered and muscular. Their large
        ears, gleaming yellow eyes, and powerful incisors give them a vaguely feline appearance.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c49e684a-c82e-4285-aac9-80d91b995333">Hobgoblins are often stereotyped as having a
        warlike, martial nature—a sentiment that arose from rumors surrounding the Iron Authority in the Rifenmist
        Jungle. That empire is majority hobgoblin, and its cruel leaders have press-ganged the land’s entire population
        into compulsory military service. In ages past, most hobgoblins that became known to the other peoples of
        Tal’Dorei were scouts or captured legionnaires of the Iron Authority. Today, though, many escapees from the
        authority’s influence live in cities such as Emon, Kymal, or Byroden. Most of these free hobgoblins know only
        their parents’ stories of that distant empire, and are able to live happily free of its influence.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Bugbears" data-content-chunk-id="0c313e5c-f069-4d0f-85ea-afd22b652c99">

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7728f580-d38e-4420-aa47-0f88cf8c1f08">Bugbears are tall humanoids covered with brown,
        black, or blue-gray fur, which combines with large ears and yellow eyes to give them an even more feline
        appearance than their hobgoblin cousins. Though bugbears are tall, their posture is generally stooped, so that
        their heads are still roughly at human height.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5afdb337-0650-48b9-8d04-55f549b30090">Many bugbears are solitary folk, living in forests
        and mountains where their thick fur protects them against the cold. They typically gather in large groups one to
        three times a year to socialize and play games with friends, reunite with family, and find love—a tradition that
        has been reworked by those who live in permanent communities. Such bugbears often live with a number of romantic
        partners under the same roof, or “adopt” goblin families and dwell in their loving, chaotic, multigenerational
        households.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="a53fc4c3-293d-462b-b387-ecf3509daba9">Four peoples were known to exist on Tal’Dorei when
        the world was reborn out of the ashes of the Calamity. The elves, who emerged from the Fey Realm. The dwarves,
        who emerged from the earth. The orcs, who endured the Calamity through strength and determination. And the
        half-giants, who safely rode out that war in mountaintop retreats before eventually descending to the windswept
        plains below.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a799a63f-d490-4a79-8f8f-66aa12b68393">Averaging seven feet tall, with hairless, craggy
        bodies and skin tough as stone, half-giants are often colloquially known as stoneborn or goliaths. Descended
        from stone giants, these folk have long been viewed as exemplars of rugged endurance and individualism. They are
        found in settlements across Tal’Dorei, where they are known for their innate strength and their commonly held
        belief—passed down from the giants of old—that all must take fate into their own hands.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a6c90111-364e-4082-9611-4d70d94ed461">In ancient times, goliaths and orcs lived off the
        same land, and their nomadic clans frequently warred and intermingled in equal measure. As such, it is common
        for orcs and goliaths of Tal’Dorei to discover common ancestors somewhere in their family trees.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="789c24c2-45a2-4f6f-8a8c-42246f0b7cb7">Stone giants believe that physical perfection is the
        world’s greatest virtue, and this belief has been passed down culturally to the goliaths who live in the
        mountains and upon the Dividing Plains. These plains-dwelling half-giants call their clans “herds,” and unite
        behind the stone giants’ philosophy of “might makes right.” Though at one time these herds were mostly made up
        of stoneborn almost exclusively, recent generations have come to include humans, orcs, dwarves, and even
        physically diminutive people such as halflings—as long as they agree with the philosophy of strength above all.

        stone is sturdiest when formed into towers, walls, and bridges, and cities such as Kraghammer and Emon have long
        been filled with the works of goliath masons and architects not given the historical recognition they deserved.

        have been made by other city-dwelling stoneborn, and scholars of the Cobalt Soul are working to confirm which of
        the beloved Emonian and Westruunian structures that survived the Chroma Conclave are actually the result of
        pioneering goliath minds. Westruun has long been home to vast numbers of half-giants dwelling there to be close
        to their former herds, but many others have set down more recent roots after the Battle of Westruun, helping
        rebuild in the wake of the destruction wrought by the dragon Umbrasyl and the Herd of Storms.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="bc67902f-0215-4a0e-b090-238e5a26364e">No one really knows how halflings appeared on
        Exandria, nor is it known how they first arrived in Tal’Dorei. Some halfling scholars are eager to trace the
        origin of their people, but many of those who live out in the countryside are more keen on inventing
        increasingly tall tales regarding the roots of their ancestry. One popular creation myth is that when the
        All-Hammer made the dwarves, a little bit of leftover clay slipped from his hands and landed on the rolling
        fields beyond the dwarves’ mountains, where it became the first halflings. Though most people dismiss this story
        as nothing more than folklore, a sense of the halflings having humble beginnings fits with the place they’ve
        found for themselves in Tal’Dorei.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1a72b4e4-201c-42ad-b551-f5d5b7cf340b">The historical records of the Cobalt Soul assert
        that halflings journeyed across the Ozmit Sea from Issylra with Tal’Dorei’s first humans, with both peoples
        coexisting in peaceful harmony in this realm’s earliest cities and idyllic agrarian towns. Humans and halflings
        likewise fought together—and against each other—when the Iron Rule of Drassig swept across the land.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0b6bd85c-6ff6-4f9f-93f6-937108862022">The Scattered War divided halflings across the
        continent in two ways. Thousands of humans and halflings were impressed by Drassig’s strength and joined his
        armies, even as many of those who refused to join turned away from their old allegiances. One group of halflings
        decided that humans had betrayed them and that Warren Drassig was emblematic of all humanity’s evils, and formed
        the Stoutheart Clan in response. They stockpiled weapons and began a campaign of guerilla warfare against
        Drassig’s armies—even battalions that held former friends and family among their ranks.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fb4f9804-9efd-4561-a095-e48cbb2f3089">Another clan, the Lightfoots, asserted that all
        humans couldn’t be condemned for the evil actions of one king, and pointed to the thousands of halflings and
        other non-humans who had allied themselves with Drassig’s evil regime as proof. The Lightfoots advocated
        protecting as many people as possible while waiting the war out. In the end, it became clear to both halfling
        clans that in a conflict against a tyrant such as Drassig, neutrality was not an option. They banded together
        behind Zan Tal’Dorei’s banner of rebellion.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c084b4bd-dad2-4da6-9b81-fc843b06a58b">These two clans dissolved after the Scattered War,
        but many contemporary halfling families can trace their genealogies back to one or the other, and proudly
        proclaim that their great-grandparents were there when history was being made. Most halflings treat this sense
        of history only as idle fun, though, and few feel any real animosity over old ills and grudges.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c5f19ffd-e5e2-4ce4-a11e-9d3ee7f43574">The Lightfoot Clan dissolved into its many component
        families after the war, but the spirit that created the clan still survives. Those halflings who strongly
        identify with their Lightfoot identity look out for number one first, and are more likely to try to evade
        conflict than to meet an oncoming storm head-on. Yet a contradiction lingers within the Lightfoot spirit, for
        despite all their love of the comforts of home, many Lightfoot halflings feel a certain unquenchable hunger to
        explore. Many adventuring halflings are Lightfoots who have given in to this compulsion.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="462121c6-41aa-4f58-8814-9f4a9fee7a24">The Stoutheart Clan also dissolved in the wake of
        the Scattered War, but its ideals and identity still endure. Brashness and courage even in the face of absurd
        odds embodies the Stoutheart spirit. Recalling the guerilla army that stood against the legions of Drassig, any
        halfling with the fortitude to stand up to a warrior three times their size has more than earned the honor of
        calling themself a Stoutheart—even if their family tree doesn’t have true roots in that historic clan.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cb675b05-e97e-4884-a8c2-f61bc9a9b52b">Stouthearts often surprise other people who know of
        halflings only from experiences with more laid-back Lightfoot folk—and many use this surprise to their advantage
        to become truly cunning diplomats. The proud Stoutheart named Assum Emring, a former member of the Tal’Dorei
        Council, once boisterously claimed that he was so rude, so brash and so defiant in his first meeting with the
        late Sovereign Uriel Tal’Dorei II, that he was very nearly arrested—before being offered a position on the
        sovereign’s staff the very next day!</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3ae8288a-36c8-4160-bc29-a26554753131">If humans ever lived upon Tal’Dorei in the Age of
        Arcanum, they were wiped out entirely by the end of the Calamity. But after the world had begun to recover from
        the devastation wrought by that war of gods and mortals, an expedition of human explorers departed from
        Vasselheim in Issylra, thought to be the only bastion of humanoid culture on the surface of Exandria to survive
        the Calamity. Sailing eastward, they reached the land that would eventually come to be called Tal’Dorei, and
        were shocked to find elves, dwarves, orcs, and half-giants already living there—shattering their belief that the
        Calamity had washed away all mortal life except the people of Vasselheim.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="432d9f38-e4a9-402c-bf0b-863b03954589">Over the years, humans and their ambition have been
        responsible for bloody wars, weapons of unimaginable devastation, and spells that have reduced entire cultures
        to ruin. Yet humans have also driven great advances in art, music, poetry, and theater, and have shown love and
        compassion to the other mortal peoples of the world. The course of human history is never straight, and can turn
        at any time. After all, humans’ lives are short and their minds are chaotic—a fact that troubles many of the
        long-lived elves and dwarves of Tal’Dorei. Still, despite these weaknesses—or perhaps because of them—humans
        have produced some of the most innovative and forward-thinking figures Tal’Dorei has ever known.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4ce7fe49-bd46-488e-a412-94141be732df">Humans can hail from anywhere in Tal’Dorei, for
        although their presence on the continent began as a small colony in the west, that presence quickly spread.
        Humans were eager to trade, to forge alliances, and to find love with the elves, dwarves, orcs, and goliaths of
        Tal’Dorei. Their lands quickly grew in size and power. But then a human despot by the name of Warren Drassig
        broke the peace of trade and coalition in favor of conquest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c346d7fc-beb0-4481-8f8b-d646ec3a8079">Drassig’s betrayal nearly condemned humankind to an
        eternal reputation for villainy. However, one human rebel named Zan Tal’Dorei forged alliances of renewed trust
        between her rebellious faction and the other beleaguered peoples of Drassig’s kingdom. Her forthright idealism
        and steadfast determination won the Scattered War, and laid the foundations for a new society that enshrined the
        alliances she created.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bc53f887-b230-40e8-8a0a-7a693aacd4a0">Though human adventurers can hail from anywhere in
        Tal’Dorei, humans are most commonly found in the lands connected by the Silvercut Roadway: the Bladeshimmer
        Shoreline in the west, the Lucidian Coast in the east, and the Dividing Plains that separate them. A number of
        humans from Wildemount also sailed across the Shearing Channel long ago and settled in the Alabaster Sierras,
        where they founded the city-state of Whitestone.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="93759434-a07d-4a2e-8170-8ed65d117736">Humans living along the Silvercut provide the
        infrastructure for trade across the continent, and as such are often involved in some form of craft, business,
        or production. Human-dominated cities in Tal’Dorei are typically highly diverse, because they were founded with
        the aid of many allies of other ancestries. Today, members of all Exandria’s other peoples come together in
        great cities such as Emon, even as humans from the distant continents of Issylra, Marquet, and Wildemount travel
        to exchange goods and ideas with the vast and bountiful lands of Tal’Dorei. Beyond the cities, dozens of
        human-founded outposts spread along the fringes of lands better known by Tal’Dorei’s older ancestries—the elves,
        dwarves, orcs, goliaths, and even the reclusive giants. Outlanders, explorers, and hermits take refuge here from
        the hectic pace of city life, but still find danger enough in the wilderness to keep them on their toes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="824df930-92d7-4400-a3da-be0207bf5a5d">Many humans likewise live in settlements founded by
        non-humans, ranging in size from tiny gnome-majority villages in Torian Forest to the ancient and stately cities
        of Syngorn and Kraghammer. These humans absorb the cultures of their homes, just as people of other ancestries
        raised in cities such as Emon can grow up with a distinctly human outlook on life.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e7f3ad25-5d28-4b4f-8032-86e58ba4db24">Orcs survived on Tal’Dorei during the Calamity
        through sheer determination and strength. Unlike the elves and dwarves who hid in their secret retreats, and the
        goliaths who watched the destruction from their mountaintops, great clans of orcs fought endless bloody battles
        on the Dividing Plains as the gods and their loyal minions clashed, wielding magic sufficient to rip the world
        asunder. And the orcs endured—perhaps in part because of the divine power behind that people’s creation.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d494a439-524a-4413-8036-3ea66e247872">The myth surrounding the orcs’ origin is a grim one.
        It is said that they were created by accident when the Arch Heart, god of the elves, shot out the eye of the war
        god known as the Ruiner. The Ruiner’s blood poured from his wound and rained upon the armies of elves who served
        the Arch Heart—and those unsuspecting mortals were transformed. Their muscles bulged, tusks grew from their
        jaws, and their minds burned with a thirst for blood.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7bb1286e-28d6-4fdd-95a9-ddea153fd88b">Yet after that battle’s end, the fury within these
        new humanoids burned away, and the orcs survived as a hardy, physically powerful people. In the early days of
        Gwessar, orc clans warred with anyone who invaded their territory, especially the goliaths who descended from
        the mountains to the plains, and who rivaled the orcs in both strength and stature. But once more, fury cooled
        in time, and reasonable voices won out over those of even the most passionate warmongers.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a02a189b-1ced-4cf0-b632-efea20c660eb">Today, orcs and other folk with orcish heritage can
        be found all across Tal’Dorei. Many orcs find their natural athleticism an asset in specific trades, but they
        can be found in every guild and profession. Though orcs and humans have an ancient legacy of conflict that lives
        on in a prejudiced few, the realm is filled with people who denounce and ostracize any who discriminate against
        their orc neighbors.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4f791f9a-0ccf-42c7-b373-6428d86b53f1">Though many of Tal’Dorei’s orcs are related to clans
        that have lived nomadically on the continent since time immemorial, the major cities of the land are also home
        to orcs who’ve traveled to Tal’Dorei from across the sea. Many of those orcs originated in the lands of Xhorhas,
        in Wildemount, and the continent of Marquet—places where orcs have never been denied the opportunity to become

        claiming to detail the evil origin of tieflings, the more progressive parts of the realm have long since stomped
        out such ugly myths. Still, many folk can’t help but show surprise the first time they see a person with horns
        curling from their brow, gleaming eyes of a single solid color, and lustrous, brightly hued skin of red, purple,
        or blue.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="58a23858-d3fc-4070-9813-f9f5671fb223">Scholars have scoured thousands of years of Issylran
        history in search of the origin of tieflings, to little avail. The most complete extant records suggest that
        during the Age of Arcanum, a cabal of power-hungry Issylran warlocks consorted with extraplanar entities, and
        that many of these unions resulted in children who shared the qualities of human and fiend. These progeny of the
        Lower Planes eventually came to break away from that origin to become a people unto themselves.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d31a5357-aff7-43e7-88c7-87747730b3ac">The first tieflings to walk on Tal’Dorei sailed from
        Issylra during the Age of Arcanum, fleeing religious zealots who believed their very existence was an
        abomination. Many tieflings in Tal’Dorei refused to fight during the Calamity, embracing a nihilism which said
        that if the world could reject their kind, perhaps it was better to just let it burn. Yet the world and the
        tieflings survived.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5be767df-f529-4076-b772-4d1531ec2c9f">In the centuries after the Divergence, tieflings who
        had grown weary of gods and demons rejoiced, feeling that the gods’ imprisonment had effectively freed them from
        their cursed past. As such, when Warren Drassig and his sons conquered the elven lands of Gwessar, countless
        tieflings rose in rebellion against the tyrant. They had seen his kind before, they knew his methods, and they
        knew others would suffer as they once had.</p>

        children, and most tieflings belong firmly to that ancient ancestry. Yet to this day, any humanoid—whether
        famous hero or common farmer—who makes a deal with fiends might give rise to children, grandchildren, or even
        more distant descendants born with the horns, eyes, and colorful skin of a tiefling.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="347bc9a3-3107-446a-b149-dbc71d56ed65">Perhaps the most famous tiefling born in the past
        generation is Gwendolyn de Rolo, the youngest daughter of the renowned heroes Percival and Vex’ahlia de Rolo of
        Whitestone. It is an open secret in the city-state that Percival had dealings with fiends as a young man. Yet
        though none of the rumors have precisely pinpointed the nature of Percival’s supernatural bargain, all who know
        Gwendolyn agree that she is the sweetest and most innocent de Rolo to roam the halls of Castle Whitestone in

        unclear as to whether the ancestries of elves, dwarves, orcs, and goliaths routinely mixed before the arrival of
        humankind on Tal’Dorei’s shores. But it’s easy to assume that explorers and ambassadors would inevitably find
        love or companionship among the folk of unfamiliar lands—and it is well known that the arrival of humans changed
        Tal’Dorei forever.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="01fcd99f-e0d3-43ae-94d4-b57b24799028">From the earliest days of human exploration on the
        continent, love and passion began to blossom between all of Tal’Dorei’s people. The children that spring from
        the unions of folk of different heritage bear the traits of each of their parents, so that a human child might
        gain patches of scales and reptilian eyes from a dragonblood parent, or an orc and a dwarf might raise a child
        of squat, stout stature and olive-green skin, and bearing wisps of a coppery beard even as an infant.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2ea7f76a-d563-440d-9eec-9a732a385a87">In the modern age, love unites all folk. People of
        mixed ancestry can be found all across Tal’Dorei, though they are most common in the realm’s cosmopolitan
        cities. Some ancestries are biologically improbable (such as a goliath and a gnome having a child), but
        sufficient application of magic makes even those unions possible. However, money can be a limiting factor in
        such things, as having a skilled mage on hand during conception and childbirth is an expensive process.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="492852d2-726b-4d04-a42a-2b0098f423ec">Non-humanoid creatures with the magical ability to
        assume humanoid size and form, such as dragons, can also sire or give birth to mixed-ancestry children.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MixedAncestryStatistics"
        data-content-chunk-id="cd94bf58-6d18-4891-a687-31e4f77ffdb1"><a href="#MixedAncestryStatistics"
            data-content-chunk-id="2442bf12-fc8d-4fbc-af84-4a8cd372fa12"></a>Mixed Ancestry Statistics</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9e9b96c0-2d09-4a9a-a791-2c6519820115">Only certain combinations of ancestries, such as
        half-elves and half-orcs, already have racial traits described in the fifth edition core rules. You can use
        these racial traits as is, or create your own mixed ancestry from any two races by choosing one or two racial
        traits from one parent’s race and exchanging them for the same number of traits from another parent’s race.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="209fe784-f874-437e-b125-1f2826aca00b">When you build a character of mixed ancestry, keep
        in mind that some racial traits are more mechanically powerful than others, while some are largely flavorful or
        narrative focused. As such, focus on swapping a narrative trait for another narrative trait, or a combat-focused
        trait for another combat-focused trait. Additionally, you must have your Game Master’s permission to use your
        replacement traits. As with any house rule, you and your Game Master might want to revisit your unique
        combination of traits later in the campaign if they feel overpowered or underpowered.</p>

        beings walk the lands of Tal’Dorei. Many of these are rare creatures, never building communities of folk who
        share their appearance and abilities. Some are wholly unique creations of unpredictable magical effects. Others
        are mighty beings such as dragons and giants, who can take on the role of hero or villain with equal ease but
        who intentionally separate themselves from the affairs of Tal’Dorei’s other mortal peoples.</p>

        incredibly sensitive topic, regardless of whether it’s happening to someone’s own character, to another player
        character, or to an NPC. Additionally, many people have blood phobias that they may not want to disclose.
        Because of this, if any player or the GM wants to use one of these options, it’s important that you bring it up

        magic in your game, consider how you can describe your spellcasting in fun and eerie ways. When casting divine
        spells as a Blood Domain cleric, you can flavor your descriptions to tailor the magic’s effect on an opponent’s
        blood and vitality. The <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2147-hold-person"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="191ca039-1500-4f96-9825-d667d114338d">Some characters don’t have blood. It might be
        because they’re a living construct, or have become undead through some macabre magic. If you want to play a
        blood mage but don’t have blood yourself, consider your hemocraft to be a unique variant that channels the power
        of your life force, the necromantic energy that animates you, or even the oil that pumps through your artificial
        form. This is a purely flavorful change, and doesn’t affect any of your subclass features.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="08a5d47b-8101-42ef-9af9-db4ad29b2847">On the other hand, some hemocraft features require
        the targets of your magic to have blood themselves. It’s generally up to the Game Master to decide what does and
        doesn’t have blood, but for the most part, all beasts, dragons, giants, and humanoids need blood to live. Most
        celestials, fey, and fiends have blood or magical ichor, as well as some elementals. However, constructs and
        undead don’t have blood, and are unaffected by hemocraft.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="80d7701f-3d32-48e8-a3f0-261eff797cad">Most aberrations, monstrosities, and plants also
        need blood or some type of vital sap or ichor to survive. It’s recommended that the Game Master rule in the
        players’ favor in cases like these. That said, one way to show that hemocraft is more difficult to use against
        such creatures is to give them advantage on any saving throw against the feature the character is trying to use.

                <p>When Kel’jaia sets her eyes on something, nothing can stop her from achieving it. Her small size has
                    no bearing on her unbelievable strength, which can overpower creatures many times her size. She came
                    to Tal’Dorei after the village on the Rifenmist Peninsula she was defending was razed by the Iron
                    Authority. She first arrived in Syngorn, and through the connections and friendships she made there,
                    was chosen to be a Syngornian delegate to the Tal’Dorei Council. She strongly believes that
                    Tal’Dorei should take a stand against the cruelty of the Authority. Should strife come to Tal’Dorei,
                    Kel’jaia is thought by all to be the council’s first choice for the Master of War, due to her valor,
                    tactical cunning, and battle prowess.</p>

        to target the attacking creature and evoke the story of their downfall. For 1 minute or until the target suffers

        <p>Born in Westruun and raised by two loving goliath parents—a towering warrior and an equally massive
            astronomer of the Yuminor Observatory—Balthasar Bleakskull was exposed to the adventuring lifestyle and
            academia from an early age. He tumbled into the art of theater when he was but a child, and followed his
            passion for drama into adulthood—when he was entangled in a bloodcurdling academic conspiracy that left
            eight dead, including his dramatic mentor and his lover. Since then, he has devoted his dramatic skill to
            the art of tragedy, to grant his audiences the catharsis that he one day hopes to give himself.</p>

        to the skies and sensed the power and mystery carried by Catha and Ruidus, the two moons of Exandria. The
        Moonweaver herself is said to guide her worshipers from within the pale glow of Catha, revealing hidden paths
        and granting inspired dreams to those who pray to that moon. Distant, dark Ruidus is often regarded with awe and
        apprehension, considered a portent for fell deeds and bad luck.</p>

        connection to the moons to wield light and shadow, invoke good fortune and ill favor, and reveal or conceal as
        they see fit. Most Moon clerics worship the Moonweaver herself, but her followers are as varied as the stars in
        the sky. Some seek to protect the vulnerable and do good in the world, while others meddle with impunity and
        distort the truth for selfish gain. Other Moon clerics worship not the gods but the moons themselves, especially
        those with an innate connection to the lunar cycles through lycanthropy.</p>

                <p><em>Elf Moon Domain cleric (they/them)</em></p>
                <p>The moons of Exandria show their faces for all to see, yet hide a secret face from the world. Nalys
                    Ildareth, leader of an obscure Syngornian sect of the Moonweaver, believes that true reverence
                    requires all faithful to have a face they show to the world—represented by a mask of silver they
                    never remove—and one they keep to themselves, beneath the mask. Nalys believes that it is their duty
                    to enact the Moonweaver’s will upon Exandria, and keep the world safe within the balance of Catha’s
                    calm order and the ill-fated chaos of Ruidus. They are thoughtful and calculating, seeming an
                    impassive observer while they wait for the proper moment to strike, but then transforming into a
                    furious avenger when that moment arrives.</p>

        attuned to nature and channeling power that grants you spells and allows you to transform your body. When your
        druid character chooses a druid circle at 2nd level, the Circle of the Blighted is a new option available in a
        Tal’Dorei campaign.</p>

        find themselves drawn to a particular shrine or natural site, binding their body and spirit to these places of

        in defending these sacred realms.</p>

        magics, the tainted presence of an ancient terror, or a terrible mistake unleashed by druids themselves, a land
        can become cursed with magic that warps any druid bound to that land. Twisted by their connection to an
        unhallowed territory, these guardians come to embody the defiled nature they serve, exalting the natural process
        of decay and using it to further their goals—or sometimes to seek a means to end the curse that plagues them.

                <p><em>Firbolg Circle of the Blighted druid (she/her)</em></p>
                <p>Life was beautiful under the light of the sun for Camellia Springshower. The sun caused her flowers
                    to flourish, and the rains nourished them so they could grow when next the sun arose. One day,
                    however, she wandered too far from her family while they traveled the Dividing Plains, and tumbled
                    into the bleak depths of Shadebarrow, a forgotten, accursed tomb. She ran for the light, but a
                    specter reached out from the walls and touched a ghastly finger to her chest. She felt her blood run
                    cold, and the flowers within her basket wither away. Though she escaped the Shadebarrow, she was
                    never able to find her family again, and she now wanders the Dividing Plains like an untethered
                    shadow—hoping to use the blighted powers granted to her by the shade to do some semblance of good in
                    the world, even if all life seems to wither beneath her touch.</p>

        the unseen energy of life grants you supernatural insights and the ability to manipulate your foes. When your
        monk character chooses a monastic tradition at 3rd level, the Way of the Cobalt Soul is a new option available
        in a Tal’Dorei campaign.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="80bbca74-d285-4745-a419-3da35a7bfca0">Driven by the pursuit of knowledge and its scholars’
        worship of the Knowing Mentor, the Library of the Cobalt Soul is one of the best-respected and most heavily
        guarded repositories of tomes, history, and information in all Exandria. People from all lands come to the
        library to seek knowledge, and those particularly dedicated to the virtues of truth often pledge their minds and
        bodies to the Cobalt Soul’s cause. To become a member of the Cobalt Soul is to give oneself over to a quest
        dedicated to unveiling life’s mysteries, bringing light to the secrets of concealed evil, and guarding the most
        powerful and dangerous of truths from those whose unwholesome thirst for knowledge might bring death and
        suffering to others.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4f84ed46-dc0e-4808-b696-0ebbba31669b">The monks of the Cobalt Soul are the embodiment of
        the maxim: “Know your enemy.” Through tireless research, they steel themselves against the unrelenting tides of
        evil. Through rigorous training, they learn to break through their foes’ mental and physical defenses. Then,
        once the fight is done, they record their findings for future generations of monks to study.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c50870fc-6e8a-471f-a302-cb5bbab0ca1e">Starting at 3rd level, you can strike pressure
        points to intuit crucial information about a foe. When you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by
        your Flurry of Blows, you can analyze it. Whenever an analyzed creature misses you with an attack, you can
        immediately use your reaction to make an unarmed strike against that creature if it’s within your reach. This
        benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="245c71eb-ea06-4b50-b0d6-65181009017b">Additionally, when you analyze a creature, you learn

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1d6443d0-1ddc-4dca-9f97-0015ac90845f">Starting at 6th level, you can precisely strike a
        hidden cluster of nerves on a creature, temporarily preventing it from masking its true thoughts and intent.
        When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to force it to make a Charisma saving
        throw. On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak a deliberate lie, and all Charisma checks directed at
        the creature are made with advantage for up to 10 minutes. You know if it succeeded or failed on its saving
        throw.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b2ab1045-28da-487e-b16d-a8c386db149c">An affected creature is aware of the effect and can
        thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in
        its answers as long as the effect lasts.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9a381183-617f-4446-987c-df6ecf1b749b">If you wish to impose this effect on a creature
        without injuring it, you can attack the creature to simply touch it, dealing no damage on a hit.</p>

        knowledge to manipulate a creature’s ki to undermine their fortitude. When you hit a creature with an unarmed
        strike, you can spend 3 ki points to cause the creature to gain vulnerability to one damage type of your choice
        for 1 minute, or until the end of a turn in which it has taken damage of that type.</p>

                type you choose, this resistance is suppressed for 1 minute, rather than gaining vulnerability. A
                creature that is immune to the damage type you choose is unaffected. A creature who is affected by this
                feature cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>

                <p>A freshly titled expositor of the Cobalt Soul, Cressida Holt has already made a name for themself as

                    they are most often seen in Emon, Kymal, and Westruun, where they infiltrate political galas,
                    high-stakes games of two-card, and other dens of high-society corruption.</p>
                <p>Though most Cobalt Soul expositors are expected to keep a low profile and gather intelligence,
                    Cressida has found success with a flashier method. She strides into a room in a fine cobalt-blue
                    suit, makes sensual eye contact with the most beautiful person in the room, and casually makes
                    herself someone from whom no one can keep a secret.</p>

        warriors, swashbuckling sailors, and traveling guardians who seek the thrill of a limitless horizon. Driven to
        search for adventure and mystery across and beneath every endless oceanic expanse, paladins who swear this oath
        stand against those who would deny liberty to likeminded travelers, rooting out tyranny and corruption wherever
        it is found.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e79d562e-4387-43c5-a4bc-0786fc1acbd4">Such guardians believe in the natural beauty of the
        sea, often making offerings and prayers to entities or deities such as the Wildmother or the Stormlord who
        influence safe passage. At the same time, they answer the call to hunt the monstrous creatures that too often
        bloody the waters with wanton violence and ill intent, and which terrorize the folk of the sea and shore.</p>

                <p>Though he is only in his early 30s, famed sailor Shirkuh Marín is well on the way to having his life
                    become an epic sung in taverns all over the Lucidean Ocean. Born a girl to Marquesian immigrant
                    parents in Nicodranas on Wildemount’s Menagerie Coast, Shirkuh took his present name from his
                    great-granduncle, an infamous Marquesian pirate. He swore to wear that name with pride, and has
                    followed his own code of honor and ethics ever since. He has worked hand-in-hand with both honest
                    sailors and pirates of the Revelry—and clashed swords with both, too.</p>
                <p>Of the many tales that surround Shirkuh, it’s unclear which are true—if he truly outran a juvenile
                    kraken in the Shearing Channel, if he indeed cheated the Plank King in a game of two-card and lived
                    to tell the tale, and if he actually managed to steal the heart of a Clasp Spireling in Kymal. But
                    most agree that even if the stories are made up, he possesses both the talent and the recklessness
                    to have accomplished them if he set his mind to it.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d7859204-899f-44d0-8d58-29eecfdcd84d">You are a spellcaster to whom magic comes as
        naturally as breathing, possessing an instinctive grasp of its power—for that power flows through your very
        veins. When your sorcerer character chooses a sorcerous origin at 1st level, the Runechild origin is a new
        option available in a Tal’Dorei campaign.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Runechild"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="594f8699-3c2b-4418-ae84-02c5547373d6">The mysterious weave and flow of magic is feared by
        many folk across Exandria. But while some spellcasters must study the essence and nature of magic in the hope of
        learning to harness it, sorcerers possess an innate talent to sculpt and wield the errant strands of power that
        shape the world. For some sorcerers, the body becomes a conduit for this power, which is collected and stored in
        the form of natural runes—and which sees a sorcerer named as a Runechild.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c8f1f77b-bd78-4246-b65f-a487537381f7">The talents of a Runechild are rare, and sorcerers
        with this origin are sought after for study by mages and scholars alike, driven by a prevalent belief that the
        secrets of their runes can help understand the mysteries of magic. Others sometimes seek to enslave Runechild
        sorcerers, using their bodies as tortured spell batteries for diabolic pursuits. Runechild sorcerers were
        subjugated throughout the Age of Arcanum, and many of their contemporaries now search for ways to hide their
        essence—a task that isn’t easy given the revealing nature of their gifts.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b64ffc20-e31b-48c4-85ea-2f11a1d1de60">At 1st level, your body begins to express your
        innate magic as runes traced out across your skin. You start with 1 essence rune, and gain an additional rune
        whenever you gain a level in this class. These runes can manifest anywhere on your body, though the first
        usually manifests on the forehead. Your essence runes remain invisible when inert.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3edfeba3-afe3-4d57-8a30-91333a9d7f15">At the end of a turn during which you spent one or
        more sorcery points, a number of your essence runes equal to the number of sorcery points you spent begin to
        glow with stored energy, becoming charged runes. You use these charged runes to power your Runechild subclass
        features. Also, as a bonus action, you may spend a sorcery point to convert two essence runes into two charged
        runes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f1091206-5899-4aae-b34c-177946ca416b">If you have 5 or more charged runes, you emit bright
        light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c38ae09e-8372-4ff6-ae27-013b21398847">If you expend a charged rune to use one of your
        Runechild features, it returns to being an inert essence rune. Any charged runes also revert to inert essence
        runes after you finish a long rest.</p>

                <p>When you’re a model in a city as big as Emon, you’ve got to find a way to stand out. Being a
                    broad-shouldered, heavyset dragonblood with brass scales that twinkle in the sun is a good start,
                    but Karzy Sunscale has another ace up his sleeve: he’s a runechild. Ever since he was an infant, he
                    has manifested strange magical abilities, and when he expresses intense emotions through his magic,
                    mysterious runes flare to life upon his scales. All of these traits have always made Karzy the
                    center of attention, and he basks in other peoples’ interest like a lizard in the sun. He goes out
                    of his way to dress in outrageous fashions and emote as vividly as he can. He works as a fashion
                    model in Emon, but the idea has worked its way into his head that he could make an even bigger
                    splash if he were to also become a celebrity adventurer by completing a truly monumental quest.</p>

        practitioners, the use of blood magic—also known as hemocraft—is a rare art that harnesses the latent powers of
        a creature’s vitality to fuel and amplify the caster’s own capabilities, while manipulating and weakening the
        bodies of enemies from the inside. Some of the more macabre mages seeking to empower their arcane pursuits turn
        to hemocraft as a means of bolstering their spells, giving their own life’s blood to reach new heights of
        frightening magical prowess.</p>

        magic were once the sole purview of the mysterious Claret Orders. In recent years, however, these secrets have
        begun to spread beyond the order’s members and into the hands of less scrupulous mages. Blood magic has a bad

                <p><em>Tiefling Blood Magic wizard (she/her)</em></p>
                <p>It’s not easy being the youngest spellwright in the League of Miracles, especially when you’ve got a
                    conscience. Honor Kinnabari was enamored with the league since she was a child in Westruun, when she
                    saw the spellwrights and their adranach constructs rebuild the entire Market Ward in a matter of
                    days after it was reduced to a slag pit by a hoard of magma landsharks. She was raised by dwarf
                    parents from the Alabaster Sierras, and wears wizardly robes in the style of their clan in honor of
                    them. Honor has just constructed an adranach of her own, and has begun leading small-scale
                    operations for the league, but she’s starting to worry that something cultish and sinister lurks
                    beneath her compatriots’ practiced smiles.</p>

        roleplaying game has a background. While your class represents your role in an adventuring party, your
        background represents who you were and what you learned before you began your adventuring career. Your
        background doesn’t necessarily have to be confined to the past, though, as the way it marks your connections to
        the world might involve ongoing commitments to an organization or even an entire people.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="674f20c2-202a-4c30-9744-e8127d975dfc">The new backgrounds in this section each grant your
        character new proficiencies, languages, and equipment, as well as a unique background feature. Tables of
        characteristics can also help you quickly generate personality traits, ideals, character flaws, and bonds to tie

        Tal’Dorei, you are a member of the Ashari people—a society bound to an ancient covenant protecting the Material
        Plane from the chaos of the primordial elements. You’ve been raised to revere and protect the natural world, and
        to shepherd the tumultuous elemental forces that give it life. When the elements threaten to overwhelm the
        delicate balance of nature, it is the role of the Ashari to restore harmony.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="006c45aa-fe5a-42d3-9528-c8116db650af">You grew up in a tight-knit society, bound to a
        leader who successfully returned from the traditional journey to the Elemental Planes known as an Aramante. By
        contrast, you might well have never traveled more than a few days from your home, and thus have closer bonds
        with your family and neighbors than many people of Tal’Dorei.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="19cf9c22-0d31-4296-9dcc-4dcf8253f0ae">In your early life, you likely took up one of the
        many roles that make up your society, whether homemaker, hunter, explorer, or protector. If you have the ability
        to use elemental magic, you might have had one of the most important duties of all: protecting and soothing the
        elemental rift at the heart of your home. And even as an adventurer now traveling far beyond that home, your
        loyalties still lie with the continued safety of your order. Whatever else you do as you learn about the new
        world around you, you’re conscious of the need to gather allies to your cause.</p>

        can also make them determined, steadfast, and tightly focused on their goals. Ever since Keyleth, Voice of the
        Tempest and leader of the Zephrah, became a world-renowned hero, the Air Ashari at least have become more
        familiar to Tal’Dorei’s other peoples. They are known to welcome outsiders to their mountaintop enclave, and to

    <p data-content-chunk-id="76c91208-1715-4dea-baad-fcf90b7de258">Whether you grew up in the mean streets of Kymal
        bamboozling foolish gamblers, or spent your youth pilfering loose coin from the pockets of Emon’s many tourists,
        your lifestyle of deceiving-to-survive eventually drew the attention of the Clasp: a storied crime syndicate
        that has hideouts in every city in Tal’Dorei. In exchange for protection, a modicum of kinship, and a number of
        useful resources to further develop your craft as a criminal, you agreed to receive the brand of the Clasp and
        join their ranks.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8e070479-42f4-47f9-9d3e-8dfdb990e755">You might have spent time working the guild’s most
        menial assignments, wandering the alleys as a simple cutpurse and filling your pockets with silver while you
        waited to climb the professional ladder. Or you might be a clever actor and liar, whose skill at blending in
        with all facets of society has made you an indispensable spy. Perhaps your swift technique with a blade led you
        to become a feared assassin for the Spireling leader of a local Clasp sect. Regardless, though the threat of the
        law is ever looming, the advantages to having a connection to such a powerful cartel greatly outweighs your
        paranoia. Most of the time.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ed4e0ce3-d34d-467c-ae2f-64d483d3f7ba">Since the Clasp is an organization, its members can
        rise in rank by proving their worth, by making the right friends in high places, or even through blackmail and
        bribery. You and the Game Master can decide together how your actions affect your rank in the Clasp, and what
        benefits that rank grants you.</p>

        can call in a favor from your contacts whenever you’re close enough to a center of syndicate activity. A request
        for a favor can be no longer than 20 words, and is passed up the chain to an undisclosed Spireling for approval.
        This favor can take on any form subject to the approval of the GM, who decides how it is fulfilled. If muscle is
        requested, an NPC member of the Clasp (using statistics found in <a
            href="/sources/tcsr/allies-and-adversaries-of-taldorei#ClaspOperatives"
            data-content-chunk-id="a927c64d-a0a8-4f73-89e8-ebb7f30693cc">chapter 6</a>) can temporarily aid your party.
        If money is needed, a small loan can be provided. If you’ve been imprisoned, Clasp operatives can look into
        breaking you out or paying off the jailer.</p>

        repayment, often without warning. Refusing the call will result in your termination—literally. You might be
        called on to commit a specific burglary, or to pressure an Emonian dignitary to reveal a secret at an upcoming
        ball. The Clasp might even demand that you assassinate a specific person, with no questions asked or answered.
        It’s the GM’s prerogative to ensure that the syndicate’s request is proportionate to the favor they bestowed—or
        that they compensate you in other ways for a service that goes beyond the scope of repaying the initial favor.

        scrupulous. As a Myriad operative in Tal’Dorei, you might have been given a specific task that furthers that
        syndicate’s hunger to expand beyond Wildemount, or which gives them an edge in their rivalry with the Clasp.
        Moreover, you understand the wisdom of keeping your activities secret from fellow criminals as well as law

        syndicate is a feared group of thieves and killers, whose name is often invoked only in whispers. But at the
        same time, the organization has a reputation for guerilla heroism, in response to its members having saved
        countless lives when the Chroma Conclave attacked Emon. And so like every Clasp member, your own reputation
        often swings between these two poles.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="84b1a823-a0d1-4c68-8f3f-b7f79c14025a">Your bond is likely associated with your fellow

        your importance and indispensability to the Clasp.</p>

        pulled you from your studies, and you now face the challenge of keeping up with your education even as the tides
        of destiny threaten to sweep you away.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e295596b-9b2e-4fbd-8685-8c7c5e0ffbb4">You might have come to the Lyceum to better research
        and understand the history and lore of Exandria and the lands you call home. Perhaps you sought a future here as
        a professor—or you might hope to do so still. You could also have been drawn by the promise of prosperity in
        politics, learning the inner workings of government and alliances to better position yourself as a future writer
        of history. Or perhaps your knack for the arcane inspired you to attend the Lyceum to refine your spellcraft,
        following in the footsteps of some of the finest wizards to ever practice the arts of magic.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="08ade624-9fb5-4e8d-b678-329defe3975b">When you choose this background, you could be either
        an active student seeking adventures for your own research, or a graduated alumnus. With a little modification,
        you could easily be a professor as well.</p>

        land. If you came from a smaller city, a rural area, or Tal’Dorei’s relatively uncharted wilderness, studying at

        since the world’s founding—the Prime Deities and the Betrayer Gods. During the Calamity, the Prime Deities
        allied themselves with the mortal races of Exandria, their original creations, to protect their flawed world and
        its multifarious forms of life. The Betrayers sought to wipe the slate clean.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c0058f9b-1594-4497-8b07-4f450f238aa5">At the end of that devastating war, the Prime
        Deities established a Divine Gate that would prevent all gods, good or evil, from directly affecting the world,
        but which would leave the gods’ mortal followers and supernal servants to enact their will. And so the
        corrupting whispers of the Betrayer Gods have ensnared the minds of power-hungry mortals for centuries,
        promising them a sliver of the gods’ great power in exchange for dedicating their souls to occult lore.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b6feca0b-dbd1-41a0-b60d-1f49fca5abec">You once belonged to such a cult of the Betrayer
        Gods. Perhaps this faith only briefly tempted your rebellious, youthful spirit. Perhaps the cult gave you love
        and family when you had none, asking only your adherence to their prophet in exchange. Or maybe you were raised
        from birth to pay homage to gods of selfish cruelty—until one fateful day the veil was lifted, so that nothing
        stood between you and the horrifying truth.</p>

        you will be hunted—and if the members of the cult think you dead, their hunt will begin again the second they
        learn they’re wrong.</p>

        enthusiasts—treat you differently. You might be seen as a noble defender of the people, a selfish hoarder of
        power, or anything in between, at the GM’s discretion.</p>

        someone on behalf of the de Rolo family, or you might have been separated from your company while on an

        Rifle Corps do not represent the apex of firearms skill in Whitestone. A clandestine group of elite soldiers and
        survivalists is drawn secretly from the Rifle Corps ranks. Called the Whitestone Hunters, these soldiers are
        special operatives of the de Rolo family, and loyally serve as spies, bodyguards, and even assassins when the
        job requires it. Though few officially know of them, rumors of the Whitestone Hunters’ existence swirl
        constantly throughout the city-state, often in response to their activities after having been loaned out to
        protect Whitestone’s allies.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ab2d8720-d78c-49b3-8f73-c792cc72c5b7">You are one of these Whitestone Hunters, even if

    <p data-content-chunk-id="cf0022f1-7958-4224-85a3-0629a605460d">Most lives and souls find their ways easily along
        the paths of fate and destiny, oblivious and eager to be a part of the history meant for them. Some souls,
        however, carry themselves with mysterious influence, the golden threads of their fate subtly guiding history as
        they pass. Events both magnificent and catastrophic often follow such souls, which take the form of great rulers
        and terrible tyrants, powerful mages, religious leaders, and legendary heroes. These are the fate-touched.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="166e459e-2ff0-40f7-aca4-e50766f05dba">Few fate-touched ever become aware of their
        prominent nature. Without the confirmation of the gods themselves, few can know for certain that they bear this
        blessing. And this is as it should be, for people of renown and power grow easily jealous of those whose gifts
        outstrip their own. The surviving chronicles of the Age of Arcanum are filled with tales of magical hierarchs
        who enslaved those they took for fate-touched—or worse, attempted to extract the essence of fate from them by
        the most horrid means. Being touched by fate can be a blessing or a curse. It is most often those who bear the
        blessings of fortune who are remembered by history, while those cursed by fate are forgotten. Most cultures of
        Exandria have legends of those marked by ill fate simply by being born under the full light of Ruidus, the
        vermilion moon around which countless fell legends swirl.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6d2e300d-e50e-4992-8b8a-834355826cfb">Player characters and NPCs gain this blessing by
        having the GM grant it to them, gaining the Fortune’s Grace feature as a result. A character might receive the
        blessing as a gift from the gods, or as a temporary and surprising phenomenon when the campaign shifts into a
        story arc focused on that character. An NPC ally might bear this blessing to help them survive as the characters
        protect them from a terrible threat. A previously benign NPC might even become a power-hungry villain as they
        test the limits of their fate-touched gift.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="50876c42-fc6a-4bd2-bcfe-8aca18af7466">Your fate-touched essence can cause events to shift
        in your favor. When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can choose to reroll the
        d20. You must reroll the die before the outcome of the initial roll is determined.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d639b65c-469e-4c68-b3c0-970ac0706dec">Alternatively, when a creature you can see makes an
        attack against you or makes a saving throw against one of your spells or features, you can force that creature
        to reroll the attack roll or saving throw.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="389f65cd-8cc1-4bdc-859b-b0fb9a77aac2">If the roll that triggers the reroll is made with
        advantage or disadvantage, both d20s are rerolled. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
        finish a long rest.</p>

        run enjoyable games. A GM is the starting point of the storytelling process, coming up with narratively
        compelling adventure frameworks that they and the players then turn into a campaign. To do so, a GM works up
        locations and scenarios that their players will have fun with. They stock adventures with loot and magic items
        to reward daring characters, villains and monsters to defend those valuable treasures, and NPCs of all kinds who
        can give clues, help as allies, or oppose the characters in their goals.</p>

        running campaigns in Tal’Dorei. It also contains a number of new magic items, including the legendary Vestiges

    <p data-content-chunk-id="8640c074-aa42-4a22-8f6c-fd84d834add6">Before reading this section, you should familiarize
        yourself with “<a href="/sources/tcsr/welcome-to-taldorei#RunningaTalDoreiCampaign"
            data-content-chunk-id="7b6f21a5-3458-42cd-92a1-a2f74eaea2b2">Running a Tal’Dorei Campaign</a>” in <a

            3</a> of this book also contains dozens of specific story hooks, many of which tie into the big-picture
        secrets introduced in chapter 1. Some hooks are simple, giving you just enough to inspire your next game
        session. Some are more complex, and can cascade into an entire campaign’s worth of story.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bfb1309b-035f-42c5-ba46-789955e554b2">You’ll notice that these story hooks present a
        beginning, and sometimes a hint of a middle, but never a conclusion. That’s because they’re designed to spark
        your imagination, but in a way that still leaves you to fill out the rest of the story framework in your own
        way. The goal of this book is to provide the building blocks with which you can create your own Tal’Dorei, and
        these open-ended plot seeds will help you set up adventures that feel right at home in the world of <em>Critical
            Role</em>—whether you’re a long-time fan of the show or are brand-new to Tal’Dorei.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c2c3db16-9030-4054-8948-0e664ece2ba4">If you’re an experienced GM, you might already have
        your own approach to creating adventures from story hooks. But especially if you’re a beginning GM, this section
        presents a straightforward approach you can try out for expanding hooks into full adventures. And even as an
        experienced GM, if you ever feel stuck while planning an adventure, it can help to create a “fill-in-the-blanks”
        outline of your narrative. Start by dividing a page of your GM journal (whether it’s a physical page or a
        digital one) into three sections labeled “Beginning,” “Middle,” and “End.” Then think about what happens in each
        of those parts of your adventure as a means of opening up your creative process.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="BeginninganAdventure"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="64290af4-7e1d-4390-9222-103586c418c7">The beginning of most adventures comes when the
        characters receive a quest or are plunged headfirst into an unexpected scenario. In the Beginning section of
        your GM journal, write one sentence about how you want the characters to learn of the adventure. For example: “A
        member of the Tal’Dorei Council posts an urgent notice about a dangerous creature in every tavern in Emon,
        promising a 1,000 gp reward.” Then write down little notes about other things you want in the beginning scene.
        Where is this opening scene set? What other NPCs are there? Are there environmental notes or clues you want to
        communicate to the players?</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="aa831f5b-a4d2-440b-9dea-de10f3d9a246">The middle of an adventure is filled with conflict,
        whether episodic events during travel, a dungeon exploration filled with deadly traps and territorial monsters,
        or intense diplomatic negotiations. In the Middle section, write down notes about what sort of conflict you want
        your adventure to have. Most story hooks in this book contain a clear antagonist or threat—so start by writing
        down that antagonist and then brainstorming secondary threats that will challenge the characters on their way to
        facing their main foe. In addition to the monsters in <a href="/sources/tcsr/allies-and-adversaries-of-taldorei"
            data-content-chunk-id="74b00f2f-f98c-49c5-becc-7855f6163b7f">chapter 6</a> of this book, the fifth edition
        rules are filled with useful monsters that are perfectly at home in Exandria.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1daad660-2edf-418e-8429-fd38fe72874b">The end of an adventure is where the characters gain
        their reward and return to safety. In the Ending section of your journal, write down ideas for treasure or other
        rewards that you want to give the characters. You can make use of the new treasures featured in this book, as
        well as the varied rewards described in the fifth edition rules.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="af1e69b6-bb9f-4ee8-9408-f87342cef1c5">Remember that treasure doesn’t have to be gold or
        magic items, and it doesn’t have to be found in a dungeon. When the characters return to town carrying the head
        of the monster they’ve slain, their quest-giver might grant them an audience with the Tal’Dorei Council, give
        them special use of the Traverse Junction or some other magical marvel of the Alabaster Lyceum, or bestow any
        number of other immaterial rewards.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="460e35a8-6f86-4c31-919b-e30a284b0807">Don’t worry if your plans go awry—they will. No RPG
        session ever goes totally as planned. The most important skill for any GM is the ability to improvise, because
        you can never predict everything your players will do. Make your plans loose and variable, and be willing to
        have fun and change course. Your players are surprised by every challenge you throw at them—so give yourself a
        chance for the same experience! It can be fun to be surprised, especially when you’re the GM who supposedly
        holds all the important story cards.</p>

            holding onto you, then—whoosh!—the wind catches you, and swings you back into the sky.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2a9b48aa-da3c-4572-9736-59c8394b749d">During the wars of the Calamity, destruction rained
        across the world. Fragmented chronicles of this time recount battles between gods that leveled mountains and
        sank whole civilizations beneath the waves. Chosen heroes rose up to accept weapons, armor, and other magic
        items blessed by their patron gods to staunch the inexorable tide of death. Powerful archmages wove the
        overflowing arcane powers of the war into legendary magic items that could both thwart death and mete it out in
        equal measure.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0d637906-9c67-4fea-8cc1-b36ee88e4ec0">These relics of the Age of Arcanum armed mortals
        with god-like powers, and escalated the Calamity to a fever pitch. Soon after, the war climaxed in a wave of
        total destruction that left much of Exandria in ruins. Thousands of years of history were reduced to ash—and in
        that ash were buried many of these selfsame relics. Some of those not lost were passed down through bloodlines
        for generations, becoming potent symbols of authority and rulership. Others were sealed away by those who feared
        their power. These mighty echoes of the war that nearly shattered Exandria and the divine banishment that
        followed are known as the Vestiges of Divergence.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fb170da1-9581-4571-9ac4-4a35a366ef64">The Vestiges of Divergence are unique even among
        legendary magic items, for each one touches the defiant soul of its wielder and grows in power alongside them.
        The base state of a Vestige of Divergence is its dormant state, which the item returns to if sealed away or
        otherwise kept from being attuned by a worthy individual for a long period of time. A dormant state still imbues
        a modicum of power to an attuned wielder. But with time, perseverance, and personal growth, the Vestige of
        Divergence can regain access to some of its lost power in its awakened state. Eventually, if its bearer
        overcomes personal hardship and transforms their own soul, a Vestige of Divergence reaches its full potential in
        its exalted state. This shows the true power of the item, as it was when first utilized in the Calamity against
        gods armed for war.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="acc769b9-3ef8-45dc-a1ea-75befc53901e">The point at which a character finds a Vestige of
        Divergence, as well as the point at which that item starts to unlock its full power, is entirely in the hands of
        the Game Master—though it is a topic that players and GMs can discuss and mutually scheme over between game
        sessions. The acquisition of such an item—or the discovery of its true identity—has the potential to be a scene
        of momentous narrative weight. Those who bear a Vestige of Divergence are respected and feared by those who
        understand these items’ true power. But such an honor can also paint a target on the bearer’s back, for many
        covet such power, and would do anything to obtain it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="22295e87-96be-4092-9d3c-5a833d571c89">Many of the Vestiges of Divergence detailed in this
        section can currently be found in Tal’Dorei, while others are scattered elsewhere throughout Exandria. Some of
        these relics remain lost to time, waiting for someone to find them among the dust and rubble. Others might be in
        use by powerful heroes ready to pass the item’s power onto a worthy successor who fights for the proper cause.
        Still others might be in the hands of twisted souls using them to terrorize the weak and defenseless. The
        Vestiges of Divergence are both magic items and narrative devices, and it’s the GM’s choice as to where any one
        of them might be found or earned.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d918248b-1b26-4247-ba52-8fd32cc5acd6">The conditions by which a Vestige of Divergence
        progresses to its next level of power can vary, and often revolve around the nature of the specific item and its
        magic. An attuned bearer of a Vestige of Divergence must often symbolically progress to a new state of
        self-discovery or accomplishment. Alternatively, a Vestige of Divergence might bequeath new power to a character
        in a state of extreme personal duress or desperation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1ac92953-0774-44bb-be20-4ab4f5d0c66a">Such triggering moments are entirely up to the Game
        Master to identify and unveil, and as such, will likely manifest in unexpected ways. Players should allow the
        organic narrative moments that they feel might exemplify such an advancement to occur, and GMs should tailor the
        triggering moment accordingly to be important, impactful, and memorable.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e777d371-986c-430c-9999-243ac319f355">Examples of the kinds of moments that can trigger
        the advancement of a Vestige of Divergence include the following:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="b4e49b6e-21d1-465f-898c-b802b57bb171">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="78ed25f7-b7d4-497a-94a3-f84efbbfff93">A character finally surmounts one of their
            greatest fears, bravely overcoming a traumatic event to save a party member.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="3ed999a4-e4dd-4350-9719-604070927959">A character is mercilessly defeated by a
            long-hated foe, and in the face of such defeat, they feel a deep, dormant strength grow from within.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="7bc36cf3-89f9-49e2-890f-6d4ae96bf9f7">A character loses a close ally in battle, and
            the anguish and fury stirs the power within their Vestige of Divergence.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="65c60e23-19e7-492b-acc7-50d8cc2b29e7">A character discovers a facet of their destiny
            that calls their actions toward a dangerous cause—and against their own fear, they accept their fate and
            responsibility.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="85b97d22-eb0d-4ffe-9570-d920295f4196">A character claims vengeance against a rival
            who has tormented them for ages.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="60a1d578-c816-4007-b00b-2b5713c85e9b">A character known for restraint gives in to the
            amoral violence that the relic they bear was dedicated to.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2b9fd5ac-77c4-48fd-b89d-3e5788c31059">If you want to keep the Vestiges “balanced,” in
        addition to being narratively significant, then characters may find a dormant Vestige before 11th level—perhaps
        unaware that it’s even a Vestige! That dormant Vestige is awakened somewhere between 11th and 17th level, and is
        exalted at any time after that. Even using these level ranges as a rule of thumb, you shouldn’t rely too heavily
        on those mechanical benchmarks. A Vestige of Divergence’s advancement is triggered by character development, not
        simply by leveling up.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f1c8b73a-5e5a-4c8c-82ce-99af58c390fa">The Vestiges of Divergence were all created by
        humanoids or gifted by the gods to their humanoid champions. As such, all of these legendary magic items are
        sized to suit Medium creatures. However, the mighty magic that thrums within each item allows it to grow or
        shrink in size to suit the creature attuned to it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="10571952-6882-4231-b6ed-0f85e44b9c39">The game statistics of a Vestige of Divergence don’t
        change when it resizes unless the item is a weapon. When a Large or larger creature makes an attack with such a
        weapon, the weapon deals one additional damage die for each size category its wielder is larger than Medium. For
        example, if <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip" href="/magic-items/7170938-fenthras"
            data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/7170938-tooltip">Fenthras</a> is used by a Large fey, attacks made using the
        longbow deal 2d8 piercing damage. If <a class="tooltip-hover magic-item-tooltip"
            href="/magic-items/7171000-pyremaul" data-tooltip-href="/magic-items/7171000-tooltip">Pyremaul</a> is used
        by a Huge giant, attacks made using the maul deal 4d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>
    <aside class="tcsr--major-epigraph">
        <p>When the god-war spread across Exandria, no creature was safe, no matter how small and insignificant, no
            matter how mighty and powerful. For the battles between gods, would-be gods, and their divine monstrosities
            took place on such a scale that mountains were sundered and whole cities perished. How could any mortal hope
            to sway the fate of their own world?</p>
        <p>The answer—perhaps ironically, given how the arcane arts and a hunger for godhood brought about the
            Calamity—lay in magic of both arcane and divine provenance. Not paltry charms or trinkets, but the kind of
            magic that suffuses the ley lines of this world and plucks at the very fabric of reality. True, a mortal
            army may be naught but a cloud of gnats to the gods, but a singular hero—or villain—wielding an artifact
            imbued with magic beyond reckoning...such a champion could bring their strength and cunning to bear amidst
            the devastation of the god-war.</p>
        <p>Thus, the gods and even the greatest mortal mages wrought relics of a might never seen before, nor, I think,
            since. Moreover, the full potential of these items could only used by those with souls worthy of wielding
            such legendary power….</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e7879879-39a4-47ca-9939-1eade184447e">Every campaign embarks on its heroic tale in its own
        way. Simple beginnings for a ragtag lot of sellswords. Students of the world falling in with the wrong crowd.
        Unwitting pawns of destiny thrust into plots much larger than themselves. However you wish to formulate your
        story and world—whether as player or GM—the rules of the game can help set a clear vision of how to run a
        campaign with consistency and intended design.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b531860a-265c-43b2-8b29-6c03935c8777">That being said, sometimes the experienced group
        wishes to add some new flavor to the existing structure of the gaming world. You can bring in new options for
        old rules, or adjust to a more advanced level of difficulty in a mystical world where danger—and even death—can
        be easily circumvented. This section outlines a number of homebrew rules and guidelines that any campaign can
        adopt to further customize the gaming experience, and which can fit in especially well with a Tal’Dorei
        campaign.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0dc763d4-44d6-404d-bae3-bb67d80a54d6">As with any homebrew or nonstandard rules and
        options, any of the options presented here that appeal to the players should be approved and implemented by the
        Game Master. Likewise, Game Masters should discuss the possible inclusion of any of these options with players
        beforehand, to ensure that everyone will have fun with the intended changes. Talk these options over and make
        sure everyone is aware of and fully understands the new rules.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="84e020ef-a316-46ab-80bd-af290c25d371">Certain adventures thrive on the adrenaline of the
        chase or the ever-present fear of ambush. As it stands, the need to take a short rest can prove difficult during
        long dungeon crawls, and this lends itself to a nice tone of personal stress and risk versus reward. However,
        sometimes a rest is necessary for the party to continue, even if the current rush of the story’s clock won’t
        allow for the hour that a short rest requires.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1c9b19b6-27f5-48fb-a09a-e092a8022453">One way to make short rests less intrusive is to let
        characters take one in a reduced amount of time. If the characters have only 10 minutes to spare, let them take
        a 10-minute short rest. If they have half an hour to spare, let them take a short rest in 30 minutes. This fits
        the game mechanics to the story’s narrative, rather than the other way around.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c62e1175-3a26-4150-83f4-4a4f0e01aea6">In a campaign that implements this option, a
        character must finish a long rest before they can take an accelerated short rest again.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="2d4d9e03-4c1e-4685-9411-83a7c3eb42e9">If fudging game mechanics to support the campaign’s
        narrative doesn’t feel right for your group, the characters can potentially make use of the option to take an
        arduous rally instead of a short rest. This involves one or more characters spending 5 minutes to rally their
        resolve in the face of coming peril, letting their adrenaline fuel the need to push on. A character who
        undertakes an arduous rally gains the benefit of a short rest, but any hit points restored by spending Hit Dice
        are halved. Moreover, the character gains one level of <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="91447a3d-a4ce-40f1-a8ed-ad5576e81de2">Character death often becomes no more than a minor
        inconvenience in some campaigns. Once an adventuring party reaches a certain level, the spells available to
        return fallen comrades from the afterlife—including <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip"
            href="/spells/2234-revivify" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2234-tooltip">revivify</a>, <a

            href="/spells/2232-resurrection" data-tooltip-href="/spells/2232-tooltip">resurrection</a>—make death no
        more than a temporary setback, potentially undermining one of the most significant elements of danger and threat
        in the campaign story. For players and GMs who wish to elevate the gravity of character death, the optional
        rules in this section offer three different approaches.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="HarrowingReturn"
        data-content-chunk-id="13112b18-9dd9-4402-8719-24faf3a06ea1"><a href="#HarrowingReturn"
            data-content-chunk-id="ce96756f-61e4-4db2-a70e-57713e82f44d"></a>Harrowing Return</h4>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3df1d767-1449-459f-8221-85733667648d">In games that use this house rule, the process of a
        character dying and being pulled back into their body becomes a traumatic experience. The magic that pulls the
        spirit from beyond the dark veil of death takes a toll on that spirit each time, changing a person in unexpected
        and profound ways.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a1c3db9a-d788-458e-9870-4095733e15cd">This rule is best for campaigns with dark and
        horrific themes. It adds a dose of grim bleakness that might not feel at home in epic and heroic stories.
        Players and GMs who want to make use of this rule should talk about it beforehand, and if any player says no or
        doesn’t offer enthusiastic support, it’s best to not use it. It’s also important for GMs to check in with the
        players whenever this rule comes into play, just to make sure everyone is still having fun with the darker
        themes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7e623509-b362-4aac-bc73-19d7669b96d1">When a character is brought back to life by any
        spell other than <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2285-true-resurrection"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2285-tooltip">true resurrection</a>, that character must make a Wisdom saving
        throw with a DC equal to 22 − the level of the spell used to return the character to life. On a failure, the
        character’s experience of death and the afterlife exacts a heavy toll, determined by rolling on the Harrowing
        Return table. The consequence lasts until the GM rules that the character has resolved it. Consequences with no
        clear resolution last for 1d10 × 10 days, after which the player decides how their character overcame it. Or, to
        make a campaign even darker, the players and the GM can agree that these consequences last indefinitely.</p>

            data-content-chunk-id="3cadd437-38f8-4cc6-91f9-258eb0adb913"></a>Nonplayer Creatures</h2>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4839e0b1-ea6d-4a4c-b525-d2ab93cef843">Tal’Dorei is filled with non-humanoid beings that
        leave their mark on the world even if they typically don’t go on adventures in dungeons or journey across the
        world on epic quests. The types of creatures in this section are those who the player characters can encounter
        on their adventures as either friends or foes. Many of these creatures are fully described in the fifth edition
        rules. The lore here simply covers how they function in the world of Exandria.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3386f340-165e-415d-b8d0-ca1e03c6c641">The creatures in this section include many not meant
        to be used as player characters in a typical campaign, including those with non-humanoid physiology (such as
        centaurs), large size (including giants), or alien minds (aboleths and the like). But many other creatures of
        Exandria are suitable for player character use even if they don’t have statistics in the fifth edition core
        rules. Creatures such as minotaurs, gnolls, and the many humanoids with animal-like traits ranging from eagles
        to elephants can be used as player characters if players and Game Masters are willing to put in the effort to
        make them work in a campaign. The same is technically true for creatures like dragons, fey, and giants, but
        their size and innate powers can make it difficult for them to be members of a balanced adventuring party.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Aboleths" data-content-chunk-id="f8981e1c-f9f3-477b-bf1e-2d69219a44c4">
        <a href="#Aboleths" data-content-chunk-id="015fcabd-4871-4b06-9da0-e9c9e2c4df86"></a>Aboleths</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d1015223-c348-48db-afc5-925164faca05">Vile, intelligent, and imbued with corrupting
        psychic abilities, aboleths are three-eyed piscine beings that lurk in watery grottos deep beneath the surface
        of Exandria. These aberrations are irredeemably evil, and all who attempt diplomacy with an aboleth end up as
        their food—or worse, their mindless thralls. Most aboleths grandiloquently claim that they have no notion of
        morality, but only an inexorable sense of purpose that is utterly inscrutable to the lesser minds of humanoid
        creatures. But even such “lesser minds” can understand that an aboleth’s purpose is the psychic domination of
        all life, for the lives of other creatures have no value to it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dcb7d6ec-355f-43d8-99b7-f7c935ba325b">Aboleths can be found throughout the underground
        waterways of Tal’Dorei, typically living in isolation with only their thralls for company. These aberrations are
        loath to work together, for their perfect memories never permit them to forget a grudge. It is fortunate that
        these arrogant creatures are all but incapable of cooperation, for if their genius-level intellects were united,
        they might well be unstoppable.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="005f1471-5147-4d64-aa0a-361626c1ee96">During the Age of Arcanum, an aboleth empire covered
        the length and breadth of Tal’Dorei’s subterranean world. This dominion’s heart was Salar, the Unseeable City
        (see <a href="/sources/tcsr/taldorei-gazetteer#RuinsofSalar"
            data-content-chunk-id="9d3961e4-eb59-4f9f-b23b-c5a6a916a8fa">chapter 3</a>). Though Salar is naught but a
        ruin in the Crystalfen Caverns beneath Emon now, aboleths still journey there in hopes of finding some remnant
        of their lost glory. Salar is little more than legend to the world above—but even though few have seen it and
        survived, the Unseeable City is no myth. Some arcanists even speculate that the lingering psychic footprint of
        the ruined city is what drew the first Issylran settlers to the area, and what inspired them to build Emon above
        it.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Catfolk" data-content-chunk-id="0b6af9e8-44af-4cbe-a80e-9a9aae9cfa5f">
        <a href="#Catfolk" data-content-chunk-id="bd508edb-134d-4fe7-8bde-fc29e810c506"></a>Catfolk</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d526916e-ddbe-41e5-b3dd-0304e7ad48ae">The catfolk of Tal’Dorei are as widespread and as
        variable in shape and color as the cats they resemble. They usually live solitary lives, claiming small
        territories to call their own, though some catfolk live as small family units with little conflict. Moreover,
        their feline instinct for solitude doesn’t get in the way of catfolk interacting with other people around them.
        Indeed, many catfolk are highly social around others, safe in the knowledge that they can retreat to a solitude
        promising safety and calm whenever they need to.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cfd1227f-a2b6-4d15-aa88-0790015ae792">No consistent creation myth exists for these people,
        who can be found living as cave dwellers in the Cliffkeep Mountains, as city folk with their own private flats
        in Emon, as cunning trackers and community builders in the Rifenmist Jungle, and more. Generally, catfolk
        believe that their kind were all once normal animals, transformed by incredible magic in the ancient past. This
        transformation might have been a gift from the gods when magic washed over the world during the Age of Arcanum,
        or when Exandria trembled beneath the divine powers unleashed in the Calamity.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Centaurs" data-content-chunk-id="940133bc-e88a-47d6-9052-9fa0ff663621">
        <a href="#Centaurs" data-content-chunk-id="f3227607-5b43-493f-9237-0a34d8955b61"></a>Centaurs</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e6bd2da8-28f5-490c-bff9-983e802f3ea7">During the Calamity, many elves fled into the Fey
        Realm to escape that terrible war. One elven tribe that remained on Exandria to fight alongside their gods were
        known as the Horselords of Laphithas. The elves of Laphithas rode alongside the Arch Heart against the mortal
        servants of the Ruiner, but the entire tribe was slain in a burst of chaotic magic when the Arch Heart stabbed
        the Ruiner through one eye. The overflowing power of the wounded god merged these elves’ mortal bodies with the
        bodies of their steeds even as they died.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c8f1e976-d3b1-4c78-95ce-edac7154d389">The Arch Heart rewarded the elves of Laphithas by
        reviving them as centaurs, who would ride across the Dividing Plains forever free of war. Centaurs have long
        since diverged from their elven ancestry, viewing themselves as a people all their own. Still, some centaurs
        throw their arms wide to the elves of Syngorn as long-lost cousins, even as others nurture an ancient grudge
        against them for fleeing when their people’s need was greatest. Many of the centaur herds of the plains are
        incredibly faithful, worshiping the Arch Heart with a fervor unknown even among the elves.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8b2ea801-213e-4a30-b3a0-05ac0b2c1586">Centaurs share an origin with orcs (see <a
            href="/sources/tcsr/character-options#Orcs"
            data-content-chunk-id="8c22547b-0a31-499e-a62b-44b862b821d4">chapter 4</a>), who were also originally elves
        before being changed by the conflict between the Arch Heart and the Ruiner. Many centaurs and orcs of the
        Dividing Plains see one another as kindred, but just as with real family, this bond can engender feelings of
        intense affection or equally intense hatred—or simply indifference. The circumstances of their lives determine
        the way orcs and centaurs feel about one another, though their kinship brings them into frequent contact either
        way.</p>
    <h3 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="Dragons" data-content-chunk-id="4a9d6b06-e956-406b-9eb9-79308cbfae10">

    <p data-content-chunk-id="dc184f86-38e6-4c84-9b4b-5800d4f9150d">Dragons have existed in Tal’Dorei since the
        Founding, when these mighty beings were created by the Platinum Dragon and the Scaled Tyrant to protect their
        interests on the Material Plane. All folk of Tal’Dorei know the power of dragons, and many people have witnessed
        it firsthand. Even the youngest humanoid victims of the Chroma Conclave’s attack on Emon are old enough now to
        be parents, and to have passed down tales of the terror that filled the city’s streets as doom rained down from
        above.</p>
    <h4 class="compendium-hr heading-anchor" id="MetallicDragons"
        data-content-chunk-id="1609abae-0993-4f82-b144-11b97ed50839"><a href="#MetallicDragons"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c0b1ec65-4aa8-4253-8631-a15a5f96e5b7">Though countless popular stories tell of heroic
        warriors slaying evil, greedy, and monstrous dragons, the oldest legends of dragonkind speak of their roles as
        benevolent protectors of the weak. In the time of the world’s beginning, the Platinum Dragon created beings in
        his image, with scales of shining metal and kindly hearts. Those metallic dragons helped the mortal people of
        Exandria survive the turbulence of the Founding. But since those days, most metallic dragons have vanished from
        the world, leaving their kindness and virtue to linger on in myth and legend rather than the chronicles of
        history.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="753254d3-18bf-4aef-be5b-4abe263bee2d">On clear days, a lucky traveler might look up to the
        blue skies of the Dividing Plains and feel their heart thump faster at the sight of sun glinting off silvery
        wings high above the world. For the most part, though, those metallic dragons who remain in the world use their
        shapechanging magic to live among humanoids, watching quietly from the background and gently nudging people in
        the direction of prosperity. After all, the Platinum Dragon’s creations still look upon mortals as their
        charges—but times have changed. Mortals are now too numerous for the scant remaining metallic dragons to guide
        them as they once did. But a watchful observer can see the ills of society and whisper a word of caution into
        the ear of a mortal who might do something about it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d6c302aa-c05a-4dde-a4e7-6995ff43b17f">Lest any forget, the metallic dragons are not all
        friends to mortalkind. For some of these protectors of the small, time has caused them to grow selfish and
        disillusioned with their creator’s commandment. These venal metallic dragons use their silver tongues and
        sterling reputations to manipulate mortals.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="da97a146-ad1e-40a5-999e-ccccc7349380">Fire, acid, poison, ice, and lightning rained
        devastation upon the world when the Betrayer God known as the Scaled Tyrant created the unparalleled warriors
        that would serve her whims. The greed and malice of chromatic dragons are the stuff of countless legends—as are
        the mountains of gold and other treasures amassed within their lairs.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e65c3417-8a97-4cc9-ae10-2c68dc480c16">Dozens of cruel chromatic dragons lurk in the
        darkest depths of the forests, the highest mountain peaks, and the most arid, barren wastelands of Tal’Dorei.
        Though the devastation of the Chroma Conclave is not yet three decades past, scores of adventurers have chosen
        to forget the horror of seeing flesh melt from bone beneath Umbrasyl’s acid breath, or beholding scores choke in
        Raishan’s poison fumes. Those adventurers now seek glory by hunting young and ambitious chromatic dragons, and
        claiming their nascent treasure hoards.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5cba86df-5616-4fba-8bfa-a8c3044ff0a8">At the same time, not all chromatic dragons cling to
        the ways of their creator. A number of such dragons witnessed the horrors unleashed by the Cinder King and his
        minions, and recoiled in disgust. Tales are told of how Westruun was the beneficiary of a donation of over fifty
        thousand gold pieces from a mysterious young red dragon who supposedly admired the Cinder King’s ambition, but
        was appalled by his flagrant disregard for life.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="e25dfc74-82d8-44a3-8a38-6a1dc57db366">The Betrayer God known as the Spider Queen was one
        of the first casualties of the Calamity—impaled by the Stormlord’s thunderspear before her dark elf soldiers
        ever saw battle. Her blood, thick and silvery, seeped into the earth and pooled in the sunless caverns beneath
        Exandria. In the centuries that followed her defeat, these pools of divine blood were discovered by the Spider
        Queen’s most loyal dark elf servants, and they drank deeply.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="061e1502-f672-494b-8615-7e2618947870">The blood of the Spider Queen granted these drow the
        goddess’s terrible power, and warped their bodies into forms that are half-spider, half-elf. Called driders,
        these beings grew in number as more and more drow accepted this gift. In time, the pools of divine blood began
        to run dry, and the driders found themselves tormented by its absence. They now roam the caverns and tunnels
        beneath Exandria, desperately searching for hidden pools of the silver nectar.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d1249937-1b57-4e8a-b17b-8a7c203ac611">People don’t discover the fey; rather, the fey
        discover people. Though enchanted forests are their favored domain, fey folk can be found wherever the power of
        nature is strong—even a flower garden in the middle of Emon. Of course, Emonian scholars endlessly debate
        whether the fey typically come to an enchanted forest because of its magic, or whether the magic of such sites
        blooms because of the fey. The answers to such mysteries are known to the Archfey, of course—but they don’t like
        spilling secrets.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a4dd1085-044d-4ede-a803-1a7bfaa13e38">The Fey Realm is a place of intense emotion. There,
        happiness becomes elation, anger becomes fury, and passions become obsessions. The very shapes of the fey are
        defined by their innermost feelings, and even fey siblings can take different forms based on what they feel most
        strongly about. Two daughters of pixie parents are just as likely to be a sprite and a satyr if one sister is
        drawn to war and the other to revelry. And though uncommon, it is not unheard of for a fey to completely and
        spontaneously change form after a life-altering event. Since most fey live for upward of three centuries, a
        particularly unstable fey might take a dozen forms over the course of their life, wildly changing their physical
        form, voice, gender, likes and dislikes, and more.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b199edb2-8e70-4b92-95f4-fecdfe9b7cb5">Though the fey are beings of chaos and change, one
        immutable factor of fey life is that all are beholden to the Archfey. The immortal and imperious rulers of
        feykind, the Archfey rarely travel to Exandria, instead spending their time scheming against each other and
        plotting elaborate political intrigues. When mortals enter their realm, the Archfey take notice and often spy on
        them in person, using clever disguises and misdirection to keep those mortals from disrupting the Archfey’s own
        maneuvering. Vox Machina was once pursued by Lord Artagan of the Morncrown, a jovial Archfey who finds the
        incursions of mortals more amusing than distressing. And there are rumors that Artagan has made his presence
        known on the Material Plane as well, as a mysterious being known as the Traveler (see <a
            href="/sources/tcsr/allegiances-of-taldorei#TheTraveler"
            data-content-chunk-id="89af6ed7-5af3-4684-8f85-508a0e5f4ce7">chapter 2</a>).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="36fa7399-176b-40bb-b802-720ba1342fff">The mages of the Arcana Pansophical have confirmed
        the identities of three other Archfey, though little else is known about them. They include Lord Saundor the
        Forsaken, the reportedly deceased Master of the Shademurk; Lady Elmenore the Unforgiving, High Warqueen of the
        Burning Vale and Matriarch of the Seelie Court; and Potentate Sammanar, They-Who-Walk-Unseen, keeper of the
        Sun’s Shadow and Master of the Unseelie Court. Additionally, a spy of the Arcana Pansophical traveling in the
        Fey Realm is said to have uncovered rumors of the existence of an Archfey known as the Keeper of the Moontides,
        or simply the Keeper. Since delivering her first report, however, this spy has not been heard from again.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c731642a-66b1-4f83-b576-deaf63044e57">Some Issylran myths and legend speak of the giants
        as the precursors to humanity, calling them the gods’ failed attempts to create what would become humankind.
        Other tales suggest that the giants are what became of humans who tried to ascend to godhood, making bargains
        with fiends and imbibing the elemental essences of primordial spirits.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="00f13523-2914-463a-a51d-d873b81ef64f">Regardless of their connection to humanoids, giants
        have longed dwelled far from humanoid cities and settlements. The so-called highborn giantkin stay isolated
        because they believe humanoids to be warlike, foolish, and untrustworthy. The lowborn giants who hold a place
        below the highborn are reclusive because humanoid legends paint them as terrible monsters to be hunted and
        slain.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cc45624d-c8b6-4f92-9d9b-937b50b3164f">Giants have a natural life span of about 300 years,
        though lives of hardship and toil mean that lowborn giants rarely live past 200 years. Highborn giants in their
        isolated and idyllic cities usually live full lives and die of old age more than any other cause—though highborn
        politics can be cutthroat, and assassination has ended the long life of many a giant over the centuries.</p>

        rungs of giant society. The highborn keep them at arm’s length, using them as a sort of barrier between humanoid
        and giant civilizations. The lowborn band together, forming tight-knit social groups that must fight and forage
        to survive. Cyclopes typically rule lowborn settlements, and some hill giant warriors ritualistically tear out
        one eye to emulate their rulers. Zealous hill giant worshipers of the Ruiner sometimes do the same, with that
        god granting them power to survive in exchange for ever-increasing sacrifices.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="12f3f06f-6002-473d-8ded-615ae7614896">Cyclopes, ogres, and hill giants who turn to
        corrupting magic to help them survive lives of hunger and exile sometimes tumble into a cycle of cruelty and
        devotion to evil powers from which there is no escape. Their minds and bodies are warped beyond recognition,
        turning them into trolls or oni. These giants gain tremendous power but lose any sense of compassion. Such
        corrupted giants typically live selfishly, and try to transform lowborn enclaves into their own personal armies
        of conquest.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="fe95001b-8d35-41df-a5e0-d6f8c8094349">The humanoid peoples of Tal’Dorei divide the
        highborn giants into five types: cloud, fire, frost, stone, and storm. These giants are considered one people
        divided into different cultures, having adopted different magics, fighting styles, and codes of ethics and law.
        Highborn giants are proud of their ability to look their kin in the eye as equals, making it ironic how few of
        them acknowledge the caste divide between highborn and lowborn.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="87b0f8be-6581-42d9-bdc3-93b71d77f3f7">The hill giants were once considered highborn, but
        were stripped of their nobility and exiled by the Council of Seven Scepters, and their culture has long since
        fallen into ruin.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d81f8d14-24a1-4e4e-9405-44280ab7ca6e"><strong><em>Cloud Giants.</em></strong> These lofty
        giants are denizens of Jovatthon, the Castle of Thunder. This mighty city-state flies invisibly above Tal’Dorei,
        enshrouded in thick storm clouds and tracing a clockwise circular route around the continent that avoids its
        cloudless, arid heartland. The cloud giants are ruled by two wedded monarchs, currently a City-King in charge of
        domestic affairs, and a War-King tasked with the defense of Jovatthon against dragons and other highborn giants.
        The current City-King is a stern, fearsome ruler named Ardokles, while the War-King is a much more charismatic
        and beloved general named Vasilios.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="baa84e20-8e72-4044-b75a-426c6d2abdfb"><strong><em>Fire Giants.</em></strong> These
        subterranean giants dwell in the same tunnels as drow and duergar, typically beneath volcanically active
        mountain ranges whose natural magma fuels their forges. The heart of fire giant civilization is the city-state
        of Vulkanon, located within the deep magma tubes beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains. Though their citadels are
        spacious and vast, many fire giants have a perpetually stooped posture due to the low clearance of their
        underground homes. They are masters of the forge, and have been known to occasionally ally with the duergar of
        the Emberhold to produce some of the finest arms ever seen in Tal’Dorei. Weapons of Vulkanon steel are prized by
        mercenaries across the continent, as much for their value as status symbols as their worth in combat.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f5cd034d-aa4d-4110-8660-5d2a7ecb6252">The ruler of Vulkanon, the Grand Legate Phaestor,
        has long dreamed of expanding his empire, and the fire giants’ duergar allies have granted them a strategic
        foothold in Tal’Dorei’s darkest depths. Fire giants might prove to be a dangerous enemy to the folk of the
        surface world—but they might also be a fierce ally in the fight against the aberrations lurking in the depths,
        including the aboleths of Salar.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b24ab6bd-42af-4c09-ac54-86c37f62e0d4"><strong><em>Frost Giants.</em></strong> Few beings
        can survive the Neverfields, the frozen wasteland north of the Cliffkeep Mountains. But the frost giants, riding
        on the backs of chitinous remorhaz and woolly mammoths, have risen to be the undisputed rulers of this frigid
        land. Though their people are mostly nomadic reavers led by petty jarls, they all swear fealty to High King
        Jorskymmar, who rules from the fortress-city of Jotunborg.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="33ca38f8-818b-4424-b505-eaa00bd7e7a7">The frost giants of Jotunborg are renowned for their
        ability to tame the fearsome beasts of the Neverfields—including the white dragons that haunt the skies of that
        land. This skill and their knack for surviving in an inhospitable realm has made the giants of Jotunborg a pious
        people, and most pray to the Wildmother for safety before crossing the ice fields. Some giants who have suffered
        near-death experiences, whether being trapped beneath an icy lake or smothered by an avalanche, clandestinely
        join one of the cults of the Chained Oblivion, seeking solace in the inevitability of eternal cold.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="396e4539-6129-489e-9d1f-91c2bfcdf826"><strong><em>Stone Giants.</em></strong> Few things
        are more striking than the sight of a stone giant atop a mountain peak, silhouetted against the sun. Some
        mountain climbers fortunate enough to see such a sight become convinced that they have gazed upon the Dawnfather
        himself. Stone giants are happy to encourage such rumors, for it makes their existence seem more like myth than
        fact. These reclusive highborn giantkin live in fortresses carved from the peaks of mountains. Their greatest
        stronghold is Skyanchor Citadel, a city hidden within a peak of the Alabaster Sierras, its halls winding from
        the mountain’s deepest roots to its highest summit.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="adace1a1-f299-4a8d-a56c-7f21ec2b6ca1">Stone giant culture holds physical perfection as the
        greatest of all virtues, and stone giants are obsessed with physical appearance and feats of strength. But
        unlike the lowborn giantkin who have grown strong and resilient out of struggle, stone giants see physical power
        as an abstract virtue, best used in sporting events. A quadrennial tournament of prowess called the Sky Queen’s
        Favor is held in coliseums atop Skyanchor, and highborn giants from across Tal’Dorei gather there to compete in
        tests of strength, agility, and endurance. Even the stone giants’ humanoid kin, the half-giant goliaths, are
        occasionally present at the Sky Queen’s Favor.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c41d4ddb-e139-4839-8efb-bdc390b49cda"><strong><em>Storm Giants.</em></strong> The most
        mysterious of all the highborn, the storm giants are rarely seen even by other giantkin. Their flying city-state
        of Tempestar was destroyed by an unknown force centuries ago, and all the glories of their realm were cast into
        the Lucidian Ocean, hundreds of miles off the coast. Storm giants now live solitary lives, calling no other
        giants their neighbors, and caring only for themselves and their families.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="472217af-113c-4488-9f1f-8e17c7cc2f1e">Centuries have passed since Tempestar was last the
        seat of the Council of Seven Scepters, yet the otherwise-reclusive Sea Dreamer Galadawna, has never missed a
        meeting of the council. Though she takes little interest in the day-to-day minutiae of highborn society, she
        ensures that the other giant leaders never forget about her people—or the thunderous might of their sorcerers.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d19f7d40-3471-42bf-98a9-4fd3818a79e6"><strong><em>Council of Seven Scepters.</em></strong>
        The highborn are united by a democratic council that convenes annually for one week in the tallest spire of
        Jovatthon, the cloud giant citadel. The ruler of each giant civilization—including the two rulers of the cloud
        giants—have a seat on the council, though that seat is sometimes taken by a highly placed ambassador or
        representative of the ruler. When the council meets, its members deliberate on how best to maintain peace and
        prosperity. For even as they do their best to maintain a safe distance from the humanoid peoples of Tal’Dorei,
        the last thing the highborn giants desire is infighting among themselves.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="50c094b1-c05c-4927-853a-121d72c1175a">Two of the seven thrones of the council have
        remained empty for generations. Hillqueen Ovam’mura refused to relinquish her scepter when her hill giant people
        were banished from the ranks of the highborn, and the Scepter of Wodensdottr has gathered dust in Jovatthon’s
        vaults since Woden, demigod of the storm, abandoned the storm giants after the fall of Tempestar. Though the Sea
        Dreamer of Tempestar has never missed a gathering of the council, she has thus far refused to reclaim her throne
        or scepter, and the responsibilities that come with both.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="285f9f92-35a5-442d-a22b-6036cabdc9f3">As their canine appearance suggests, gnolls are
        descended from hyenas that once roamed the Dividing Plains. A pack of these creatures was caught in the divine
        eminence of a Demon Prince that did battle in the Calamity. When the nimbus of that demon’s unholy power faded,
        the beasts were transformed.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4a62bcc8-bfbb-4320-b0be-1299c08c1dd4">Today, most gnolls are nomadic groups led by a
        matriarch and her mate. Many people of the Dividing Plains see gnolls as demonic monsters, and are driven to
        acts of cruelty against them by their fear. Nevertheless, many gnoll clans live side by side with the other
        humanoid peoples of Tal’Dorei in small towns across the plains, including the Dustpaw gnolls and the people of
        Turst Fields (see <a href="/sources/tcsr/taldorei-gazetteer#TurstFields"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4f577a28-b170-4211-9f90-fda2c95d2e14">The lizardfolk of Tal’Dorei emerged from the K’Tawl
        Swamp in the Age of Arcanum. Mages from an unnamed flying city descended into the swamp and conducted intense
        magical experiments on the local fauna. Some mutated into giant lizards, others into slithering swamp
        serpents—and others into humanoid beings. The mages took a few of these lizardfolk as specimens, and left the
        other fruits of their experiments behind.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="26ecac8f-1fd8-4e05-b8b2-9c5c40d37ac4">In time, these abandoned lizardfolk used their
        cunning minds and skilled hands to create tools. They called themselves the Kuul’tevir—noble masters of the
        earth and water. These folk advanced rapidly, and though they never matched the heights of the flying cities of
        the magi who created them, they built magnificent domains filled with towering spires and glimmering magical
        waterfalls.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2e8cac8b-1605-458a-8ed2-ef9b5e703fbc">When the decadence of the Age of Arcanum gave way to
        the chaos of the Calamity, the Kuul’tevir delved deep into corrupting magic to save their grandeur. For a time,
        their people prospered, bolstered by the magic of demons and evil gods. But in the end, the desire to survive at
        any cost turned the Kuul’tevir’s rulers against one another. Cabals of petty warlocks tore the lizardfolk’s
        magnificent societies apart, and the evil magic they wielded began to devour even the magic that the ancient
        mages had used to turn them from simple reptiles into a majestic people.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="47af27f2-4cc4-4bd8-b010-56407f24b97f">Today, the majesty of the Kuul’tevir is little more
        than distant myth. Most lizardfolk live in small communities in swamps, jungles, and fiery mountains across
        Tal’Dorei. Some live in cities, especially those with hot, humid climates, but no lizardfolk today possess the
        supernatural poise and power that they did in the Age of Arcanum. Today, the lizardfolk are a people like any
        other—just trying to survive in modest comfort. But many still cling to the mythic memory of their ancient
        civilization and have allied themselves with terrible tyrants such as Thordak the Cinder King in an attempt to
        resurrect their lost glory.</p>

        dwell on Visa Isle, south of Daggerbay. They are more serpentine than lizard-like, but it is suspected that
        their origins are similar to that of the lizardfolk.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b4aa9b91-b8cb-4e3c-9688-160094b8bbd4">Known by sailors as “sea devils,” the shark-like
        sahuagin are both enemy and ally to humans who ride the waves, and are rumored to have spawned from a bottomless
        trench in the ocean floor. Pods of sahuagin have no <em>de facto</em> leader, and usually have no more than six
        members. However, several pods might band together and collaborate on tasks they could not accomplish alone,
        forming schools. These schools follow the will of the majority, and disobedience is rare.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d5853fd5-bf73-4567-9d6e-cd9fe4e7cbab">The few sea devils who dominate multiple schools
        through personal strength are known as barons, who are as feared as they are revered. Sahuagin schools that fall
        under the sway of a baron often become known for their piracy and hunger for slaughter, as the members of the
        school are directed to steal treasure to appease their tyrant’s greed. Other schools might offer their services
        as mercenaries, aiding those humanoids willing to pay for their ferocity.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8527b7cb-39a7-4152-806e-9eb2a34f5221">Sahuagin pods sometimes fall under the corrupting
        influence of aboleths or other aquatic aberrations, with these aberrations taking on roles as demigods and the
        sahuagin who obey them becoming cultists. Instead of plundering ships for treasure, these sahuagin engineer
        shipwrecks and drag the survivors before their cruel overlord, who adds those humanoids to the ranks of their
        brainwashed thralls. The most feared of all these unholy figures is one that truly is the progeny of one of the
        Betrayer Gods: Uk’otoa, a many-eyed leviathan spawn of the Cloaked Serpent that is supposedly imprisoned deep
        beneath the Lucidian Ocean.</p>

        Tal’Dorei, they are best known as the creatures that allowed cities razed by the Chroma Conclave to be rebuilt
        in a matter of weeks, rather than years. But adranachs are also mighty combatants that serve their masters as
        hunters, bodyguards, and even assassins.</p>

        body is formed from the energy of the Astral Plane. Their claws and face, as well as a number of rune-inscribed
        braces on their body, are made of mithral and are necessary to keep their form of pure energy from losing
        cohesion. The methods for creating these mithral foundations and for binding astral energy to them are known
        only to the Wonderworker (the leader of the League of Miracles) and the spellwrights who learn from them.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="30cb813c-ad17-4fa6-8255-15c25fa5aa33">This secret knowledge is granted to worthy
        spellwrights in the form of an orb of mithral bands, about three feet in diameter, called a dormen. As the bands
        are removed and forged into the adranach’s braces and mask, the dormen speaks aloud the instructions of how to
        craft an adranach in the magically recorded voice of the Wonderworker.</p>

        adranach has a unique mask crafted by its creator as their signature. This mask is crafted from pure mithral,
        and is the key to summoning and dismissing an adranach to a unique pocket dimension where it can rest and repair
        itself. When not in use, the mask magically shrinks from its true size to an easily concealable size fit for a

        <p>Adranach Customization</p>
        <p>Adranachs are constructs personalized to their creators. One of the traits that make a spellwright candidate
            attractive to the League of Miracles is an interest in invention, and spellwrights are encouraged to
            customize any adranach they create. Below are some optional features with which spellwrights have outfitted
            their creations. Most <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/3768325-adranach"
                data-tooltip-href="/monsters/3768325-tooltip">adranachs</a> have one extra feature, and most <a

        <p><strong><em>Advanced Tracking (Recharges after a Long Rest).</em></strong> When a creature fails its saving
            throw against the adranach’s Force Bolts, the adranach can mark that creature for the next 24 hours. The
            adranach knows the direction to a creature’s location as long as they are on the same plane. If the creature
            is moving, the adranach knows the direction of this movement.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Arcane Bond.</em></strong> The adranach’s creator can communicate with it telepathically while
            both are within 1 mile of each other. As an action, the creator can see through the adranach’s eyes and hear
            what it hears until the start of the creator’s next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses the
            adranach has. During this time, the creator is <a class="tooltip-hover condition-tooltip"

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6d7abdd0-f021-4057-bee6-b91a21f6b25d">A reclusive society of elementalist druidic masters,
        the Ashari symbolize the connection between civilization and nature in balance as they govern, heal, and tame
        Exandria’s primordial threats.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="57fb3b07-2360-4ffe-a8e5-ab2a5c109d6a"><strong><em>Mysterious Beginnings.</em></strong> No
        one knows the Ashari’s true origins, though one popular legend ties directly to the ancient war between the gods
        and the primordial titans. As the Prime Deities scattered the essence of their fallen foes across Exandria, the
        titans’ remains birthed new Elemental Planes. In response, numerous humanoids—who would eventually become part
        of the Ashari—were gifted with a magical affinity to shape the world and a responsibility to defend against
        future primordial threats.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8dc275e0-c64f-4489-aaba-43ab8370f5d1"><strong><em>Triumph Divided.</em></strong> A
        multiracial people, the Ashari strategically organize into four distinct communities—the Fire Ashari of Pyrah,
        the Air Ashari of Zephrah, the Earth Ashari of Terrah, and the Water Ashari of Vesrah. Each community builds
        homes alongside sources of elemental power.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e877987b-718d-4b30-af08-ce7e4d3f402a"><strong><em>Primordial Guardians.</em></strong> The
        walls between the Material Plane and the Elemental Planes are thin, and if those boundaries are tested, they
        tear asunder and form rifts. These planar fractures hemorrhage vast fields of wildfire, avalanches of crushing
        stone, boundless expanses of screeching hurricanes, and unending oceans of pounding tsunamis, all seemingly
        yearning for destruction.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ccf2753e-6a7e-4dd1-905d-1b03ac88dcbc">When an elemental rift grows volatile, the Ashari
        become a living dam—subduing, soothing, and sealing its escaping power. Then, once a rift calms, the Ashari’s
        work to heal the surrounding land begins.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="cf9f7142-7712-4128-bca0-866911f057ec"><strong><em>Selfless Respect.</em></strong> Ashari
        is a word found in many languages with a multitude of meanings, including: sunrise, innate will, torchbearer,
        and gardener. Some Ashari greetings include, “The Wildmother sees you” and “Your actions bring forth light.”</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f50db772-bf93-4f21-be1e-5c5cb8f3b5a8">Of all the Ashari tribes, the Fire Ashari of Pyrah
        have suffered the greatest. Their people were all but destroyed when Thordak burst through the Rift of Flame in
        his cataclysmic return to Exandria. Yet despite their immense hardships, the Fire Ashari have given selflessly
        to the people of Tal’Dorei.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="56a9f478-32c3-49e7-891d-982e3b3480f1">Firetamers are the elite elementalists of the Pyrah,
        using their attunement to the primordial forces of the world to not just create fire, not just command it, but
        tame it to their will. A firetamer of Pyrah is nothing like the manic pyromancers of Tal’Dorei. For while the
        latter recklessly wields fire as a weapon, firetamers use their talent to protect others from fire’s destructive
        power—or wield that same power to destroy those who threaten their people.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1ae446b5-3596-4721-8762-b2bc09edea7e">Firetamers are almost always accompanied by a
        salamander, a fire elemental, or a small herd of magma or smoke mephits. While home in Pyrah, Ashari firetamers
        use their power to control the Rift of Flame or to control the flames of the volcanic forest known as the
        Cindergrove. And on the outskirts of Emon, a group of firetamers led by a half-orc Ashari named Lorkathar keeps
        watch over the volatile Scar of the Cinder King.</p>

        the Ashari who dwell there from countless hardships. Few infringe upon their isolated home, and this safety has
        bred a certain recklessness among the Air Ashari. Though they guard their elemental rift as closely as do the
        rest of their kin, their lack of stoicism and restraint often earns them the scorn of the Earth Ashari of
        Terrah, the only other Ashari tribe in Tal’Dorei.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b8731fc0-2ecd-427c-be37-fbc59357c81a">The Earth Ashari of Terrah are a stoic people, slow
        to change and more likely to fight defensive battles and outlast enemies than wage offensive wars. The Terrah
        stoneguard are the perfect embodiment of this ideal, with their druidic training augmented by ancient combat
        techniques that allow them to hold fast against a tide of enemies. The stoneguard craft arms and armor from the
        granite around them, and their magical stonecraft rivals even that of the dwarves. It is said that when
        elemental armies poured into Exandria in mythic times, two legendary stoneguard protected all of Terrah against
        that onslaught for ten days and ten nights, each standing guard while the other rested.</p>

        defensive points within the Cliffkeep Mountains, warding the Terrah tribe against the dwarves of Kraghammer. If
        the stoneguard were ever to falter in their vigil, they believe the dwarves would doubtlessly enter their
        ancestral lands and strip its natural beauty in search of wealth and fuel.</p>

        of the open ocean and dedicate their lives to protecting seafarers from storms, pirates, and sea monsters. They
        are not warriors, however, but rather accomplished healers and aquatic empaths, using their powers to seek out
        and rescue survivors of marine disasters. They sometimes bring critically wounded survivors to Vesrah, a
        practice that the isolationist Water Ashari condemn for fear that such outsiders threaten their way of life. The
        waveriders take their peers’ scorn in stride, for they would rather be righteous than popular.</p>

        preferring to fight in their shapechanged fishform rather than with harpoon in hand. They use hit-and-run
        tactics as a hunter shark or employ their giant octopus form’s natural camouflage to harry opponents. When
        patrolling the open seas, waveriders skim across the water on personal waveboards with folding sails, similar in

        cinderslag elemental’s Molten Gaze unleashes incredible power that can melt steel and stone with a glance. If
        one of these creatures is allowed to focus its gaze for long periods, or if several elementals work in unison,
        entire cities can easily be leveled in a tide of molten stone. Fortunately for the people of Emon, Thordak’s
        elemental spawn are mindless and incapable of unified action—as long as no one is able to bend these creatures
        to their will.</p>

        any scoundrel claim the rank of cutthroat. An effective cutthroat is patient and precise. Sneak in, take cover,
        wait, strike only with advantage, and fight without honor. If spotted, misdirect by fleeing—then regain a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="eab2a775-0cf8-4be8-8630-df0755976955">The Clasp prefers to operate in the shadows, but
        sometimes blackmail targets need convincing. Whenever a scare or a show of force is needed, the Clasp’s
        enforcers make quite an impression. An enforcer values promises and debt repayment nearly as much as profit, so
        any who break agreements with the Clasp are sure to earn a visit from one. “Want to know exactly what enforcers
        enforce?” is a popular Clasp one-liner—before the operative delivering the joke switches from telling to
        showing.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1b01a49b-6ed2-45d3-bb73-f157941cdc09">Hard to hit and harder to kill, enforcers enjoy
        running up to targets with hammers swinging, inspiring a healthy dose of intimidation in anyone lacking the
        wisdom to pay up or run.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="282d8ce4-3f4b-4ed6-a663-4812119eeee4">A number of elves and archmagi still live who
        remember the Icelost Years—a dark time in Tal’Dorei’s history, when legions of ice-rimed warriors spilled forth
        from the Elemental Planes, intent on turning the world into a gelid wasteland. Cold snap spirits are a surviving
        echo of the vast armies of the cruel elemental Errevon the Rimelord, who nearly claimed Tal’Dorei for his own.
        They linger in the ever-frozen forests of the Frostweald, atop the snow-capped peaks of the Cliffkeep Mountains,
        and amid the arctic plains of the Neverfields.</p>

        separated from the malign command of an elemental warlord, cold snap spirits are little more than animalistic
        creatures of instinct. They drift harmlessly about cold regions of the Material Plane that mirror the
        interminable frost of their plane of origin.</p>

        docile cold snap spirits are driven into a terrible frenzy by the presence of heat. They have an instinctive
        fear of flame, and even the warmth of a living creature can be enough to drive them into a murderous rage. Once
        the source of heat is annihilated, a cold snap spirit rapidly returns to a state of calm ambivalence.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7d51a405-cad0-479d-beb3-604acf99b6c0"><strong><em>Inchoate Berserkers.</em></strong> Cold
        snap spirits make excellent soldiers for elemental beings with ambition and the will to dominate. Their aversion
        to warm climes is quickly overridden by loyalty to their commander, and the ambient heat of even a temperate
        region is enough to drive them to a state of constant frenzy.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c3cbd5fc-39c5-48dc-85dd-b29d2a5e71c2">When cyclopes are born beneath a raging storm, they
        sometimes grow up different—smaller than the rest, sickly and weak. Most of these stormborn cyclopes are
        relentlessly bullied and beaten for their tiny stature, and many die before adulthood. Those who survive do so
        because of the magic the Stormlord has bestowed upon them—intentionally or otherwise. As cyclopes are generally
        unfamiliar with magic, the power of a stormcaller awes and terrifies them, and many see stormcallers as nothing
        short of the manifestation of a god.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e155a6aa-3a37-40e4-970c-5d380e33398c"><strong><em>Storm Worship.</em></strong> Their
        fellow cyclopes may assume that the might of a stormcaller is akin to godliness, but many stormcallers hunger
        for greater power. A cabal of stormcallers regularly gathers in the Daggerbay Mountains at an ancient elven
        temple called the Skyneedle (in Elvish, <em>ira’fallai</em>; in Giant, “Tall Zappo-Zappo”). There, they conduct
        strange rituals to commune with an entity they call the Eye of the Storm—and with every ritual, their power
        grows.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0a1390be-02f0-4783-8111-2ab134a20b3e">However, the Eye of the Storm is no avatar of the
        Stormlord, but a vengeful storm giant named Eyvindr, who’s posing as a demigod and intent on raising an army to
        exact retribution on the Council of Seven Scepters. He’ll have to risk revealing himself to the stormcallers
        eventually—but not until he believes that his control over his cyclops devotees is absolute.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="4f251f6c-3cda-4a5c-a8cf-a2203ec2facf">These monstrous spiders, the spawn of the divine
        Spider Queen, lurk in the darkest recesses of the world. They have gorged themselves on the ichor of demons
        since the earliest days of the Calamity, when demons were slain in such quantity that the subterranean depths
        were awash with their foul blood.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a8d56e29-ae35-4d15-887a-f49458669746"><strong><em>Monstrosities Transformed.</em></strong>
        Demonfeed spiders are terrible fiends as a result of having supped upon the remains of demons, but all are
        descended from the overlarge spiders that haunt caverns and forests across Tal’Dorei. As such, most are native
        to the Material Plane, so that once killed, they are slain forever—unlike fiends that are simply banished to
        their home plane.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3e01acc5-7229-4621-a83b-484926bff313"><strong><em>Endless Hunger.</em></strong> No
        sustenance is more delectable to a demonfeed spider than the ichor remaining behind after a demon has been slain
        on the Material Plane. However, in the absence of such remains, they will sate themselves on the fluids of any
        living creature.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3c6fefb8-f469-4ea0-b519-a46f3e74d94c"><strong><em>Toxic Blood.</em></strong> The terrible
        poison of spiders, when mixed with the vile ichor of demons, becomes the demonfeed spider’s most potent weapon.
        When its chitinous hide is pierced and its blood begins to flow, the spider can expel arcing sprays of caustic
        blood that seep into the exposed flesh of its attackers.</p>

                The Fire Ashari of Pyrah believe that the mythic rocs that gave rise to the ember rocs maintain balance
                in Tal’Dorei. Rocs avoid humanoid settlements and hunt the monstrous creatures that would otherwise
                threaten those settlements. So the Ashari lure rocs to sites of elemental rifts, enticing them to devour
                creatures attempting to escape into the Material Plane. After years of feeding on fire elementals,
                salamanders, fire giants, and more, a roc is imbued with primordial power, flames erupting from every
                feather to transform it into the ember roc.</p>

                back to its nest—often inside an active volcano. If prey proves too much trouble while in flight, an
                ember roc readily drops it from some great height. But those unable to escape slowly roast in the

        the Age of Arcanum, magic inspired a deep arrogance in many of the gods’ children, who assumed arcane gifts were
        proof of inevitable divinity. In response, many mortal folk experimented with manufacturing “life” of their own.
        The dwarves succeeded first, marrying divine gifts with technical skill to animate autonomous wardens as
        protectors of their ancestral halls. The dwarves’ knowledge was quickly stolen and expanded upon by other folk,
        and creating golems eventually became less about proving that mortals can shape life as the gods do, and more
        about protecting life, wealth, and secrets from others.</p>

        golems are mighty armored servitors made by arcanists who find iron too mundane a metal. The first seeds of
        these automata fall from the sky, with raw cobalt carefully extracted from meteorites and smelted by way of
        ferromagnetic alchemy into a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal. This finished cobalt is then molded and twisted
        into armored skin shielding clockwork designs that animate rune-encrusted muscle-like chains. A central
        lodestone powers a cobalt golem, fueled by magic rituals that spark ionized life within its inorganic shell.</p>

        All-Hammer fashioned forge guardians to guard the divine furnaces and hearths that designed the first dwarves.
        Shaped from extravagant marble and fused with adamantine, crafted with impeccable detail and care, these rare
        and massive constructs exemplify the highest form of artistry that every Exandrian blacksmith, forgemaster, and
        artisan spends a lifetime hoping to achieve.</p>

        tireless being of immense strength, a forge golem is gifted life by a single shard from the All-Hammer’s own
        divine spark, lovingly kept safe inside a ring of arcane flame and ancient sigils. The All-Hammer’s divinity is
        akin to a volcano inside the golem, turning the construct’s blood into lava. Fire no longer harms the construct,
        but instead heals it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="70a868dc-487e-4c52-ab4b-877bc331d69d"><strong><em>Sacred Purpose.</em></strong> Where it
        looms over a divine forge, a forge guardian’s appendages end in a stretched set of hooked forceps and a
        rune-adorned blade. The golem can assist a blacksmith in creating new golems, or it can trample, bludgeon, push,
        and knock down any who threaten this sacred process of creation.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c93b38ce-00eb-4ebf-9cad-6db27bb4fde1">Forge golems also serve as opponents for any wishing
        to engage in the All-Hammer’s trial of worthiness. A golem’s attacks blind prospective heroes, who must then
        earn back their vision by risking a deadly counterattack.</p>

        clanking footsteps make its approach audible to all intruders, who should recognize that fleeing is the best
        option: for the golem’s form is nigh-invulnerable, and its mighty fists can obliterate life with a single blow.

        the Platinum Dragon also craft these golems using divine rituals and imbue them with the unflinching devotion to
        justice epitomized by their god.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3a9763c6-216e-416f-bd85-a9e05249c0ad">Jourrael is a nightmarish specter and ancient
        assassin of many names. The Spider Queen bestowed upon her the title of Caedogeist, the specter of silent death,
        while scholars describe Jourrael as “the Inevitable End,” more certain than death. Those who catch a glimpse of
        her whisper of a nightmarish wraith wielding daggers dripping poison, hair like fire, skin shielded in shadow,
        and able to walk through walls and mountains as if they were water.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3d5adba7-c765-4ae0-99dc-9c5b9ead2737"><strong><em>Death Forbidden.</em></strong> Jourrael
        cannot die. A contract between the Lord of the Hells and the Spider Queen forbids death from claiming the
        assassin, though many have tried—often in increasingly creative ways. At the Calamity’s end, armies joined
        together to separate Jourrael’s body into disparate parts. The Savalirwood elves took their head to Veluthil,
        while their heart was hidden in the Lotusden Greenwood under a dread wraithroot tree.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="347119ad-0e38-4f2b-8c66-159cf11bc86a">The mysterious fiend Obann falsely believed that
        after recovering and reviving Jourrael, he could control her indefinitely. Inevitably, Jourrael dealt a killing
        blow to Obann, sending him to the death she will never meet.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="dc1a0e07-8933-46da-8384-270da6b68e56"><strong><em>Unbound Future.</em></strong> Alive and
        well, Jourrael still serves the Spider Queen. Their ghostly form and unmatchable stealth fuel the attacks of
        their spectral blade and void dagger, with few surviving that onslaught. They shrug off nature’s elements and
        mortals’ weapons, won’t be held against their will, and know no fear. After having spent so long dismembered and
        sealed away, Jourrael is eager to see the world of Exandria—and to kill any creature they deem worthy of dying
        on their blades.</p>

        and the endless seas of flame within the Elemental Plane of Fire, magma landsharks live only to eat. These
        creatures are physically similar to bulettes, the common landshark of the Dividing Plains, but are filled with
        churning elemental power.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eb0b8400-54ea-4ccd-9c13-3ea17f8bc8bc">This fiery, armored predator burrows and burns
        through solid rock and can sense the slightest movement in the ground around it. When hungry—and these creatures
        are always hungry—a magma landshark erupts from under the earth, oblivious to any obstruction or danger,
        uprooting trees, destroying roads, unleashing avalanches, and leaving sinkholes behind in its wake. Its jaws
        widen as it swallows prey whole, and even creatures that initially survive the attack must contend with an aura
        of intense heat if they can’t escape.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="3b1bf50c-c483-4bd7-8c09-3f832f863b0a">The hulking plainscow is an exceptionally sturdy
        beast of burden native to the Dividing Plains and used by the people of central Tal’Dorei for centuries. Though
        many wild herds still roam the plains, domesticated plainscows are more common, used as mounts, pack animals,
        and livestock. Plainscows are unusually empathetic for beasts, and often bond with a rider for life. They stand
        6 feet tall, weigh about two tons, and live for 70 years.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7e8d179d-598e-4d99-a185-59b557b4b11d">The Ravagers are a death cult that stampedes across
        the Dividing Plains, spilling blood in the name of the Betrayer God known as the Ruiner. Led by bloodthirsty
        warlords called Slaughter Lords, the cult’s long-term goals are unknown, but its members are content in the
        short term to sow the seeds of chaos across the plains.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="924fbea2-b5fc-49f4-8235-bd93a97f643b">Such wanton, chaotic slaughter would certainly
        please the Ruiner, and the smaller settlements of the plains have learned to fear the sight of Ravagers on the
        horizon. Inside the walls of Westruun, however, Lord Mayor Lysandra Kallos and her councilors worry that the
        Ravagers show better organization than their bloodthirsty warlords should be capable of instilling in the cult.
        Who—or what—is commanding the Slaughter Lords from the shadows? And toward what end are these depraved warriors
        being directed?</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="8d22ea60-95ed-4c80-85f4-d7dea68fa417">Some warlords of the Dividing Plains, hungry for
        recognition in the single burning eye of their god, turn to the Ravagers in the name of blood and glory. Those
        few whose deeds live up to their ambitions soon find themselves leading factions of the cult—and honored by the
        title of Slaughter Lord. A Slaughter Lord craves combat and leads Ravager raids as often as possible. However,
        they are frequently forced to remain at their strongholds because of the strict regimen of alchemical treatments
        that grant them increased power.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e26b19b3-b28d-4423-9faf-4c3dbdfcd7f8">A small army of shamans and alchemists attend to the
        Slaughter Lords to artificially enhance their strength and fury, creating concoctions to grow their muscular
        forms to massive size, sharpen their tactical reasoning, and bestow upon them the divine protection of the
        Ruiner. A Slaughter Lord’s unnatural size is their most obvious martial advantage, enabling them to dual-wield
        even the largest weapons. But the Ruiner’s blessings also grant them access to divine magic that can blind or
        slay enemies with a word.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="cebbaad4-ad09-406d-ba3a-57b73b06d0d1">Adventurers and mercenaries most often take up arms
        against the Ravagers after hearing stories of the hordes terrorizing the free peoples of the Dividing Plains.
        They prepare themselves for brutal combat against even more brutal foes—and are thus unprepared for the
        Ravagers’ most terrifying weapon, the stabby-stabbers. Fresh-faced warriors from Emon laugh at the name when
        they first hear it in Kymal’s taverns, even as veteran mercenaries close their eyes and hastily bury their faces
        in their tankards.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7fdc0832-a638-4ac9-9a73-3a69be1a7376">Nimble Ravager warriors who show exceptional skill
        are brought before their Slaughter Lord and forced to drink a terrible brew the Ravagers call skullfire. This
        concoction burns away what little reasoning ability those warriors possessed, turning them into perfectly
        obedient, flesh-hungry monsters. In battle, stabby-stabbers swarm like rats, eviscerating enemies and bystanders
        alike.</p>

        pretenders—simply the One, and prepare patiently for his final ascension.</p>

        minds, emptying out other thought and filling their heads with clarity and direction. Much of this direction
        involves the Remnants’ plans to leverage secrets stolen from the Plane of Shadow to increase the cult’s power in
        Tal’Dorei.</p>

        of the cult’s leaders. Every cultist can feel the presence of their foul god just beyond the fabric of the

        in others, encouraging them to express it. They hope to seed the ruin of all who worship other deities until

    <p data-content-chunk-id="730879be-cd95-4368-ae33-997cab09206e">The Rivermaw Herd is a nomadic society mostly
        composed of half-giants, also known as goliaths, and a mighty force for good on the Dividing Plains. The herd
        was once conquered by a goliath tyrant named Kevdak, then formed anew after Kevdak was eventually defeated by
        Vox Machina. Free of Kevdak’s martial cruelty, the Rivermaw see it as their duty to prevent any such tyrant from
        conquering the Dividing Plains ever again.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="54ee78d4-9d13-4741-b8c7-3ded4d4457ac">Though most members of the Rivermaw Herd are
        goliaths, their ranks include people of all races who wish to live beyond the stone walls of Westruun and the
        palisades of plains towns like Turst Fields. Orcs, humans, halflings, and gnolls make up most of the rest of the
        herd’s warriors. Most of those warriors value strength and endurance over other qualities, but the brawlers and
        stormborn of the Rivermaw are better known for cunning, intelligence, strategy, and a unique attunement to the
        mighty thunder of the Stormlord.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b58974c1-6aab-446d-934f-62bf42293466">Many children in the Rivermaw Herd get into friendly
        brawls, but only the truly dedicated learn the art of fist fighting. Rivermaw brawlers usually lead the charge
        on the battlefield, using their exceptional strength, speed, and cunning to throw an enemy vanguard into chaos.

    <p data-content-chunk-id="54f6b5ac-6931-41b1-9679-c9efa860086e">Beyond the Dividing Plains, brawlers trained by the
        Rivermaw can be found in noble adventuring parties, working for the Clasp as muscle, in underground fighting
        rings, and as personal bodyguards. In Emon, the most famous fist fighters make a name for themselves within the
        Brawler’s League or the Godsbrawl, representing the Stormlord in that annual holy tournament.</p>

        are blessed with preternatural skill with a blade and the uncanny ability to command lightning. Often destined
        to become mythic heroes, stormborn fight with reckless abandon—but many can be distressingly prideful and might
        need reminding that the songs of defeated or tyrannical stormborn are rarely sung by the bards.</p>

        the Rivermaw Herd is bolstered by those who were freed from Kevdak’s rule. The few stormborn remaining from that
        broken herd are part of the Rivermaw, and more storm-blessed warriors have been born into the Rivermaw since,
        ready to forge new legends.</p>

        <p>“Odd mysteries surround these skeletal nightmares given renewed, violent purpose as a mockery of mortality.
            Rumors speak of a dark intelligence rooted within, seeking power and using their own bones, or even the

        reanimated by aspiring necromancers, imbued with a vulgar imitation of life and reassembled into an

        treacherous shore-side cliffs and bleak mountains swarming with starving monstrosities. But beneath those peaks
        is a dense, beautiful, and eerie forest called the Parchwood. During the six-year nightmare that was the
        Briarwood’s reign, refugees made their home here—but so did Lady Delilah and Lord Sylas’s experiments. The
        centaur skeletons of the Parchwood are not centaurs at all; rather, they are the remnants of the Briarwoods’
        fleeting attempts to entertain themselves by refashioning the remains of different species into unique forms.

        magics, most of the Vos’skyriss shed the useless skin of their humanity to become like the Betrayer God known as
        the Cloaked Serpent. Those who couldn’t evolve became food for those who did.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ecb035ce-6d89-482d-b52b-7d588de64021">Seers of the Vos’skyriss foresaw the Calamity, and
        the empire created an arcane stasis field under their capital city of Vos’skyriss to survive. This site stands
        off the western coast of Tal’Dorei and is now known as Visa Isle. Only the strongest were allowed to seek refuge
        in the capital, and decades of carefully tracked tournaments determined who was fit for survival.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0086283a-0dc6-4282-9ab2-70a36690f111"><strong><em>Ophidian Society.</em></strong>
        Serpentfolk occupy remote temples in jungles, swamps, and deserts. Their society enforces strict discipline and
        a hierarchy that rewards those closest to snakes in mind and body. Serpentfolk transfigured into massive snakes
        with humanoid arms are held in the highest esteem.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="bc0b94da-53b6-4c97-881f-3ed6193d3ffb">Despite their god’s moniker, the Vos’skyriss
        serpentfolk outlaw hoods so that outsiders in their realm are easily recognizable.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="59a1aa25-2a82-4293-878d-428f441437dc"><strong><em>Narcissistic Worship.</em></strong> Most
        serpentfolk have little love for the Cloaked Serpent, though they pay him homage as the deity of poisons,
        assassins, and darkness. For the Vos’skyriss serpentfolk, worship is a means to an end. Their legends say that
        the devout will be granted the ability to devour nightmares, enabling them to gorge themselves on dreams of fear
        and terror until they grow so large that they can turn on their god and swallow the Cloaked Serpent himself.
        Once begun, this feast is unending—they will devour the remaining gods one by one, and finally, the entirety of
        the multiverse.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="47e620fd-975c-4b51-be02-b098ee2447a0"><strong><em>Vos’skyriss Rising.</em></strong>
        Several decades ago, Jorlund Vohr, professor of archaeology at the Alabaster Lyceum, led an expedition to the
        ruins upon Visa Isle—and found them prowled by the restless spirits of the serpent empire. Their incursion
        unleashed these entombed spirits, and awakened hundreds of their living kin from magical stasis. Now, living and
        undead serpentfolk plot together to rekindle the embers of their long-lost empire.</p>

        of the adventuring party Vox Machina is a complicated one. Over the course of their adventures, they’ve
        selflessly saved the lives of thousands of people in Tal’Dorei, Wildemount, Issylra, and beyond. Of course,
        there are also countless tales of individuals they’ve bullied, threatened, insulted, or otherwise needlessly
        antagonized throughout those same adventures. These legendary figures grew from a band of dime-a-dozen
        sellswords in the swamp burgh of Stilben to gods-blessed warriors whose actions might have saved all of Exandria

        and large, the members of Vox Machina have set aside weapons, armor, and spells in favor of more subtle ways of
        helping others. Some lead the lands they were born to lead. Others have been elected to the Tal’Dorei Council,
        shaping the fate of the continent’s people with quiet wisdom rather than blades and battle cries.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="c6f1ca18-7ae5-44b1-844f-9b38a0681179">Many painters across Tal’Dorei have depicted the
        stoic, melancholy visage of Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest, as she stands at the edge of a lofty cliff of
        Zephrah, gazing into the rosy sunset beside a pink-blossomed tree. In this image, people see a leader who has
        lost much—and sacrificed even more—for her people, for her world, and for the family she found on her journeys.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5cb37091-c521-4796-9d78-4010c918e7c8"><strong><em>Hidden Heart.</em></strong> Though
        Keyleth often looks back on the life she left behind, she does not dwell on the past. She remembers the joy and
        pain in equal measure, keeping her eyes on the horizon to seek the next sunrise, not the sunset. In public, she
        is a consummate leader, speaking tactfully, with calculated words and poise. Yet when she’s with her friends
        from the old days, particularly Pike, Percival, and Vex’ahlia, her practiced public face falls away, revealing
        the same eager, enthusiastic, idealistic Keyleth that she’s always been—just with a few more sorrows weighing
        upon her heart. She keeps a humble home in Whitestone near Grey Hunt Manor, close to a hidden forest trail she
        can walk down in peace, conjuring snowdrops as she goes.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="66e71a4a-2bab-4d8d-8e30-7618951ae72c"><strong><em>After the Epilogue.</em></strong>
        Keyleth buried herself in her duties as Voice of the Tempest after the loss of Vax’ildan and the Whispered One’s
        defeat. She did everything she could to ally the Air Ashari with the rest of Tal’Dorei, and to create a world
        better prepared to unite against threats like the Whispered One and the Chroma Conclave. Her heroic reputation,
        her political will, and her mighty elemental magic gained her many allies, but the entrenched elite of Tal’Dorei
        still see her as a potential threat to their stability. She rarely adventures anymore, preferring to hire others
        to tackle problems she sees arising across Tal’Dorei. But if the world is ever in need of an archdruid, she will
        answer the call.</p>

        III has endured much in his life. He was a young man plagued by personal demons when Vox Machina rescued him
        from a dismal cell in the Umbra Hills. In those days, Percival de Rolo was a man driven by vengeance, with only
        his guns as allies, but he took no joy in that life. He has since expressed that the thing he’s most grateful
        for is that he didn’t die as the person he was, but lived long enough to grow into someone better, together with
        his beloved Vex’ahlia and their five children.</p>

        Percival is deeply dedicated to his wife, to his children, and to the enduring health of Whitestone. The sorrows
        of his old life still haunt him, though, particularly the creation of firearms. But he has done his best to make
        peace with his past, resolving to spend the rest of his days creating things that bring joy to the lives of
        others rather than curtailing those lives. His crowning achievement is the Heart of Whitestone, a majestic clock
        tower that looms over his city.</p>

        Percival largely retired from public life not long after the fall of the Whispered One. He now dedicates himself
        to his duties as a leader in Whitestone as much as he can, though he is more interested in creating than
        governing. Most of his tinkering happens in private, creating novelties such as intricate watches and
        streetlamps powered by volatile reactions with the acid pools beneath his city. He has also lent his knowledge

    <p data-content-chunk-id="308007d2-ed8d-45e8-acc9-c1c7ee444631">Vex’ahlia was one of the first members of Vox
        Machina when those adventurers initially met in Stilben, along with her twin brother, Vax’ildan. Today, she is
        one of the most influential people in Tal’Dorei. She sits on the Tal’Dorei Council as Master of Commerce and is
        Whitestone’s Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt, a champion of the Dawnfather, and a hero beloved by all who know
        the legend of Vox Machina. Her charm and skill with a bow are legendary, and she is equally dedicated to
        changing the world as she is to raising her five children in Whitestone.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="998bec59-111a-4b9d-82ed-9dafe633f1d2"><strong><em>Charming and Incorrigible.</em></strong>
        As an adventurer, Vex’ahlia was known for being resolute and confident even in the face of unspeakable despair.
        The stories told of Vex revolve around her cunning, her flirtatious charm, and her propensity for haggling—an
        expression of her impoverished childhood in the wildlands of Tal’Dorei. The hardships she has endured and
        overcome have not changed her for the worse, though. She is the same Vex’ahlia that is remembered in the
        legends, just with a few more gray hairs and somehow even more responsibilities. Even her beloved animal
        companion, the brown bear <a href="#Trinket"
            data-content-chunk-id="9d8651a8-9771-4dc5-9900-272e61e0e48f">Trinket</a>, is still by her side—though age
        has slowed him somewhat. His young cub is now a well-behaved playmate for the youngest de Rolo children.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="92d2c1a4-1171-4f14-8be3-9809eaa0e494"><strong><em>After the Epilogue.</em></strong> Though
        she’s better known for her archery skill, Vex’ahlia’s capability with coin made her an easy choice for election
        to the Tal’Dorei Council as Master of Commerce. She makes frequent use of a teleportation circle to travel
        between Castle Whitestone and Traverse Junction in Emon, making it possible to fulfill her duties to both the
        Chamber of Whitestone and the Tal’Dorei Council. Though she has generally left her adventuring life behind her,
        she does occasionally sortie with the Grey Hunters to eliminate threats to the continued peace and prosperity of
        Tal’Dorei.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="60473067-42a0-4726-b53b-9561aabc17ff">This little gnome from the Bramblewood has been
        called many things—dragonslayer, savior of Exandria, champion of the Everlight, Monstah, and, more recently,
        Mom. But Pike doesn’t care much what people call her, as long as it’s said with love. Her soul befits the mantle
        of the Everlight well, as she exudes warmth, calm, and comfort. But all that cozy kindness shelters a fiery,
        rebellious spark that can shock strangers and inspire raucous cheers and peals of laughter from her friends.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="7bfa7524-a7fb-4349-9b8b-896a025bfbb6"><strong><em>After the Epilogue.</em></strong> Pike
        ultimately returned Scanlan Shorthalt’s romantic interest after the Whispered One was defeated and Exandria
        saved once more. There was no denying that she loved him, and they settled down in Westruun and had two children
        within a year of one another, Juniper and Wilhand’ildan (Juni and Wax for short). When the kids went off to
        school (one to seminary, the other to Westhall Academy), Pike and Scanlan decided to call it quits, with sad
        smiles and promises to always be the best of friends. And they’ve since kept that promise, even as the two of
        them each sought new paths in life.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="abfd74a8-d0fc-4ee0-959f-1df2786ea5bc">Missing her found family, Pike moved to Whitestone
        and built a temple to the Everlight in the city’s Temple Ward. It’s beautiful, small, and cozy—a true work of
        art down to the smallest details. Folk can find her there most days, tending to the gardens but always ready to
        lend a helping hand or a prayer. Many mornings, Pike swings by the Slayer’s Cake to make sure the baked goods
        remain as tasty as their reputation demands. She’ll grab some fresh pastries and coffee to go, and maybe drop
        off a delivery at Kiki’s—that is, Keyleth’s—house.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fd3b04cb-2378-4c0e-a250-5704bf2e1976">Scanlan usually comes by Whitestone in the summer,
        his and Pike’s favorite time of year. This is a time for simple pleasures—eating dinners with the kids and their
        Auntie Kiki, Auntie Vex, Uncle Grog, and Uncle Percy; playing music by the fire; hearing Wilhand’ildan and young
        Vax’ildan de Rolo joke in private about their names and their weird family; and reminiscing about times past.
        And sometimes, Pike and Scanlan even wind up in bed together, though also, sometimes not. Though Pike’s path has
        diverged from Scanlan’s in one way, their lives are never truly separated—a thing that could be said of everyone
        in Vox Machina.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="6a40333f-1838-470e-ad17-752cf574e8f6">Bard extraordinaire, champion of the Knowing Mentor,
        and braggadocious hero of all Exandria, Scanlan Shorthalt is the kind of adventurer who will never let you
        forget his name. He’s personally ensured that the bards spreading his legend across the world will sing his
        praises for decades to come.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1f528106-3ec0-40fd-a94b-0716efbf0d1b"><strong><em>After the Epilogue.</em></strong>
        Scanlan has always been a self-centered, showboating braggart, but it doesn’t mean he doesn’t have a heart.
        These days, friendship and family mean more to him than anything, even if he’s still not very good at showing
        it.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d7839f14-2a1e-4f8d-ad1f-020fc4c1151b">Following the defeat of the Whispered One, Scanlan
        eventually proposed to his long-pursued sweetheart, Pike Trickfoot, and they were married in a grand ceremony.
        The duo had a pair of children, one named Juniper (Juni) and the other named Wilhand’ildan (Wax). When the
        children were grown and in school, Pike and Scanlan amicably divorced and went their separate ways, remaining
        good friends—and occasional lovers—but content to follow their own paths.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ce27e025-f9dd-4e7d-a9c1-b0d1382775bc">Scanlan is approaching a century of life, but as a
        long-lived gnome, his looks are much as they were in his adventuring days except for his slowly receding
        hairline and the slight belly he’s developed. Vanity dies slowly, though, and he hides even this modest amount
        of aging with a comb-over, frequent use of his trademark beret, and well-placed illusion magic when he needs to
        look portrait perfect.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="e1d1e7a0-a26f-4d4d-a37a-01819e9b356b">Scanlan likes to sing songs of the Vox Machina days
        to crowded houses in cities across Tal’Dorei. He spends his winters in Ank’Harel, where he and his daughter
        Kaylie operate their high-end trading business, Meatman Imports &amp; Sexports. It’s a good job that keeps him
        constantly traveling around Exandria, suiting his interest in seeking out new people and places around the
        world—and for new performance venues and places to get into trouble.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="f834210b-a64f-4f28-b6d2-80d8b64c4e53">Gleaming, resplendent, and overflowing with
        indefatigable confidence, Taryon Gary Darrington is every bit the man he was when he parted ways with Vox
        Machina over twenty years ago. These days, though, all the bravado and good cheer he had two decades ago is
        real—not just an act. Tary doesn’t need to fake it anymore; he’s made it. Even if responsibility doesn’t come
        easily to him, he takes it whenever he has to.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="d78dcadb-ca2e-4e4d-8237-496bef1a870e"><strong><em>After the Epilogue.</em></strong> After
        many years running the Darrington Brigade—his heroic adventuring band—and publishing several absolutely true
        accounts of their exploits, Taryon realized his adventuring checklist was essentially complete. He left his home
        in Deastok, in Wildemount’s Dwendalian Empire, and began a new chapter of his life. Leaving the brigade in the
        capable hands of his sister, Maryanne, and his confidant Lionel Gayheart, Taryon traveled around launching
        several smaller “satellite” brigades in Wildemount’s most dangerous lands.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5e80208a-807d-43c1-94df-bdd96290d1fa">Then, realizing he had spent his career as a writer
        of nonfiction adventure books, he decided to try his hand at fiction instead. With his trusty scribe and
        majordomo Doty X at his side (“Doty Ten,” he patiently explains to anyone who mispronounces it), Taryon and his
        husband Lawrence moved to the Menagerie Coast, setting up in a small writing cottage in Port Damali. While
        Lawrence tutors local students, Taryon has been dashing off novel after novel. His most successful books are a
        series called “The Deastok Mysteries,” which feature a young, handsome blonde boy who solves crimes around
        Wildemount with his brilliant intellect and trusty robot sidekick.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="218d625d-e31b-4f6f-bb7f-06de105cec32">From time to time, Taryon charters a skyship to
        visit his old friends in Whitestone and enjoy the memories of their time together as full-fledged members of Vox
        Machina.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f0e1c267-5afe-4229-bb71-ddc4bcfd37e3"><strong><em>The Automatic Scribe,
                Doty.</em></strong> Doty X is much like past models of Tary’s mechanical servant—vaguely humanoid but
        not too expressive. The new model is sleek and stylish, and not built for battle. Doty’s vocabulary has grown to
        six words: “Tary,” “Yes,” “Correct,” “Absolutely,” “Soon,” and “Handsome.” The scribe also features a built-in
        shelf of Taryon’s favorite books—that is, his favorite books that he’s written himself—in case Taryon needs to
        make a sale while he’s on holiday.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="239ee425-8047-4c6d-b364-282767330b17">Death comes for all things in their time. It is the
        will of the Matron of Ravens that no being, no matter how heroic or how powerful, shall escape their rightful
        place in the hereafter. Yet when his sister Vex’ahlia died in a sunken Issylran tomb, Vax’ildan demanded that
        the goddess of death release her claim on Vex’ahlia’s soul—and claim his instead.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f63bc8b9-003b-42bb-896c-320fbc3f3a29">Inscrutably, the Matron of Ravens acquiesced to
        Vax’ildan’s demand. He donned the Deathwalker’s Ward, a Vestige of Divergence imbued with the Matron of Ravens’
        power, and the legendary armor of her previous mortal champion. In time, Vax’ildan too came to be called her
        champion, and returned to life from death more than once—even enduring utter annihilation by the Whispered One
        and strangulation by an Archfey. All these deaths were permissible for the Matron of Ravens’ champion, since the
        threads of fate that bound Vax’ildan to her service had not yet run their full course. But they inevitably did.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1b73505c-299e-47e5-8a67-52e54d197612">Vax’ildan bade farewell to all the people he held
        most dear in the wake of the Whispered One’s defeat, and vanished into the eternal embrace of his god. In the
        years since, his returns to the world he once knew have been rare and fleeting. The Champion of Ravens is not
        Vax’ildan, though Vax resides within him. He is a loyal arbiter of the ineffable providence of death itself. He
        appears at times as a wrathful angel, masked and surrounded by a storm of raven feathers, bringing an end to
        those who would pervert the sanctity of oblivion out of greed or fear of the unknown.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="074a15da-4f00-475a-ab2c-c793b9731c9a">All fear the end, in their own way. Some fight it,
        delving into magic that delays the inevitable by making a mockery of both life and death. Others lash out,
        hurting people around them in smaller ways. But those whose fears are greatest are met by the Champion of
        Ravens, whose kind soul soothes and shepherds the fearful beyond the veil of the mortal world.</p>
