    <p data-content-chunk-id="c95eb2b6-fd86-43cb-bd23-e4a645d390c9"><em>Lost Mine of Phandelver</em> is an adventure for
        four to five characters of 1st level. During the course of the adventure, the characters will advance to 5th
        level. The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the
        Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the North — a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by
        wilderness and adventure. You don’t need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the adventure; everything you
        need to know about the setting is contained in this content.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="afe6605f-0642-42c2-889e-bd7e22fa72a3">The Dungeon Master (DM) has a special role in the
        <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.</em></p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="db22beda-4238-448d-8ab4-053ea2d2336b">The DM is a <strong>referee</strong>. When it’s not
        clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f5eb2da2-e5f6-4968-9cd2-003f81681ea3">The DM is a <strong>narrator</strong>. The DM sets
        the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters the players must overcome. The DM is
        the players’ interface to the D&amp;D world, as well as the one who reads (and sometimes also writes) the
        adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters’ actions.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="45624d0b-e1c5-45ae-aa6c-b9afee523ddd">The DM <strong>plays monsters</strong>. The DM plays
        the monsters and villains the adventurers battle against, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their
        attacks. The DM also plays the part of all the other characters the players meet in the course of their
        adventures, like the prisoner in the goblin lair or the innkeeper in town.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="850d1c1f-bdb7-4d02-b9ab-faf20f8862b9">Who should be the DM for your gaming group? Whoever
        wants to be! The person who has the most drive to pull a group together and start up a game often ends up being
        the DM by default, but that doesn’t have to be the case.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a7c4d23c-b14f-4eaf-829a-353becf173c1">Although the DM controls the monsters and villains
        in the adventure, the relationship between the players and the DM isn’t adversarial. The DM’s job is to
        challenge the characters with interesting encounters and tests, keep the game moving, and apply the rules
        fairly.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0935466a-5041-4c1c-aac8-bdd22e1ca29b">The most important thing to remember about being a
        good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you have a good time. The rules aren’t in charge. You’re the DM —
        you’re in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that everybody has fun.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3bf579d9-f0e8-4c0e-a3cf-fc2c52c1569b">Many players of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> find
        that being the DM is the best part of the game. With the information in this adventure, you’ll be prepared to
        take on that role for your group.</p>
    <aside id="RulesToGameBy" class="text--rules-sidebar">
        <p>Rules to game by</p>
        <p>As the Dungeon Master, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes during the
            game. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they come up.</p>
        <p><strong>When in doubt, make it up!</strong> It’s better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in
            the rules.</p>
        <p><strong>It’s not a competition.</strong> The DM isn’t competing against the player characters. You’re there
            to run the monsters, referee the rules, and keep the story moving.</p>
        <p><strong>It’s a shared story.</strong> It’s the group’s story, so let the players contribute to the outcome
            through the actions of their characters. <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is about imagination and coming
            together to tell a story as a group. Let the players participate in the storytelling.</p>
        <p><strong>Be consistent.</strong> If you decide that a rule works a certain way in one session, make sure it
            works that way the next time it comes into play.</p>
        <p><strong>Make sure everyone is involved.</strong> Ensure every character has a chance to shine. If some
            players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.</p>
        <p><strong>Be fair.</strong> Use your powers as Dungeon Master only for good. Treat the rules and the players in
            a fair and impartial manner.</p>
        <p><strong>Pay attention.</strong> Make sure you look around the table occasionally to see if the game is going
            well. If everyone seems to be having fun, relax and keep going. If the fun is waning, it might be time for a
            break, or you can try to liven things up.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b8a0d3c7-42a4-4546-baaa-08f13187b419">The adventure often tells you what ability checks
        characters might try in a certain situation and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes adventurers
        try things that the adventure can’t possibly anticipate. It’s up to you to decide whether their attempts are
        successful. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don’t ask for an ability check; just tell
        the player what happens. Likewise, if there’s no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it
        doesn’t work.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="d2060655-2dda-44ba-a4a7-c212a55885fc">Otherwise, answer these three simple questions:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="9dc373f8-3092-4757-9c44-092173a2cfa3">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="3c1b3c9a-6599-4cb7-a02e-45a0ef50dab6">What kind of ability check?</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="896d0a8a-1354-44f5-887b-2e502dfd55ba">How hard is it?</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="69f4c39d-ed74-4f14-bdad-08d2d6a60d1d">What’s the result?</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="49905150-502c-4606-a324-080c42b6f983">Use the descriptions of the ability scores and their
        associated skills in the Basic Rules to help you decide what kind of ability check to use. Then determine how
        hard the task is so that you can set the DC for the check. The higher the DC, the more difficult the task. The
        easiest way to set a DC is to decide whether the task’s difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use these
        three DCs:</p>
    <ul data-content-chunk-id="d8c0e0db-8f8d-436f-acbc-ff7221dbda19">
        <li data-content-chunk-id="199c81b0-5eb8-458e-8b54-b4bdb60a7f84"><strong>Easy (DC 10).</strong> An easy task
            requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="5fc3849a-1f7f-4f26-947a-ae5539a0b99f"><strong>Moderate (DC 15).</strong> A moderate
            task requires a slightly higher level of competence to accomplish. A character with a combination of natural
            aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often than not.</li>
        <li data-content-chunk-id="c2b06f8b-e987-477b-a61c-710b2c1c9048"><strong>Hard (DC 20).</strong> Hard tasks
            include any effort that is beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability. Even
            with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck — or a lot of specialized training — to
            pull off a hard task.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="839b9417-d42f-4229-91ec-0c37015bc368">The outcome of a successful check is usually easy to
        determine: the character succeeds at whatever he or she set out to accomplish, within reason. It’s usually
        equally easy to figure out what happens when a character fails a check: the character simply doesn’t succeed.

        places, the adventure presents descriptive text that’s meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to players. This
        read-aloud text is offset in boxes. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe rooms or present bits of
        scripted dialogue.</p>

        NPC that is likely to be involved in combat requires game statistics so that the DM can run it effectively.
        These statistics are presented in a format called a <strong>statistics block</strong>, or <strong>stat
            block</strong>. You’ll find the stat blocks needed for this adventure in <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="15e55645-43d7-4a04-83d0-22da81cf44f6">More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves
        and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous
        cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human
        spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge
        (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of
        Phandalin (pronounced <em>fan</em>-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through
        the North and laid waste to all in their path.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a702857d-a19b-40e4-96be-61e4a10f1106">A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil
        mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought
        alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed
        much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="fba4306c-f08d-4b57-8021-87f1fd5a6020">For centuries, rumors of buried riches have
        attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in
        locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble
        frontier town. More important, the Rockseeker brothers — a trio of dwarves — have discovered the entrance to
        Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eab71d92-2205-4c18-b237-ab9ebef0a6a9">Unfortunately for the Rockseekers, they are not the
        only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. A mysterious villain known as the Black Spider controls a network of
        bandit gangs and goblin tribes in the area, and his agents have followed the Rockseekers to their prize. Now the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="b2ecf85a-c20a-45da-b717-035d63510161"><em>Lost Mine of Phandelver</em> is divided into
        four parts. In <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/lmop/goblin-arrows"
            data-content-chunk-id="54eb6b1d-87b9-44bc-b5cf-5c1b939f881d">part 1, “Goblin Arrows,”</a> the adventurers
        are on the road to the town of Phandalin when they stumble into a goblin ambush. They discover that the goblins
        (who belong to the Cragmaw tribe) have captured their dwarf friend Gundren Rockseeker and his escort, a human
        warrior named <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/22033-sildar-hallwinter"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/22033-tooltip">Sildar Hallwinter</a>. The characters must deal with the
        ambushers and then follow their trail back to the goblins’ hideout. They rescue Sildar and learn from him that
        Gundren and his brothers discovered a famous lost mine. Sildar knows only that Gundren and his map have been
        taken to somewhere called “Cragmaw Castle.”</p>

        in Phandalin to find it terrorized by the Redbrands, a gang of miscreants led by a mysterious figure called
        Glasstaff. A number of interesting NPCs can also be found in Phandalin, laying the hooks for short adventures in
        part 3. The Redbrands try to run the characters out of town, so the characters return the favor and storm the
        Redbrand lair. In a hidden stronghold beneath an old manor, they find that Iarno “Glasstaff” Albrek, the leader
        of the Redbrands, is taking his orders from someone called the Black Spider — and that the Black Spider wants
        the adventurers out of the picture.</p>

        characters with several short adventures in the region around Phandalin as they search for more information
        about the Black Spider and the dwarves’ lost mine. The clues the characters picked up in Phandalin can lead them
        to spy on a mysterious wizard at the ruins of Old Owl Well, seek the advice of a dangerous banshee, oust a band
        of orcs lurking at Wyvern Tor, and investigate the ruins of the town of Thundertree.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="f777f365-8d55-4aab-8be4-1489eed28c9f">Several of these leads point to Cragmaw Castle,
        which is the stronghold of <a class="tooltip-hover monster-tooltip" href="/monsters/287862-king-grol"
            data-tooltip-href="/monsters/287862-tooltip">King Grol</a>, leader of the Cragmaw goblins. Here the

            href="/monsters/22027-nezznar-the-black-spider" data-tooltip-href="/monsters/22027-tooltip">Nezznar</a>, and
        that the Cragmaw goblins work for him (drow are elves who hail from a realm deep underground). More importantly,
        they recover Gundren Rockseeker’s map to the lost mine, or learn the mine’s location from one of the other leads
        they unearth during part 3.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7992f5e6-78cf-4b28-be3c-0daa41e8c6e7">Following the map or the directions to the lost mine

        underground complex is now overrun by undead and strange monsters. Nezznar the Black Spider is there with his
        loyal followers, exploring the mines and searching for the legendary Forge of Spells. The adventurers have the
        opportunity to avenge Gundren Rockseeker, to ensure the prosperity and security of Phandalin by clearing the
        rich mine of its monsters, and to put an end to the troublemaking of the Black Spider — if they can survive the
        dangers of the Lost Mine of Phandelver.</p>

        escort a wagon to Phandalin. Gundren has gone ahead with a warrior, Sildar Hallwinter, to attend to business in
        the town while the characters follow with the supplies. The characters will be paid 10 gp each by the owner of
        Barthen’s Provisions in Phandalin when they deliver the wagon safely to that trading post.</p>

            data-content-chunk-id="16710481-32ec-4da2-91c4-79fe9bee7818"></a>The Forgotten Realms</h2>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1e5fb9eb-54b3-4eff-b21d-7085a9f99ab5">Just like a fantasy novel or movie, an adventure is
        set in a larger world. In fact, the world can be anything that the DM and players can imagine. It could be a
        swords-and-sorcery setting at the dawn of civilization, where barbarians battle evil sorcerers, or a
        post-apocalyptic fantasy where elves and dwarves wield magic amid the wreckage of a technological civilization.
        Most D&amp;D settings are somewhere between those two extremes: worlds of medieval high fantasy with knights and
        castles, as well as elven cities, dwarven mines, and fearsome monsters.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="02a94f1f-c915-4b55-9eec-7ac727e0d684">The world of the Forgotten Realms is one such
        setting, and that’s where the story in this adventure takes place. In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the
        fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities
        such as Neverwinter and Baldur’s Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the
        terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into
        secrets too dark for the light of day. Dragons, giants, demons, and unimaginable abominations lurk in dungeons,
        caverns, ruined cities, and the vast wild places of the world.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ff5c8b9f-2f45-4624-874f-0e95ce88b7d8">On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel
        minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers, sailors, and steel-hearted adventurers carrying tales of
        strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams
        of glory far across the world. Thousands of restless would-be heroes from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy
        villages arrive in Neverwinter and the other great cities every year in search of wealth and renown.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="2df740b5-0fbe-45f8-beb9-3b76b3fadb80">Known roads may be well traveled, but they aren’t
        necessarily safe. Fell magic, deadly monsters, and cruel local rulers are all perils that you face when you
        travel in the Forgotten Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day’s walk of a city can fall prey to
        monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b79618d4-9941-49b9-b82b-5e6794e83aef">The regional map shows just a tiny part of this vast
        world, in a region called the Sword Coast. This is a region of adventure, where daring souls delve into the
        wreckage of ancient strongholds and explore ruins of long-lost cultures. Amid a wilderness of jagged,
        snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, lawlessness, and monsters, the coast holds the greatest bastions of
        civilization, including the coastal city of Neverwinter.</p>
    <aside id="RoleplayingandInspiration" class="text--rules-sidebar">
        <p>Roleplaying and Inspiration</p>
        <p>One of the things that you can do as the DM is reward players for roleplaying their characters well.</p>
        <p>Each of the characters included in this set has two personality traits (one positive and one negative), an
            ideal, a bond, and a flaw. These elements can make the character easier and more fun to roleplay. <a

                href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#PersonalityTraits"
                data-tooltip-href="/rules/53-tooltip">Personality traits</a> provide a glimpse into the character’s
            likes, dislikes, accomplishments, fears, attitude, or mannerisms. An <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip"
                href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Ideals"
                data-tooltip-href="/rules/55-tooltip">ideal</a> is something that the character believes in or strives
            for above all else. A character’s <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip"
                href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Bonds"
                data-tooltip-href="/rules/54-tooltip">bond</a> represents a connection to a person, place, or event in
            the world — someone the character cares about, a place that holds a special connection, or a treasured
            possession. A <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip"
                href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Flaws"
                data-tooltip-href="/rules/56-tooltip">flaw</a> is a characteristic that someone else can exploit to
            bring the character to ruin or cause the character to act against his or her best interests.</p>
        <p>When a player roleplays a negative personality trait or gives in to a drawback presented by a bond or a flaw,
            you can give that player’s character one <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip"
                href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/personality-and-background#Inspiration"
                data-tooltip-href="/rules/80-tooltip">inspiration</a> as a reward. The player can then spend it when his
            or her character makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw. Spending inspiration gives the
            character <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip"

                data-tooltip-href="/rules/96-tooltip">advantage</a> on the roll. A clever player might spend the
            inspiration to counteract <a class="tooltip-hover rule-tooltip"

        supposed to protect. Everything came to a head recently, when you disobeyed an order and followed your

        privilege. In the glory days of Neverwinter, your parents were the count and countess of Corlinn Hill, a large
        estate located in the hills northeast of the city. But Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, devastating
        Neverwinter and erasing Corlinn Hill from the map. Instead of growing up on an estate, you were raised in a
        small but comfortable town house in Waterdeep. As an adult, you stand to inherit a meaningless title and little
        else.</p>

        Corlinn Hill is impractical, thanks to the volcano. But in the last three or four years, hardy settlers have
        been rebuilding another ruin near the city: the old town of Phandalin, which orcs sacked five centuries ago.
        Clearly, what Phandalin needs now is a civilizing influence—someone to take the reins and bring law and order.
        Someone like you.</p>

        plan to reclaim an ancient mine and restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity. Since your
        goals align, Hallwinter should be willing to assist you.</p>

        escorting a wagon full of provisions and supplies from Neverwinter to Phandalin. The journey takes them south
        along the High Road to the Triboar Trail, which heads east (as shown on the overland map). When they’re a

        <p>In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to
            the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days’ travel southeast of the city. Gundren was
            clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his
            brothers had found “something big,” and that he’d pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies
            safely to Barthen’s Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along
            with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to “take care of
            business.”</p>
        <p>You’ve spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you’ve just recently
            veered east along the Triboar Trail. You’ve encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be

        <p>ADVENTURE MAPS</p>
        <p>Maps that appear in this adventure are for the DM’s eyes only. A map not only shows an adventure location in
            its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren’t meant to
            see—hence the need for secrecy.</p>
        <p>Maps are best used to show multiroom lairs and other locations that have many places to explore. Therefore,
            not every location needs a map.</p>
        <p>When the players arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give
            them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a separate piece of graph
            paper, copying what’s on your map while omitting details as appropriate.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Scale and Grid.</strong></em> A scale allows you to measure distances and dimensions accurately,
            which is important for combat encounters, magical effects, and light sources, among other things. Indoor
            maps use grid squares that are either 5 feet on a side or 10 feet on a side.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Compass Rose.</strong></em> A compass rose comes in handy when you’re describing locations. For
            instance, you might need to tell players about “barrels along the north wall” or “the staircase descending
            to the west.”</p>

        <p>NPC Party Members</p>
        <p>An NPC might join the party, if only for a short time. Here are some tips to help you run an NPC party
            member:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Let the characters make the important decisions. They are the protagonists of the adventure. If the
                characters ask an NPC party member for advice or direction, remember that NPCs make mistakes too.</li>
            <li>An NPC won’t deliberately put himself or herself in harm’s way unless there’s a good reason to do so.
            </li>
            <li>An NPC won’t treat all party members the same way, which can create some fun friction. As an NPC gets to
                know the characters, think about which characters the NPC likes most and which ones the NPC likes least,
                and let those likes and dislikes affect how the NPC interacts with the party members.</li>
            <li>In a combat encounter, keep the NPC’s actions simple and straightforward. Also, look for things that the
                NPC can do besides fighting. For example, an NPC might stabilize a dying character, guard a prisoner, or
                help barricade a door.</li>
            <li>If an NPC contributes greatly to the party’s success in a battle, the NPC should receive an equal share
                of the XP earned for the encounter. (The characters receive less XP as a consequence.)</li>
            <li>NPCs have their own lives and goals. Consequently, an NPC should remain with the party only as long as
                doing so makes sense for those goals.</li>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="db837b63-a029-477e-81b1-2944efad4eb6">The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins
        of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were
        firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver’s Pact. However, the same orc horde that sacked the
        mines at Wave Echo Cave laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="93464247-09a1-4877-b226-4add33a5125d">In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from
        the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. A
        bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters,
        fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains.
        Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that
        the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled
        Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious
        figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="af3ee15b-f037-4917-a886-61582f0f367d">When the characters first arrive in Phandalin, read:
    </p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town
            consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old
            ruins—crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars—surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this
            must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the
            cart track, which widens into a muddy main street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a
            hillside at the east side of town.</p>
        <p>As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running
            errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="1cefc0d0-5d27-4d32-86d6-49de4785df9d">If Sildar Hallwinter is with the party, add:</p>

    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="53dc2804-6bc4-43a7-8679-eb2750c7c67a">Sildar’s plan is to get some rest at the Stonehill
        Inn, then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek. When his investigation hits a dead
        end, he sets up a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the “<a href="#TownmastersHall"
            data-content-chunk-id="a7a7cc8f-4135-426f-b806-0eaf99d493d5">Townmaster’s Hall</a>” section).</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ddb6f1f6-4ef6-42f5-8c37-66f35920f242">During this part of the adventure, the characters
        can visit the various locations in Phandalin and talk to the NPCs there. (See the “<a href="#TownDescription"

        town is small enough that it takes only a few minutes to stroll from one end to the other. However, the
        characters arrive late in the day and can’t get to more than one or two locations before it’s time to seek

    <p data-content-chunk-id="5e77d9d8-5d0c-423f-9284-e439693c3cd3">When the characters explore Phandalin, you don’t
        need to keep track of how much time is spent at each location. Instead, imagine that you’re directing an
        old-style western movie. Your goal is to present several scenes in which the adventurers walk into a store or
        saloon and meet the people there. By interacting with these NPCs, the adventurers learn what the NPCs need or
        what information they want to share, then can move on to the next location. These scenes are a series of
        roleplaying encounters that take place over the course of a couple of days of game time.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1d7064a7-4c7a-4469-ae6b-44f3eec92307">To begin, ask the players where they want to go and
        what they want to do in town. For example, you could tell them, “There’s an inn, a town hall, a shrine, general
        stores and trading posts, and a few other homes and businesses. Where do you want to go?” When the players pick
        a spot, refer to the description in the following section, introduce the NPCs there, and let the interaction
        begin.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eca87997-3aa9-43b0-a589-e0045c9c7caf"><em><strong>The Stonehill Inn.</strong></em> If the
        players aren’t sure what their characters should do, encourage them to begin at the <a href="#StonehillInn"
            data-content-chunk-id="151b270e-889f-4a0b-9d45-40971981d407">Stonehill Inn</a>. The NPCs there are
        “pointers” who can direct the characters toward the various adventure opportunities and important rumors that
        can be found in other parts of the town. By visiting the inn, the characters learn what other places they should
        visit.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="12570839-ae18-457d-8235-a2f00f955828"><em><strong>Redbrand Ruffians.</strong></em> Sooner
        or later, the adventurers run into the thugs who run Phandalin. All you need to do is choose when the ruffians
        appear. After the characters have had a chance to visit several locations in town and talk to the townsfolk,
        they might decide to go looking for the Redbrands. When they do, run the “<a href="#RedbrandRuffians"
            data-content-chunk-id="0b02cd29-66a0-4547-ba17-fe0e4eb8abe2">Redbrand Ruffians</a>” encounter.
        Alternatively, if the characters are reluctant to seek out the ruffians, the Redbrands can come looking for them
        at a time of your choosing.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a4062146-8716-491f-b5ac-e57ec8075838"><em><strong>Finding Cragmaw Castle.</strong></em>
        The characters might want to seek out Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue Gundren Rockseeker. Most of the
        townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. Qelline
        Alderleaf, Sildar Hallwinter, and Halia Thornton can offer suggestions on how the party might find someone who
        knows the location.</p>

        start is to have the character introduce himself or herself, welcome the adventurers to Phandalin, and ask who
        they are and what they want. You don’t need to be an actor or stand-up comedian to get good drama or humor out
        of your NPCs, but if you want to ham it up, here’s some advice:</p>

        by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a two-day march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who’s
        there and what they’re up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire
        known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the party pursues this quest,

        the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations
        around the area. There isn’t any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams

        calculating human woman named Halia Thornton. In her attempts to establish the Miner’s Exchange as the closest
        thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of
        the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and
        influence. Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the

        <p>WHAT THE REDBRANDS KNOW</p>
        <p>If the characters charm or successfully question any of the Redbrands, they can learn the location of their
            hideout under Tresendar Manor as well as the following useful information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The leader of the Redbrands is a human wizard known as Glasstaff, so named because his magic staff is
                made of glass. (Only Iarno Albrek and the Black Spider know Glasstaff’s real name.) Glasstaff’s chambers
                are in the western end of the stronghold (see <a href="#11WizardsWorkshop">areas 11</a> and<span
                    class="visually-hidden"> area</span> <a href="#12GlasstaffsQuarters">12</a>).</li>
            <li>A mysterious figure called the Black Spider has hired the Redbrands to frighten off adventurers and
                intimidate the locals, for reasons unknown. The Black Spider has sent bugbears to reinforce the
                Redbrands and provide extra muscle (see <a href="#9GuardBarracks">area 9</a>).</li>
            <li>The lower part of the complex is guarded by a hideous “eye monster” (see <a href="#8Crevasse">area
                    8</a>).</li>
            <li>The Redbrands have a handful of captives in a holding area “near the old crypts,” which are guarded by
                skeletons (see <a href="#4TresendarCrypts">areas 4</a> and<span class="visually-hidden"> area</span> <a
                    href="#5SlavePens">5</a>).</li>

        deserted, but with plenty of tracks leading to a stone staircase just off the empty ruin of a large kitchen. At
        the bottom of the stairs stands an unlocked door with a cellar beyond.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="8e13e4cd-998d-48aa-8cec-bda387f0eec4">When the characters open the door, read the

        <p>The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet above a large cellar, with stone steps descending
            to the floor in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone
            cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.</p>

        exactly the sort of thing one might expect to find beneath an old manor. The Redbrands want to keep their base

        their presence.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="759fd25e-bc6b-4928-8304-d382f2c63a6d">A former member of the Lords’ Alliance, Iarno seized
        an opportunity in Phandalin to line his own pockets. Originally tasked with setting up a constabulary, the mage
        instead assembled a group of outlaws and local ruffians to secure his own position in town.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1bb047d8-3fb0-4052-9e22-82d7bff239ee">Iarno knew of the Black Spider through his contacts
        in the Lords’ Alliance and brokered a meeting. The drow promised to share the secrets and wealth of the Forge of
        Spells with the wizard in exchange for his help and loyalty.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="20ee4f9a-61e5-449f-a243-c250b43bb115">Iarno puts on airs of gentility and courteous
        manners, addressing his ruffians as “my good gentlemen,” and referring to sordid acts such as kidnapping or
        arson as “that unpleasant little business” or “those unfortunate events.” He refers to the characters as
        “guests” and expresses regret that he cannot provide suitable entertainment for their visit. Beneath his genteel
        demeanor, however, Iarno is just as thuggish and arrogant as any Redbrand outlaws.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="06fd8756-8f20-4a54-ae55-d79b86b10e9c">Phandalin lies in a part of the North known as “the
        Triboar Trail,” “the Triboar Cutoff,” or “the Cony Gap.” This stretch of foothills and rolling, sparsely wooded
        plains extends between the Sword Mountains to the south and Neverwinter Wood to the north. The area gains its
        name from an old trail that runs from the distant town of Triboar to the east, winding westward about one
        hundred miles through the abandoned village of Conyberry, then running north of Phandalin on its way to the High
        Road along the coast.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c46d11c4-340a-4e48-ac69-3e4356cab056">Describe the party’s overland travels as vividly as
        you like, but keep the story moving. “You walk for several miles and encounter nothing of interest” is far less
        evocative and memorable than, “A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you
        break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but
        otherwise you see nothing out of the ordinary.”</p>

        will frequently be marching overland from one point of interest to another. As can be seen on the regional map
        in the Introduction, some of these areas are a good forty to fifty miles apart, requiring several days of
        marching overland to travel to the next adventure site.</p>

        the party travels twenty-four miles per day over a period of ten hours. The characters must rest for eight hours
        per day, with the remaining six hours consisting of making and breaking camp, preparing meals, and a little bit

        order, so that you know which characters are in the lead and who’s bringing up the rear. When the party camps,
        ask which characters are on watch. This information is important if the party encounters something dangerous.
    </p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7f715482-8413-496f-9a5e-b51a910febde">The Triboar Trail is not safe. As the adventurers
        travel throughout this area, they might stumble across hungry beasts, greedy bandits, or vicious monsters. Check
        for encounters once during the day and once at night by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17–20, an encounter takes
        place. Roll a d12 and consult the Wilderness Encounters table to determine what the party meets.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="591a2e21-3517-458a-bf45-d5f9702bd567">When an encounter occurs, the adventurers gain XP if
        they defeat the monsters. Each creature’s stat block has the XP value for one monster of that sort. Multiply
        that value by the number of creatures encountered, then divide the total equally among the characters.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="332bcad9-4b5f-41f1-b3e0-237a77982549">The town of Conyberry was sacked by barbarians years
        ago and now lies in ruins. The Triboar Trail runs right through the abandoned town, providing an easy landmark
        for locating the lair of the banshee Agatha. From the ruins of Conyberry, an old trail leads northwest into
        Neverwinter Wood. Agatha’s lair is a few miles outside town.</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of
            moss drape the branches, and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined village. Rounding a bend
            in the trail, you see a screen made from the warped branches of trees standing close together, woven into a
            domelike shelter in the shadows. A low doorway leads inside.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="eb57c857-aadf-408a-8fd3-5492ee34a9d1">If the characters exercise caution and remember what
        they’ve come for, they will be able to speak with the banshee. When the characters enter the shelter, read the
        following:</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>A home of sorts is sheltered within the dome of woven branches. It is sparsely furnished with chests,
            shelves, a table, and a reclined couch, all of it old and of elven craft.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a9766260-ea19-4c82-ae04-7584748c441b">Agatha senses the characters’ intrusion and
        manifests shortly after they enter her home.</p>
    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>The air grows cold, and a powerful feeling of dread grips you. A cold, pale light flickers in the air,
            rapidly taking on the form of a female elf, her hair and robes waving in a spectral wind. She might have
            been beautiful once, but a hateful expression twists her features now. “Foolish mortals,” she snarls. “What
            do you want here? Do you not know it is death to seek me out?”</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="6be74906-7c71-474a-9458-6fb5b0a8c35b">If the characters are rude, disrespectful, or

        speaking with the banshee makes the check. If that player roleplays the encounter well, allow him or her to make
        the check with advantage. If any character has Sister Garaele’s silver comb and presents it to Agatha as a gift,
        the check is automatically successful.</p>

        Agatha tells them that she traded the book to a necromancer named Tsernoth from the city of Iriaebor more than a
        hundred years ago. She does not know what became of the book afterward. Her answer is truthful, and it is all
        the information Sister Garaele needs for the Harpers to resume their search.</p>

        of the Black Spider, or Hamun Kost’s question about <a href="#OldOwlWell"
            data-content-chunk-id="743fee96-bca4-4a5b-a2fa-f35ca3de96eb">Old Owl Well</a> (see that section). Agatha is
        well informed and a capable diviner, so she can answer almost any single question pertaining to the adventure

        choose it carefully.</p>

        empire, Old Owl Well is a ruined watchtower that now consists of little more than a few crumbling walls and the
        broken stump of a tower. In the tower’s courtyard stands an old well that still delivers clean, fresh water. Old
        Owl Well lies in the wild and rugged hills south of the Triboar Trail. The site is relatively easy to find, and
        any NPC in Phandalin can provide directions to the ruins.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b406a177-5f2f-40ef-834a-aed119422c9c">Recently, prospectors in the area have noted that

    <aside class="text--quote-box">
        <p>As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbling ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the rugged hills.
            The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard of sorts, adjacent to the
            broken stump of an old tower. A colorful tent has been set up in the middle of the courtyard, but no one is
            in sight.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9eddb863-3dee-4eae-9f78-655569f880c5">The ruins are currently occupied by a mage who is
        busy exploring the site in the hope of gleaning arcane lore left behind by its builders. The characters can
        enter the site from any direction, either following old footpaths or scrambling up the slope and finding a gap
        in the surrounding walls of rubble.</p>

            data-tooltip-href="/skills/14-tooltip">Perception</a>) score of 10 or higher smells a deathly odor wafting
        from the tower’s direction. When characters approach the tower or the tent, the zombies shamble out of the

    <p data-content-chunk-id="df70468c-8402-42cf-b745-0886f341de07">Kost is a stout, red-robed figure with sallow skin,

        check verifies the garb as that usual for Thay, a land far to the east where wizards pattern their flesh with
        tattoos. The tattoo on the head represents a wizard’s school of magic. Kost’s school is necromancy.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="3f5ee716-11e5-45cf-a348-c2a640021411">If any character attempts to talk to Kost, even by
        calling out a greeting or answering his questions during combat, he temporarily calls off his zombies. The Red
        Wizard is not particularly aggressive, and he is willing to strike a deal that advances his interests at the
        same time it helps the characters.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="b48e17dc-b448-4c64-8ada-25d6d55ed1aa">Kost stays tight-lipped about the reason for his
        presence in the region. He is, however, willing to provide information the party needs if it does a favor for
        him. If the characters give Kost some indication of what they want, he shares one or both of these requests:</p>

        from Neverwinter Wood stands the abandoned village of Thundertree. Once, this was a prosperous community on the
        outskirts of the forest, wealthy from the work of its woodcutters and trappers. Then thirty years ago, the
        eruption of Mount Hotenow to the north devastated Thundertree. In the wake of the natural disaster, a plague of
        strange zombies swept over the area, killing or driving off those who survived the eruption.</p>

        to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms. Few
        people dare to venture into the ruined village now, and those who do so seldom stay long—with two notable
        exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see <a href="#4DruidsWatch"

        rival goblinholds scattered throughout the area of the Triboar Trail and the Neverwinter Wood. However, one
        chieftain is grudgingly recognized by all others as supreme: King Grol of Cragmaw Castle.</p>

        that the structure’s original name. Raised by a talented wizard-noble of old Phalorm, an ancient realm that once
        controlled much of the North, the stronghold consists of seven overlapping towers; however, its upper levels
        have long since collapsed to heaps of crumbling masonry. Only the ground floor is still sound enough to be
        habitable.</p>

        <p>DISGUISED CHARACTERS</p>
        <p>Rather than storm Cragmaw Castle with weapons in hand, clever characters might try to talk their way inside.
            For example, they might don the scarlet cloaks of the Redbrands and claim to be emissaries sent by Iarno
            “Glasstaff” Albrek, the Redbrand leader, to meet with King Grol. A good DM rewards this kind of clever
            thinking by giving the characters a chance to succeed.</p>
        <p>It’s okay if the characters circumvent combat and talk their way past castle defenders. Both the Cragmaw
            tribe and the Redbrands work for the Black Spider, so the goblinoids aren’t likely to attack the party if
            they claim to be working in the Black Spider’s interest.</p>
        <p>If the characters try to perpetrate a deception as a group, have them each make a Charisma (<a

            checks if the deception is particularly well planned or roleplayed. If at least one character wins the
            contest, the deception is a success. You may award XP for monsters fooled by the deception. As the party
            makes its way deeper into the castle, additional checks might be required, at your discretion.</p>

        Castle, he offers the characters his thanks and asks that they escort him back to Phandalin and then venture to
        Wave Echo Cave to learn the fate of his brothers, Nundro and Tharden. He knows that someone called the Black
        Spider orchestrated his capture and hopes that the characters stop the villain. Upon returning to Phandalin,
        Gundren offers the characters 25 gp each for their assistance and promises the party a 10 percent share of the
        mine’s wealth once his operation there is up and running.</p>

        know the location of Wave Echo Cave. The only thing left for them to do is seek out the old dwarven delve and
        discover for themselves who the Black Spider is, and why he’s so interested in the Lost Mine of Phandelver.</p>

        of the Sword Mountains, lies Wave Echo Cave. The rich mine of the Phandelver’s Pact was lost five hundred years
        ago during orc invasions that devastated this part of the North.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4817c0b8-2fec-45fd-ab8b-42e0041b156d">In the centuries since, countless prospectors and
        adventurers have searched for the lost mine, but none succeeded until the Rockseeker brothers found the entrance
        a month ago. Unfortunately, the Rockseekers did not realize they were being trailed by spies working for
        Nezznar, the Black Spider, and they inadvertently led the drow villain to their prize. Nezznar and his followers
        dealt with the two Rockseekers who were guarding their find, then arranged for Gundren’s ambush. Learning of the
        adventurers’ involvement with Gundren or their exploits in and around Phandalin, the Black Spider has given
        orders for the characters to be dealt with. Meanwhile, Nezznar has begun his exploration of Wave Echo Cave.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5803e7f0-481a-4141-b703-afbc544cec49">The drow is searching for the Forge of Spells, where
        the human mages of old Phandalin enchanted dwarven weapons and gnome gadgets. However, Nezznar’s exploration has
        been hindered by the restless undead and dangerous monsters that lurk in Wave Echo Cave, forcing him to proceed
        with great caution.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="5f5a301c-9bd4-4617-be97-d093778dd0a4">The adventurers now have the chance to aid Gundren,
        avenge his kin, and put a stop to the nefarious schemes of the Black Spider. And of course, the hoard of
        powerful magic rumored to be hidden in the mines is a rich prize.</p>

        overcoming monsters, as in parts 2 and 3. However, XP awards for monsters is not given in the encounter
        description. Instead, the amount of XP that a monster is worth is noted in its stat block (see <a

    <p data-content-chunk-id="cf7734c5-3bb8-451a-8f65-91782be2916b">Monsters roam through all areas of the mine. Random
        encounters remind players that monsters aren’t necessarily confined to specific areas, and that no part of the
        dungeon is safe. Encounters with wandering monsters are an effective way to keep the players and characters on
        their toes, alleviate player boredom, and tax party resources. However, having too many random encounters can
        become tedious, so use them sparingly.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="1c22382e-2390-4370-a837-462b1b1e859a">If the characters spend a long time in a given area,
        you can check for wandering monsters by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17–20, an encounter takes place. Conversely,
        if the players seem restless, you can decide that an encounter occurs. Roll a d12 and consult the Wandering
        Monsters table to determine what the party meets.</p>

        <p>All good dungeons have characteristics that make them unique, and Wave Echo Cave is no exception. The
            rhythmic thunder of pounding waves echoes throughout the mine, loud enough to make the stone underfoot
            shiver. Waves come about two minutes apart, growing louder toward the northeast.</p>
        <p>Wave Echo Cave is nowhere near the ocean, but a water-filled cavern deep in the mine is connected to an
            underground hot spring. That spring boils over continuously to produce a surge that slams into a narrow
            funnel, making a sound like breaking surf. Describe this sound to players on occasion. It will pique their

        have defeated the Black Spider and undone his destructive plots, cleared Phandalin of the ruffians who
        threatened its people, and reclaimed the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave. Their deeds will be long remembered in
        this corner of the Sword Coast. In years to come, the restored mines of the Phandelver’s Pact will bring great
        riches to Phandalin and help establish peace and prosperity in the area.</p>

        Manor or establish homes of their own, the people of the area are glad to have them stay. Even if they choose to
        move on in search of new adventures, they’ll always have a warm welcome in Phandalin.</p>

    <p data-content-chunk-id="447ea742-8a98-48d4-86a8-d8fa5c32d224">A magic item’s description explains how the item
        works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the
        item. Casting the <a class="tooltip-hover spell-tooltip" href="/spells/2152-identify"
            data-tooltip-href="/spells/2152-tooltip">identify</a> spell on the item then reveals its properties.
        Alternatively, a character can concentrate on the item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with
        the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item’s properties. Potions are an exception; a little
        taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="7234bccd-e341-4a03-b30d-87947ee4b90e">Certain magic items require a user to
        <strong>attune</strong> to them before their magical properties can be used. Attuning to a magic item requires
        that you spend a short rest concentrating on it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn an item’s
        properties). Depending on the nature of the item, this concentration can take the form of prayers, weapon
        practice, or meditation. In any case, the concentration period must be uninterrupted. Once you are attuned to an
        item, you can use its magical properties.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="a53af44f-047e-4407-b66b-c019da79b2e3">An item can be attuned to only one creature at a
        time. A creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at any given time, and you can attune yourself
        to only one item during a short rest.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="79e8d353-31c4-44fe-93fc-992fd8a0843c">Your attunement to an item ends if it has been more
        than 100 feet away from you for 24 hours or if you die. You can also voluntarily end your attunement to an item
        with another short rest.</p>
