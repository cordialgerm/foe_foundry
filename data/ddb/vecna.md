## Vecna

On countless worlds, his name evokes tales of terror and cruelty. Vecna the Undying King. Vecna the Whispered One. Vecna the Lord of the Rotted Tower. Over more than a hundred thousand years, incandescent hatred carried him from the humblest of origins to a conqueror’s throne, then to the realms that lie beyond life and death, and finally to godhood. Many have suffered his terrible wrath, but few can recount how a lowly scribe left an aeon-deep scar on the multiverse before ascending beyond the material altogether. Only a few fragments of Vecna’s story have ever been unearthed.

It is said that Vecna was born into a lowly caste on the world of Oerth, son of a hedge witch and a father he never knew. An order of wizards exiled Vecna’s mother into the wastes for practicing the forbidden art of necromancy. The order bound her orphaned son into servitude and employed him as first a bootblack, then a scribe. Vecna spent the better part of his childhood secretly educating himself in his masters’ arts, stealing into their library of magical treatises each night after midnight. It was during these intense study sessions that he first heard a soothing voice in his head, a whisper from another world that promised him revenge if he would only yield to the hatred that was festering in his heart. Once Vecna learned all he could from his masters and their books, he massacred them. On that very night, the voice urged him to record his every foul thought and dream, and he started to pen his Book of Vile Darkness.

According to legend, Vecna went on to forge a kingdom in the world of Greyhawk. He ruled for several centuries from an obsidian tower that rose from the bottom of the black waters of the Nyr Dyv to stretch far above its surface. During this era, at the urging of the voice, Vecna conquered vast realms and swept great cities beneath earth and rock. Generations later, when his physical form finally started to succumb to the ravages of time, Vecna’s festering hatred would not permit him to perish. He called upon the forbidden arts of necromancy to transform himself into a lich, a frightful being beyond the reach of death.

At some point, Vecna grew bored with his kingdom on Oerth and started visiting his evil on other worlds, still driven by the mysterious voice and his unquenchable hatred for all things true and pure. For a time, he is said to have inhabited a palace known as the Citadel of Cavitius, located in a vast field of ash somewhere near the border between the Planes of Earth and Fire.

Eventually, a fallen paladin known as Kas the Bloody-Handed rose through the ranks of Vecna’s vile minions to become the archlich’s personal guard and regent over many of the kingdoms and cults Vecna established across the multiverse. As a symbol of Kas’s authority, Vecna forged him a terrifying weapon, the blade now known as the Sword of Kas. Later, Kas turned on Vecna and used the sword to sever the archlich’s hand and put out his eye. No one knows why Kas betrayed Vecna. Some believe the mysterious voice that spoke to Vecna for eons grew to fear the archlich and began whispering to Kas instead.

After their clash, Kas and Vecna disappeared for ages. The former later emerged as the ruler of the wasteland domain of Tovag in the Shadowfell. The latter spent several centuries hopping from world to world, questing for his severed hand and eye. More recently, Vecna decamped to the Outer Planes, where he grew so powerful that he became a god. He has many ardent worshipers, all hungry for a taste of his immense power.

The accompanying stat block depicts Vecna in his archlich form prior to Kas’s betrayal. Because Vecna is said to have mastered magic allowing him to travel through time, he can appear in this form even on worlds where his severed hand and eye are already known artifacts.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Vecna uses _Flight of the Damned_ (if available), _Rotten Fate_, or _Spellcasting_. He then makes two attacks with _Afterthought_.

**Afterthought.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
**Hit:** 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. The target takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage at the start of each turn until they succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect. Until the effect ends, the target can’t regain hit points.

**Flight of the Damned (Recharge 5–6).** Vecna conjures spectral entities in a 120-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage and becoming frightened for 1 minute on a failure (half damage and not frightened on success). A frightened creature can repeat the save at the end of its turns, ending the effect on success.

**Rotten Fate.** Vecna engulfs a creature he can see within 120 feet in necrotic magic. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 96 (8d8 + 60) necrotic damage (half on success). If a humanoid dies from this, it rises as a zombie under Vecna's control at the start of Vecna's next turn.

**Spellcasting.** Vecna casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components (spell save DC 22):

- **At will:** _animate dead_, _detect magic_, _dispel magic_, _fly_, _lightning bolt_, _mage hand_, _prestidigitation_

---

### Reactions

Vecna can take up to three reactions per round but only one per turn.

**Dread Counterspell.** Vecna interrupts a creature casting a spell. If the spell is 4th level or lower, it fails. If it’s 5th level or higher, Vecna makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + spell level). On success, the spell fails, and the caster takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

**Fell Rebuke.** When hit by an attack, Vecna deals 10 (3d6) necrotic damage to the attacker and teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space.
