## You Can’t Make This Stuff Up

Just a little timeout from the monster tactics to share with you a bit of what it’s like to write and maintain a blog.
I got this e-mail today:
From: P██████ H█████
Subject: Website Collaboration
My name is P██████ H█████ and I’m with █████████████████████.com, we are a nationwide directory that helps property owners who are searching for information on restoring their home or business from fire or water damage disasters..
I was researching “Fire Damage” posts and came across “Monsters of the Multiverse Humanoids, Part 1”.
I wrote 2 articles for Time Business News on “Top 5 Benefits of using a restoration company for fire or water damage and Top 5 Benefits of starting a restoration franchisee” and would like to link back to your website as a resource from the article.
Time Business News is an excellent site with high metrics and gets a lot of traffic from Google. It gets over 100,000 visitors per month. It has a Domain Rating of 62 on Ahrefs and Domain Authority of 67 on Moz.
In return, I would highly appreciate it if you could add a link back to my website on “https://www.themonstersknow.com/monsters-of-the-multiverse-humanoids-part-1/”  .
Do let me know if you are interested and I will send across a line you can add which will match your content flow.
That way we both rank higher on Google, improve our brand visibility and get more traffic.
Looking forward to your reply.

Here’s my reply, P██████: You “came across” my post, but you didn’t read it, did you? Into the trebuchet, my dude.
You know who I am going to link to? Akismet, whose antispam filter has kept more than 67,000 spam messages out of my comments since I migrated to my new host in May 2020. It’s a pity it doesn’t do anything to prevent non-comment spam.
