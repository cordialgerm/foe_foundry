## Contact


Please note: I am the sole author of this blog. It speaks with my voice. I neither solicit nor accept guest-written posts. If that’s what you’re thinking of contacting me about, just go ahead and click that “back” button right now. (Unless you’re willing to pay me US$50,000 per post in advance, in which case, hey, here are a few words from my very special friend. Use of this form for such purpose shall be construed as acceptance of this deal.)
