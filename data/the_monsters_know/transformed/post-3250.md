## Well, That Took a Long Time

I honestly did not expect writing my latest book to eat the entire year. My bad.
I’m happy to report, however, that it’s now finally done, and I’ll have more to say about it soon. Quite a bit more.
In the meantime, MOAR! Monsters Know What They’re Doing is just a week away from release—huzzah!—and I’ll return to blog writing in the new year, picking up where I left off. Wizards of the Coast has kindly provided us with several new books for me to look at monsters from, including Van Richten’s Ezmerelda’s Guide to Ravenloft (she did the work, Racist Uncle stole the credit—that’s my headcanon, and I’m sticking to it), Fizban’s Treasury of Dragons and Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos. I’ve got my work cut out for me in 2022 (and probably 2023 as well)!
See you all after the odometer rollover.
