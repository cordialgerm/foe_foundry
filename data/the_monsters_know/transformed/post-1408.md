## Thank You for Your Patience

A quick note to my loyal readers: This summer and fall have been a whirlwind, thanks to work on other projects and preparation for a new little monster that will be coming to inhabit our dungeon very soon. As a result, I’ve fallen way behind on responding to e-mail messages and acknowledging reader requests. Today I’ve gone through all my outstanding e-mail and put together a queue of 18 different monster types to look at in the coming weeks. If there’s a monster you requested that I look at and I haven’t gotten to it yet, don’t despair: I’ll get to it soon! (I’ll also try to improve my posting rate, which has gone from mediocre to dismal. Such are the demands of life.)
