## Where I’ve Been

Hey, readers. I owe you an update! Yeah, it’s been a while since I posted any new tactical analyses, and I apologize for that. Since I became a parent, my available time to work on projects has gotten pared way back. For the past couple of months, what time I’ve had has been claimed by getting my next two (!) books ready to deliver to my publisher, and it’s going to be the same for at least the next couple of months as well. The holidays weren’t much of a break, either, since my wife is hard at work on the illustrations for book No. 3 (you know her work from book No. 1), meaning I’ve been picking up slack for her rather than vice versa. A lot of things have fallen by the wayside, writing blog posts among them. I’ll still slip in a post here and there when my workload permits, and once I’m further along on book No. 4, I’ll try to make up for lost time. But it’s probably going to remain somewhat quiet for a while.
