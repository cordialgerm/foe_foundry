I’m also making two local author appearances this week. If you live in Chicagoland, please stop by one of these events:

On Thursday, Dec. 8, I’m doing a reading and signing at the Book Cellar, 4736 N. Lincoln Ave., Chicago, starting at 7 PM.
On Sunday, Dec. 11, I’m doing a Q&A/meet-and-greet at Chicagoland Games, 5550 N. Broadway, Chicago, from noon to 2 PM. James D’Amato, author of the Ultimate RPG Guide series of books, will moderate.

Hope to see you!
