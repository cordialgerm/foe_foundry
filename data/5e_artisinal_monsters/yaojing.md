### Special Abilities

- **Charlatan’s Bane:** The yaojing knows if it hears a lie, and it has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine if a creature is attempting to deceive it.
- **Magic Resistance:** The yaojing has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The yaojing’s weapon attacks are magical.
- **Motion Blur:** If the yaojing moves at least 10 feet on its turn, attack rolls against it have disadvantage until the start of its next turn.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The yaojing’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no verbal or material components.
At will: detect evil and good, silence
3/day each: beacon of hope, bestow curse
1/day each: death ward, dispel evil and good

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The yaojing uses Blasphemer’s Bane. It then makes three attacks.
- **Sacred Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage and 13 (3d8) radiant damage.
- **Sacred Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (5d8) radiant damage.
- **Blasphemer’s Bane:** The yaojing makes a ward of censure against a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be unable to cast spells or maintain concentration on spells until the beginning of the yaojing’s next turn.
- **Radiant Spin (Recharge 5-6):** The yaojing performs a spinning kick brimming with radiant energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the yaojing must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 22 (5d8) bludgeoning damage and 22 (5d8) radiant damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the yaojing. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed.
