### Special Abilities

- **Inspiring Savagery:** Each ally within 30 feet of the dhampir that can see it can make one melee attack as a bonus action.
- **Undead Resistance:** The dhampir has advantage on saving throws against disease.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dhampir makes four rapier or four shortbow attacks. It can make a grapple attack or Dark Thirst attack in place of any attack.
- **Rapier:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Shortbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Dark Thirst:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature that is grappled by the dhampir, incapactitated, or restrained. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The dhampir commander regains hp equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
- **Predatory Charm:** The dhampir magically beguiles the mind of one humanoid it can see within 30 feet for 1 hour. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or the dhampir has advantage on Charisma checks against the target. If the dhampir or any of its allies damage the target, the effect ends. If the target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends, the target is immune to this dhampir's Predatory Charm for the next 24 hours. A creature immune to being charmed is immune to this effect. A dhampir can have only one target affected by its Predatory Charm at a time. If it uses its Predatory Charm on another target, the effect on the previous target ends.
- **Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** For 1 minute, the dhampir can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the dhampir. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the dhampir is incapacitated.
