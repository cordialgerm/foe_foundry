### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Three Bites and can use Curse of the Grave or Fearsome Howl if available. If 2+ Bites hit a Med or smaller target black shuck sinks in its teeth shaking head violently. Target: DC 17 Str save or 7 (2d6) slashing damage and be thrown up to 15 ft. in random direction and knocked prone.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 13 (2d8+4) piercing damage and 10 (3d6) necrotic.
- **Curse of the Grave:** Glares at one creature it can see within 30' of it. Target: DC 17 Wis save or be cursed: disadvantage on next two death saves it makes in the next 7 days. Curse lasts until cursed creature has made two death saves until 7 days have passed or until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.
- **Fearsome Howl (Recharge 5–6):** Howls a haunting tune. Each creature within 60' and can hear it: frightened until the end of its next turn (DC 17 Wis negates). A frightened creature concentrating on a spell must make DC 17 Con save or it loses concentration.

### Bonus Actions

- **Mist Stalker:** In dim light fog or mist it takes the Hide action.
