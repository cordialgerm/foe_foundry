### Special Abilities

- **Aura of Famine:** If a creature starts its turn within 10 feet of a gaki, it is overwhelmed by a hunger that dissolves fat and atrophies muscle. It must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Gluttonous Attraction:** At the start of its turn, if a creature can see the gaki, it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is overcome with a desire to kill and eat the ghost, and it must move as close to the gaki as it can.
- **Hungry Frenzy:** The gaki has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hp.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** The gaki can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
