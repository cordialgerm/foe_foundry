### Special Abilities

- **Devil’s Sight:** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the nephirron’s darkvision.
- **Magic Resistance:** The nephirron has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Master Liar:** The nephirron has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks when telling a lie.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The nephirron devil’s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 20). The nephirron can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: detect thoughts, protection from evil and good, teleport (self plus 150 pounds only)
3/day each: flame strike, scrying, wall of ice
1/day each: confusion, mass suggestion, shapechange (dragon or humanoid form only)

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The nephirron devil makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (4d8 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute, or until it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. Dragons and dragon-like creatures, such as dragonborn, have disadvantage on this saving throw.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

### Reactions

- **Sculpt Breath (Recharge 6):** When the nephirron is in the area of a spell, such as fireball, or a breath weapon, it can create a hole in the spell or breath weapon, protecting itself from the effects. If it does so, the nephirron automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell or breath weapon and takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.
