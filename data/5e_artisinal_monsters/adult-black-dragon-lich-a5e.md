### Special Abilities

- **Ambusher:** When submerged in water, the dragon has advantage on Stealth checks. If the dragon hits a creature that can't see it with its bite, it can deal piercing damage and grapple the target simultaneously.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each: animate dead, fog cloud, legend lore, pass without trace, speak with dead

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws. In place of its bite attack  it can use Acid Spit.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) acid damage. Instead of dealing piercing damage  the dragon can grapple the target (escape DC 20)  and a Large or smaller creature grappled in this way is restrained. While grappling a creature  the dragon can't bite or use Acid Spit against another target.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage  and the dragon pushes the target 10 feet away.
- **Acid Spit:** The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet  forcing it to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save also takes 5 (1d10) ongoing acid damage. A creature can use an action to end the ongoing damage.
- **Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales sizzling acid or necrotic energy in a 60-foot-long  5-foot-wide line. Each creature in that area makes a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw  taking 31 (7d8) acid damage and 31 (7d8) necrotic damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is blinded until the end of its next turn.

### Reactions

- **Tail Attack:** When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.



### Legendary Actions

- **The dragon can take 3 legendary actions:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Darkness:** The dragon creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness originating from a point it can see within 120 feet. Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness. The darkness lasts for 1 minute or until the dragon uses this action again.
- **Roar:** Each creature of the dragons choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.
- **Wing Attack:** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.
