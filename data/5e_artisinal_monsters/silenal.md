### Special Abilities

- **Drinking Buddy:** A creature that shares a drink with a silenal has advantage on saving throws against being charmed and poisoned for 1 hour. During this time, if the creature takes violent action against the silenal, the creature has disadvantage on these saving throws for the remainder of the duration.
- **Drunken Clarity:** When the silenal is within 5 feet of an alcoholic beverage, it has truesight out to a range of 90 feet. In addition, it notices secret doors hidden by magic within 30 feet of it.
- **Hide in the Fray:** The silenal can take the Hide action as a bonus action if it is within 10 feet of two other creatures engaged in combat with each other.
- **Liquid Courage (Recharge 4-6):** As a bonus action, the silenal imbibes nearby alcohol to gain access to a hidden reservoir of audacity and grit. The silenal gains 10 (3d6) temporary hp for 1 minute.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The silenal makes three attacks.
- **Tankard:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Darts:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 20/40 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d4 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Cause Row (1/Day):** The silenal magically stirs humanoids it can see within 60 feet of it into a frenzy. The frenzied patrons use the statistics of 4d4 commoners or 1 bar brawl. The frenzied patrons donâ€™t attack the silenal. The patrons remain frenzied for 10 minutes, until the silenal dies, or until the silenal calms and disperses the mass as a bonus action.
