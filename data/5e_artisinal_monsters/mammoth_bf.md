### Special Abilities

- **Trampling Charge.** If the mammoth moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 17 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the mammoth can make one Stomp attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The mammoth makes two Gore attacks.
- **Gore.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.
- **Stomp.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one prone creature. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Trunk Grab.** The mammoth grabs one Large or smaller creature within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 STR save or be grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the mammoth can’t use Trunk Grab on another creature.
