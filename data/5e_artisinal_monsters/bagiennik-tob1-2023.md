### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The bagiennik makes two Claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Acid Spray:** The bagiennik sprays acid on one creature it can see within 30 feet of it, creating a puddle of oil beneath the creature. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 (4d8) acid damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone. The slippery oil covers the ground in a 5-foot square centered on the point where the target was standing for 1 minute. A creature that enters the oily area or ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
- **Healing Oil (3/Day):** The bagiennik applies healing oil to a creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target magically regains 7 (2d6) hp and is freed from any disease or poison. The target must then succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved and it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute.
