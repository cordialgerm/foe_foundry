Yobbos instinctivelyknow which creatures have magic items onthem. When they successfully grab a creature, theyuse their next action to take that creatures nearestmagic item and then stuff it down their throats. Ifit is a weapon, it deals damage to them as if theydbeen hit by that weapon. If its a piece of armor, theirmouths stretch to fit around it. They are now imbuedwith the powers of the devoured magic item.
