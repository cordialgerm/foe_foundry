The target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or one of the following parts of its body (the winter wolf’s choice) is petrified in ice for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target takes fire damage, it has advantage on the next save it makes to end the effect.
