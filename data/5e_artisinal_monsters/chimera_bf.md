### Special Abilities

- **Bickering Heads.** The chimera is perpetually one step away from arguing with itself. A creature that can see the chimera can use a bonus action on its turn to appeal to one of the chimera’s heads with bribes (dragon), praise (lion), displays of magic (goat), or other clever manipulation of a head’s desires. The chimera must succeed on a DC 15 WIS save or succumb to that desire.
- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The chimera is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Multiple Heads.** The chimera has three heads and is resistant to the blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and unconscious conditions.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The chimera makes one Bite attack, one Headbutt attack, and two Claws attacks, or it can make two Claws attacks and use Fire Breath, if available.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Headbutt.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon head exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 DEX save, taking 27 (6d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
