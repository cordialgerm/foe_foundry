### Special Abilities

- **Evil:** The dragon radiates an Evil aura.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** The dragon can move through other creatures and objects. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Essence Link:** The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d10 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Anguished Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales a shadowy maelstrom of anguish in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw  taking 22 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
