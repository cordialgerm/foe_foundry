### Special Abilities

- **Drawn to Magic:** The radiant spark swarm can pinpoint the location of magical items within 60 feet of it. If the swarm starts its turn within 60 feet of a magic item, it moves to that magic item and hovers around it. If the item is being worn or carried by a creature, the swarm attacks that creature. If multiple magic items are within 60 feet of the swarm, it moves to the item that is most rare. If more than one item is most rare, choose randomly among them.
- **Burning Radiance:** A creature that touches the radiant spark swarm, starts its turn in the swarm’s space, or hits the swarm with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) radiant damage and 2 (1d4) fire damage.
- **Illumination:** The radiant spark swarm sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny elemental. The swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.

### Actions
