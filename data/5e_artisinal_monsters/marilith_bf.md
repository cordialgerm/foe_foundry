- **Reactive.** The marilith gets up to five extra reactions, but these extra reactions can be used only for Parry.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The marilith makes two Dagger attacks, two Mace attacks, and two Longsword attacks. It can replace two Dagger attacks with a Tail attack.
- **Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Mace.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the marilith can automatically hit the target with its Tail, and the marilith can’t make Tail attacks against other targets.

### Bonus Actions

- **Marilith Tactics.** The marilith shouts one of the following commands at up to two friendly creatures it can see within 30 feet of it:
	- March! Each target can use a reaction to move up to half its speed in a direction of the marilith’s choice. This movement is unaffected by difficult terrain and doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
	- Protect Yourself! Each target gains the marilith’s Parry reaction until the start of the marilith’s next turn.
	- Remember Your Training! Each target has advantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the start of the marilith’s next turn.
- **Teleport.** The marilith magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

### Reactions

- **Parry.** The marilith adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the marilith must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
