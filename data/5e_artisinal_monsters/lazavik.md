### Special Abilities

- **Glowing Eye:** As a bonus action, the lazavik makes its single eye shine with a brilliant golden light. Its eye sheds bright light in a line that is 90 feet long and 5 feet wide, or it sheds bright light in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area illuminated by the lazavik’s eye gains the lazavik’s Swamp Stride trait as long as it remains on the illuminated path. The lazavik can douse its light at any time (no action required).
- **Hold Breath:** The lazavik can hold its breath for 30 minutes.
- **Speak with Beasts:** The lazavik can communicate with beasts as if they shared a language.
- **Swamp Stride:** Difficult terrain composed of mud, reeds, or other marshy terrain doesn’t cost the lazavik extra movement. In addition, it can pass through nonmagical hazards, such as quicksand, without being hindered by them and through nonmagical plants without taking damage from them, despite thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

### Actions

- **Reed Whip:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Eye Flare (Recharge 5-6):** The lazavik’s eye flares with blinding light in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area much make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
