- **Impaling Charge:** If it moves 20+' straight toward a target and then hits it with Horn attack on same turn karkadann impales target on its horn grappling the target if it is a Large or smaller creature (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends the target is restrained takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage at start of each of its turns and karkadann canâ€™t make horn attacks vs. other targets.
