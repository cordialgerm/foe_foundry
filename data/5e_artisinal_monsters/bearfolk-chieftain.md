### Special Abilities

- **Brute:** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the bearfolk cheiftain hits with it (included in the attack).
- **Frenzy (1/rest):** As a bonus action, the bearfolk can trigger a berserk frenzy that lasts 1 minute. While in frenzy, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks and has advantage on attack rolls. Attack rolls made against a frenzied bearfolk have advantage.
- **Keen Smell:** The bearfolk has advantage on Wisdom(Perception) checks that rely on smell.
- **Savage Charge:** If the bearfolk moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a battleaxe attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the bearfolk can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The bearfolk makes two attacks with its battleaxe and one with its bite.
- **Battleaxe:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage if used two-handed.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** For 1 minute, the bearfolk chieftain can, as a reaction, utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll, provided it can hear and understand the bearfolk chieftain. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the bearfolk chieftain is incapacitated.
