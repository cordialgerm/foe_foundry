### Special Abilities

- **Devil’s Sight:** Magical darkness doesn’t impede its darkvision.
- **Frigid Vortex:** Emits a swirl of cold wind in a 15 ft. radius around it. Each creature that enters wind’s area for first time on a turn or starts its turn there: DC 15 Str save or knocked prone. Wind is nonmagical and disperses gas or vapor and extinguishes candles torches and similar unprotected flames in the area. At start of each of its turns rimepacted chooses whether this is active. While active rimepacted has disadvantage on Dex (Stealth) checks.
- **Magic Resistance:** Advantage: spell/magic effect saves.
- **Snow Burrower:** Can burrow only through nonmagical snowith ice.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Two Icy Claw attacks or three Frostbolt attacks.
- **Icy Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 9 (1d10+4) slashing damage + 10 (3d6) cold.
- **Frostbolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, 60 ft., one target, 13 (3d6+3) cold and the target’s speed is reduced by 10 ft. until the end of its next turn.
- **Freezing Smite (Recharge 5–6):** Raises its frigid claw drawing upon fiendish energies then smashes its rimed fist into the ground causing a wave of freezing power to emanate outward. Each creature within 30': 21 (6d6) cold (DC 15 Con half). If a creature fails by 5+ it is restrained by ice until end of its next turn.

### Reactions

- **Fury of the Storm:** When a creature rimepacted can see is knocked prone by Frigid Vortex rimepacted can move up to half its speed toward the creature.
