### Special Abilities

- **Carrion Sense.** The swarm can pinpoint, by scent, the location of carrion, dead creatures, and Undead without the Incorporeal Movement trait within 60 feet of it.
- **Pilfering Swarm.** A creature in the swarm’s space is surrounded by ravens pecking and pulling at its clothing, hair, fur, and belongings. If a creature in the swarm’s space casts a spell with a material component, it must succeed on a DC 12 DEX save or the spell fails to cast, expending the action required to cast it but not the spell slot or daily use, as the ravens steal the component.
- **Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny raven. The swarm can’t regain HP or gain temporary HP.
- **Swarm Resilience.** The swarm is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it is immune to the charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned conditions.

### Actions

- **Beaks.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 9 (2d8) piercing damage, or 4 (1d8) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its HP or fewer.
