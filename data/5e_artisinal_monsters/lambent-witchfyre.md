### Special Abilities

- **Fire Absorption:** Whenever the lambent witchfyre is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hp equal to the fire damage dealt.
- **Fire Form:** The lambent witchfyre can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the lambent witchfyre or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the lambent witchfyre can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire; until someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
- **Illumination:** The lambent witchfyre sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The lambent witchfyre makes three blazing touch attacks.
- **Blazing Touch:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. If a creature is slain by this attack, the lambent witchfyre regains hp equal to the damage dealt. The body of a creature slain by this attack turns to ash, along with any nonmagical items it was wearing or carrying. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a resurrection or wish spell.
