### Special Abilities

- **False Presence:** The berstuc detects as a Fey when sensed by spells and features, such as the detect evil and good spell or a paladin’s Divine Sense. However, it is still a Fiend and can be subjected to spells and features that affect Fiends, such as Divine Smite. Beasts and Plants find the berstuc’s presence soothing and don’t attack the berstuc unless ordered to or provoked.
- **Forest Camouflage:** The berstuc has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forest terrain.
- **Magic Resistance:** The berstuc has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Twisted Path:** While in a nonmagical forest, the berstuc leaves no trail and can’t be tracked, except by magical means. Creatures of the berstuc’s choice within 30 feet of it that travel with it can’t retrace their own trails, and become hopelessly lost after 1 hour of travel with the berstuc. Creatures led astray by the berstuc have disadvantage on ability checks to discern their location or to navigate for 24 hours.
- **Verdant Nature:** The berstuc doesn’t require food or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The berstuc makes three Slam attacks. If two Slam attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the berstuc can use Enclose on it.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 17) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the berstuc doesn’t have two other creatures grappled.
- **Enclose:** The berstuc encloses a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it in a mossy growth on the berstuc’s body, and the grapple ends. While enclosed in the berstuc’s growth, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover from attacks and other effects outside the berstuc, and it takes 21 (6d6) poison damage at the start of each of the berstuc’s turns. The berstuc can have only one creature enclosed at a time.
