### Special Abilities

- **Reactive Venom:** If the spider deals poison damage to a creature that is poisoned, the target takes an extra 2 (1d4) poison damage.
- **Spider Climb:** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down and on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Web Walker:** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.

### Bonus Actions

- **Swingline:** The spider throws a length of webbing at a point on a surface, such as the ground or wall, it can see within 30 feet of it, attaching one end of the webbing to that point. It then reels in the webbing, pulling itself to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that point. When the spider moves in this way, opportunity attacks against it have disadvantage. If the spider pulled itself at least 15 feet straight toward a creature, it has advantage on the next Bite attack it makes against that creature before the start of its next turn.
