- **Poisoned Weapons.** The assassin’s weapons are coated in poison. When it hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 poison damage (included in the attack). In addition, at the start of each of its turns, the assassin can choose which of the following poisons is active on its weapons. The poison remains on the weapons until the start of the assassin’s next turn.
