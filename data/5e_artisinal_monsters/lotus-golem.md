### Special Abilities

- **Arcane Pool:** The lotus golem absorbs energy from nearby spellcasting. Most lotus golems hold 1 charge point at any given time but can hold up to 4. As a bonus action while casting a spell within 5 feet of the lotus golem, the golem's controller can expend the golem's charge points to cast the spell without expending a spell slot. To do so, the controller must expend a number of charge points equal to the level of the spell.
- **Immutable Form:** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.
- **Water Walker:** The golem can move across the surface of water as if it were harmless, solid ground. This trait works like the water walk spell.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The lotus golem makes two arcane water attacks.
- **Arcane Water:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d12 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) force damage.

### Reactions

- **Arcane Absorption:** When a spell is cast within 30 feet of it, the golem absorbs some of the spell's potency. If it is a spell that forces a saving throw, the DC to succeed drops by 2. If it is a spell with an attack roll, the attack roll has disadvantage. The golem regains 20 hp and gains 1 charge point in its Arcane Pool.
