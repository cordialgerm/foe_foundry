### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The knight attacks twice with their greatsword.

- **Lance (Mounted Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d12 + 3) piercing damage. If the knight moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack  they deal an extra 6 (1d12) piercing damage and the target makes a DC 13 Strength saving throw falling prone on a failure. This attack is made at disadvantage against targets within 5 feet.

- **Knightly Inspiration (1/Day):** The knight inspires creatures of their choice within 30 feet that can hear and understand them. For the next minute inspired creatures gain an expertise die (1d4) on attack rolls and saving throws. A creature can benefit from only one Knightly Inspiration at a time and the knight cannot target themselves.
