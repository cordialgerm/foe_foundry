- **Adhesive (Object or Terrain Form):** Adheres to anything that touches it. Creature adhered is also grappled (escape DC 15). Ability checks to escape: disadvantage. It can choose for creature to not be affected.
- **False Appearance (Object or Terrain Form):** While motionless it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object or terrain feature.
- **Grappler:** Advantage on attack rolls vs. any creature grappled by it.
- **Object Mimicry (Object or Terrain Form):** Shape minor pseudopods into Med or smaller objects. Creature that sees one can tell it is an imitation with DC 15 Wis (Insight) check. Creature with half its body in contact with object (ex: sitting on “chair”) is subject to Adhesive.
- **Stretched Form (Terrain Form):** Occupy another’s space vice versa.
- **Tunneler:** Can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 15-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

- **Stalagteeth (Terrain Form Recharge 4–6):** Launches harpoon-like pseudopod shaped like pointed object (ex: stalagtite) at a creature in its space. Target: DC 14 Dex or 24 (7d6) piercing damage and pseudopod stuck in it. While pseudopod is stuck target restrained and 10 (3d6) acid at start of each of its turns mimic can use bonus action to pull target up to 30' to its nearest wall ceiling or similar surface. Creature including target can use action to detach pseudopod via DC 15 Str. If target detaches harpoon while stuck to mimic's ceiling: normal fall damage.
