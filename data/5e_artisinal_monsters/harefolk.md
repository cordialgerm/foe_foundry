### Special Abilities

- **Keen Smell:** The harefolk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
- **Ready for Trouble:** The harefolk can’t be surprised, and it has advantage on initiative rolls if it isn’t incapacitated or unconscious.
- **Shapechanger Sensitivity:** The harefolk has advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine if a creature is a shapechanger. It automatically succeeds when the shapechanger is a werewolf. In addition, the harefolk has advantage on its first attack roll each turn against a creature with the Shapechanger trait or Change Shape action, regardless of whether the harefolk was previously aware of the shapechanger’s nature.
- **Snow Camouflage:** The harefolk has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain.
