### Special Abilities

- **Frozen Blood:** A creature that hits the chosen with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) cold damage.
- **Ice Runes:** The chosen’s weapon attacks are magical. When the chosen hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 cold damage (included in the attack).
- **Ice Walk:** The chosen can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra movement.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Boreas’ chosen makes two ice spear attacks.
- **Spear:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.
- **Breath of the North Wind:** (Recharge 5-6). Boreas’ chosen exhales freezing breath in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) cold damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and its speed isn’t reduced. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is petrified in ice until the end of its next turn instead.
