### Special Abilities

- **Clumsy.** While not flying, the wyvern is vulnerable to the grappled, prone, and restrained conditions.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The wyvern makes one Bite attack and one Stinger attack. While flying, it can replace one attack with a Claws attack.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Stinger.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

- **Reflexive Tail Whip.** When a creature moves into a space within 15 feet of the wyvern, it can whip its tail at the creature. The target must succeed on a DC 15 STR save or be knocked prone.
