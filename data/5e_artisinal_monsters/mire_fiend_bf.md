### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The mire fiend makes one Mandibles attack, one Spear attack, and one Stinger attack.
- **Mandibles.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Spear.** Melee Weapon or Ranged Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
- **Stinger.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 CON save or be poisoned.
- **Stunning Snap (Recharge 5–6).** If the mire fiend has no creature grappled, it snaps its mandibles together with great force, creating a miniature sonic boom in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 CON save. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) thunder damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.

### Reactions

- **Acidic Retribution.** When the mire fiend takes damage, including any damage that reduces it to 0 HP, it can expel acid from its stinger in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 DEX save, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
