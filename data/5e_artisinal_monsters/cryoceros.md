### Special Abilities

- **Snow Camouflage:** The cryoceros has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain.
- **Trampling Charge:** If the cryoceros moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with its gore attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the cryoceros can make one stomp attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.
- **Stomp:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one prone creature. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Shards of Ice (Recharge 4-6):** The cryoceros exhales razor-sharp ice in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage and 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
