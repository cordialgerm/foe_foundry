- **Sunlight Weakness.** While in sunlight, the shadow has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saves.
- **Undead Nature.** The shadow doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Undead Resilience.** The shadow is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.

### Actions

- **Strength Drain.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target’s STR score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its STR to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If a Humanoid dies from this attack, a new shadow rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Bond.** One creature the shadow can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 12 WIS save or the shadow bonds with the target’s shadow for 1 minute. While bonded with the target’s shadow, the shadow can use this bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that creature, provided the creature is within 120 feet of the shadow.
- **Shadow Stealth.** The shadow takes the Hide action. It can use this bonus action only while in dim light or darkness.
