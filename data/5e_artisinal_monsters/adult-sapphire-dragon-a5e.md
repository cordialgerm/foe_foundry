### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, its eyes dull as it briefly loses its connection to the future. Until the end of its next turn, it can't use Foretell, Prognosticate, or Prophesy Doom, and it loses its Predictive Harmonics trait.
- **Predictive Harmonics:** The dragon is psionically aware of its own immediate future. The dragon cannot be surprised, and any time the dragon would make a roll with disadvantage, it makes that roll normally instead.
- **Psionic Powers:** The dragons psionic abilities are considered both magical and psionic.
- **Far Thoughts:** The dragon is aware of any creature that uses a psionic ability or communicates telepathically within 100 miles of it. As an action, the dragon can psionically observe a creature, object, or location it is familiar with within 100 miles. While observing a subject in this way, the dragon can see, hear, and communicate telepathically, but it is blind and deaf in regard to its physical senses and does not require food or water. The dragon can psionically observe a subject indefinitely and can end this effect and return to its own senses as an action.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 18). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:comprehend languages, detect thoughts, telekinesis, wall of force

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws. In place of its bite  it can use Psionic Wave.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) psychic damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Psionic Wave:** The dragon psionically emits a wave of crushing mental pressure. Each creature within 20 feet makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw  taking 16 (3d10) psychic damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Creatures suffering ongoing psychic damage make this saving throw with disadvantage.
- **Discognitive Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon unleashes psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw  taking 60 (11d10) psychic damage and 11 (2d10) ongoing psychic damage on a failed save or half as much psychic damage and no ongoing psychic damage on a success. The ongoing damage ends if a creature falls unconscious. A creature can also use an action to ground itself in reality  ending the ongoing damage.
- **Prognosticate (3/Day):** The dragon psionically makes a prediction of an event up to 100 years in the future. This prediction has a 67 percent chance of being perfectly accurate and a 33 percent chance of being partially or wholly wrong. Alternatively  the dragon can choose to gain truesight to a range of 90 feet for 1 minute.



### Legendary Actions

- **The dragon can take 3 legendary actions:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Foretell:** The dragon psionically catches a glimpse of a fast-approaching moment and plans accordingly. The dragon rolls a d20 and records the number rolled. Until the end of the dragons next turn, the dragon can replace the result of any d20 rolled by it or a creature within 120 feet with the foretold number. Each foretold roll can be used only once.
- **Psionic Wave (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon uses Psionic Wave.
- **Shatter Mind (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 23 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 22 (4d10) ongoing psychic damage. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the ongoing psychic damage on a success. A creature can also use an action to ground itself in reality, ending the ongoing damage.
