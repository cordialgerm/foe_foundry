### Special Abilities

- **Devil’s Sight:** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the salt devil’s darkvision.
- **Magic Resistance:** The salt devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Salt-Encrusted Hide:** A creature that touches the salt devil or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The salt devil makes two Scimitar attacks and one Water-Draining Claw attack.
- **Scimitar:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Water-Draining Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature that isn’t a Construct or Undead, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Plants, Oozes, and creatures with the Amphibious, Water Breathing, or Water Form traits have disadvantage on this saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target also suffers one level of exhaustion.
- **Teleport (3/Day):** The salt devil magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
- **Summon Devil (1/Day):** The salt devil magically calls 1d4 gnolls that are Fiends with the salt devil’s damage resistances and immunities. The salt devil has a 25 percent chance of calling one salt devil instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the devil and obeying its telepathic commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the devil dies, or until the devil dismisses them as a bonus action.
