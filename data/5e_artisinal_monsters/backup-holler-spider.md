### Special Abilities

- **Spider Climb:** The holler spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Vigilant:** If the holler spider remains motionless for at least 1 minute, it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Hoot:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) thunder damage. If the holler spider scores a critical hit, it is pushed 5 feet away from the target.
- **Distressed Discharge (Recharge 5-6):** The holler spider releases a short, distressed cacophony in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The holler spider is pushed 15 feet in the opposite direction of the cone.

### Reactions

- **Tune Up:** When an ally within 15 feet of the backup holler spider casts a spell that deals thunder damage, the backup holler spider chooses one of the spell’s targets. That target has disadvantage on the saving throw against the spell.
