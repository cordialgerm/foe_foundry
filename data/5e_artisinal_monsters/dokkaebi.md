### Special Abilities

- **Invisibility Hat:** Its hat allows it to turn invisible. Works for another only if dokkaebi formally allows that creature to borrow it. A creature wearing hat with permission can use its Invisibility action. If hat is not returned when requested hat loses all magical properties.
- **Wrestler:** Advantage on Str (Athletics) checks made to grapple and ability checks and saves made to escape a grapple.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Three attacks with its club.
- **Dokkaebi Bangmangi:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 5 (1d4+3) bludgeoning damage. See below..
- **Invisibility:** Magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Items wears or carries are invisible with it. Can’t use this if it doesn’t have its hat.
