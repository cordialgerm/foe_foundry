### Special Abilities

- **Controlled Polarity:** The magnetic elemental has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if the creature is wearing metal armor. A creature attacking the magnetic elemental with a metal weapon while within 10 feet of it has disadvantage on the attack roll.
- **Magnetism:** When the magnetic elemental moves, Medium and smaller metal objects that aren’t being worn or carried are pulled up to 5 feet closer to the magnetic elemental. If this movement pulls the object into the elemental’s space, the item sticks to the elemental. A successful DC 15 Strength check removes a stuck item from the elemental. Objects made of gold and silver are unaffected by this trait.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The magnetic elemental makes two slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Magnetic Pulse (Recharge 4-6):** The magnetic elemental releases a magnetic pulse, choosing to pull or push nearby metal objects. Objects made of gold or silver are unaffected by the elemental’s Pulse. <br>* Pull. Each creature that is wearing metal armor or holding a metal weapon within 5 feet of the magnetic elemental must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or the metal items worn or carried by it stick to the magnetic elemental. A creature that is made of metal or is wearing metal armor and that fails the saving throw is stuck to the elemental and grappled (escape DC 15). If the item is a weapon and the wielder can’t or won’t let go of the weapon, the wielder is stuck to the elemental and grappled (escape DC 15). A stuck object can’t be used. Grappled and stuck creatures and objects move with the elemental when it moves. A creature can take its action to remove one creature or object from the elemental by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The magnetic elemental’s Armor Class increases by 1 for each creature grappled in this way. <br>* Push. Each creature that is wearing metal armor or holding a metal weapon within 10 feet of the elemental must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the elemental. On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn’t pushed. A creature grappled by the elemental has disadvantage on this saving throw.
