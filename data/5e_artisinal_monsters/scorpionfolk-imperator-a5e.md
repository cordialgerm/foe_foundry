A creature in the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every foot moved towards the imperator. The imperator can change the direction of the gust with a bonus action.

Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw  taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is also poisoned until the end of its next turn.
