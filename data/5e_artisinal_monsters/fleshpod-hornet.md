### Special Abilities

- **Flying Charge:** If the fleshpod hornet flies at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fleshpod hornet makes two attacks: one with its slam and one with its stinger.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Stinger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed saving throw, the target is also infected with the eggs of the fleshpod hornet. <br><br>The injected eggs form a circular lotus pod tumor, roughly half a foot in diameter, on the target within 1 minute of injection. While carrying this tumor, the target has disadvantage on skill checks and saving throws. Exactly 24 hours after the lotus pod appears, a young fleshpod hornet (use giant wasp statistics) erupts from the tumor, dealing does 33 (6d10) slashing damage to the target. <br><br>The tumor can be excised with a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, causing 16 (3d10) slashing damage to the host. If it is cut out without the check, the patient must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (4d10) slashing damage.
