### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The sandman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Stuff of Dreams:** Made partially from dreams and imagination, the sandman isn’t fully real. Any critical hit against the sandman is a normal hit.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sandman makes two Claw attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Dreamer’s Sand, if available.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic damage. Damage from this attack doesn’t wake an unconscious creature, unless the unconscious creature is below half its hp maximum. If the sandman scores a critical hit, the target is cursed with the eye-closer’s curse. While cursed, the creature is blinded until it finishes a long rest or until the curse is lifted by remove curse or similar magic.
- **Encourage Dreams (Recharge 5–6):** The sandman encourages powerful dreams in the minds of up to three unconscious creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, nightmares fill the target’s mind, and the target takes 35 (10d6) psychic damage, wakes from its sleep, and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, pleasant dreams fill the target’s mind, and the target regains 10 (3d6) hp and can choose to remain unconscious or awaken. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Dreamer’s Sand (Recharge 5–6):** The sandman throws magical sand in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.
