- **Greatclub:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage  and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.
- **Sweeping Strike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.  all creatures within 5 feet. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage  and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failure  it is pushed 10 feet away from the ogre.
- **Grab:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage  and the target is grappled if its Medium or smaller (escape DC 14)  and until the grapple ends  the zombie can't grab another target.

### Reactions

- **Bodyblock:** If the ogre flesh heap is grappling a creature when it is hit with a weapon attack by a creature it can see, it uses the creature as a shield, adding 2 to its AC against the attack. If this causes the attack to miss, the attack hits the grappled creature instead.
- **Corpulent Expulsion (Recharge 6:** When it takes damage, the ogre flesh heaps belly splits and releases a torrent of caustic gore in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in this area make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) acid damage on a failure and half damage on a success. The flesh heap then takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.
