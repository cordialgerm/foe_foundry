- **Shatter (2nd-Level; V, S, M):** An ear-splitting ringing sound fills a 10-foot-radius sphere emanating from a point the minstrel can see within 60 feet.

A creature made of stone  metal  or other inorganic material has disadvantage on its saving throw. Unattended objects in the area also take the damage.
