### Special Abilities

- **Prehensile Tendrils:** The valkruung has 10 shiny blue-gray tendrils that constantly grab at things in the environment. Each tendril can pick up or hold a Tiny object, such as a coin or piece of jewelry, that isn’t being worn or carried. If it uses all 10 of its tendrils, the valkruung can carry a single Small object, such as a backpack. The valkruung can use its tendrils to interact with objects, but it can’t use them to wield a weapon. It has advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks when using its tendrils and can use its tendrils to disarm opponents (see the Disarming Tendrils reaction).

### Actions

- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target suffers an itchy rash, and, at the start of each of its turns, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving or spend its action furiously scratching the rash. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

- **Disarming Tendrils:** When a creature the valkruung can see targets it with a melee weapon attack, the attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or its weapon is knocked out of its grasp into a random unoccupied space within 5 feet of the attacker. The valkruung can’t use this reaction against attackers wielding a heavy or two-handed weapon.
