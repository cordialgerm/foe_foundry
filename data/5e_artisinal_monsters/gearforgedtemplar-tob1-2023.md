### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The gearforged templar doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The gearforged templar makes four Greatsword or Javelin attacks. If two Greatsword attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the templar. The templar can choose not to push a creature.
- **Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage
- **Javelin:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Whirlwind (Recharge 5–6):** The gearforged templar whirls its greatsword in a great arc. Each creature within 10 feet of the gearforged must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Defensive Zone:** When a creature enters the gearforged templar’s reach, the templar makes one Greatsword attack against the creature.
- **Parry:** The gearforged templar adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the templar must be able to see the attacker and must be wielding a melee weapon.
