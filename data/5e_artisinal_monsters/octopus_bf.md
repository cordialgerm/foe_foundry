### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath.** While out of water, the octopus can hold its breath for 30 minutes.
- **Underwater Camouflage.** The octopus’s Stealth is 18 while underwater.
- **Water Breathing.** The octopus can breathe only underwater.

### Actions

- **Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 11), if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the octopus can’t use its Tentacles on another target.

### Reactions

- **Ink Dash (Recharge 6).** When a creature the octopus can see deals damage to it, the octopus can release a 5-foot-radius cloud of ink all around itself, if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured until the end of the octopus’s next turn, although a significant current can disperse the ink. Then, the octopus can swim up to its swimming speed. If it does so, it immediately releases any creature it is grappling.
