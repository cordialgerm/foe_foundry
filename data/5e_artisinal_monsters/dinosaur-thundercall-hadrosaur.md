- **Thunderous Bellow (Recharge 5–6):** The thundercall hadrosaur unleashes a ground-shattering bellow in a 120' cone. All in area make a DC 16 Con save. On a failure a creature takes 38 (7d10) thunder and is knocked prone. On a success a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.

- **Sonic Shield:** The hadrosaur adds 4 to its AC vs. one ranged attack that would hit it. To do so the hadrosaur must see the attacker and not be in an area of magical silence.
