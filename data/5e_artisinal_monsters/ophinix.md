### Special Abilities

- **Conductive Fur:** While the ophinix is charged with electricity, a creature that touches the ophinix or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) lightning damage.
- **Lightning Recharge:** Whenever the ophinix is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and becomes charged with electricity. If it is already charged, the duration resets to 1 minute.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the ophinix is charged with electricity, the target also takes 5 (2d4) lightning damage.
- **Generate Static:** The ophinix rubs along a dry surface and charges its fur with static electricity. Its fur remains charged with electricity for 1 minute or until it uses Lightning Strike.
- **Lightning Strike (Recharge Special):** The ophinix releases its static electricity at up to three targets it can see within 30 feet of it. Each creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After using Lightning Strike, the ophinix is no longer charged with electricity. It can’t use Lightning Strike if isn’t charged with electricity.
