### Special Abilities

- **Aura of Defiance:** The ghost dwarf and any undead within 10 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
- **Ethereal Sight:** The ghost dwarf can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** The ghost dwarf can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the ghost dwarf has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ghost dwarf makes three attacks, only one of which can be a hand of the grave attack.
- **Ghostly Axe:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. A new ghostly axe appears in the ghost dwarf's hand after it is thrown.
- **Hand of the Grave:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Prayers Unanswered (Recharge 5-6):** The ghost dwarf emits a constant whisper consisting of prayers, pleading, cursing, and cryptic phrases. The volume of the whispering intermittently increases, and those within 30 feet of the ghost dwarf that can hear it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Etherealness:** The ghost dwarf enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane. Ghoul, Darakhul Though all darakhul acknowledge dark gods, the priestess holds a closer link than most-always first to the feast, dividing out the choice morsels, intoning the words of hideous praise for the feast.
