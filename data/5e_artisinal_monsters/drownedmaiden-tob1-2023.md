### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The drowned maiden makes three Hair attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Draining Kiss.
- **Hair:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16) if it is a Large or smaller creature. She can grapple up to three creatures at a time. The hair holding a creature can be attacked and destroyed (AC 15; 15 hp; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage).
- **Draining Kiss:** One creature within 5 feet of the maiden and that she is grappling must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and its Strength is reduced by 1d6. On a success, the target takes half the damage, and its Strength isnâ€™t reduced. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its Strength is reduced to 0.
- **Illusory Appearance:** The maiden covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the maiden takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the maiden is disguised.

### Bonus Actions

- **Reel:** The drowned maiden pulls each creature grappled by her up to 15 feet straight toward her.
