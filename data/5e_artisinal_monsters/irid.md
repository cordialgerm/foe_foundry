- **Magic Resistance:** The irid has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Photographic Memory:** The irid can perfectly recall anything it has seen or heard in the last month.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The irid uses its Gossip. It then uses its Iridescent Blast once.
- **Iridescent Blast:** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) radiant damage.
- **Gossip:** The irid spouts gossip and exaggerated truths about a target it can see within 30 feet. If the target is hostile, it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on its next attack roll. If the target is friendly, it has advantage on its next attack roll.
- **Invisibility:** The irid magically turns invisible until it attacks or uses Gossip, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the irid wears or carries is invisible with it.
