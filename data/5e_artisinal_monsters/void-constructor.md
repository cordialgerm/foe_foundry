- **Tainted Aura:** A Void constructor that has completed a Void henge gains necrotic energy while within 1 mile of the henge. At the start of each of the Void constructor’s turns each creature within 10 ft. of it must make DC 13 Cha save or take 2 (1d4) necrotic. The Void constructor can choose for a creature it is grappling to be immune to the Tainted Auras of all Void constructors.
