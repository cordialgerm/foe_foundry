### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the pine doom remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary pine tree.
- **Sticky Pine Tar:** A creature that touches the pine doom is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained. In addition, when a creature hits the pine doom with a bludgeoning or piercing weapon while within 5 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the weapon becomes stuck to the tree. A stuck weapon canâ€™t be used. A creature can take its action to remove one stuck weapon from the pine doom by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check. Splashing the pine doom with a gallon of alcohol frees all creatures and objects stuck to it and suppresses this trait for 1 minute.
- **Siege Monster:** The pine doom deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The pine doom makes three slam attacks. Alternatively, it can use Sap-filled Pinecone twice.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Sap-filled Pinecone:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by sap. A creature can be free if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 16 Strength check and succeeds.
- **Flurry of Pinecones (Recharge 6):** Each creature within 30 feet of the pine doom must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 15 (6d4) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
