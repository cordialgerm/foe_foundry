### Special Abilities

- **Crawling Swarm.** A creature in the swarm’s space is covered in crawling and buzzing insects. If the creature casts a spell with a somatic component, it must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or the spell fails to cast, expending the action required to cast it but not the spell slot or daily use.
- **Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain HP or gain temporary HP.
- **Swarm Resilience.** The swarm is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it is immune to the charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned conditions.

### Actions

- **Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its HP or fewer.
