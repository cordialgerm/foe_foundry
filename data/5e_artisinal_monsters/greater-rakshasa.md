### Special Abilities

- **Limited Magic Immunity:** The greater rakshasa can't be affected or detected by spells of 7th level or lower unless it wishes to be. It has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.
- **Puppet Master:** When the greater rakshasa casts the charm person spell, it can target up to five creatures. When it casts the dominate person spell, the spell's duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The greater rakshasa's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The greater rakshasa can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: detect thoughts, disguise self, mage hand, minor illusion
3/day each: charm person, detect magic, invisibility, major image, suggestion
1/day each: dominate person, fly, plane shift, true seeing

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The greater rakshasa makes two claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, and the target is cursed if it is a creature. The magical curse takes effect whenever the target takes a short or long rest, filling the target's thoughts with horrible images and dreams. The cursed target gains no benefit from finishing a short or long rest. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.
- **Harrowing Visions (Recharge 5-6):** The greater rakshasa chooses a point it can see within 60 feet, conjuring a terrifying manifestation of its enemies' worst fears in a 30-foot-radius around the point. Each non-rakshasa in the area must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 66 (12d10) psychic damage and becomes frightened for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't frightened. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The greater rakshasa can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The greater rakshasa regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Claw Attack:** The greater rakshasa makes one claw attack.
- **Misleading Escape (Costs 2 Actions):** The greater rakshasa becomes invisible at the same time that an illusory double of itself appears where it is standing. This switch is indiscernible to others. After the double appears, the greater rakshasa can move up to its speed. Both effects last until the start of the greater rakshasa's next turn, but the invisibility ends if the greater rakshasa makes an attack or casts a spell before then.
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions):** The greater rakshasa casts a spell from its list of innate spells, consuming a use of the spell as normal.
