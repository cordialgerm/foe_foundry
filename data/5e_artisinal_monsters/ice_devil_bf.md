### Special Abilities

- **Devil’s Sight.** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the devil’s darkvision.
- **Devilish Resilience.** The devil is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, it is immune to fire damage and poison damage and to the poisoned condition.
- **Magic Resistance.** The devil has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.
- **Snow Walk.** The ice devil can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. In addition, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra movement.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The devil makes two Claw attacks and one Tail attack, or it makes three Icicle Shard attacks.
- **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) cold damage.
- **Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) cold damage.
- **Icicle Shard.** Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) cold damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Ice Wall.** The ice devil causes a wall of ice to magically rise from the ground at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. It can be any shape, as long as its base is connected to the ground. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side (the devil’s choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall, it can make a DC 17 DEX save. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

### Reactions

- **Ice Shield.** When the ice devil or a friendly creature it can see is hit by an attack, the devil can create a magical barrier of ice to disrupt the attack. The target halves the damage from the attack.
