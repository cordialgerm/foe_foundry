### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While motionless indistinguishable from clump of crabgrass.
- **Flaming Seedpod Regrowth:** Has four Flaming Seedpods. Used Flaming Seedpods may regrow each turn. If podthrower starts its turn with less than four Flaming Seedpods roll a d6. On a roll of 5 or 6 it regrows 1d4 Flaming Seedpods to a max of 4.
- **Regeneration:** Regains 10 hp at the start of its turn. If it takes necrotic or if it is grappled and removed from the ground this trait doesn’t function at start of its next turn. It dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn’t regenerate.

### Actions

- **Grass Blade:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 10 ft., one target, 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage.
- **Flaming Seedpod:** Lobs a flaming seedpod at a point it can see within 60' of it. Seedpod explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within 10 ft. of that point: 12 (5d4) fire (DC 15 Dex half).

### Reactions

- **Unstable Bulb:** When podthrower is grappled and removed from the ground while above 0 hp its bulb bursts. Each creature within 10 ft.: 12 (5d4) fire (DC 15 Dex half).
