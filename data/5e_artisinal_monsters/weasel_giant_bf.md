### Special Abilities

- **Heightened Hearing and Smell.** The weasel’s Perception is 18 when perceiving by hearing or smell.

### Actions

- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the weasel can steal one item the target is wearing or carrying, provided the item weighs no more than 10 pounds, isn’t a weapon, and isn’t wrapped around or firmly attached to the target. For example, a weasel could steal a hat or belt pouch but not a creature’s shirt or armor.

### Reactions

- **Repellent Spray.** When a creature the weasel can see moves to a space within 15 feet of it, the weasel can release a pungent spray at the creature. The target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned, the creature can’t move to a space within 5 feet of the weasel.
