### Special Abilities

- **Aberrant Resilience.** The insatiable brood has advantage on saves against spells or effects that would alter its form.
- **Magic Bites.** The insatiable brood’s Bites attacks are magical.
- **Siege Monster.** The insatiable brood deals double damage to objects and structures.
- **Swarm.** The insatiable brood can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the brood can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The brood can’t regain HP or gain temporary HP.
- **Swarm Resilience.** The swarm is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it is immune to the charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned conditions.
- **Void Traveler.** The insatiable brood doesn’t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure, enabling it to travel safely through the Void and similar environments.

### Actions

- **Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) force damage, or 7 (2d6) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) force damage if the insatiable brood has half its HP or fewer.

### Bonus Actions

- **Void Gaze.** The insatiable brood turns all its individual heads in one direction, and its hundreds of Void-filled eyes stare at one creature the brood can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or be frightened until the end of its next turn. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, it suffers a random, short-term dread effect for 1 minute.
