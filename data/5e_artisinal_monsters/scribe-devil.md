### Special Abilities

- **Devil’s Sight:** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the scribe’s darkvision.
- **Magic Resistance:** The scribe has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The scribe devil’s spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). The devil can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: detect magic, illusory script
3/day each: dispel magic, zone of truth
1/day each: glyph of warding, modify memory

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The scribe devil makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its tail.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become blinded as its eyes turn black and fill with infernal ink. The condition can be removed with a greater restoration spell or similar magic. Alternatively, a creature with a healer’s kit can drain the ink from a blinded creature’s eyes with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If this check fails by 5 or more, the attempt to drain the ink instead removes the blinded creature’s eyes and the creature takes 21 (6d6) piercing damage.
