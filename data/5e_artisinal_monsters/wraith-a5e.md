- **Evil:** The wraith radiates an Evil aura.

- **Light Sensitivity:** While in sunlight or bright light cast by a fire, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Perception checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Life Drain:** The wraith targets a creature within 5 feet  forcing it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  the creature takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage  or 21 (6d6) necrotic damage if it is frightened or surprised  and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. It dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.
