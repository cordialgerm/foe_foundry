### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The basilisk is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Petrifying Gaze.** When a creature that can see the basilisk’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk, the basilisk can force it to make a DC 12 CON save if the basilisk isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the save at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The basilisk makes two Bite or Poison Spit attacks. If both Bite or Poison Spit attacks hit one creature, the target is poisoned until the end of its next turn.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
- **Poison Spit.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) poison damage.
