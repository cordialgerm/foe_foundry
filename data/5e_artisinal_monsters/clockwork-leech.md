### Special Abilities

- **Anesthetizing Bite:** When the clockwork leech successfully bites a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the bite. If the leech remains attached to the target, the target can repeat this check at the start of each of its turns.
- **Immutable Form:** The clockwork leech is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The clockwork leech has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the clockwork leech attaches to the target. While attached, the leech doesn’t attack. Instead, at the start of each of the clockwork leech’s turns, the target loses 5 (1d6 + 2) hp due to blood loss, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the leech’s next turn. The clockwork leech can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 10 hp of blood from its target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the leech by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
