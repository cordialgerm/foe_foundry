### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious.** The sea hag can breathe air and water.
- **Fey Resilience.** The sea hag is resistant to the charmed and unconscious conditions.
- **Horrific Appearance.** When a Humanoid that can see the hag’s true form starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag, the hag can force it to make a DC 12 WIS save. On a failure, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn.
- **Underwater Camouflage.** The hag’s Stealth is 18 while underwater and not using Illusory Appearance.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The hag uses Death Glare. It then makes two Claw attacks.
- **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Death Glare.** One creature the hag can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 12 WIS save or be frightened until the end of its next turn. If the target is already frightened and fails the save, it is reduced to 0 HP instead. If reduced to 0 HP in this way, the creature is stable.

### Bonus Actions

- **Illusory Appearance.** The hag covers itself and anything it is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes it look like another creature of its general size and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if the hag dies.

### Reactions

- **Barnacle Block.** When the hag takes damage from a source it can see, the hag can shift the barnacles and scales on its body to absorb some of the impact, reducing the damage by 4 (1d8).
