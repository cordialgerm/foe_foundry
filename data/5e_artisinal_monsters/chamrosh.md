### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Fearsome Bark (Recharge 5-6):** The chamrosh lets out a highpitched bark at a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target is of evil alignment, it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. The bark has no effect on neutral or good-aligned creatures.
- **Healing Lick (2/Day):** The chamrosh licks another creature. The target magically regains 10 (2d8 + 1) hp and is cured of the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions.
