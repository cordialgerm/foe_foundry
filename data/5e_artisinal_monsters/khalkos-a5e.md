### Special Abilities

- **Detect Alignment:** The khalkos can detect the presence of creatures within 30 feet that have an alignment trait, and knows the alignment of such creatures.
- **Magic Resistance:** The khalkos has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.
- **Psionic Spellcasting:** The khalkoss spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

### Actions

- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.
- **Chaos Pheromones:** The khalkos emits a cloud of pheromones in a 20-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners. Each non-khalkos creature in the area makes a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. Creatures with an alignment trait make this save with disadvantage. On a failure  the creature is confused for 1 minute. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending the effect on itself on a success. If the creature makes its saving throw or the condition ends for it  it is immune to Chaos Pheromones for the next 24 hours.
- **Psionic Sting:** The khalkos targets a creature within 30 feet  forcing it to make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure  the target takes 28 (8d6) psychic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn.

### Bonus Actions

- **Brain Jab:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated creature with a brain and an Intelligence of 6 or higher. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target becomes diseased with brain larvae. Once the khalkos has used this attack successfully, it can't use it again for 24 hours.

### Reactions

- **Telekinetic Shield:** When the khalkos is hit by an attack made by a creature that it can see or sense with its Detect Alignment trait, it gains a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack.
