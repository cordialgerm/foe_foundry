### Special Abilities

- **Keen Hearing and Smell:** The chupacabra has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
- **Running Leap:** With a 10-foot running start, the chupacabra can long jump up to 25 feet.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the chupacabra attaches to the target. While attached, the chupacabra doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the chupacabra's turns, the target loses 6 (1d6 + 3) hp due to blood loss. The chupacabra can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after the target is reduced to 0 hp. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the chupacabra.
- **Fearful Gaze:** The chupacabra fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the chupacabra's Fearful Gaze for the next 24 hours.

### Reactions

- **Malodorous Stench:** When the chupacabra is reduced to less than half of its maximum hp, it releases a foul, sulphurous stench. Each creature within 5 feet of the chupacabra must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.
