### Special Abilities

- **Spellcasting:** The mage is a 9th level spellcaster. Their spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14
 +6 to hit with spell attacks). They have the following wizard spells prepared:
 Cantrips (at will): fire bolt
 light
 mage hand
 prestidigitation
 1st-level (4 slots): detect magic
 identify
 mage armor
 shield
 2nd-level (3 slots): alter self
 misty step
 3rd-level (3 slots): animate dead
 counterspell
 fireball
 4th-level (3 slots): dimension door
 greater invisibility
 5th-level (1 slot): cone of cold

### Actions

- **Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Fire Bolt (Cantrip; V, S):** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d10) fire damage.
- **Fireball (3rd-Level; V, S, M):** Fire streaks from the mage to a point within 120 feet and explodes in a 20-foot radius  spreading around corners. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw  taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
- **Dimension Door (4th-Level; V):** The mage teleports to a location within 500 feet. They can bring along one willing Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. If a creature would teleport to an occupied space  it takes 14 (4d6) force damage  and the spell fails.
- **Greater Invisibility (4th-Level; V, S, Concentration):** The mage or a creature they touch is invisible for 1 minute.
- **Cone of Cold (5th-Level; V, S, M):** Frost blasts from the mage in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw  taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Misty Step (2nd-Level; V):** The mage teleports to an unoccupied space they can see within 30 feet. The mage can't cast this spell and a 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.

### Reactions

- **Counterspell (3rd-Level; S):** When a creature the mage can see within 60 feet casts a spell, the mage attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the mage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If the mage casts counterspell with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of counterspell.
- **Shield (1st-Level; V:** When the mage is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of their next turn.
