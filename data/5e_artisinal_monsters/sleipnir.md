### Special Abilities

- **Heroic Leap (1/Day):** As a bonus action, the sleipnir can leap into the air, gaining a flying speed of 60 feet for 1 minute.
- **Trampling Charge:** If the sleipnir moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a rune hooves attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the sleipnir can make another rune hooves attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sleipnir makes two rune hooves attacks.
- **Rune Hooves:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage and 3 (1d6) radiant damage. An undead creature who takes damage from this attack must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be restrained by magical runes until the end of its next turn.
- **Gold and Ice (1/Day):** The sleipnir summons a gilded avalanche in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning and 13 (3d8) cold damage, is pushed 15 feet away from the sleipnir, and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.

### Reactions

- **Eight Hooves (3/Day):** When a creature moves within 5 feet of the sleipnir, the sleipnir can move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
