- **Flexible Form:** Can twist its body into unnatural positions allowing it to easily move through any opening large enough for a Small creature. It can squeeze through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The angel’s destination must still have suitable room to accommodate its volume.
- **Keen Smell:** Advantage: smell Wis (Percept) checks.
- **Limited Telepathy:** Can magically communicate simple ideas emotions and images telepathically with any creature within 100' of it that can understand a language.
