- **Stout:** The juggernaut has advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws made against effects that would push it or knock it prone.
- **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** If the juggernaut takes 15 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hp, it is reduced to 1 hp instead.

- **Multiattack:** The dogmole juggernaut makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. it: 12 (3d4 + 5) slashing damage.

### Reactions

- **Wormkiller Rage:** When the juggernaut takes damage from a Small or larger insectoid Beast, such as a giant centipede, or when it deals damage to such a creature, it enters a special rage for 3 rounds. While in this rage, it has advantage on attack rolls and Strength checks and deals an extra 5 (2d4) piercing damage with its Bite attack, but its Armor Class is reduced by 2. The juggernaut can’t end this rage willingly.
