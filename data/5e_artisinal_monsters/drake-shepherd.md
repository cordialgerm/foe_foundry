Each creature within 30' of it: become indifferent about creatures that it is hostile toward within 100' of the drake for 1 hr (DC 15 Cha negates). Indifference ends if creature is attacked harmed by a spell or witnesses any of its allies being harmed. Frightened creatures within 30' of drake are no longer frightened.Protective Roar Each hostile creature in 30' cone: 21 (6d6) thunder (DC 15 Con half). Each friendly Beast in area gains 5 (1d10) temp hp or 11 (2d10) temp hp if it is charmed by the drake.

### Reactions

- **Shepherd’s Safeguard:** When a Beast within 30' of the drake would be hit by an attack drake can chirp and beast adds 3 to its AC vs. the attack. To do so drake must see attacker and Beast.
