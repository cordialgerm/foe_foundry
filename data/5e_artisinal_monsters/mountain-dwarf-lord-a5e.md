- **Battleaxe:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d8 + 7) slashing damage.

- **Command the Attack (1/Day):** The knight captain issues a command to all nonhostile creatures within 30 feet. Creatures who can see or hear the knight captain can use their reaction to make a single weapon attack with advantage.
- **Knightly Inspiration (1/Day):** The knight captain inspires creatures of their choice within 30 feet that can hear and understand them. For the next minute  inspired creatures gain an expertise die (1d4) on attack rolls and saving throws. A creature can benefit from only one Knightly Inspiration at a time  and the knight captain cannot target themselves.

### Reactions

- **Shield Block:** When a creature attacks the mountain dwarf lord or a target within 5 feet, the mountain dwarf lord imposes disadvantage on that attack. To do so, the mountain dwarf lord must see the attacker and be wielding a shield.
