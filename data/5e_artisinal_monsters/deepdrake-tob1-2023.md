### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The drake has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the drake has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The drake makes one Bite attack, two Claw attacks, and one Stinger attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Stinger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failure, the creature takes 7 (2d6) poison damage. On a success, the condition ends. When animate dead is cast on one or more creatures killed by this poison, the spellcaster requires no material components and can cast the spell as an action.
- **Enervating Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The deep drake exhales pain-inducing, purple-black energy in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) necrotic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.
