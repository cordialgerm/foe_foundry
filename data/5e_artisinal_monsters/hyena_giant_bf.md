### Special Abilities

- **Cackling Chorus.** If three or more hyenas are all within 30 feet of each other, their cackling, grunts, whoops, and yips create a deafening chorus. A creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a hyena must succeed on a CON save or be deafened until the start of its next turn. The DC is equal to 8 plus the number of participating hyenas.

### Actions

- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Warning Yip.** The hyena can emit a brief yip at one friendly hyena or gnoll it can see within 30 feet of it, warning the target of danger. The next attack roll against the target before the start of the hyena’s turn has disadvantage.

### Reactions

- **Rampage.** When the hyena reduces a creature to 0 HP, it can move up to half its speed and make one Bite attack. If it does, attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.
