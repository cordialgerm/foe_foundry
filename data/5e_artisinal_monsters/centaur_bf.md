### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The centaur is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Trampling Charge.** If the centaur moves at least 30 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Pike attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the centaur can make one Hooves attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The centaur makes one Hooves attack and one Pike attack, or it makes three Longbow attacks.
- **Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Pike.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

### Reactions

- **Defensive Kick.** When a creature the centaur can see within 5 feet of it hits it with an attack, the centaur can kick the attacker. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be knocked prone or pushed up to 5 feet away from the centaur (the centaur’s choice).
