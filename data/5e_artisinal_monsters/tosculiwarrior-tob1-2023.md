- **Hive Sense:** The tosculi can pinpoint the location of its hive queen when she is within 300 feet of it, and it can sense the general direction and distance to the hive where its queen makes her home.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The tosculi warrior makes one Claw attack and one Stinger attack.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Stinger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target is also paralyzed. A poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Prepare Host:** The tosculi extends the paralysis on a creature within 5 feet of it that was paralyzed by a tosculi’s Stinger attack. The paralyzed target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 8 hours and no longer makes saving throws to end the paralysis. The paralysis ends if the target takes damage while below half its hp maximum. Otherwise, a spell or effect that cures disease ends this paralysis.
