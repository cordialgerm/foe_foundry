### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The tidehunter can breathe air and water.
- **Net Maker:** With 1 minute of work, the tidehunter can create a net out of seaweed, rope, or similar material. The tidehunter typically carries 2 nets.
- **Underwater Camouflage:** The tidehunter has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while underwater.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The tidehunter makes three attacks, only one of which can be with its net. It can use Reel in place of two claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). The tidehunter has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Net:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: A Large or smaller creature hit by the net is restrained until it is freed. The net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 15 slashing damage to the net (AC 13) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.
- **Reel:** The tidehunter pulls one creature restrained by its net up to 20 feet straight toward it. If the target is within 10 feet of the tidehunter at the end of this pull, the tidehunter can make one claw attack against it as a bonus action.

### Reactions

- **Entangle Weapon:** When the tidehunter is targeted by a melee weapon attack, the attacker must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or miss the attack as the tidehunter uses its net to interfere with the weapon. The tidehunter must have an empty net to use this reaction.
