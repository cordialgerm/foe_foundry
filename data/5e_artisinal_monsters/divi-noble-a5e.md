### Actions

- **Crushing Hand:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage  and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends  the divi can't use Crushing Hand on another target and has advantage on Crushing Hand attacks against this target  and the target can't breathe.

- **Quake (Recharge 5-6):** Amid deafening rumbling  the ground shakes in a 10-foot radius around a point on an earth or stone surface within 90 feet. The area becomes difficult terrain. Each non-elemental creature in the area makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw  taking 24 (7d6) thunder damage and falling prone on a failure or taking half damage on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Stone Wall (1/Day):** A permanent stone wall magically rises from an earth or stone surface within 60 feet. The wall is 6 inches thick and can be up to 20 feet high and 30 feet long. If it appears in a creatures space, the creature can choose which side of the wall to move to. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall is an object with AC 18 and 30 hit points.
