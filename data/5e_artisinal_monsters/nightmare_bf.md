- **Illumination.** The nightmare sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
- **Riding Flames.** Any creature riding a willing nightmare is resistant to fire damage. A creature riding the nightmare without the nightmare’s permission takes 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of the nightmare’s turns.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The nightmare makes two Flaming Hoof attacks.
- **Flaming Hoof.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Ethereal Stride.** The nightmare and up to three willing creatures within 5 feet of it magically enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.

### Bonus Actions

- **Burning Hoofprints.** The nightmare increases the intensity of the heat on its hooves. Until the start of its next turn, it leaves burning hoofprints in any surface through which it walks, creating a trail of fire in its wake. A creature that enters a space with burning hoofprints for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or take 3 (1d6) fire damage. The hoofprints stop burning at the start of the nightmare’s next turn.
