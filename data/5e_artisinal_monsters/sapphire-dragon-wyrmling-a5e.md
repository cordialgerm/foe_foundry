### Special Abilities

- **Far Thoughts:** The dragon is aware of any creature that uses a psionic ability or communicates telepathically within 100 miles of it. As an action, the dragon can psionically observe a creature, object, or location it is familiar with within 100 miles. While observing a subject in this way, the dragon can see, hear, and communicate telepathically, but it is blind and deaf in regard to its physical senses and does not require food or water. The dragon can psionically observe a subject indefinitely and can end this effect and return to its own senses as an action.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d10 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Discognitive Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon unleashes psychic energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw  taking 22 (4d10) psychic damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
