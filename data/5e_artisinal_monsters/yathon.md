### Special Abilities

- **Echolocation:** The yathon can’t use its blindsight while deafened.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The yathon makes two attacks. If it hits a Medium or smaller creature with two claw attacks, the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the yathon can automatically hit the target with its claws, and the yathon can’t make claw attacks against other targets.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Longbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.

### Reactions

- **Precognition (Recharge 6):** The yathon catches a glimpse of an attack just before it lands, giving it time to react. When a creature the yathon can see hits it with a melee attack, the attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. Alternatively, when the yathon misses with a melee weapon attack, it can reroll the attack roll with advantage.
