- **Hold Breath:** Can hold its breath for 30 min.
- **Leviathan Hunter:** Advantage on Wis (Perception) and Wis (Survival) checks to find and track Large or larger creatures with swimming speed.
- **Marine Weapons:** Its weapon attacks are magical. When it hits with any weapon weapon deals an extra 2d8 cold or poison (included below) hunter’s choice.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** 3 Slams or 1 Harpoon and 2 Slams.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 12 (2d6+5) bludgeoning damage + 9 (2d8) cold or poison (hunter’s choice) and target is grappled (escape DC 17). Hunter can grapple only one target at a time.
- **Harpoon:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit 5 ft. or range 20/60' one target 12 (2d6+5) piercing damage + 9 (2d8) cold or poison (hunter’s choice) and harpoon sticks in target. While harpoon is stuck target takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at start of each of its turns hunter can’t make Harpoon attacks vs. other targets and target and hunter can’t move further than 60' away from each other. A creature including target can take its action to detach harpoon by succeeding on a DC 17 Str check. Alternatively cord connecting the leviathan hunter to the harpoon can be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 25; immunity to bludgeoning poison and psychic) dislodging harpoon into an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the target and preventing hunter from using Recall Harpoon.
- **Crush:** One creature grappled by hunter: 33 (8d6+5) bludgeoning damage (DC 17 Str half).

### Bonus Actions

- **Recall Harpoon:** Pulls on the cord connected to its harpoon returning harpoon to its empty hand. If harpoon is stuck in a creature that creature must make DC 17 Str save or be pulled up to 20' toward the hunter.

### Reactions

- **Grappled Redirect:** If it is target of an attack it can see while grappling a creature it can hold the grappled creature in the way and the grappled creature becomes attack's target instead.
