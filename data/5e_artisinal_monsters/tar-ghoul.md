### Special Abilities

- **Fire Hazard:** As a bonus action or when it takes fire damage, the tar ghoul bursts into flame. The tar ghoul continues burning until it takes cold damage or is immersed in water. A creature that touches the tar ghoul or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it while it is burning takes 3 (1d6) fire damage. While burning, a tar ghoul deals an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage on each melee attack, and its vomit tar action is a 15-foot cone that ignites immediately. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The tar ghoul makes one bite attack and one claw attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Vomit Tar (Recharge 5-6):** The tar ghoul vomits tar, covering the ground in a 10-foot square within 5 feet of it. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be covered with tar. The tar ignites if touched by a source of fire or if a creature covered with tar takes fire damage. The tar burns for 3 (1d6) rounds or until a creature takes an action to stop the blaze. A creature that starts its turn in the area or that starts its turn covered with burning tar takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.
