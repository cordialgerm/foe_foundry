### Special Abilities

- **Spine Trap:** With 10 minutes of work, the nharyth can create a web of nearly transparent spines in a 20-foot cube. The web must be anchored between two solid masses or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. A web of spines layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. The web is difficult terrain, and the spines forming it are nearly transparent, requiring a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice them.

A creature that starts its turn in the web of spines or that enters the web during its turn must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or 1d4 spines stick to it. At the start of each of its turns, the creature takes 1d4 piercing damage for each spine stuck to it. A creature, including the target, can take its action to remove 1d4 spines. If a creature starts its turn with more than 4 spines stuck to it, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The nharyth can plant up to 24 spines in a web when creating it. Once it has used 24 spines in webs, it must finish a long rest before it can use this trait again.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The nharyth makes two spined slap attacks. Alternatively, it can use Spine Shot twice.
- **Spined Slap:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
- **Spine Shot:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. If the nharyth scores a critical hit, the target doesn’t make a saving throw and is paralyzed until the end of its next turn instead.
