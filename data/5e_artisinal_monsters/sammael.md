### Special Abilities

- **Angelic Weapons:** The sammael's weapon attacks are magical. When the sammael hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).
- **Sacred Duty:** The sammael angel can use its bonus action to shift its purpose between Destructor, Executioner, and Punisher. 
* Destructor. The sammael's purpose is to destroy unholy monuments and statues. Its weapon attacks deal double damage to objects and structures. 
* Executioner. The sammael's purpose is to slay a specific creature. The angel has advantage on attack rolls against a specific creature, chosen by its deity. As long as the angel and the victim are on the same plane of existence, the angel knows the precise location of the creature. 
* Punisher. The sammael's purpose is to punish, but not kill, creatures, inflicting long-term suffering on those of its deity's choosing. A creature reduced to 0 hp by the angel loses 3 (1d6) Charisma as its body is horribly scarred by the deity's retribution. The scars last until the creature is cured by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sammael makes two melee attacks.
- **Greataxe (Executioner Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d12 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.
- **Slam (Destructor Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the angel.
- **Whip (Punisher Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. A creature's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the radiant damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest.
