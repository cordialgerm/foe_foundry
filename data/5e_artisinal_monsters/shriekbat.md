### Special Abilities

- **Echolocation:** The shriekbat can’t use its blindsight while deafened.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The shriekbat makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its talons.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) piercing damage.
- **Talons:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d6 + 7) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the shriekbat can’t use its talons on another target.
- **Shriek (Recharge 5-6):** The shriekbat emits a powerful burst of sound in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also stunned for 1 minute. A stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
