- **Paralyzing Throes:** When the ghul dies, it explodes in a puff of noxious smoke. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
- **Turn Resistance:** The ghul has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.
- **Variable Immunity:** As a bonus action, the ghul changes one of its damage resistances to immunity to that type of damage until the start of its next turn.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The ghulâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: chill touch, fire bolt, ray of frost, shocking grasp
3/day each: fog cloud, rolling thunder, misty step, spire of stone
1/day each: blur, fireball, gaseous form, frozen razors, stinking cloud

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ghul makes two attacks with its claws.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an elf or undead, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
