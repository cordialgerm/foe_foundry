- **Pestilence Aura:** At start of each of hag’s turns each creature within 10 ft. of her takes 4 (1d8) poison. If a creature remains within aura for more than 1 min it contracts disease of hag’s choice (DC 13 Con negates disease). Disease’s save DC is 13 regardless of type.
- **Plague Carrier:** The pesta hag is immune to diseases.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Two Pestilence Rake or Poison Bolt attacks.
- **Pestilence Rake:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage + 5 (2d4) necrotic. Target: DC 13 Con save or its hp max is reduced by amount equal to necrotic taken and it contracts sewer plague sight rot or other disease of hag’s choice. Disease’s save DC 13 regardless of type.
- **Poison Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, 120 ft., one target, 12 (2d8+3) poison.
- **Curative Touch (3/Day):** Touched target magically regains 10 (2d8+1) hp and freed from any disease or poison afflicting it.
- **Summon Plague Rats (1/Day):** Magically calls 1d3 rat swarms. Arrive in 1d4 rounds act as hag allies and obey her spoken commands. Swarms carry a terrible disease. If creature takes damage from swarm’s Bites: DC 10 Con save or contract the disease. Until disease is cured creature can’t regain hp except by magically and target’s hp max decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hrs. If creature’s hp max drops to 0 as a result of this disease it dies. Rats remain 1 hr until hag dies or hag dismisses them as bonus action.
