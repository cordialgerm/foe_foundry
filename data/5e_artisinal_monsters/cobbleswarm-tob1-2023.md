### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the cobbleswarm remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from normal stones.
- **Shifting Floor:** Whenever the cobbleswarm moves into a creature’s space or starts its turn in another creature’s space, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A prone creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to stand up in a space occupied by the swarm.
- **Swarm:** The cobbleswarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny stone. The swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.

### Actions

- **Stings:** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 15 (6d4) piercing damage, or 7 (3d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half its hp or fewer.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shift and Tumble:** The cobbleswarm pushes a prone creature in its space up to 5 feet away from it.
