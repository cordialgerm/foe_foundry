### Special Abilities

- **Cackle:** The skeleton emits a constant, demoralizing cackle. When a creature that isn’t an undead or a construct starts its turn within 30 feet of the cackling skeleton and can hear the skeleton, it must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or feel demoralized by the skeleton’s cackling. A demoralized creature has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn.
- **Turn Vulnerability:** The cackling skeleton has disadvantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

### Actions

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage. The cackling skeleton has advantage on this attack roll if the target is demoralized.
- **Mock (Recharge 5-6):** The cackling skeleton mocks the futile efforts of up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it that aren’t undead or constructs. Each target must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A demoralized target has disadvantage on this saving throw.
