### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The shadow skeleton makes two scimitar attacks.
- **Scimitar:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Finger Darts:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is surrounded by a shadowy aura for 1 minute. While surrounded by the aura, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) necrotic damage when hit by the scimitar attack of a shadow skeleton. Any creature can take an action to extinguish the shadow with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The shadow also extinguishes if the target receives magical healing.
