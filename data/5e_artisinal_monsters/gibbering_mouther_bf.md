### Special Abilities

- **Aberrant Ground.** The ground within 10 feet of the mouther is dough-like difficult terrain. A creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.
- **Aberrant Resilience.** The mouther is resistant to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, and it has advantage on saves against spells or effects that would alter its form.
- **Gibbering.** The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn’t incapacitated. A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther and that can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and must roll a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and moves its full speed in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can’t make such an attack.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The gibbering mouther makes two Bite attacks. If both attacks hit one Medium or smaller creature, the target must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or be knocked prone.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Rend Mind.** One creature the mouther can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and suffer a random, short-term dread effect for 1 minute.

### Bonus Actions

- **Blinding Spittle.** The mouther spits an otherworldly goo at up to two creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
