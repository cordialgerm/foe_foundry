### Special Abilities

- **Brute:** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the chieftain hits with it (included in the attack).
- **Chieftain’s Presence:** Dragons and kobolds within 30 feet of the chieftain can’t be charmed or frightened.
- **Pack Tactics:** The kobold chieftain has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the chieftain’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the kobold chieftain has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The kobold makes three Spear or Shortbow attacks.
- **Spear:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
- **Shortbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Inspiring Shriek (Recharge after Short or Long Rest):** The kobold chieftain shrieks a draconic battle cry. Each creature that isn’t a dragonborn or kobold within 30 feet of the chieftain must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

- **Springspike Shield:** When the kobold chieftain is wielding its shield and is hit by a melee attack within 5 feet of it, the chieftain can fire one of its shield spikes at the attacker. The attacker takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage.
