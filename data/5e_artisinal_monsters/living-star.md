### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The living star has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Resize:** As a bonus action, the living star can change its size. This trait works like the enlarge/reduce spell, except it deals 2d4 extra damage when enlarged and 2d4 less damage when reduced.
- **Starshine:** A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the living star must make a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is blinded for 1 minute. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the living star's Starshine for the next 24 hours.
- **Supernova:** When a living star dies, it erupts, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hp by this damage dies.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The living star makes three starflare attacks. It can use its Silvered Ray in place of one starflare attack.
- **Starflare:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) radiant damage.
- **Silvered Ray:** Ranged Spell Attack: +12 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) radiant damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
