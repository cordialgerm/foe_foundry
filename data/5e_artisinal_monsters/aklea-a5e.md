- **Lightning Bolt (3rd-Level; V, S):** A bolt of lightning 5 feet wide and 100 feet long arcs from the empyrean. Each creature in the area makes a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw  taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success.
- **Flame Strike (5th-Level; V, S):** A column of divine flame fills a 10-foot-radius  40-foot-high cylinder within 60 feet. Creatures in the area make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw  taking 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failure or half damage on a success.
