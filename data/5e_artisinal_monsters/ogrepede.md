### Special Abilities

- **Haphazard Charge:** If the ogrepede moves at least 10 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the attack is treated as though the ogrepede scored a critical hit, but attack rolls against the ogrepede have advantage until the start of its next turn.
- **Overwhelming Assault:** When the ogrepede scores a critical hit, each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the ogrepede for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the ogrepede’s Overwhelming Assault for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ogrepede makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its slam.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage if the ogrepede has half its hp or fewer. If the ogrepede scores a critical hit, it rolls the damage dice three times, instead of twice.
