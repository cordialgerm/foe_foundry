- **Water Breathing:** Can breathe only underwater.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 7 (2d8+3) piercing damage or 12 (2d8+3) piercing damage while puffed up.
- **Spine:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage or 8 (2d4+3) piercing damage while puffed up. Also 5 (2d4) poison (DC 13 Con half). If target fails the save by 5+ it takes 2 (1d4) poison at the end of its next turn.

### Bonus Actions

- **Burst of Speed (Recharges 5–6):** Takes the Dash action.
- **Puff Up (Recharge: Short/Long Rest):** For 1 min it increases in size by filling its stomach with air or water.

If pufferfish lacks the room to become Medium it attains the max size possible in space available.
