### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While motionless indistinguishable from tall branched cactus.
- **Offering of Flesh:** Spends 1 min carefully cutting its own flesh inflicting 10 slashing to itself to remove small piece of pulpy material. Pulp is edible and provides Med or smaller creature 1 quart of water and nourishment equivalent to one meal. Pulp provides nourishment only if drake offered it willingly.
- **Regeneration:** Regains 5 hp at start of its turn. If it takes cold or poison this doesn’t function at start of its next turn. Dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn’t regenerate.
- **Thorny Body:** A creature that touches it or hits it with melee attack while within 5 ft. of it: DC 13 Dex save or take 4 (1d8) piercing damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** One Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 6 (1d6+3) slashing damage.
- **Thorn Spray (Recharge 5–6):** Shakes its body spraying thorns around it. Each creature within 20' of it: 18 (4d8) piercing damage (DC 13 Dex half). A creature that fails by 5+ has its speed reduced by 10 ft. until it uses action to remove thorns. When drake uses this it loses Thorny Body trait until start of its next turn.
