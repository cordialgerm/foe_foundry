### Special Abilities

- **Immutable Form:** The tiger is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The tiger has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Pounce:** If the tiger moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the tiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
- **Reactive Guardian:** The clockwork tiger has two reactions that can be used only for Deflecting Leap.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The clockwork tiger makes one bite and two claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

### Reactions

- **Deflecting Leap:** When the clockwork tiger’s ward is the target of an attack the tiger can see, the tiger can move up to 10 feet toward its ward without provoking opportunity attacks. If it ends this movement within 5 feet of its ward, the tiger becomes the target of the attack instead.
