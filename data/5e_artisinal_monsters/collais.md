### Special Abilities

- **Impale and Toss:** When the colláis hits a Medium or smaller creature with a gore attack, it can use a bonus action to impale and toss the creature. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 11 (2d10) piercing damage and be flung up to 10 feet away from the colláis in a random direction and knocked prone.
- **Magic Resistance:** The colláis has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The colláis makes one gore attack and two hooves attacks.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Hooves:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Cry of the Forest:** The colláis sounds a dreadful and reverberating call. Each creature within 100 feet of the colláis that can hear the cry must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the colláis’s Cry of the Forest for the next 24 hours. Forest-dwelling beasts and monstrosities with an Intelligence of 4 or lower automatically succeed or fail on this saving throw, the colláis’s choice.
