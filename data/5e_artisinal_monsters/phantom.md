- **Sunlight Weakness:** While in sunlight, the phantom has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

### Actions

- **Ghostly Grasp:** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Chilling Moan (Recharge 5-6):** The phantom emits an eerie moan. Each creature within 30 feet that isn't an undead or a construct must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 9 (2d8) cold damage and is frightened until the end of the phantom's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't frightened.
