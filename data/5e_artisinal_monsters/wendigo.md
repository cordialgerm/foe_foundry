### Special Abilities

- **Aura of Starvation:** A creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the wendigo must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed by gnawing cold and crippling hunger for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the wendigo's Aura of Starvation for the next 24 hours.
- **Magic Resistance:** The wendigo has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
