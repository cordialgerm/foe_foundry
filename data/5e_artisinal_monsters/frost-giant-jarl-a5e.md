### Special Abilities

- **Fire Fear:** When the giant takes fire damage, it is rattled until the end of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant makes two melee weapon attacks.
- **Battleaxe:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature  it makes a DC 18 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.
- **Rock:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 37 (9d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature  it makes a DC 18 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure. In lieu of a rock  the giant can throw a grappled Medium or smaller creature up to 40 feet. On a hit  the target and the thrown creature both take 19 (4d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. On a miss  only the thrown creature takes the damage. The thrown creature falls prone in an unoccupied space 5 feet from the target.

### Bonus Actions

- **Grab:** One creature within 5 feet makes a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the giant can't grab another target, and it makes battleaxe attacks with advantage against the grappled target.
- **Stomp (1/Day):** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one prone target. Hit: 13 (3d4 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
- **Icy Gaze:** One creature the giant can see within 60 feet makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 21 (6d6) cold damage, and its Speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage.
