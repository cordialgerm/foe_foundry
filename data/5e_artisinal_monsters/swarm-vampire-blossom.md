### Special Abilities

- **Blood Frenzy:** Has advantage on melee attack rolls vs. any creature that doesn’t have all its hp.
- **Blood Sense:** Can pinpoint by scent location of creatures that aren’t constructs or undead within 30' of it. Swarm is otherwise blind.
- **False Appearance:** While motionless indistinguishable from carpet of flower petals.
- **Swarm:** Can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa and swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny plant. Swarm can’t regain hp or gain temp hp.

### Actions

- **Petal Slashes:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, 0 ft., one creature, in the swarm’s space. 18 (4d8) slashing damage or 9 (2d8) slashing damage if the swarm has half its hp or fewer. Target must make a DC 13 Con save reducing its hp max by an amount equal to damage taken on a failed save or by half as much if made. This reduction lasts until creature finishes a long rest. Target dies if this reduces its hp max to 0.
