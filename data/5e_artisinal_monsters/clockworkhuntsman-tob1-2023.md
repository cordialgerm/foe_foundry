### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The clockwork huntsman doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Explosive Core:** The mechanism that powers the huntsman explodes when the construct is destroyed, projecting superheated steam and shrapnel. Each creature within 5 feet of the huntsman when it is destroyed must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Immutable Form:** The clockwork huntsman is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The clockwork huntsman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The clockwork huntsman makes one Slam attack and two Longsword attacks. It can replace its Slam attack with a Net Cannon attack.
- **Longsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Net Cannon (4/Day):** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 10/20 ft., one target. Hit: If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is restrained. A mechanism within the clockwork huntsman’s chest can fire a net with a 20-foot trailing cable anchored within its chest. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check. Alternatively, dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) frees the creature.

### Bonus Actions

- **Reel:** The clockwork huntsman pulls a creature restrained by its net up to 15 feet straight toward it.
