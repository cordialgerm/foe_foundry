Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the druid retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA modifiers, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
