### Special Abilities

- **Firewalker:** When the cherufe is subjected to fire damage, its speed doubles until the end of its next turn, and it can Dash or Disengage as a bonus action on its next turn.
- **Internal Flame:** A creature that touches the cherufe or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) fire damage. In addition, the cherufe sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The cherufe makes four slam attacks. Alternatively, it can throw two magma balls.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
- **Magma Ball:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) fire damage. Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Fissure:** The cherufe opens a fissure in the ground within 120 feet of it that is 60 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 2d4 x 10 feet deep. Each creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse as if the structure was in the area of an earthquake spell. The cherufe can have only one fissure open at a time. If it opens another, the previous fissure closes, shunting all creatures inside it to the surface.
- **Quake (Recharge 6):** The cherufe slams its fists into the ground, shaking the terrain within 60 feet of it. Each creature standing on the ground in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 45 (10d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.
