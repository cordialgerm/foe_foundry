### Special Abilities

- **Earth Glide:** The apaxrusl can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the apaxrusl doesn’t disturb the material it moves through.
- **Fiendish Construct:** The apaxrusl’s sand is infused with the souls of the damned. Its type is fiend in addition to construct when determining the effects of features such as a paladin’s Divine Smite or a ranger’s Primeval Awareness.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The apaxrusl makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit the same creature, the target is blinded for 1 minute or until it uses an action to wipe its eyes.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Fiery Sands (Recharge 5-6):** Sand whips violently around the apaxrusl. Each creature within 10 feet of the apaxrusl must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) slashing damage and 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Shifting Sands:** The apaxrusl can shift the flowing sands of its body to avoid harm. When the apaxrusl takes damage, roll a d12. Reduce the damage it takes by the number rolled.
