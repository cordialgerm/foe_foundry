### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The manticore makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it makes two Tail Spike attacks. If both Tail Spike attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.

### Reactions

- **Spiky Retaliation.** When a creature the manticore can see hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it, the manticore can jab a spike into the attacker. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or take 5 (2d4) poison damage.
