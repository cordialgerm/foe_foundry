### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the tarrasque fails a save, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Magic Resistance.** The tarrasque has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.
- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The tarrasque is resistant to exhaustion.
- **Reflective Hide.** Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target.
- **Siege Behemoth.** The tarrasque deals triple damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The tarrasque uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack, four Claw attacks, and one Spiked Tail attack, or it makes five Acid Spit attacks.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 27 DEX save or be swallowed by the tarrasque. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effect outside of the tarrasque, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque’s turns.
- **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.
- **Spiked Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and 13 (3d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 27 STR save or be knocked prone.
- **Acid Spit.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (6d10 + 3) acid damage.
- **Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the tarrasque’s choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 27 WIS save or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s save is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

### Legendary Actions

The tarrasque can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The tarrasque regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

- **Detect.** The tarrasque automatically detects every creature and trap within 60 feet of it, pinpointing the current location of each.
- **Move.** The tarrasque moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Tail Attack.** The tarrasque makes one Tail attack.
- **Tail Swipe (Costs 2 Actions).** The tarrasque whips its spiked tail in a wide arc, flailing it in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 27 DEX save. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8) piercing damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.

### Regional Effects

- **1d10** If the tarrasque dies, these effects fade in  days, except for Food Aplenty, which fades within 1 year.
