### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The millitaur makes two Handaxe attacks.
- **Handaxe:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.
- **Poisonous Flask (Recharge 5–6):** The millitaur hastily combines alchemical substances into a poisonous concoction and throws it at a point the millitaur can see within 30 feet. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Healing Tonic (2/Day):** The millitaur administers a healing tonic to a willing creature within 5 feet of it. The target magically regains 7 (2d6) hp and is freed from any disease or poison.
