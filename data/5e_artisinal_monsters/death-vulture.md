### Special Abilities

- **Awful Stench:** The vulture has a disgusting body odor. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the vulture must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.
- **Keen Sight and Smell:** The vulture has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.
- **Pack Tactics:** The vulture has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the vulture’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The death vulture makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.
- **Beak:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Talons:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Decaying Breath (Recharge 6):** The vulture breathes necrotic energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail this saving throw by 5 or more also age a number of years equal to half the damage taken.
