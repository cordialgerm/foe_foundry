### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The algorith doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Immutable Form:** The algorith is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

### Actions

- **Logic Razor:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) force damage.
- **Cone of Negation (Recharge 5–6):** The algorith projects null energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 33 (6d10) force damage and any spell of 4th level or lower on the creature ends, as if it had been the target of a dispel magic spell. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and spells on it don’t end.
- **Reality Bomb (5/Day):** The algorith summons and throws a tiny rune of law at a point it can see within 100 feet. The rune explodes on impact. Each creature within 30 feet of where the rune landed must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 27 (5d10) force damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.
- **Spellcasting:** The algorith casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16): <br>At will: bless, detect magic, dimension door, dispel magic<br>1/day each: commune (as an action), wall of force
