- **Sword Sweep (1/Day, While Bloodied):** The giant makes a greatsword attack against each creature within 10 feet.
- **Ignite Blades (1/Day):** The greatswords of each fire giant of the giants choice within 30 feet magically kindle into flame. For the next minute  each of their greatsword attacks deal an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Pillar of Flame (1/Day):** Each creature within a 10-foot-radius  40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 60 feet that the fire giant can see makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw  taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Unattended flammable objects are ignited.

### Reactions

On a failure, it takes 14 (3d4 + 7) bludgeoning damage, is pushed up to 20 feet from the giant, and falls prone.
