### Special Abilities

- **Honeyed Weapons:** Radiant, magical honey drips from the Bear King’s paws and coats his weapons, making his weapon attacks magical. When the Bear King hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).
- **Keen Smell:** The Bear King has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the Bear King fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.
- **Regeneration (Bear or Hybrid Form only):** The Bear King regains 10 hp at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hp.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The Bear King makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or he makes three Maul or Honey Bolt attacks. If two Maul attacks hit one Large or smaller creature, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Bite (Bear or Hybrid Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) radiant damage. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) radiant damage at the start of each of its turns, as radiant honey sticks to the wound. Any creature can take an action to remove the honey from the wound with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The honey dissolves if the target receives magical healing.

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape:** The Bear King transforms into a Large brown bear, or a Large bear-Humanoid hybrid, or back into his true form, which is Fey. His statistics other than his size, are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. The Bear King reverts to his true form if he dies.
- **Move:** The Bear King moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Honey Toss:** The Bear King throws a jar of magical honey at a creature he can see within 120 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by sticky honey until the end of its next turn.
- **Frightful Roar (Costs 2 Actions):** The Bear King lets out a blood-curdling roar. Each hostile creature within 60 feet of the Bear King and that can hear the roar must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.
