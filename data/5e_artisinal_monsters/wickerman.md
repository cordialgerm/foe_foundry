### Special Abilities

- **Berserk:** If the staff controlling the wickerman is broken or is not being worn or carried by a humanoid, the wickerman goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the wickerman attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the wickerman attacks an object with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the wickerman goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed, until a new staff is created, or until the staff is worn or carried by a humanoid.
- **Blazing Fury:** A creature that touches the wickerman or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. If the wickerman's flame is ever doused, it is incapacitated until the flame is rekindled by dealing at least 10 fire damage to it.
- **Water Susceptibility:** If the wickerman is on fire, it takes 1 cold damage for every 5 feet it moves in water or for every gallon of water splashed on it. If the wickerman takes at least 100 points of cold damage within a 1 minute period, its flame is doused.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The wickerman makes two slam attacks.
- **Blazing Ray:** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (5d10) fire damage.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (1d10) fire damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). The wickerman has two fists, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Imprison:** The wickerman makes one slam attack against a target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is imprisoned inside its burning body, and the grapple ends. A creature imprisoned in the wickerman is blinded, restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the wickerman, and it takes 17 (5d6) fire damage at the start of each of the wickerman's turns. Up to 6 Medium or smaller creatures can fit inside a wickerman's body. If the wickerman takes 25 damage or more from a creature inside of it, the wickerman must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or the creature bursts free from it. The creature falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the wickerman. If the wickerman dies, all creatures inside of it are no longer restrained by it and can escape from the burning corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.
