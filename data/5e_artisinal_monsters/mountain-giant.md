A mountain giant can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The mountain giant regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Roar (Costs 2 Actions):** The mountain giant emits a tremendous growl. Each creature within 20 feet of the giant must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.
- **Spawn Elemental (Costs 3 Actions):** A piece of the mountain giant's body tears away in the form of an earth elemental. The earth elemental acts on the same initiative count as the mountain giant, obeying the mountain giant's commands and fighting until destroyed. The mountain giant can have no more than five earth elementals under its control at one time.
