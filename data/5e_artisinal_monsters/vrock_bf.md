### Special Abilities

- **Demonic Resilience.** The vrock is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage. In addition, it is immune to poison damage and to the poisoned condition.
- **Magic Resistance.** The vrock has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The vrock makes one Beak attack and two Talon attacks.
- **Beak.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Talon.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Wing Spores (Recharge 5–6).** The vrock shakes a cloud of toxic spores from its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 15 CON save. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. While poisoned, a creature takes 3 (1d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A poisoned creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the poisoned creature also ends the effect on it.

### Bonus Actions

- **Startling Screech.** The vrock emits a horrific screech at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 CON save or be able to take either an action or bonus action on its turn, not both, and it can’t take reactions.
