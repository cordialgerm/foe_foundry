### Special Abilities

- **Death Burst.** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of lava. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the mephit, knocked prone, and catch on fire. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the creature on fire takes 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
- **False Appearance.** While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary mound of molten rock.

### Actions

- **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Lob Magma.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Pyroclastic Burst (Recharge 6).** The mephit exhales an explosive blast of lava in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 11 STR save. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) fire damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the mephit and knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.

### Bonus Actions

- **Pyrotechnic Display (1/Day).** The mephit casts the color spray spell (spell save DC 11), requiring no material components and using CHA as the spellcasting ability.
