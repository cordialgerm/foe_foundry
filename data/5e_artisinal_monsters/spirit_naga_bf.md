### Special Abilities

- **Guardian Projection.** The spirit naga’s skeletal form is covered with a magical illusion that makes it look like the guardian naga it was in life. The naga can use a bonus action to dismiss this illusion until the end of its next turn.
- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The naga is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Necrotic Strikes.** The naga’s weapon attacks are magical. When the naga hits with any weapon attack, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 necrotic damage (included in the attack).
- **Rejuvenation.** If it dies, the naga returns to life in 1d6 days, regaining all its HP and becoming active again. Only a wish spell can prevent this trait from functioning.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The spirit naga makes two Bite or Spit Poison attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 14 CON save or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage and 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.
- **Spit Poison.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d4 + 3) poison damage plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.
- **Spellcasting.** The spirit naga casts one of the following spells, requiring only verbal components and using CHA as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14).
	- At will: command, mage hand, minor illusion
	- 3/day each: augury (as an action), charm, sleep
	- 2/day each: bestow curse, hold
	- 1/day: dominate

### Bonus Actions

- **Hidden Step.** The spirit naga magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see and takes the Hide action.
