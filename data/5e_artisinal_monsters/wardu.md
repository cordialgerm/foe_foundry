### Special Abilities

- **Flyby:** The wardu doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.
- **Magic Resistance:** The wardu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The wardu uses its Segmented Gaze. It then makes two proboscis attacks.
- **Proboscis:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the wardu regains hp equal to half the damage dealt. If the target is a spellcaster, the target has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain its concentration until the end of its next turn.
- **Segmented Gaze:** The wardu’s segmented central eye flares with unstable magical energy. One creature the wardu can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random condition until the end of its next turn. Roll a d4 to determine the condition: blinded (1), frightened (2), deafened (3), or incapacitated (4).
