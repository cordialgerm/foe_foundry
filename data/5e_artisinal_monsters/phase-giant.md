### Special Abilities

- **Ethereal Jaunt:** As a bonus action, the phase giant can magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying shifts with it. A creature grappled by the phase giant doesnâ€™t shift with it, and the grapple ends if the phase giant shifts while grappling a creature.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant makes two attacks with its spiked fists. If both attacks hit a Large or smaller target, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take 7 (2d6) piercing damage as the giant impales the target on its body spikes.
- **Spiked Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). The phase giant has two fists, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Rock:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
