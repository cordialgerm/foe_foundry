### Special Abilities

- **Abyssal Rejuvenation.** Unlike other outsiders, a dretch that dies in its home plane of the Abyss is restored in a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its HP and becoming active again. The new body appears in a random location in the Abyss. Only sprinkling holy water on the dretch’s remains can prevent this trait from functioning.
- **Demonic Resilience.** The dretch is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage. In addition, it is immune to poison damage and to the poisoned condition.

### Actions

- **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) poison damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Fetid Cloud (1/Day).** A 10-foot radius cloud of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The cloud’s area is lightly obscured and lasts 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. A creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can’t take reactions.
