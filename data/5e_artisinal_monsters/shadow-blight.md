### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the shadow blight remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from the stump of a dead tree.

### Actions

- **Frozen Shadow Tendril:** Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) cold damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.
- **Animate Plants (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** The shadow blight magically animates 1d4 plants within 60 feet of it, turning them into awakened shrubs under its control. These plants' attacks deal an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. If the shrubs are not destroyed before 1 hour passes, they become new shadow blights.
