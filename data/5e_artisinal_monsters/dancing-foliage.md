### Special Abilities

- **Evasion:** If the dancing foliage is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the dancing foliage instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- **False Appearance:** While the dancing foliage remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a flowering shrub or small tree.
- **Nimble Dance:** The dancing foliage can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dancing foliage makes four attacks with its serrated leaves.
- **Serrated Leaves:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Flower Dance (Recharge 4-6):** The dancing foliage uses one of the following flower dances: <br>* Alluring Dance. The dancing foliage sways, releasing scintillating petals. Up to three creatures of the foliageâ€™s choice that can see the petals and that are within 20 feet of the foliage must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 as it watches the swirling and falling petals. The effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake it out of its stupor. <br>* Serrated Dance. The dancing foliage whirls a flurry of serrated leaves around itself. Each creature within 10 feet of the dancing foliage must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) slashing damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Shower of Petals:** When a creature the dancing foliage can see targets it with an attack, it releases a shower of flower petals, giving the attacker disadvantage on that attack roll.
