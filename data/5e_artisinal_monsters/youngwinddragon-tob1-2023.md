### Special Abilities

- **Elusive:** The dragon has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid or escape an effect that would reduce its speed or grapple or restrain it.
- **Storm Sight:** The dragon can see through areas obscured by fog, mist, clouds, or precipitation.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Tempest Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales a blast of stormy wind in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone. Unprotected flames, such as torches, in the area are extinguished, and protected flames, such as those in lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.
