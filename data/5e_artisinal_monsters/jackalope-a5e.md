### Special Abilities

- **Evasion:** If the jackalope is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the jackalope instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- **Keen Hearing:** The jackalope has advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing.
- **Mimicry:** The jackalope can imitate sounds it hears frequently, such as a simple phrase or an animal noise. Recognizing the sounds as imitation requires a DC 14 Insight check.

### Actions

- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8+4) piercing damage. If the jackalope moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack  the attack deals an extra 7 (2d6) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Nimble Escape:** The jackalope takes the Disengage or Hide action.

### Reactions

- **Uncanny Dodge:** When an attacker the jackalope can see hits it with an attack, the jackalope halves the attacks damage against it.
