### Special Abilities

- **Fey Resilience.** The sprite is resistant to the charmed and unconscious conditions.
- **Speak with** Beasts and Plants. The sprite can communicate with Beasts and Plants as if they shared a language.

### Actions

- **Shortsword** . Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Shortbow** . Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be poisoned for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
- **Invisibility.** The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.

### Bonus Actions

- **Heart Sight.** The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature’s current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 13 CHA save, the sprite also knows if the creature has malign intentions or intends to commit malevolent acts within the next hour. Celestials, Fiends, and Undead automatically fail the save.
- **Swift Flight.** The sprite moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
