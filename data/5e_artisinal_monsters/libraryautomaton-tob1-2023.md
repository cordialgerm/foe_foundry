### Special Abilities

- **Bibliophile:** The library automaton understands any written language it can see, provided it is touching the surface on which the words are written.
- **Bibliotelekinesis:** The library automaton is surrounded by an invisible, shapeless, magical force that can perform simple tasks at the automaton’s command. This force has a Strength equal to the automaton’s Strength, and it can interact with objects up to 15 feet away from the automaton. The automaton can use this force to perform simple tasks that a Small humanoid with two hands could do, such as opening a door, moving a bookshelf’s ladder, picking up and organizing books, and similar tasks. The automaton can’t use this force to make attacks or wield a weapon or shield.
- **Book Safekeeper:** The library automaton’s body contains a small, extradimensional space. This space can hold up to 100 pounds of Small or smaller objects. This space can hold only books, scrolls, parchment, or other written works on paper or other paper- or wood-like materials. The automaton is the only creature capable of retrieving items from this space while it is alive. If the automaton is destroyed, the objects within its extradimensional space are ejected into an unoccupied space nearest it.
- **Construct Nature:** The library automaton doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
