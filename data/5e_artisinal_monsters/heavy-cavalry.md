### Special Abilities

- **Cavalry Charge:** If the dragonborn moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature while mounted and then hits with a lance attack on the same turn, it can make a trample attack against that creature as a bonus action.
- **Locked Saddle:** The dragonborn can't be knocked prone, dismounted, or moved against its will while mounted.
- **Mounted Warrior:** The dragonborn is rarely seen without its giant lizard mount. The lizard wears custom scale mail that raises its Armor Class to 15. While the dragonborn is mounted, the giant lizard can't be charmed or frightened.

### Actions

- **Lance:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d12 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Heavy Crossbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage.
- **Trample (Mounted Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Fire Breath (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** The dragonborn breathes fire in a 15-foot cone. All creatures in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
