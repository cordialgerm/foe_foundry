### Special Abilities

- **Ground Disruptor:** When the glacier behemoth moves, it can choose to make the area it moves through difficult terrain. When it uses Inexorable Charge, it automatically makes the ground difficult terrain.
- **Unstoppable:** Difficult terrain composed of ice, rocks, sand, or natural vegetation, living or dead, doesn’t cost the glacier behemoth extra movement. Its speed can’t be reduced by any effect.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The glacier behemoth makes two bite attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 33 (4d12 + 7) piercing damage.
- **Inexorable Charge:** If the glacier behemoth moves at least 10 feet, it can then use this action to continue moving in a 40-foot line that is 15 feet wide. Each creature in this line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone. The glacier behemoth’s movement along this line doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
