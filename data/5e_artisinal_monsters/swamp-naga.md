### Special Abilities

- **Cloud of Insects:** A cloud of biting and stinging insects surrounds the swamp naga. A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the naga must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, it takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the insect cloud for 1 minute. As a bonus action, the naga can disperse the cloud for 1 minute.
- **Rejuvenation:** If it dies, the swamp naga returns to life in 1d6 days and regains all its hp. Only a wish spell or removing the naga from its swamp for 1 year can prevent this trait from functioning.
- **Insect and Serpent Passivism:** No insects or serpents can willingly attack the swamp naga. They can be forced to do so through magical means.
- **Spellcasting:** The swamp naga is an 8th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks), and it needs only verbal components to cast its spells. It knows the following sorcerer spells:
Cantrips (at will): dancing lights, mage hand, message, poison spray
1st level (4 slots): charm person, fog cloud, silent image, sleep
2nd level (3 slots): blindness/deafness, hold person, suggestion
3rd level (3 slots): hypnotic pattern, stinking cloud, water breathing
4th level (2 slots): blight

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) poison damage.
- **Constrict:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the naga can’t constrict another target.
