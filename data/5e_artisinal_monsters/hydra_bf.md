### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath.** The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.
- **Multiple Heads.** The hydra has five heads and is resistant to the blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and unconscious conditions.
- **Reactive Heads.** For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.
- **Wakeful.** While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The hydra makes as many Bite attacks as it has heads.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Noxious Breath (Recharge Special).** The hydra exhales poisonous gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 CON save, taking 40 (9d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While the hydra has five or more heads, this action has a recharge of 6. The recharge range increases for each head the hydra has below five. For example, a hydra that starts its turn with two heads can recharge this feature on a 3, 4, 5, or 6.

### Bonus Actions

- **Bloody Burst (Has Fewer Than Five Heads).** The hydra squeezes the stumps of its severed heads, spraying blood and gore. Each creature within 5 feet of the hydra must succeed on a DC 16 CON save or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn and poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
