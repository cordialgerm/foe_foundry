### Special Abilities

- **Spore Death:** When the zombie is reduced to 0 hp and doesn't survive with its Undead Fortitude, it explodes in a cloud of spores. Each creature within 5 feet of the zombie must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and contract iumenta pox (see Iumenta Pox sidebar).
- **Undead Fortitude:** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hp, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hp instead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The zombie makes two slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Plague Breath (Recharge 6):** The zombie breathes a cloud of spores in 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and contract iumenta pox (see Iumenta Pox sidebar).
