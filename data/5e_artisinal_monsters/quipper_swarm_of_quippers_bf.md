- **Swarm Resilience.** The swarm is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it is immune to the charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned conditions.

### Actions

- **Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. Hit: 18 (4d8) piercing damage, or 9 (2d8) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its HP or fewer, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or have its flesh shredded by the attack. A creature with shredded flesh loses 4 (1d8) HP at the start of each of its turns as the wound bleeds profusely. Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 10 WIS (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
