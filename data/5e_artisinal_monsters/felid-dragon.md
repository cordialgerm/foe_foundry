### Special Abilities

- **Flyby:** The felid dragon doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.
- **Keen Smell:** The felid dragon has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
- **Magic Resistance:** The felid dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Pounce:** If the felid dragon moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the felid dragon can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The felid dragon can use its Deafening Roar. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage, and, if the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns as a piece of the claw breaks off in the wound. Each time the dragon hits the target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound each round increases by 3 (1d6). Any creature can take an action to remove the claw with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The claw pops out of the wound if the target receives magical healing.
- **Deafening Roar:** Each creature within 60 feet of the dragon and that can hear it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Deafening Roar for the next 24 hours.
- **Sickening Bile (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon coughs up partially digested food and slimy bile in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 70 (20d6) poison damage and is coated in bile. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t coated in bile. While coated in bile, a creature is poisoned. A creature, including the target coated in bile, can use its action to remove the bile, ending the poisoned condition.
