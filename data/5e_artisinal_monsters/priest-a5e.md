### Special Abilities

- **Spellcasting:** The priest is a 5th level spellcaster. Their spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13
 +5 to hit with spell attacks). They have the following cleric spells prepared:
 Cantrips (at will): light
 sacred flame
 thaumaturgy
 1st-level (4 slots): ceremony
 detect evil and good
 guiding bolt
 healing word
 2nd-level (3 slots): lesser restoration
 zone of truth
 3rd-level (2 slots): dispel magic
 spirit guardians

### Actions

- **Mace:** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage. On a hit  the priest can expend a spell slot to deal 7 (2d6) radiant damage  plus an extra 3 (1d6) radiant damage for each level of the spell slot expended above 1st.
- **Sacred Flame (Cantrip; V, S):** One creature the priest can see within 60 feet makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw  taking 9 (2d8) radiant damage on a failure. This spell ignores cover.
- **Guiding Bolt (1st-Level; V, S):** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) radiant damage  and the next attack roll made against the target before the end of the priests next turn has advantage.
- **Dispel Magic (3rd-Level; V, S):** The priest scours the magic from one creature  object  or magical effect within 120 feet that they can see. A spell ends if it was cast with a 3rd-level or lower spell slot. For spells using a 4th-level or higher spell slot  the priest makes a Wisdom ability check (DC 10 + the spells level) for each one  ending the effect on a success.
- **Spirit Guardians (3rd-Level; V, S, M, Concentration):** Spectral forms surround the priest in a 10-foot radius for 10 minutes. The priest can choose creatures they can see to be unaffected by the spell. Other creatures treat the area as difficult terrain  and when a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there  it makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw  taking 10 (3d6) radiant or necrotic damage (priests choice) on a failure or half damage on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Healing Word (1st-Level; V):** The priest or a living creature within 60 feet regains 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points. The priest can't cast this spell and a 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.
