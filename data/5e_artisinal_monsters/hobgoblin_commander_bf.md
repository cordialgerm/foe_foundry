### Bonus Actions

- **Martial Tactics.** The hobgoblin commander employs one of the following tactics:
	- Emboldening Shout. One friendly creature within 30 feet of the hobgoblin commander that it can see gains 7 (2d6) temporary HP until the start of the commander’s next turn.

The target can use its reaction to move up to half its speed in the direction of the commander’s choosing. This movement for both creatures is unaffected by difficult terrain and doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
