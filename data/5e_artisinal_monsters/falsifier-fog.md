### Special Abilities

- **Enveloping Fog:** The falsifier fog can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the falsifier fog can move through any opening as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. The fog’s space is lightly obscured, and a creature in the fog’s space has threequarters cover against attacks and other effects outside the fog.
- **False Appearance:** While the falsifier fog hovers motionlessly, it is indistinguishable from ordinary fog.
- **Horrific Illusions:** A creature that starts its turn in the falsifier fog’s space must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of its next turn, as it sees visions of its worst fears within the fog. While frightened, a creature’s speed is reduced to 0. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is afflicted with short-term madness.
- **Limited Telepathy:** The falsifier fog can communicate telepathically with any creature in its space.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The falsifier fog makes two chill attacks.
- **Chill:** Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target in the fog’s space. Hit: 10 (3d6) cold damage.
- **Reaching Phantasms (Recharge 5-6):** The phantasmal images within the falsifier fog reach outward. Each creature within 10 feet of the fog must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures in the fog’s space have disadvantage on the saving throw.
