### Special Abilities

- **Elemental Affinity:** The dragonleaf tree has immunity to a type of damage based on the type of dragon that grew it: acid ([black, copper), cold (silver, white), fire (brass, gold, red), lightning (blue, bronze), or poison (green).
- **Eternally Loyal:** The dragonleaf tree has advantage on ability checks and saving throws against influence or effects that would encourage it or force it to act against its draconic master. If charmed or controlled and directed to act against its master, the tree can immediately repeat the effect’s saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon leaf tree makes three Slam or Throw Leaves attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) damage of the type noted in the Elemental Affinity trait.

- **Elemental Leaves (Recharge 6):** The dragonleaf tree’s leaves rain acid, shed bolts of lightning, shake loose icicles, or similarly emit the elemental energies of the dragon that grew the tree.
