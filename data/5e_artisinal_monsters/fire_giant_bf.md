### Special Abilities

- **Giant Attributes.** The fire giant is resistant to the stunned condition, and it is vulnerable to the prone condition.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The fire giant makes two Flaming Greatsword or Lava Boulder attacks.
- **Flaming Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (6d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) fire damage.
- **Lava Boulder.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) fire damage.
- **Volcanic Burst (Recharge 5–6).** The fire giant expels built-up heat from within itself, sending a blast of lava outward. Each creature within 15 feet of the fire giant must make a DC 16 DEX save. On a failure, a creature takes 36 (8d8) fire damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone. A creature that fails this save has disadvantage on the next save it makes against the giant’s Pyroclastic Surge before the start of the giant’s next turn.

### Bonus Actions

- **Pyroclastic Surge.** A burst of volcanic gas and rock fragments flows in a 60-foot-line that is 5 feet wide from the fire giant’s outstretched hand. Each creature in the line must succeed on a DC 16 DEX save or be poisoned until the end of its next turn and pushed up to 15 feet away from the giant. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more is petrified in volcanic ash for 1 hour or until a creature spends 1 minute soaking the petrified creature in cool water.
