### Special Abilities

- **Faerie Form:** The knight can magically change its size between Medium and Tiny as an action. While tiny, the bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by the knights attacks is halved. Additionally, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and advantage on Dexterity checks. Its statistics are otherwise unchanged.
- **Faerie Light:** As a bonus action, the knight can cast dim light for 30 feet, or extinguish its glow.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The knight makes two melee attacks.
- **Glittering Scimitar:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold  fire  or lightning damage (its choice).
- **Longbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points  the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour  even if it regains hit points  and it is asleep while poisoned in this way.
- **Fey Glamour:** The knight targets one humanoid within 30 feet. The target makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  it is magically charmed by the knight for 1 day. If the knight or one of the knights allies harms the target  the target repeats the saving throw  ending the effect on itself on a success. If a targets saving throw is successful  or if the effect ends for it  the creature is immune to this knights Fey Charm for a year and a day.

### Reactions

- **Natures Shield:** When the knight would be hit by an attack while the knight is within 5 feet of a tree or other large plant, the knights AC magically increases by 3 against that attack as the plant interposes branches or vines between the knight and the attacker.
