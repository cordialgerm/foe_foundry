### Special Abilities

- **Aura of Life:** When an undead creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the bloom, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be turned until the end of its next turn.
- **Blessed Regrowth:** At the start of each of the ecstatic bloom's turns, the bloom and each good-aligned creature, including the bloom, within 10 feet of it regains 4 (1d8) hp. If the bloom takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the bloom's next turn. The ecstatic bloom dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn't regain hp from this trait.
- **Foster the Trees:** Alabaster trees within 60 feet of the ecstatic bloom have advantage on all saving throws.
- **Like Calls to Like:** The ecstatic bloom knows if a creature within 120 feet of it is good-aligned or not.

- **Castigate (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** The bloom summons a chorus of booming celestial voices that descend into the minds of nearby creatures. Each creature within 30 feet of the bloom must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. Castigate only affects non-good-aligned creatures with an Intelligence of 5 or higher.
