### Special Abilities

- **Necrotic Weapons:** The ushabti’s weapon attacks are magical. When the ushabti hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage (included in the attack).
- **Regeneration:** The ushabti regains 5 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hp.
- **Swarm Body:** The corrupted ushabti is a spirit inhabiting a colony of scarabs around a Humanoid skeleton within funerary wrappings. It can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny scarab and Humanoid bones, and it can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp, except for its Regeneration trait.
- **Undead Nature:** The ushabti doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The corrupted ushabti makes two Ceremonial Greatsword attacks.
- **Ceremonial Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Vomit Swarm (Recharge 5–6):** The corrupted ushabti exhales scarabs in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 25 (10d4) piercing damage and is covered in scarabs. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t covered in scarabs. A creature covered in scarabs takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature, including the covered creature, can take its action to brush the scarabs off the covered creature by succeeding on a DC 15 Dexterity check.
