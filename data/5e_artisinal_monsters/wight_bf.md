### Special Abilities

- **Martial Adept.** A manufactured weapon, such as a sword or bow, deals one extra die of its damage when the wight hits with it (included in the attack).
- **Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the wight has disadvantage on attack rolls, and its Perception is 8 when perceiving by sight.
- **Undead Nature.** The wight doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Undead Resilience.** The wight is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The wight makes two Longsword or Longbow attacks. It can replace one attack with a Life Drain attack.
- **Life Drain.** Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or its HP maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its HP maximum to 0.
- **zombie** A Humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a  under the wight’s control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve s under its control at one time.
- **Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.
- **Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Command Horde.** The wight commands up to five friendly skeletons or zombies to do one of the following:
	- Protect. Until the start of the wight’s next turn, each time a friendly creature within 5 feet of a target is attacked, the target can use its reaction to intercept the attack, becoming the target instead.
	- Overwhelm. Until the start of the wight’s next turn, each target has advantage on attack rolls against a creature on its turn if at least one other target is within 5 feet of the creature and the allied target isn’t incapacitated.
	- Shamble. Each target uses its reaction to move up to its speed in a direction chosen by the wight. If this movement provokes an opportunity attack, that attack is made with disadvantage.
