### Special Abilities

- **Aristocratic Disguise:** An arachnocrat in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a humanoid aristocrat.
- **Devil’s Sight:** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the arachnocrat’s darkvision.
- **Magic Resistance:** The arachnocrat has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Speak with Spiders:** The arachnocrat can communicate with spiders and other arachnids as if they shared a language.
- **Spider Climb:** The arachnocrat can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The arachnocrat makes two claw attacks. If both claws hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is restrained in gilded webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 13 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; hp 8; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. The skin of a creature that dies while poisoned takes on a golden hue.
