### Special Abilities

- **Dark Devotion:** The dark voice has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
- **Regeneration:** The dark voice regains 5 hp at the start of its turn if it is in an area of dim light or darkness. The dark voice only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn't regenerate.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the dark voice has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dark voice makes two attacks with its mace.
- **Mace:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.
- **Heavy Crossbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d10) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.
- **Whispers of Shadow (Recharge 5-6):** The dark voice speaks in Umbral, whispering of what it sees beyond the dark. The area within 30 feet of the dark voice becomes dimly lit until the end of the dark voice's next turn. Only sunlight can illuminate the area brightly during this time. Each non-dark folk creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or take 13 (3d8) psychic damage and be frightened until the start of its next turn.
