### Special Abilities

- **Combat Tunneler:** If two elite kobolds wielding any combination of picks and shovels combine their efforts, they gain a burrow speed of 15 feet through non-rocky soil.
- **Pack Tactics:** The kobold has advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of the kobold's allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally isn't incapacitated.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Mining Pick:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Sling:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Lantern Splash (Recharge 5-6):** The elite kobold opens its miner's lantern and splashes burning oil in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Small but Fierce:** Two elite kobolds within 5 feet of each other can combine their actions to slam their mining picks into the ground and split the earth in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide, extending from one of the pair. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.
