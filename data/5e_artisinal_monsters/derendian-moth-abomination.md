### Special Abilities

- **Antennae:** The Derendian moth abomination has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
- **Assimilation:** The Derendian moth abomination has six tentacles. Whenever it takes 30 or more damage in a single turn, one of its tentacles is shorn from its body. Whenever a non-undead creature drops to 0 hit points within 200 feet of the Derendian moth abomination, it can use its reaction to sprout one additional tentacle, up to a maximum of ten. Additional tentacles atrophy after one day.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the Derendian moth abomination fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Magic Weapons:** The Derendian moth abomination’s weapon attacks are magical.
- **Unbound:** The Derendian moth abomination’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the moth’s speed nor cause it to be paralyzed or restrained.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The Derendian moth abomination makes a number of tentacle attacks equal to the number of tentacles it currently possesses, and one beak attack.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage.
- **Beak:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d10) piercing damage.
- **Wings of the Primal Tender (1/Day):** The Derendian moth abomination teleports to an unoccupied location within 100 feet, leaving a shimmering outline of its wings in its former location. The shimmering wings flap violently before exploding in a rainbowcolored dust cloud covering a 60-foot radius. Any creature caught in the dust cloud must make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points. Creatures reduced to 0 hit points from this effect regenerate 10 hit points at the beginning of their next three turns.

The Derendian moth abomination can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Spent legendary actions are regained at the start of each turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The abomination makes a Perception check.
- **Pursue:** The abomination moves its flying speed.
- **Lay Eggs (Costs 2 Actions):** The Derendian moth abomination ejects a sticky mass of eggs within 5 feet of itself. At the beginning of the abomination’s next turn, the eggs hatch as a swarm of insects that attacks the abomination’s enemies.
