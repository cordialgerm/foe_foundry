### Actions

- **Poison Needle:** Melee Weapon Attack. +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Poison Dart:** Ranged Weapon Attack. +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Spore Cloud:** (Recharge 5-6). The wirbeln ejects spores in a 15foot cone. All creatures that are not wirbeln fungi must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) poison damage and be subject to one of the following effects for 1 minute, depending on the wirbeln's color: green is poisoned; red is blinded; yellow is incapacitated; blue is paralyzed; purple is frightened; and black is 5 (2d4) poison damage each round. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
