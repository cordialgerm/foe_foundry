### Special Abilities

- **Hatred:** Deprived of parental bonds, the unhatched despise those who nurture and heal others. The unhatched has advantage on attacks against a creature whose most recent action was to heal, restore, strengthen, or otherwise aid another creature.
- **Minor Magic Resistance (3/Day):** As a bonus action, the unhatched gives itself advantage on its next saving throw against spells or other magical effects.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The unhatchedâ€˜s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:
At will: chill touch, minor illusion
1/day: bane

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The unhatched makes one bite attack and one claw attack.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d6 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.
- **Desiccating Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales a cloud of choking dust infused with necrotic magic in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature who fails this save can't speak until the end of its next turn as it chokes on the dust.
