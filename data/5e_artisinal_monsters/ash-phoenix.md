### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the ash phoenix hovers and remains motionless, except for drifting on air currents, it is indistinguishable from a normal cloud of ash and smoke.
- **Rejuvenation:** If the ash phoenix’s birth site hasn’t been purified by holy rites, a destroyed ash phoenix gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of its birth site.
- **Shadow Stealth:** While in dim light or darkness, the ash phoenix can take the Hide action as a bonus action.
- **Wind Weakness:** While in an area of strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour), the ash phoenix has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ash phoenix makes two ash talon attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the phoenix plunges its beak into the target, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The ash phoenix regains hp equal to half the necrotic damage dealt.
- **Ash Talons:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Ash Storm (Recharge 5-6):** The ash phoenix furiously beats its wings, throwing clinging ash into a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded.
