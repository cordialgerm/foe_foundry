- **Home in the Wilds.** The wild warrior automatically discerns true north when outside, and checks to follow its tracks in forest, grassland, hills, or mountain terrain have disadvantage, unless the wild warrior chooses to leave obvious signs of its passage.
- **Pack Tactics.** The wild warrior has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the warrior’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

- **Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, or 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Bonus Actions

- **Quick Trap.** The wild warrior cobbles together a makeshift trap with materials at hand and throws the trap at a creature it can see within 15 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or be restrained until the end of its next turn.
