### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The pixie has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The pixieâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: vicious mockery
1/day each: bestow curse, charm person, confusion, detect thoughts, dispel magic, fire bolt, hideous laughter, ray of enfeeblement, suggestion

### Actions

- **Confusion Touch:** The pixie touches one creature. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or use its reaction to make one melee attack against one of its allies within 5 feet. If it has no allies within 5 feet, the creature attacks itself.
- **Superior Invisibility:** The pixie magically turns invisible until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the pixie wears or carries is invisible with it.
