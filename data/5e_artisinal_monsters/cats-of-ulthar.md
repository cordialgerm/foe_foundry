### Special Abilities

- **Feline Terror:** Each creature in the swarm must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the swarm's Feline Terror for the next 24 hours.
- **Keen Senses:** The swarm has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, hearing, or smell.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny cat. The swarm can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.

### Actions

- **Bites:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., up to two creatures in the swarm's space. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or 7 (2d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
