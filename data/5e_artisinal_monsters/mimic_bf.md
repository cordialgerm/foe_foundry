### Special Abilities

- **Adhesive (Object Form Only).** The mimic adheres to anything that touches it. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 13). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.
- **False Appearance (Object Form Only).** While the mimic remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.
- **Grappler.** The mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled by it.
- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The mimic is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The mimic makes two Pseudopod attacks. If it is grappling a creature, it can replace one attack with a Bite attack.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage.
- **Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the mimic is in object form, the target is subjected to its Adhesive trait.

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape.** The mimic transforms into a Large or smaller object or back into its true, amorphous form, which is a Monstrosity. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

### Reactions

- **Prey Shield.** When a creature the mimic can see hits it with an attack while it is grappling a creature, the mimic can roll the grappled creature in front of the blow, forcing the grappled creature to take the damage instead.
