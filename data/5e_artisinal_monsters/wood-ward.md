- **Horror Gaze (1/Day):** The wood ward’s eye sockets release an eerie glow in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.

If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the wood ward’s Horror Gaze for the next 24 hours.
