### Special Abilities

- **Diving Pounce.** If the gargoyle is flying and moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Claws attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the gargoyle can make one Bite attack against it as a bonus action.
- **False Appearance.** While the gargoyle remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate statue.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The gargoyle makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.

### Reactions

- **Fearsome Mien.** When a creature the gargoyle can see hits it with an attack, the gargoyle can shift its face to appear more monstrous. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or be frightened of the gargoyle until the end of its next turn.
