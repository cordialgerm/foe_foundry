- **Multiattack:** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Fin attacks.

- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Tidal Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales a crushing wave of frigid seawater in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage and 33 (6d10) cold damage and is pushed up to 30 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a Tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then move up to half its flying speed, or half its swimming speed if in the water.
