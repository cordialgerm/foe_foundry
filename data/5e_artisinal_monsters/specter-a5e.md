### Special Abilities

- **Incorporeal:** The specter can move through creatures and objects. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. If it takes radiant damage, it loses this trait until the end of its next turn.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the specter has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Perception checks that rely on sight.
- **Undead Nature:** A specter doesnt require air, sustenance, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Life Drain:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) necrotic damage  and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.
- **Hurl:** The specter targets a Medium or smaller creature  or an object weighing no more than 150 pounds  within 30 feet of it. A creature makes a DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failure  it is hurled up to 30 feet in any direction (including upwards)  taking 3 (1d6) damage for every 10 feet it is hurled. An object is launched up to 30 feet in a straight line  and a creature in its path makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw  taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage on a failure. On a success  the creature takes no damage  and the object keeps flying past it.
- **Fade:** While not in sunlight  the specter turns invisible and takes the Hide action. It remains invisible for 1 minute or until it uses Life Drain or takes damage. If the specter takes radiant damage  it can't use this action until the end of its next turn.
