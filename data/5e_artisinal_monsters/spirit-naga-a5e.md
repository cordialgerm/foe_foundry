### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. The target makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw  taking 28 (8d6) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success.
- **Hypnotic Pattern (3rd-Level; V, Concentration):** A swirling pattern of light appears at a point within 120 feet of the naga. Each creature within 10 feet of the pattern that can see it makes a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the creature is charmed for 1 minute. While charmed  the creature is incapacitated and its Speed is 0. The effect ends on a creature if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it out of its daze.
- **Lightning Bolt (3rd-Level; V):** A bolt of lightning 5 feet wide and 100 feet long arcs from the naga. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw  taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success.
- **Blight (4th-Level; V, Concentration):** The naga targets a living creature or plant within 30 feet  draining moisture and vitality from it. The target makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw  taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Plant creatures have disadvantage on their saving throw and take maximum damage. A nonmagical plant dies.

### Reactions
