- **Magic Resistance:** The fey drake has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Superior Invisibility:** As a bonus action, the fey drake can magically turn invisible until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the drake wears or carries is invisible with it.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The fey drake's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The fey drake can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components
At will: charm person, color spray, grease
3/day each: hypnotic pattern, locate creature, suggestion
1/day each: dominate person, polymorph

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fey drake makes three bite attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.
- **Bewildering Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The drake breaths a plume of purple gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed, the creature can't take bonus actions or reactions, and it makes all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma skill checks and saving throws with disadvantage.
