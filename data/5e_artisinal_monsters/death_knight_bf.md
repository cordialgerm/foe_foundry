- **Magic Resistance.** The death knight has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.
- **Undead Nature.** The death knight doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Undead Resilience.** The death knight is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The death knight makes three Greatsword or Necrotic Bolt attacks.
- **Greatsword** . Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage and 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Necrotic Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 + 4) necrotic damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Champion’s Challenge.** The death knight challenges one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 CHA save or have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures that aren’t the knight until the end of its next turn.

### Reactions

- **Parry.** The death knight adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the death knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
- **Soul Drain.** When the death knight reduces a Humanoid to 0 HP, it can absorb the creature’s soul. The target must succeed on a DC 15 WIS save or immediately die, its soul becoming trapped in the death knight’s sword. The death knight has advantage on attack rolls for 1 minute after absorbing a soul. The creature can’t be restored to life until the death knight is permanently destroyed.
