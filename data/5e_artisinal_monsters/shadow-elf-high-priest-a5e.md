### Actions

- **Mace:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. On a hit  the priest can expend a spell slot to deal 7 (2d6) radiant damage  plus an extra 3 (1d6) radiant damage for each level of the spell slot expended above 1st.
- **Web (2nd-Level; V, S, M, Concentration):** Thick  sticky webs fill a 20-foot cube within 60 feet  lightly obscuring it and making it difficult terrain. The webs must either be anchored between two solid masses (such as walls) or layered 5 feet deep over a flat surface. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure  it is restrained. A creature can escape by making a DC 15 Strength check. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round  dealing 5 (2d4) fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire. The webs remain for 1 hour.
- **Guardian of Faith (4th-Level; V):** A Large  indistinct spectral guardian appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet and remains for 8 hours. Creatures of the priests choice that move to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw  taking 20 radiant or necrotic damage (high priests choice) on a failed save or half damage on a success. The spell ends when the guardian has dealt 60 total damage.
- **Insect Plague (5th-Level; V, S, M, Concentration):** A 20-foot-radius sphere of biting and stinging insects appears centered on a point the priest can see within 300 feet and remains for 10 minutes. The cloud spreads around corners  and the area is lightly obscured and difficult terrain. Each creature in the area when the cloud appears  and each creature that enters it for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there  makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw  taking 22 (4d10) piercing damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. The priest is immune to this damage.
