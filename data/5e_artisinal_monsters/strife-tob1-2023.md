### Special Abilities

- **Mimicry:** The strife can mimic Humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check.
- **Delight:** When a creature within 30 feet of the strife takes psychic damage, the strife gains 5 temporary hp or gains advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn (the strife’s choice).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The strife can use its Sow Discord. It then makes two Claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Sow Discord:** The strife attempts to sow discord in up to two creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage and distrusts its allies until the start of the strife’s next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t distrust its allies. A creature that distrusts its allies can’t give or receive aid from its allies, including spells, class features like Sneak Attack, and the Help action.
- **Invisibility:** The strife magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the strife wears or carries is invisible with it.

### Reactions

- **Induce Doubt:** If a creature misses the strife with an attack, the strife can cause the attacker to doubt itself. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or each time it makes an attack roll or saving throw before the end of its next turn, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.
- **Familiar:** The stryx can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the stryx senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the stryx is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the stryx’s Keen Hearing and Sight trait. At any time and for any reason, the stryx can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
