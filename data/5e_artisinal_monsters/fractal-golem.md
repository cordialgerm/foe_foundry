Two duplicate fractal golems appear in the golem's space and the nearest unoccupied space, each with the same statistics as the original fractal golem, except one size smaller. When a Tiny duplicate of the golem is reduced to 0 hp, it explodes and doesn't duplicate. All duplicates act on the same initiative.
