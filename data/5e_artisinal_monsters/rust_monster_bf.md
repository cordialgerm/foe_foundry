- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The rust monster is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Rust Metal.** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the rust monster corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the rust monster is destroyed after dealing damage.

### Actions

- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d6 + 1) piercing damage.
- **Antennae.** The rust monster corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11 DEX save to avoid the rust monster’s touch.
- **+0** If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a  bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in the Rust Metal trait.

### Bonus Actions

- **Iron Dash.** The rust monster moves up to half its speed toward a source of ferrous metal it can sense.
