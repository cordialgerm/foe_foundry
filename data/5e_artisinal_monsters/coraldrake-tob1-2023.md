### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The coral drake makes one Bite attack and two Spined Fin attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with a Stinger attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Spined Fin:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Stinger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the target takes 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Biting Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The coral drake pressurizes the throat sacs that contain its growing young and spews tiny, ravenous hatchling drakes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) piercing damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
