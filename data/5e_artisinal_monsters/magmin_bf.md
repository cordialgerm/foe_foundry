### Special Abilities

- **Death Burst.** When the magmin dies, it collapses into a Tiny cinder cone. On initiative count 20 after the magmin dies, the cinder cone erupts in a burst of fire and lava. Each creature within 10 feet of the cone must make a DC 11 DEX save, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried in that area are ignited.
- **Hardened Magma.** While the magmin isn’t ablaze, it is resistant to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and it is vulnerable to thunder damage.
- **Molten Body.** While the magmin is ablaze, each creature that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.

### Actions

- **Burning Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Ignited Illumination.** The magmin sets itself ablaze or extinguishes its flames. While ablaze, the magmin sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
