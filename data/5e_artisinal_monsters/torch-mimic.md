### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While motionless indistinguishable from ordinary torch.
- **Fiery Soul:** Can ignite or extinguish fire that crowns its head as a bonus action. While ignited it sheds bright light in a 20' radius and dim light for an extra 20 feet. When mimic is subjected to effect that would extinguish its flames vs. its will (ex: submerged in area of create or destroy water or gust of wind spells) mimic must make DC 11 Con save or fall unconscious until it takes damage or someone uses action to wake it. If effect is nonmagical mimic has advantage on the save.
- **Regeneration:** Regains 2 hp at start of its turn. If mimic takes cold this doesn’t function at start of its next turn. Dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn’t regenerate.
