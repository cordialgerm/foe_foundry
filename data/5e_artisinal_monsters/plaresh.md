### Special Abilities

- **Grinding Maws:** The plaresh can burrow through harder substances such as wood, stone, or even metal. While doing so its burrow speed is reduced to half, and it creates a cluster of bore holes that leaves the material porous and weak. The material has -5 to its AC and half the usual hp.
- **Magic Resistance:** The plaresh has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Swarm:** The plaresh can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the plaresh can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny worm. The plaresh can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.

### Actions

- **Bites:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or 7 (2d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target is wearing nonmagical armor, the armor takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed.
- **Infest Corpse (Recharges after a Long Rest):** The plaresh targets one dead humanoid in its space. The body is destroyed, and a new plaresh rises from the corpse. The newly created plaresh is free-willed but usually joins its creator.
