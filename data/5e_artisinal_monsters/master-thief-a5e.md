### Special Abilities

- **Crossbow Expert:** The master assassin ignores the loading quality of light crossbows, and being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesnt impose disadvantage on the master assassins ranged attack rolls.
- **Deadly Poison:** As part of making an attack, the master thief can apply a deadly poison to their weapons (included below). The master thief carries 3 doses of this poison. A single dose can coat two melee weapons or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by their poison damage is stable but unconscious for 1 hour
- **Evasion:** When the master assassin makes a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, they take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.
- **Sneak Attack (1/Turn):** The master assassin deals an extra 28 (8d6) damage when they hit with a weapon attack while they have advantage on the attack, or when the master assassins target is within 5 feet of an ally of the master assassin while the master assassin doesnt have disadvantage on the attack.
- **Cunning Celerity:** The master thief takes two bonus actions on each of their turns.
