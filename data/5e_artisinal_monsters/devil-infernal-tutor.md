- **Weaken Resolve:** Its speech has subtle enchantments that make it seem logical or profound regardless of words used. It has advantage on Cha (Deception) and Cha (Persuasion) checks vs. Humanoids. Also if tutor spends 1+ min conversing with Humanoid that creature has disadvantage on saves vs. tutor’s Fiendish Indoctrination and vs. enchantment spells tutor casts.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Three Claws or Tutor’s Batons or one Claw and two Tutor’s Batons. It can replace one attack with Spellcasting.
- **Claw (True Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 12 (2d8+3) slashing damage + 14 (4d6) psychic.
- **Tutor’s Baton:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage + 14 (4d6) psychic. Instead of dealing psychic damage tutor can cause target to be incapacitated until target’s next turn ends.
- **Fiendish Indoctrination (Recharge 5–6):** Speaks fiendish ideals couched in persuasive scholarly language. Each creature within 30' of tutor: 45 (13d6) psychic and is charmed for 1 min (DC 18 Cha half damage isn’t charmed). Charmed creature isn’t under tutor’s control but regards tutor as a trusted friend taking tutor’s requests or actions in most favorable way it can. Charmed creature can re-save at end of each of its turns success ends effect on itself. A creature that fails the save by 5+ is charmed for 1 day instead. Such a creature can re-save only when it suffers harm or receives a suicidal command ending effect on a success.

### Reactions

- **Str of Character:** When it succeeds on a save tutor responds with scathing magical insult if source of effect is a creature within 60' of tutor. That creature: DC 18 Wis save or take 14 (4d6) psychic and have disadvantage on next save it makes vs. a spell cast by tutor.
