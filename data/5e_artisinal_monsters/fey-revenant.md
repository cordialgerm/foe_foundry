### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The fey revenant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Shadow Sight:** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the fey revenant’s darkvision.
- **Shadow Traveler (4/Day):** As a bonus action while in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the fey revenant disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at its origin and destination when it uses this trait.
- **Spider Climb:** The fey revenant can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the fey revenant has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Thorn Body:** A creature that touches the fey revenant or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) piercing damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fey revenant makes three attacks, either with its shortsword or longbow. It can use its Queen’s Grasp in place of one shortsword or longbow attack.
- **Shortsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.
- **Longbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 120/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.
- **Queen’s Grasp:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, ranged 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: The target is restrained by icy wisps of shadow. While restrained, the creature takes 7 (2d6) cold damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 15 Strength check, bursting through the icy shadow on a success. The icy shadow can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; 5 hp; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; immunity to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage).
