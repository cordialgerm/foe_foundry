### Special Abilities

- **Turning Defiance:** The bloated ghoul and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
- **Unholy Stench:** When the bloated ghoul takes piercing or slashing damage, noxious vapors burst from its distended stomach. Each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage and be poisoned until the end of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The bloated ghoul makes one bite attack and one claw attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d8 + 3) piercing damage, and, if the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved and have disadvantage on Dexterity-based checks and saving throws for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Hideous Feast:** The bloated ghoul feeds on a corpse within 5 feet of it that is less than 1 week old. It regains 1d8 hit points per size category of the creature it consumes. For example, the ghoul regains 1d8 hit points when consuming a Tiny creature or 4d8 hit points when consuming a Large creature. The bloated ghoul canâ€™t use Hideous Feast on a corpse if it or another bloated ghoul has already used Hideous Feast on the corpse.
