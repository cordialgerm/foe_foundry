### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The medusa is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Petrifying Gaze.** When a creature that can see the medusa’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 CON save if the medusa isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the save fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the save at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on itself on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
- **Snake Friend.** The medusa can communicate with snakes as if they shared a language, and snakes can’t be petrified by the medusa’s Petrifying Gaze.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The medusa makes one Snake Hair attack and two Shortsword attacks, or it makes three Longbow attacks.
- **Snake Hair.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.
- **Shortsword** . Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
- **Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

### Reactions

- **Interruptive Hiss.** When a creature the medusa can see targets it with an attack, the medusa’s snakes can suddenly rise and hiss at the attacker. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 WIS save or fail the attack roll.
