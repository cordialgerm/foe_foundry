### Special Abilities

- **Cackling Chorus.** If three or more hyenas are all within 30 feet of each other, their cackling, grunts, whoops, and yips create a deafening chorus. A creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a hyena must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or be deafened until the start of its next turn. The DC is equal to 8 plus the number of participating hyenas.
- **Pack Tactics.** The hyena has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the hyena’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
