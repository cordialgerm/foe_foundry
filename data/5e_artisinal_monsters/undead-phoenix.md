### Special Abilities

- **Bilious Aura:** A living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the undead phoenix can't regain hp and has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws until the start of its next turn.
- **Eternal Unlife:** If it dies, the undead phoenix reverts into a pile of necrotic-tainted ooze and is reborn in 24 hours with all of its hp. Only killing it with radiant damage prevents this trait from functioning.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The undead phoenix makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its decaying bite.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d6 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Decaying Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with perpetual decay. The cursed target can't regain hp until the curse is lifted by the remove curse spell or similar magic.
