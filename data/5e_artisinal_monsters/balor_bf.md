### Special Abilities

- **Demonic Flames.** Creatures resistant to fire damage aren’t resistant to fire damage dealt by the balor. A creature immune to fire damage is still immune to the balor’s fire damage.
- **Demonic Resilience.** The balor is resistant to cold and lightning damage. In addition, it is immune to poison damage and to the poisoned condition.
- **Diving Assault.** If the balor is flying and moves at least 30 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 20 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the balor can make one Longsword attack against it as a bonus action.
- **Flaming Weapons.** The balor’s weapon attacks are magical. When the balor hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 fire damage (included in the attack).
- **Fire Aura.** At the start of each of the balor’s turns, each creature within 10 feet of it takes 13 (3d8) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren’t being worn or carried ignite.
- **Magic Resistance.** The balor has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.
