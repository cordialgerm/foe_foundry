### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The dragon can breathe air and water.
- **Flowing Grace:** The dragon doesnt provoke opportunity attacks when it flies or swims out of an enemys reach.
- **Shimmering Scales:** While in water, the dragon gains three-quarters cover from attacks made by creatures more than 30 feet away.
- **Essence Link:** The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:create or destroy water, fog cloud
