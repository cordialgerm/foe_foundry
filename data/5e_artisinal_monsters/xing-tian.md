### Special Abilities

- **Indomitable:** Any spell or effect that would make the xing tian paralyzed, restrained, or stunned ends at the end of the xing tian’s next turn, regardless of the spell or effect’s normal duration.
- **Sure-Footed:** The xing tian has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The xing tian makes three attacks: one with its shield slam and two with its battleaxe. If both battleaxe attacks hit the same target, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take an extra 11 (2d10) piercing damage as the xing tian bites the target.
- **Battleaxe:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage, or 22 (3d10 + 6) slashing damage if used with two hands.
- **Shield Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Dance of the Unyielding:** The xing tian stomps and waves its arms in a martial dance, and it regains 10 hp. Until the dance ends, the xing tian regains 10 hp at the start of each of its turns and melee attack rolls against the xing tian have disadvantage. It must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue dancing. It can stop dancing at any time. The dance ends if the xing tian is incapacitated.
