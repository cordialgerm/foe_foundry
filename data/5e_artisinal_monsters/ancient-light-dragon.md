- **Incorporeal Movement:** The dragon can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:<br>Radiant Breath. The dragon exhales radiant energy in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 77 (14d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>Flaring Breath. The dragon emits a flash of dazzling light from its maw in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or be blinded. Undead within the area of effect must also make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute. Undead of CR 3 or lower who fail the saving throw are instantly destroyed.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
