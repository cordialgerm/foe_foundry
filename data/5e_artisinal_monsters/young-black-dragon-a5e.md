### Special Abilities

- **Ambusher:** When submerged in water, the dragon has advantage on Stealth checks. If the dragon hits a creature that can't see it with its bite, it can deal piercing damage and grapple the target simultaneously.
- **Amphibious:** The dragon can breathe air and water.
- **Ruthless (1/Round):** After scoring a critical hit on its turn, the dragon can immediately make one claw attack.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:fog cloud, pass without trace

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) acid damage. Instead of dealing piercing damage  the dragon can grapple the target (escape DC 16)  and a Medium or smaller creature grappled in this way is restrained. While grappling a creature  the dragon can't bite another creature.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales sizzling acid in a 40-foot-long  5-foot-wide line. Each creature in that area makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw  taking 45 (10d8) acid damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is blinded until the end of its next turn.
