### Special Abilities

- **Cloudsight** . The cloud giant can see through areas obscured by clouds, fog, smoke, and steam without penalty.
- **Giant Attributes.** The cloud giant is resistant to the stunned condition, and it is vulnerable to the prone condition.
- **Heightened Smell.** The cloud giant’s Perception is 22 when perceiving by smell.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The cloud giant makes three Cloud-Coated Mace attacks, or it makes two Wind Burst attacks.
- **Cloud-Coated Mace.** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d6 + 8) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.
- **Wind Burst.** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (5d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 STR save or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the cloud giant and knocked prone.

### Bonus Actions

- **Cloud Cover.** The cloud giant creates a 20-foot cube of clouds centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it. The cube spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until the cloud giant dies, or until the cloud giant uses this bonus action again.
- **Condense.** The cloud giant causes a 20-foot-radius sphere of cloud, fog, smoke, or steam centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it to become as thick as mud, making the area difficult terrain for creatures moving through it. A creature that starts its turn in the hardened cloud must succeed on a DC 15 STR save or be restrained until the start of its next turn. The cloud remains condensed for 1 minute, until the cloud giant dies, or until the cloud giant uses this bonus action again.

### Reactions

- **Cirrus Deflection.** The cloud giant creates a bit of hardened cloud between it and an attacker, increasing the giant’s AC by 4. To do so, it must be able to see the attacker.
