### Special Abilities

- **Elemental Nature:** The anubian doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Sand Camouflage:** The anubian has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in sandy terrain.
- **Sand Form:** The anubian can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Vulnerability to Water:** For every 5 feet the anubian moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 2 (1d4) cold damage. An anubian completely immersed in water takes 10 (4d4) cold damage at the start of its turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The anubian makes two Claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Haboob (1/Day):** A 30-foot-tall cylinder of sand forms in the anubian’s space and moves with it for 10 minutes, until the anubian ends the storm as a bonus action, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). The area within 5 feet of the anubian is heavily obscured. A creature that starts its turn in that area or enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the storm. While restrained, the creature takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and moves with the anubian when the anubian moves. A creature, including the restrained creature, can use its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.

### Bonus Actions

- **Sand Step:** The anubian collapses into loose sand and teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, reforming in that space. If the destination space contains sand, the anubian can immediately Hide. The anubian can’t use Sand Step while Haboob is active.
