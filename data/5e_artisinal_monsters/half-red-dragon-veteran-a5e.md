### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The veteran makes two melee attacks.
- **Longsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The veteran exhales a blast of fire that fills a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw  taking 24 (7d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature who fails the saving throw also suffers 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage. At the end of each of its turns  it can repeat the saving throw  ending the ongoing damage on a success. This fire can also be put out in typical ways  such as immersion in water  and a creature who uses an action to drop prone can put out the fire with a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw.

### Bonus Actions

- **Tactical Movement:** Until the end of the veterans turn, its Speed is halved and its movement doesnt provoke opportunity attacks.

### Reactions

- **Off-Hand Counter:** When the veteran is missed by a melee attack by an attacker it can see within 5 feet, the veteran makes a shortsword attack against the attacker.
