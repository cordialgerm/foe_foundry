### Special Abilities

- **Detect Alignment:** The khalkos can detect the presence of creatures within 30 feet that have an alignment trait, and knows the alignment of such creatures.

### Actions

- **Chaos Pheromones:** The khalkos emits a cloud of pheromones into the air in a 10-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners. Each non-khalkos creature in the area makes a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure  the creature is confused for 1 minute. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending the effect on itself on a success. If the creature makes its saving throw or the condition ends for it  it is immune to the chaos pheromones of khalkos spawn for the next 24 hours.
- **Sting:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.
