### Special Abilities

- **Camouflage:** The giant has advantage on Stealth checks made to hide in rocky terrain.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant attacks twice with its greatclub or twice with rocks.
- **Greatclub:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature  it makes a DC 19 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.
- **Rock:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature  it makes a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failure  it is pushed 10 feet away from the giant and knocked prone. In lieu of a rock  the giant can throw a grappled Medium or smaller creature up to 30 feet. On a hit  the target and the thrown creature both take 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. On a miss  only the thrown creature takes the damage. The thrown creature falls prone in an unoccupied space 5 feet from the target.

### Bonus Actions

- **Grab:** One creature within 5 feet makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the giant can't grab another target, and it makes greatclub attacks with advantage against the grappled target.

### Reactions

- **Rock Catching:** If a rock or other Small or larger projectile is hurled or fired at the giant, the giant makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the giant catches the projectile, takes no bludgeoning or piercing damage from it, and is not pushed or knocked prone by it.
