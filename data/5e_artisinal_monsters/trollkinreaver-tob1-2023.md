### Special Abilities

- **Regeneration:** The trollkin reaver regains 5 hp at the start of its turn. If the trollkin takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the trollkin’s next turn. The trollkin dies if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn’t regenerate.
- **Thick Hide:** The trollkin reaver’s skin is thick and tough, granting it a +1 bonus to Armor Class. This bonus is already factored into the trollkin’s AC.
