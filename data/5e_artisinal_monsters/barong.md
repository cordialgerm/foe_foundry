The creature doesn't provoke an opportunity attack from this movement. Bats Bats exist in hundreds of species, from the harmless messenger bats of the ghoul empire to the ravening blood-devouring vampire bats found in various castles and deep jungles. The giant albino bat and the giant vampire bat are two monsters that vex adventurers more often than most, and they are often allies of darakhul, werebats, dhampirs, and vampires.
