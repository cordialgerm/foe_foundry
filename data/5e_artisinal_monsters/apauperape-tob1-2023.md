### Special Abilities

- **Diseased Ichor:** When the apau perape takes piercing damage or slashing damage, a spray of caustic blood spurts from the wound. Each creature within 5 feet of the apau perape must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the Mechuiti’s ichor disease and be poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hp maximum by 5 (2d4) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Magic Resistance:** The apau perape has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The apau perape makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Fiery Roar (Recharge 6):** The apau perape releases a terrifying, flame-coated roar in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 31 (9d6) fire damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t frightened.
- **Summon Demon (1/Day):** The apau perape magically calls 1d4 apes that are Fiends with the apau perape’s damage resistances and immunities. It has a 50 percent chance of calling one apau perape instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the apau perape and obeying its telepathic commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the apau perape dies, or until the apau perape dismisses them as a bonus action.
