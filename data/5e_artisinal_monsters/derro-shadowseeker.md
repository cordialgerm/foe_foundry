### Special Abilities

- **Erratic Movement:** The shadowseeker can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns. In addition, opportunity attacks against the shadowseeker are made with disadvantage.
- **Evasion:** If the shadowseeker is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the shadowseeker instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- **Magic Resistance:** The shadowseeker has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Sneak Attack (1/Turn):** The shadowseeker deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the shadowseeker that isn’t incapacitated and the shadowseeker doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the shadowseeker has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The derro shadowseeker makes three melee attacks.
- **Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Light Crossbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Maddening Convulsions (Recharge 5-6):** The shadowseeker’s body contorts and spasms in bizarre ways, confounding other creatures. Each non-derro creature within 5 feet of the shadowseeker that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as if by a confusion spell for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the shadowseeker’s Maddening Convulsions for the next 24 hours.
