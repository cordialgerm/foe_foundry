### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The kot bayun can use its Slumbering Song. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Invisibility:** The kot bayun magically turns invisible until it attacks or uses Slumbering Song, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the kot bayun wears or carries is invisible with it.
- **Slumbering Song:** The kot bayun sings a magical song to one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw on fall unconscious for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the kot bayun uses a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing, the target has disadvantage on this saving throw. Otherwise, the effect ends for a target if the target takes damage while below half its hp maximum.
- **Healing Purr (2/Day):** The kot bayun purrs at a creature it can see within 15 feet of it. The target magically regains 10 (3d6) hp and is freed from any disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.
