- **Chaos Pheromones:** The swarm emits a cloud of pheromones in the air in a 10-foot-radius. The cloud spreads around corners. Each non-khalkos creature in the area makes a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure  the creature is confused for 1 minute. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending the effect on itself on a success. If the creature makes its saving throw or the condition ends for it  it is immune to the chaos pheromones of khalkos spawn for the next 24 hours.
