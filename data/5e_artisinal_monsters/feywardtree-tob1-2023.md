### Special Abilities

- **Aversion to Cold:** If the feyward tree takes cold damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.
- **Construct Nature:** The feyward tree doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Enchanted Leaves:** The feyward tree’s Razor-Leafed Branch attacks are magical. When the tree hits with its Razor-Leafed Branch, the branch deals an extra 9 (2d8) force damage (included in the attack).
- **Immutable Form:** The feyward tree is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Lightning Absorption:** Whenever the feyward tree is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hp equal to the lightning damage dealt.
- **Magic Resistance:** The feyward tree has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Warden’s Reach:** A creature within 15 feet of a feyward tree that moves away from it provokes an opportunity attack even if the creature takes the Disengage action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The feyward tree makes two Razor-Leafed Branch attacks.
- **Razor-Leafed Branch:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) force damage.
- **Flaying Leaves (Recharge 5–6):** The feyward tree launches a barrage of razor-sharp cold iron leaves from its branches. Each creature within 20 feet of the tree must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
