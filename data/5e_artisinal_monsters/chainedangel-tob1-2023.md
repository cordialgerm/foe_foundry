### Special Abilities

- **Immortal Nature:** The chained angel doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.
- **Magic Resistance:** The chained angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Redemption:** When a creature casts the knock spell on the chained angel’s chains, the chains release a blast of unholy flame. The spellcaster must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) fire damage and 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the spellcaster survives, the chained angel must immediately make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the angel’s chains fall away. It is restored to its senses and the form it had before it was chained, typically a deva. On a failure, the chained angel remains chained for 7 days, and during that time, any further attempts to cast knock on the angel’s chains fail.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The chained angel makes two Fiery Greatsword attacks.
- **Fiery Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 16 (3d10) fire damage.
- **Fallen Glory (Recharge 5–6):** Each creature the chained angel can see within 50 feet of it must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 19 (3d12) radiant damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.

### Reactions

- **Fiendish Cunning:** When a creature the chained angel can see within 60 feet of it casts a spell that appears on the cleric or paladin spell list, the chained angel can counter the spell with a successful ability check. This works like the counterspell spell with a +5 spellcasting ability check, except the chained angel must make the ability check no matter the level of the spell.
