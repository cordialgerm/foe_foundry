- **Charge:** If the dracotaur moves at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a bite attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 14 (4d6) piercing damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dracotaur makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws or two with its longbow.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

- **Lightning Arrow (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** The dracotaur shoots an arrow at a point it can see within 150 feet where it explodes into a 20-foot-radius sphere of lightning. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as damage much on a successful one.
- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dracotaur exhales lightning in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
