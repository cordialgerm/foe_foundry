### Special Abilities

- **Magic-Infused Weapons:** The power coursing through the corrupted chieftain’s veins flows into its weapons. The chieftain’s weapon attacks are magical. When the chieftain hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 force damage (included in the attack).
- **Spiked Hide:** A creature that touches the ogre or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The corrupted ogre can use its Chieftain’s Command or Chieftain’s Might. It then makes two Greatclub or Javelin attacks.
- **Greatclub:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) force damage.
- **Javelin:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) force damage.
- **Chieftain’s Command:** The corrupted chieftain barks an order to one Giant it can see within 30 feet of it, sharing a measure of its power with the target. The target has advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of the chieftain’s next turn. In addition, the next attack roll against the target before the start of the chieftain’s next turn has disadvantage.
- **Chieftain’s Might:** The corrupted chieftain causes its eyes to glow, its muscles to swell, and the ground beneath its feet to rumble. Each creature within 15 feet of the chieftain must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.

### Bonus Actions

- **Aggressive:** The corrupted chieftain moves up to its speed toward a hostile creature it can see.
