### Special Abilities

- **Potent Poison:** Undead with resistance or immunity to poison damage or the poisoned condition can be affected by the swarm’s poison.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.
- **Weight of Wings:** A creature that starts its turn in the swarm’s space has its speed halved and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded. Both effects end when the creature ends its turn outside the swarm’s space. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the blinding effect of Weight of Wings for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The swarm makes two Bites attacks.
- **Bites:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. Hit: 21 (6d6) piercing damage, or 10 (3d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hp or fewer. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, it takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
