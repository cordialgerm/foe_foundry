### Special Abilities

- **Charge:** If the ophidiotaur moves at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a poisoned glaive attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5 (1d10) slashing damage.
- **Magic Resistance:** The ophidiotaur has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ophidiotaur makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its glaive.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Poisoned Glaive:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.
- **Call Serpents (1/Day):** The ophidiotaur magically calls 1d6 poisonous snakes or flying snakes (ophidiotaurâ€™s choice). The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the ophidiotaur and obeying its spoken commands. The snakes remain for 1 hour, until the ophidiotaur dies, or until the ophidiotaur dismisses them as a bonus action.
