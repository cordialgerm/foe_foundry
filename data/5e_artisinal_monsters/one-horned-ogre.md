### Special Abilities

- **Magical Horn:** The power of the one-horned ogre comes from its horn. If the horn is ever removed, the one-horned ogre loses its Fiendish Horn Blast action and its Innate Spellcasting trait, and its Charisma score is reduced to 8 (-1). If the ogre receives a new horn through regenerative magic or a blessing from its patron, it regains what it lost.
- **Ruthless Weapons:** When the one-horned ogre hits a blinded, charmed, or frightened creature with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The one-horned ogre’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.
2/day each: darkness, misty step, suggestion
1/day each: fear

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The one-horned ogre can use its Fiendish Horn Blast. It then makes one greatsword attack.
- **Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Javelin:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Fiendish Horn Blast:** The one-horned ogre directs the power of its horn at a target it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and suffers a condition for 1 minute based on the color of the ogre’s horn: blinded (black), charmed (crimson), or frightened (white). On a success, the target takes half the damage and doesn’t suffer the condition. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
