### Special Abilities

- **Flyby.** The snake doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.

### Actions

- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or take 5 (2d4) poison damage.

### Reactions

- **Reflexive Escape.** When a creature the snake can see attacks it, the snake can move up to 5 feet. If this movement puts the snake out of reach of the attack, the attack misses.
