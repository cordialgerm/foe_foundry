### Special Abilities

- **Inescapable Hunger:** Necrotic damage dealt by the servant of the Unsated God ignores resistance to necrotic damage.
- **Master of Disguise:** A servant in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, it loses its stench.
- **Stench:** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the servant must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the servant’s Stench for the next 24 hours. A servant using this ability can’t also benefit from Master of Disguise.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the servant has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Turning Defiance:** The servant and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
- **Spellcasting:** The servant of the Unsated God is a 4th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following cleric spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): guidance, mending, resistance, thaumaturgy
1st level (4 slots): bane, command, inflict wounds, protection from evil and good
2nd level (3 slots): blindness/deafness, hold person, spiritual weapon

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The servant of the Unsated God makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its mace of the devourer.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and, if the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.
- **Mace of the Devourer:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. The mace is magical and infused with the Unsated God’s power while in the servant’s hands.
- **Light Crossbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.
- **Hungering Strike (Recharge 5-6):** A shadowy jaw superimposes over the servant of the Unsated God’s mouth and reaches out to a creature within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
