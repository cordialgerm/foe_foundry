### Special Abilities

- **Horrifying Aura:** Any creature hostile to the bloody bones that starts its turn within 10 feet of the bloody bones must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the bloody bones' Horrifying Aura for the next 24 hours.
- **Horrific Imitation:** The bloody bones chooses one creature it can see. It moves, acts, and speaks in a macabre imitation of the creature. Its utterances are nonsense, and it can't understand the languages of its chosen target. It maintains this imitation until it dies. A creature that hears and sees the bloody bones can tell it is performing an imitation with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The bloody bones makes two claw attacks. It can use its Dark Stare in place of one claw attack.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Dark Stare:** The bloody bones stares balefully at one creature it can see within 60 feet. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on all attacks until the end of its next turn.

### Reactions

- **Its Crown Runs Red:** When it is hit by an attack, the bloody bones regains 5 (1d10) hit points and has resistance to that damage type until the end of its next turn as life-giving blood pours from the top of its skull.
