### Special Abilities

- **Ghostly Body (Ghostwalk Form Only):** The ghostwalk spider has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and it has immunity to the grappled, paralyzed, petrified, and restrained conditions.
- **Incorporeal Movement (Ghostwalk Form Only):** The ghostwalk spider can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Spider Climb:** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Web Walker:** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ghostwalk spider makes one Bite attack and one Ghostly Snare attack, or it makes two Bite attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage. If the ghostwalk spider is in its true form, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
- **Ghostly Snare (Ghostwalk Form Only, Recharge 4–6):** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: The target is restrained by invisible webbing. While restrained in this way, the target is invisible. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 15 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; hp 15; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

### Bonus Actions

- **Ghostwalk:** The ghostwalk spider magically takes on a ghostly form or returns to its true, tangible form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying becomes ghostly with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
