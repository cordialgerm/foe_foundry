### Special Abilities

- **Earth Glide:** The dragon can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing it.
- **False Appearance:** While the dragon remains motionless within its linked area, it is indistinguishable from a natural rocky outcropping.
- **Essence Link:** The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:locate animals or plants, spike growth

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its slam.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Scouring Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales scouring sand and stones in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw  taking 38 (11d6) slashing damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
