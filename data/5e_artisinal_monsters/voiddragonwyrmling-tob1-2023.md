### Special Abilities

- **Chill of the Void:** Creatures with resistance to cold damage don’t have resistance to the cold damage dealt by the Void dragon. A creature with immunity to cold damage is still immune to the dragon’s cold damage.
- **Expert Void Traveler:** The Void dragon doesn’t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure. While traveling in the Void, the dragon magically glides on solar winds, covering immense distances in short times.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.
- **Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.
- **Gravitic Breath:** The dragon exhales localized gravity in a 15-foot cube, originating from the dragon. When a creature ends a fall in the cube, it takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d10. A creature that enters the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained. On a success, the creature’s speed is halved as long as it remains in the cube. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The cube lasts until the start of the dragon’s next turn.
- **Stellar Breath:** The dragon exhales star fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage and 10 (3d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Void Twist:** The dragon adds 2 to its AC against one attack that would hit it, as it twists reality to open a small rift in space to protect itself. To do so, the dragon must be able to see the attacker.
