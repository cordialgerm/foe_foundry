### Special Abilities

- **Barbed Death.** When the barbed devil dies, its body withers, leaving behind a mass of spikes on the ground in a 10-foot radius centered on the devil’s body. The area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, and when a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d6 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
- **Barbed Hide.** A creature that hits the barbed devil with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage. A creature that starts its turn grappling or grappled by the barbed devil takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage.
- **Devil’s Sight.** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the devil’s darkvision.
- **Devilish Resilience.** The devil is resistant to cold damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, it is immune to fire damage and poison damage and to the poisoned condition.
