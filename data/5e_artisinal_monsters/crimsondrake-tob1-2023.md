### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The drake has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The crimson drake makes one Bite attack and one Stinger attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Stinger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target takes 2 (1d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns while poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 6):** The drake exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Familiar:** The drake can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the drake senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the drake is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the drakeâ€™s Magic Resistance trait. At any time and for any reason, the drake can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
