### Special Abilities

- **Ice Walk:** The hoarfrost drake can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra movement.
- **Icy Scales:** The hoarfrost drake has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hoarfrost drake makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) cold damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Cloud of Riming Ice (Recharge 5-6):** The hoarfrost drake creates a cloud of freezing fog that rimes everything in frost. Each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 14 (4d6) cold damage and must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or drop whatever it’s holding. On a success, the target takes half the damage and doesn’t drop what it’s holding.<br><br>The area becomes difficult terrain until the end of the hoarfrost drake’s next turn. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

### Reactions

- **Retaliatory Slip:** When a creature grapples the drake, the drake can immediately attempt to escape. If it succeeds, it can make a bite attack against the creature that grappled it.
