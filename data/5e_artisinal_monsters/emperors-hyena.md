### Special Abilities

- **Pack Tactics:** The emperor’s hyena has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the hyena’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
- **Stench:** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the emperor’s hyena must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the emperor’s hyena’s Stench for 24 hours.
- **Turning Resistance:** The emperor’s hyena has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The emperor’s hyena makes two bite attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.
- **Black Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The emperor’s hyena breathes a 15-foot cone of noxious black vapor. Each creature in the area that isn’t an undead or a construct must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. This exhaustion lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest.
