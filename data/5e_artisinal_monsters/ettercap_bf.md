### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The ettercap is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Spider Climb.** The ettercap can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the ettercap knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.
- **Web Walker.** The ettercap ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The ettercap makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack, or it makes two Spit Poison attacks.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Spit Poison.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 3) poison damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Web (Recharge 4–6).** The ettercap launches a gob of webbing at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or be restrained. A creature, including the restrained target, can take its action to free the target from the webbing by succeeding on a DC 13 STR check. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; HP 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
