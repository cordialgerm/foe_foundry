### Actions

- **Serrated Beak.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or be restrained as it begins to turn to stone. The creature must repeat the save at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 24 hours.
