### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The death barque makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tail smash.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Tail Smash:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Shrapnel Burst:** The death barque launches a ball of bone shards from its tail at a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) piercing damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isnâ€™t blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Necrotic Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The death barque exhales a dark cloud of necrotic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
