### Special Abilities

- **Angelic Weapons:** The kinnara's weapon attacks are magical. When the kinnara hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).
- **Eternal Lovers:** The kinnara shares a powerful bond with its partner and can't be turned against its partner by magical or non-magical means.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The kinnara's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The kinnara can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: detect good and evil, guidance, light, spare the dying
3/day each: charm person, sleep, healing word
1/day each: calm emotions, enthrall, hold person

### Actions

- **Shortsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.
- **Shortbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.
- **Discordant Refrain (Recharge 5-6):** The kinnara plays a series of jarring notes on its musical instrument. Each non-celestial creature within 60 feet who can hear the sound must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage but isn't frightened. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

- **Share the Pain:** When the kinnara's partner is hit with a melee or ranged attack, the kinnara can teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of its partner. The damage caused by the attack is divided evenly between the two kinnara.
