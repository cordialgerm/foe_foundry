### Special Abilities

- **Darkness Shroud:** The cave dragon naturally suppresses light near it. Bright light within 15 feet of the dragon becomes dim light, and dim light within 15 feet becomes nonmagical darkness.
- **Magical Tunneler:** The cave dragon can burrow through nonmagical unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dragon can choose whether to leave the material it moves through undisturbed or leave a 5-foot diameter tunnel in its wake.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.
- **Poison Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales a cone of black, poisonous gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned.
