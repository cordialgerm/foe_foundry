### Special Abilities

- **Acidic Vapors.** After the black dragon uses its Acid Breath, acid clings to its mouth, throat, and nostrils for a time, evaporating as the dragon breathes. While the dragon’s Acid Breath is unavailable, acidic vapors surround it, and each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.
- **Amphibious.** The dragon can breathe air and water.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon exhales acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 DEX save, taking 49 (11d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
