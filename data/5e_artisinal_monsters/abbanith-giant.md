### Special Abilities

- **One with the Earth:** The abbanith giant can detect the flows and rhythms of the earth—including things that interfere with these rhythms, such as earthquakes and magical anomalies. As a result, the abbanith giant can’t be surprised by an opponent that is touching the ground. In addition, the giant has advantage on attack rolls against constructs and elementals made of earth or stone.
- **Siege Monster:** The giant deals double damage to objects and structures and triple damage to objects and structures made of earth or stone.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The abbanith giant makes two thumb claw attacks.
- **Thumb Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.

### Reactions

- **Earth Counter (Recharge 6):** When a creature the abbanith can see within 30 feet of it casts a spell, the abbanith counters it. This reaction works like the counterspell spell, except the abbanith can only counter spells that directly affect or create earth or stone, such as stone shape, wall of stone, or move earth, and it doesn’t need to make a spellcasting ability check, regardless of the spell’s level.
