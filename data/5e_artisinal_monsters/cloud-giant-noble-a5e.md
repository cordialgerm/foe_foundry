### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant attacks twice with its glaive.
- **Glaive:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d10 + 8) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature  it makes a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failure  it is pushed up to 10 feet away from the giant and knocked prone.
- **Rock:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 39 (9d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature  it makes a DC 20 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.
- **Fog Cloud (1st-Level; V, S, Concentration):** The giant creates a 20-foot-radius  heavily obscured sphere of fog centered on a point it can see within 120 feet. The fog spreads around corners and can be dispersed by a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour). It lasts for 1 hour.
- **Arc Lightning (1/Day):** Up to three creatures within 60 feet that the giant can see make DC 15 Dexterity saving throws  taking 42 (12d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success.
- **Blinking Blades (1/Day):** The giant magically teleports multiple times within a few seconds. The giant may make one glaive attack against each creature of its choice within 30 feet  up to a maximum of 6 attacks.
- **Reverse Gravity (1/Day):** Each creature of the giants choice within 30 feet is magically hurled 60 feet in the air. If a creature hits an obstacle  it takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage. The creatures then fall  taking falling damage as normal.
- **Silver Tongue (1/Day):** One creature that can hear the giant within 30 feet makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  it is magically charmed by the giant for 1 hour. This effect ends if the giant or its allies harm the creature.

### Bonus Actions

- **Gust:** One creature within 10 feet makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed up to 30 feet away from the giant.
- **Misty Step (2nd-Level; V):** The giant teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. The giant can't cast this spell and a 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.
