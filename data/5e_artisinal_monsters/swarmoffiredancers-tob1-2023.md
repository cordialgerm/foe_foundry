### Special Abilities

- **Elemental Nature:** The swarm of fire dancers doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Fire Form:** A creature that touches the swarm or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the first time the swarm enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire. Until a creature, which can include the target, uses an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
- **Illumination:** The swarm sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light to an additional 30 feet.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny Elemental. The swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.
- **Water Susceptibility:** For every 5 feet the swarm moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The swarm of fire dancers can use its Frightening Visage, if available. It then makes two Singe attacks.
- **Singe:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 22 (4d10) fire damage, or 11 (2d10) fire damage if the swarm has half its hp or fewer.
- **Frightening Visage (Recharge 5–6):** The swarm rearranges itself into the shape of a giant, blue, flaming Humanoid skull. Each Humanoid within 30 feet of the swarm that can see it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
