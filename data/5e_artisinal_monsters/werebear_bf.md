### Special Abilities

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The werebear makes three Claw or Greataxe attacks. It can replace one attack with a Bite attack, provided it is in the appropriate form. If two Claw attacks hit one creature, the target is grappled (escape DC 15). The werebear can grapple only one creature at a time.
- **Bite (Bear or Hybrid Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 CON save or be cursed with the werebear lycanthropy curse (see Curse of Lycanthropy sidebar).
- **Claw (Bear or Hybrid Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Greataxe (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) slashing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape.** The werebear transforms into a Medum or Large bear, a Large bear-humanoid hybrid, or back into its true form, which is Humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, speed, and AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
- **Pin.** One creature grappled by the werebear is knocked prone, and it is restrained until the grapple ends.
