### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The mouther can breathe air and water.
- **Gibbering Mouths:** The mouther babbles constantly. A living non-aberration creature that starts its turn within 30 feet and can hear its gibbering makes a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature is confused until the start of its next turn.
- **Reality Eater:** The ground within 15 feet of the mouther is the consistency of sucking mud and is difficult terrain to all creatures except the mouther. Each non-aberrant creature that starts its turn in the area or enters it for the first time on its turn makes a DC 10 Strength saving throw. On a failure, its Speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.
