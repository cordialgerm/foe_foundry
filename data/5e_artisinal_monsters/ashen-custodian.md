### Special Abilities

- **Fire Controller:** As a bonus action, the ashen custodian can create or extinguish a nonmagical fire in a 5-foot cube within 30 feet of her, or she can expand an existing fire within 30 feet of her by 5 feet in one direction. If she creates or expands a fire, the target location must have suitable fuel for the fire, such as paper or wood. If the ashen custodian targets a fire elemental with this trait, the fire elemental has advantage (expanded) or disadvantage (extinguished) on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
- **Forest Cleanser:** When the ashen custodian hits a plant or plant creature with her Cleansing Strike, the target takes an extra 2d8 fire damage.
- **Magic Resistance:** The ashen custodian has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Warming Presence:** When a hostile creature starts its turn within 10 feet of the ashen custodian, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) fire damage. When a friendly creature within 10 feet of the ashen custodian regains hp, the creature regains an extra 1d6 hp.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The ashen custodianâ€™s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). The ashen custodian can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: druidcraft, produce flame
3/day each: burning hands, cure wounds, flame blade, fog cloud
1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), wall of fire

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ashen custodian makes two cleansing strike attacks.
- **Cleansing Strike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
