### Special Abilities

- **Back Spikes:** Any Small or larger creature riding alke against its will: 14 (4d6) piercing damage (DC 15 Dex half).
- **Keen Sight:** Advantage: sight Wis (Percept) checks.
- **Pounce:** If it moves 30'+ straight toward a creature and then hits it with Claws on the same turn that target: DC 15 Str save or be knocked prone. If target is prone alke can make one Beak attack vs. it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** One Beak attack and two Claws attacks.
- **Beak:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 8 (1d8+4) piercing damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage.
- **Piercing Roll (Recharge 4–6):** Tucks in its head and throws itself spikes first into nearby foes. Alke moves up to 25 ft. in a straight line and can move through space of any Med or smaller creature. The first time it enters a creature’s space during this move creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and 14 (4d6) piercing damage and is knocked prone (DC 15 Str half not knocked prone.)

### Reactions

- **Repelling Spikes:** Adds 3 to its AC vs. one melee or ranged weapon attack that would hit it. To do so the alke must see the attacker and not be prone.
