- **Howl (Recharge 5-6):** The roggenwolf lets loose a howl that can only be heard inside the minds of nearby creatures. Each creature within 30 feet of the roggenwolf that isn't an undead or a construct must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened and restrained for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending both effects on itself on a success.
