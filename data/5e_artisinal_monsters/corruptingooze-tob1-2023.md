### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The corrupting ooze makes two Slam attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or one nonmagical leather, metal, or wooden item the creature is wearing or carrying is destroyed. This effect can’t destroy armor or weapons.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Reshape Body:** The corrupting ooze can reshape its mass into a vaguely Humanoid shape or back into its amorphous shape. It reverts to its amorphous shape if it dies. While in a Humanoid shape, it can take any action that requires hands, except it can’t wield weapons or a shield or don armor.
