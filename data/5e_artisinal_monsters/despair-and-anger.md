### Actions

- **Multiattack:** 3 Blazing Fist or Shadow Tendrils or 3 Divine Bolts.
- **Blazing Fist (Anger Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 8 (1d8+4) bludgeoning damage + 7 (2d6) fire and 7 (2d6) radiant.
- **Shadow Tendril (Despair Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 15 ft., one target, 11 (2d6+4) bludgeoning damage + 7 (2d6) necrotic and target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends target is restrained. Despair and anger has three shadow tendrils each of which can grapple only one target. At start of each of despair and anger’s turns each creature grappled by it takes 7 (2d6) necrotic and despair and anger regains hp equal to half the total necrotic dealt.
- **Divine Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, 120 ft., one target, 22 (4d8+4) necrotic (if despair is active) or radiant (if anger is active).
- **Burning Rage (Anger Only Recharge 5–6):** Each creature within 30': 21 (6d6) fire and 21 (6d6) radiant (DC 16 Dex half).
- **Despairing Rejection (Despair Only Recharge 4–6):** Assaults minds of up to 3 creatures it can see within 30' of it with despair. Each target: 17 (5d6) cold and 17 (5d6) psychic and must use its reaction to move its full speed away from despair and anger by safest available route unless there is nowhere to move this move doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks (DC 16 Wis half damage and doesn’t move away).

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Aspect:** Changes aspect in control. Only one active at a time. Creature grappled by despair no longer grappled by anger.
