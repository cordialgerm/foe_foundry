### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience.** The gorgon is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Trampling Charge.** If the gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the gorgon can make one Hooves attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The gorgon makes one Gore attack and one Hooves attack.
- **Gore.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The gorgon exhales poisonous, petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 CON save. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and is restrained as it begins to turn to stone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t restrained. A restrained creature must repeat the save at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the creature. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

### Reactions

- **Poisonous Retort.** When the gorgon is hit by an attack from a creature it can see within 10 feet of it, the gorgon can snort angrily, releasing a puff of poisonous gas at the creature. The attacker must succeed on a DC 16 CON save or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.
