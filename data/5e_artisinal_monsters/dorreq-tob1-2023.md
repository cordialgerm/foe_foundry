### Special Abilities

- **Void Warping:** The area around the dorreq is warped by its connection to the Void. A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the dorreq must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dorreq makes one Bite attack and two Tentacles attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Tentacles:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 14) and pulled up to 5 feet closer to the dorreq. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The dorreq can grapple up to two creatures at a time.
- **Void Thrum (Recharge 5â€“6):** The dorreq emits a barely audible, vibrating thrum laced with Void energy. Each creature within 20 feet of the dorreq must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) thunder damage and 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Bonus Actions

- **Stone Step:** The dorreq teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. The origin and destination spaces must contain a stone or rocky surface, such as a cliff face or rocky terrain.
