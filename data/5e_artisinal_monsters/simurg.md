### Special Abilities

- **Flyby:** The simurg doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
- **Keen Sight:** The simurg has advantage on Perception (Wisdom) checks that rely on sight.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The simurg's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14). The simurg can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: detect poison and disease, detect thoughts, spare the dying
2/day each: cure wounds, lesser restoration, purify food and drink
1/day each: greater restoration, remove curse

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The simurg makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Forceful Gale (Recharge 5-6):** The simurg beats its wings, creating wind in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage, is pushed 10 feet away from the simurg and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.
