- **Stone Camouflage.** The xorn’s Stealth is 18 while in rocky terrain.
- **Treasure Sense.** The xorn can pinpoint, by scent, the location of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 60 feet of it.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The xorn makes one Bite attack and three Claw attacks, or it makes three Lob Stone attacks.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Lob Stone.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shard Belch.** The xorn belches a mixture of stomach gas and crystalline shards in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 DEX save or be coated in miniscule, crystalline shards until the end of its next turn. A creature coated in shards suffers bouts of pain each time it moves, reducing its speed by 10 feet and imposing disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.
