- **Beak:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d6+6) piercing damage.
- **Talons:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d6+6) slashing damage  and the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends  the target is restrained  and the roc can't attack a different target with its talons.

### Reactions

- **Retributive Strike:** When a creature the roc can see hits it with a melee weapon attack, the roc makes a beak attack against its attacker.
