### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sulsha makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its slam, and one with its tail spur. Alternatively, it makes two bomb attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

- **Bomb:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Terrifying Display (Recharge 5-6):** The sulsha beats furiously on its chest and hollers with rage. Each creature within 30 feet of the sulsha that can see or hear it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
