### Special Abilities

- **Point Blank Fencer:** A rapier deals one extra die of its damage when the city watch captain hits with it (included in the attack). In addition, the captain ignores the loading property of crossbows and doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll with a crossbow from being within 5 feet of a hostile creature. The captain may still have disadvantage on such an attack from other sources.
- **Tactical Insight:** The city watch captain has advantage on initiative rolls, and friendly creatures within 30 feet of the captain and under the captain’s command can choose to take the captain’s initiative instead of their own when combat starts.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The city watch captain can use its Issue Orders. It then makes two Rapier attacks or three Light Crossbow attacks, or it makes one Rapier attack and two Light Crossbow attacks.
- **Rapier:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the city watch captain can force the target to drop one weapon it is wielding or drop one item it is carrying. If the captain chooses to make the target drop an item, the item can’t be wrapped around or firmly attached to the target, such as a shirt or armor. The item lands in a space of the captain’s choice within 5 feet of the target.
- **Light Crossbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Issue Orders:** The city watch captain shouts orders at up to two friendly creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target can do one of the following as a reaction:
