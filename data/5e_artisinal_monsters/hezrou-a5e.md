### Special Abilities

- **Chaotic Evil:** The hezrou radiates a Chaotic and Evil aura.
- **Magic Resistance:** The hezrou has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hezrou makes one attack with its bite and one with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends  the target is restrained  and the hezrou can't bite another target.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Swallow:** The hezrou makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits and the hezrou has not swallowed another creature  the target is swallowed and the grapple ends. A swallowed creature has total cover from attacks from outside the hezrou  it is blinded and restrained  and it takes 17 (5d6) ongoing acid damage while swallowed.
- **If a swallowed creature deals 25 or more damage to the hezrou in a single turn, or if the hezrou dies, the hezrou vomits up the creature:** 
- **Darkness:** Magical darkness spreads from a point within 30 feet  filling a 15-foot-radius sphere and spreading around corners. It remains for 1 minute  until the hezrou dismisses it  or until the hezrou uses this ability again. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

### Reactions

- **Stench (1/Day):** When hit by a melee attack, the hezrou emits a cloud of foul-smelling poison gas in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is poisoned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success
