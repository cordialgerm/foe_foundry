### Special Abilities

- **Air Senses:** Can’t use blindsight underwater or in an area with o air.
- **Air Weapons:** When it attacks it conjures a weapon out of the air itself weapon appearing and disappearing in the blink of an eye. Air weapon is a swirl of wind in the shape of a simple or martial weapon but always deals 2d6 damage of the same type as that weapon. Air weapon shaped like a ranged weapon uses the range of that weapon except acolyte doesn’t have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls when attacking a target beyond weapon’s normal range. Air weapons don’t use any other weapon properties of weapons they mimic. Air weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Three Air Weapon attacks. If acolyte hits one creature with two Air Weapon attacks target: DC 15 Str save or be pushed up to 15 ft. away from acolyte.
- **Air Weapon:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit 10 ft. or range defined by chosen weapon one target 12 (2d6+5) bludgeoning damage slashing or piercing as defined by chosen weapon.
- **Wind’s Rebuke (Recharge 6):** Draws breath out of one creature it can see within 60' of it. Target: DC 15 Con save. Fail: all of the breath is drawn from target’s lungs and it immediately begins suffocating for 1 min or until it falls unconscious. It can re-save at end of each of its turns success ends effect on itself.

### Reactions

- **Buoying Wind:** Summons winds to break the fall of up to 5 falling creatures it can see within 60' of it. A falling creature’s rate of descent slows to 60' per round for 1 min. If a falling creature lands before effect ends it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet.
- **Drift:** When a creature moves to within 15 ft. of the wind acolyte the acolyte can fly up to half its flying speed.
