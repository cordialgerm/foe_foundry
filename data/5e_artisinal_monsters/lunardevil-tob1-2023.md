### Special Abilities

- **Devil’s Sight:** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the lunar devil’s darkvision.
- **Light Incorporeality:** The lunar devil is translucent when standing in moonlight and is immune to damage from all nonmagical weapons in such conditions.
- **Lightwalking:** Once on its turn, the lunar devil can use half its movement to step magically into one area of moonlight within its reach and emerge from a second area of moonlight within 80 feet of the first, appearing in an unoccupied space within that second area.
- **Magic Resistance:** The lunar devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The lunar devil makes one Bite attack, one Claw attack, and one Tail attack, or it makes three Hurl Moonlight attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Hurl Moonlight:** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of its next turn.
- **Summon Devil (1/Day):** The lunar devil magically calls 1d4 giant owls that are Fiends with the lunar devil’s damage resistances and immunities (but not its Light Incorporeality trait). The lunar devil has a 25 percent chance of calling one lunar devil instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the devil and obeying its telepathic commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the devil dies, or until the devil dismisses them as a bonus action.
- **Spellcasting:** The lunar devil casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):<br>At will: fly, major image<br>3/day: greater invisibility<br>1/day: wall of ice
