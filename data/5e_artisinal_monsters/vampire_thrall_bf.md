### Special Abilities

- **Blood-Bound** . If the thrall has not consumed 1 ounce of blood from a vampire within the past week, it is poisoned for 1 week, and it loses darkvision and its Limited Regeneration, Spider Climb, and Sunlight Sensitivity traits until it consumes 1 ounce of vampire blood.
- **Limited Regeneration** . The thrall regains 2 HP at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 HP and isn’t in sunlight. If the thrall takes radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the thrall’s next turn.
- **Spider Climb** . The thrall can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity** . While in sunlight, the thrall has disadvantage on attack rolls, and its Perception is 8 when perceiving by sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The vampire thrall makes two Rapier attacks.
- **Rapier.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

### Reactions

- **Repay the Gift.** When a friendly vampire the thrall can see within 5 feet of it is hit by an attack that would reduce the vampire to 0 HP, the thrall can give some of its life force to save the vampire. The thrall loses 10 (3d6) HP, and the vampire regains HP equal to that amount.
