### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The death dog attacks twice with its bite.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature  it makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  it becomes infected with a disease. Until this disease is cured  the target is poisoned. While diseased  the target makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw every 24 hours  reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure and ending the disease on a success. This hit point maximum reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.
