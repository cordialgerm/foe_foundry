### Special Abilities

- **Giant Attributes.** The stone giant is resistant to the stunned condition, and it is vulnerable to the prone condition.
- **Stone Camouflage.** The giant’s Stealth is 20 while in rocky terrain.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The giant makes two Stony Fist or Rock attacks.
- **Stony Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (4d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 17) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the stone giant isn’t already grappling a creature.
- **Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 STR save or be knocked prone.

### Bonus Actions

- **Wrestle.** The stone giant performs one of the following wrestling maneuvers against one creature it is grappling. The target must succeed on a DC 17 STR save or suffer the listed effect until the stone giant uses this bonus action again or until the grapple ends.
	- Armbar. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and on checks made to escape the grapple.
	- Chinlock. The target can’t speak and can’t cast spells with verbal components.
	- Takedown. The target is knocked prone and restrained.
	- Throw. The target is thrown up to 30 feet in a random direction and knocked prone, ending the grapple. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 DEX save or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

### Reactions

- **Missile Deflection.** If a creature the giant can see makes a ranged weapon attack against the giant, the giant can add 3 to its AC. If the attack misses, the giant can catch the missile, provided the attack included a projectile, and throw it back at the attacker, using the giant’s normal ranged weapon attack bonus and the weapon’s normal damage.
