### Special Abilities

- **Ice Glide:** The elemental can burrow through nonmagical ice. While doing so, the elemental doesn’t disturb the material it moves through.
- **Ice Walk:** The ice elemental can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra movement.
- **Splinter:** A creature that hits the ice elemental with a melee weapon attack that deals bludgeoning damage while within 5 feet of the elemental takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage as shards of ice fly out from the elemental’s body.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ice elemental makes two ice claw attacks.
- **Ice Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (4d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Encase in Ice:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft. one creature. Hit: 14 (4d6) cold damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, ice begins to form around the creature, and it is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified in ice on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature spends at least 1 hour in a warm environment. Alternatively, a creature can be freed of the restrained or petrified conditions if it takes at least 10 fire damage.
