### Special Abilities

- **Fey Ancestry:** The shadow fey guardian has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put it to sleep.
- **Shadow’s Vigil:** The guardian has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and magical darkness doesn’t impede the guardian’s darkvision.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The shadow fey guardian makes two Pike or Javelin attacks.
- **Pike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Javelin:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Traveler (2/Day):** While in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.

### Reactions

- **Protective Interference:** When a friendly creature the shadow fey guardian can see within 5 feet of it is the target of an attack, the guardian can impose disadvantage on the attack roll. To do so, the guardian must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
