### Special Abilities

- **Boil Over.** When the red dragon hasn’t unleashed its Fire Breath, the heat builds and rolls outward from it. While the dragon’s Fire Breath is available, it emits immense heat, and each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 17 CON save or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 DEX save, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
