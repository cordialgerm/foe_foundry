### Special Abilities

- **Pounce.** If the dragon moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 12 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the dragon can make one Claw attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The dragon makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon exhales fire in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11 DEX save, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Sleep Breath (Recharge 6).** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or fall unconscious for 1 minute. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.
