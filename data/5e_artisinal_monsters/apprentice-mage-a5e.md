 prestidigitation
 1st-level (3 slots): detect magic
 magic missile

### Actions

- **Fire Bolt (Cantrip; V, S):** Ranged Spell Attack: +4 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d10) fire damage.
- **Magic Missile (1st-Level; V, S):** Three glowing arrows fly from the mage simultaneously  unerringly hitting up to 3 creatures within 120 feet. Each arrow deals 3 (1d4 + 1) force damage.

### Reactions

- **Shield (1st-Level; V:** When the mage is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of their next turn.
- **Whether a student attending a wizard college or serving a crotchety master:** Apprentice mage statistics can also be used to represent an older hedge wizard of limited accomplishments.
