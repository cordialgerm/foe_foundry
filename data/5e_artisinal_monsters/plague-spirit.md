### Special Abilities

- **Decrepit Mist:** A cloud of green mist with a diameter of 1 mile and height of 60 feet is centered on the spirit. For each day a creature spends in the mist, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or increase in age by 5 percent of its total life span. The mist has no effect on undead or constructs.
- **Hunter of the Living:** The plague spirit can magically sense the general direction of the largest concentration of living flora and fauna within 50 miles of it.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The plague spirit makes three attacks: one with its enfeebling touch and two with its censer.
- **Censer:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Enfeebling Touch:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and the target’s Strength score is reduced by 1d6. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.
- **Dance of Death (Recharge 5-6):** The plague spirit dances and twirls its censer. Each creature within 20 feet of the plague spirit that can see it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) necrotic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
