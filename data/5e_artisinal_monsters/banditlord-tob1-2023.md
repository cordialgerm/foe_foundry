### Special Abilities

- **Brute:** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the bandit lord hits with it (included in the attack).
- **Pack Tactics:** The bandit lord has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the bandit lord’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The bandit lord makes two Longsword attacks and one Dagger attack.
- **Longsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.
- **Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, or 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage if used to make a melee attack.
- **Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** For 1 minute, the bandit lord can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the bandit lord. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the bandit lord is incapacitated.

### Reactions

- **Parry:** The bandit lord adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the bandit lord must see the attacker and be wielding a weapon.
- **Protect Me!</strong></em> When a creature the bandit lord can see targets it with an attack, the bandit lord can sidestep behind an ally within 5 feet of it, moving to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the ally. The chosen ally becomes the target of the attack instead.</p>

<p data-content-chunk-id="217d742b-35f0-46a5-90c8-dbbfffefdd9c">The black knight commander strikes an imposing figure upon its chosen mount; one that inspires bloodlust in its allies and fear in its foes. Devoted to its own twisted code, the black knight commander has a sense of honor but spares no compassion for those who stand in its way. Whether the knight fights for a dark lord or a demonic god, all its foes will be trampled into the dust and their families slaughtered so there can be no revenge. The only victory is a total victory.</p>
