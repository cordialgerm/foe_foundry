### Special Abilities

- **Scourge of the Seekers:** The sentinel has advantage on attack rolls against creatures with darkvision, blindsight, or truesight.
- **Vault Keeper:** Secret doors and illusory walls within 1,500 feet of the sentinel have the DC to detect their presence increased by 5.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sentinel makes two stone fist attacks. If both attacks hit a Large or smaller creature, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or lose one non-weapon, non-armor object that is small enough to fit in one hand. The object is teleported to a random unoccupied space within 200 feet of the sentinel. The target feels a mental tug in the general direction of the item until it is recovered.
- **Stone Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Curse of the Wanderer (Recharge 6):** One creature the sentinel can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the Curse of the Wanderer. While cursed, the creature's speed is halved and it can't regain hp. For every 24 hours it goes without discovering or learning new information, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.
