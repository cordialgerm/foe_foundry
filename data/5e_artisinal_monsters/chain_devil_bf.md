### Special Abilities

- **Devil’s Sight.** Magical darkness doesn’t impede the devil’s darkvision.
- **Devilish Resilience.** The devil is resistant to cold damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, it is immune to fire damage and poison damage and to the poisoned condition.
- **Magic Resistance.** The devil has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The devil makes four Chain attacks.
- **Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 14 (4d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns, and the chain devil can’t use the same Chain on another target.

### Bonus Actions

- **Animate Chains.** The chain devil commands chains it can see within 60 feet of it that aren’t being worn or carried to grab up to two creatures it can see within 10 feet of at least one commanded chain. Each creature must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or be restrained. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 15 STR check.

### Reactions

- **Unnerving Mask.** When a creature the devil can see starts its turn within 30 feet of the devil, the devil can command its mask to shift to look like one of the creature’s departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see the mask, it must succeed on a DC 15 WIS save or be frightened until the end of its turn.
