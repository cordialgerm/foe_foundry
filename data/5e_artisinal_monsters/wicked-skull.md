### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance (Object Form Only):** While the wicked skull remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.
- **Jokester:** The wicked skull has advantage on a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) check if it includes mockery or a joke or riddle as part of the check.
- **Shapechanger:** The wicked skull can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny object or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isnâ€™t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

### Actions

- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Petty Mockery:** The wicked skull unleashes a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature it can see within 60 feet. If the target can hear the wicked skull (though it does not have to understand it), the target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
