### Special Abilities

- **Acidic Slime:** A creature that touches the primal oozer or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) acid damage.
- **Ooze Plague:** The primal oozer’s barbed tentacles inject the ooze plague disease into a creature if the creature fails its saving throw after being bitten twice in a row by the oozer. Until the disease is cured, the infected creature’s skin slowly becomes more ooze-like, and its hp maximum decreases by 5 (2d4) for every 24 hours that elapse. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this disease rises 24 hours later as an ochre jelly. The jelly isn’t under the primal oozer’s control, but it views the primal oozer as an ally.
- **Pack Tactics:** The primal oozer has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the primal oozer’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
- **Slimy Body:** The primal oozer has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The primal oozer makes two bite attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) acid damage and contracts a disease (see the Ooze Plague trait). On a success, the target takes half the damage and doesn’t contract a disease.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
