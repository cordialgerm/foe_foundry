### Special Abilities

- **Fire and Light:** The zoryas' weapon attacks are magical. When the zoryas hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 radiant or fire damage (included in the attack). The zoryas chooses whether its attack does radiant or fire damage before making the attack roll.
- **Open Celestial Gate:** As an action, the zoryas opens a gateway to the celestial plane. The gate appears as a shimmering circle that sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet and is framed by twisting, golden strands. The gate lasts 1 hour; though, the zoryas can choose to close it at any time as a bonus action. Once the gate closes, the zoryas is reduced to 0 hp and remains unconscious for six days, awakening, fully restored, at sunrise on the seventh day. The zoryas can't pass through its own gate.
- **Regeneration:** The zoryas regains 10 hp at the start of its turn. If the zoryas takes necrotic damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the zoryas' next turn. The zoryas' body is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn't regenerate.
- **Sun's Guidance (3/Day):** The zoryas has advantage on melee attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The angel makes two morningstar attacks.
- **Morningstar:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) radiant or fire damage.
- **Light of Dawn (Recharges after a Long Rest):** The zoryas' lantern brightens, bathing its environs in brilliant light. Each creature within 30 feet of the zoryas must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. An undead creature who fails this save also takes 13 (3d8) fire damage. The light dispels up to three spells or other magical effects of 3rd level or lower like the dispel magic spell within the area.
- **Dusk's Arrival (Recharges after a Long Rest):** The zoryas' lantern darkens, snuffing out nearby natural and magical sources of light. Each creature within 30 feet of the zoryas must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area is bathed in darkness like the darkness spell until the end of the zoryas' next turn.
