### Special Abilities

- **Apostasy Aura:** The idolic deity’s presence causes devout followers to doubt their faith. When a creature attempts to use divine or celestial power, such as a cleric casting a spell or a paladin using Divine Smite, it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the spell, class feature, or other divine or celestial power is expended, but it has no effect.
- **Construct Nature:** The idolic deity doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **False Appearance:** While the idolic deity remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** The idolic deity can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The idolic deity can use its Seduce the Righteous. It then makes two Slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) psychic damage.
- **Seduce the Righteous:** The idolic deity corrupts one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws (the idolic deity’s choice) until the end of its next turn. Creatures that wield divine or celestial power, such as clerics, paladins, or aasimars, have disadvantage on the saving throw.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Stealth:** While in dim light or darkness, the idolic deity takes the Hide action.
