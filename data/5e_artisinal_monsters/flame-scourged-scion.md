### Special Abilities

- **Burning Rage:** When a flame-scourged scion takes fire damage, it has advantage on its attack rolls until the end of its next turn. If it takes more than 5 fire damage, it has advantage on its attack rolls for 2 rounds.
- **Firesight:** A flame-scourged scion can see through areas obscured by fire, smoke, and fog without penalty.
- **Groundbreaker:** Difficult terrain caused by rocks, sand, or natural vegetation, living or dead, doesn't cost the flamescourged scion extra movement. Its speed can't be reduced by any effect.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The flame-scourged scion makes three tentacle attacks.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, the flame-scourged scion can automatically hit the target with its tentacle, and it can't use the same tentacle on another target. The flame-scourged scion can grapple up to two creatures at one time.
- **Embers (Recharge 6):** The flame-scourged scion fills the area around itself with a cloud of burning embers. Each creature within 10 feet of the flame-scourged scion must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The embers die out within moments.
