- **Keen Smell:** Advantage: smell Wis (Percept) checks.
- **Relentless (Recharge: Short/Long Rest):** If it takes 15 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hp it is reduced to 1 hp instead.
- **Trampling Charge:** If it moves 20'+ straight toward a creature and then hits it with Bite on the same turn that target must make DC 13 Str save or be knocked prone. If target is prone daeodon can make one Slam vs. it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** One Bite attack and one Slam attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 14 (2d8+5) piercing damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends the target is restrained and the daeodon can’t Bite another target.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 10 (2d4+5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Fierce Call (Recharge: Short/Long Rest):** Lets out a loud fearsome call. Each hostile creature within 60' of the daeodon must make DC 13 Wis save or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for 1 min. While frightened a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the daeodon by the safest available route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened creature can re-save at end of each of its turns success ends effect on itself.
