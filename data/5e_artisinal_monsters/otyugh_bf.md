### Special Abilities

- **Aberrant Resilience.** The otyugh is resistant to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, and it has advantage on saves against spells or effects that would alter its form.
- **Limited Telepathy.** The otyugh can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn’t allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.
- **Stench.** Each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the otyugh must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The otyugh makes one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks. It can replace both Tentacle attacks with a use of Tentacle Slam.
- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or become infected with a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target is poisoned. Every 24 hours that elapse, the infected creature must repeat the save, reducing its HP maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The creature dies if the disease reduces its HP maximum to 0. This reduction to the creature’s HP maximum lasts until it finishes a long rest after the disease is cured.
- **Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13). The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.
- **Tentacle Slam.** The otyugh slams creatures grappled by it into each other or into a solid surface. Each creature must make a DC 15 STR save. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned.
