### Special Abilities

- **Charge:** If the mountain strider moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a headbutt attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the mountain strider and knocked prone.
- **Sure-Footed:** The mountain strider has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.

### Actions

- **Headbutt:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Spear:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
- **Thunderous Bleat (Recharge 6):** The mountain strider releases a loud bleat in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Revenge for the Fallen:** When an ally the mountain strider can see is reduced to 0 hp within 30 feet of the mountain strider, the strider can move up to half its speed and make a headbutt attack.
