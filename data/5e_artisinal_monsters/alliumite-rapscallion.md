### Special Abilities

- **Plant Camouflage:** Advantage on Dex (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life.
- **Tearful Stench:** Each creature other than an alliumite within 5 ft. of alliumite when it takes damage: DC 14 Con save or be blinded until start of creature’s next turn. On a successful save creature is immune to Tearful Stench of all alliumites for 1 min.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Two Thorny Rapiers or one Thorny Rapier and one Grappelvine Whip.
- **Thorny Rapier:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 8 (1d8+4) piercing damage + 3 (1d6) slashing damage.
- **Grapplevine Whip:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, 10 ft., one target, 9 (2d4+4) slashing damage. If target is holding a weapon it must make DC 14 Str save or drop the weapon. If it is holding more than one weapon it drops only one.

### Reactions

- **Grapplevine Escape:** When a creature rapscallion can see hits it with melee attack can use its whip to swing up to 20' away from attacker provided nearby terrain includes a feature it can use to swing (branch chandelier ledge mast railing or similar). This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
- **Pungent Retort:** When a creature rapscallion can see within 60' of it starts its turn or casts a spell rapscallion issues forth a string of insults cleverly crafted to make a foe cry. If it can hear the rapscallion target: DC 14 Wis save or sob uncontrollably until start of rapscallion’s next turn. A sobbing creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls and must make DC 14 Con save to cast a spell that requires spellcaster to see its target. Spellcaster doesn’t lose the spell slot on a failure.
