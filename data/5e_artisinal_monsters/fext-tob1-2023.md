### Special Abilities

- **Eldritch Weapons:** The fext’s weapon attacks are magical. When the fext hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 force damage (included in the attack).
- **Magic Resistance:** The fext has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Patron’s Blessing:** While the fext is conscious and wearing no armor and wielding no shield, it adds its Charisma modifier to its AC (included above).
- **Undead Nature:** The fext doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fext makes two Eldritch Blade or Eldritch Fury attacks.
- **Eldritch Blade:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) force damage.
- **Eldritch Fury:** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) force damage.
- **Patron’s Might (Recharge 5–6):** The fext channels its patron’s awe-inspiring presence, terrifying those nearby. Each creature within 10 feet of the fext must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) psychic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
