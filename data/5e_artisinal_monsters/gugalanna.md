Gugalanna can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Gugalanna regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Kick:** Gugalanna makes a kick attack.
- **Rearing Stomp (Costs 2 Actions):** Gugalanna spreads his wings and stomps his hooves, shaking the earth. Each creature within 10 feet of Gugalanna must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 20 feet away from Gugalanna. On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn't pushed. Gugalanna can then fly up to half his flying speed.
- **Blazing Sun Disc (Costs 2 Actions, Recharge 5-6):** The sun disc floating between Gugalanna's horns flares. Each creature within 30 feet of Gugalanna must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
