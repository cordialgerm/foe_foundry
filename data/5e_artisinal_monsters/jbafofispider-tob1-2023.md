### Special Abilities

- **Camouflaged Webs:** With 10 minutes of work, the j’ba fofi can create a camouflaged web in a 10-foot cube. The web must be anchored between two solid mases or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. A camouflaged web layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. The web is camouflaged to match its surroundings, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice them. Each creature that starts its turn in the camouflaged web or that enters it during the creature’s turn must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to break the webbing and free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
- **Forest Camouflage:** The j’ba fofi has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forested terrain.
- **Spider Climb:** The j’ba fofi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Spider Passivism:** No spider can willingly attack the j’ba fofi, unless attacked first. A spider can be forced to do so through magical means.
- **Web Sense:** While in contact with a web, the j’ba fofi knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.
- **Web Walker:** The j’ba fofi ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
- **Call Spiderlings (1/Day):** The j’ba fofi releases pheromones and calls 1 swarm of spiders. The spiders arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the j’ba fofi and obeying its pheromone commands. The spiders remain for 1 hour, until the j’ba fofi dies, or until the j’ba fofi dismisses them as a bonus action.
