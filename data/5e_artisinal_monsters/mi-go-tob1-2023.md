### Special Abilities

- **Deathly Spores:** When a mi-go dies, its body crumbles into millions of spores. Each creature within 10 feet of the mi-go must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) poison damage and be poisoned until the end of its next turn.
- **Void Traveler:** The mi-go doesn’t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure. It requires only minimal exposure to starlight a few times each year to sustain itself.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The mi-go makes two Claw or Psychic Bolt attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature.
- **Psychic Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d6 + 7) psychic damage.
- **Spore Burst (Recharge 5–6):** The mi-go releases hallucinogenic spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t incapacitated.
