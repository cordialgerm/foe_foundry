### Actions

- **Sacrificial Dagger.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) slashing damage. If the target is paralyzed, prone, stunned, or unconscious, it takes an extra 2 (1d4) slashing damage.

### Reactions

- **For the Cause!** When a friendly creature the cultist can see within 5 feet of it is hit by an attack that would reduce that creature to 0 HP, the cultist can leap in front of the attack, taking the damage instead.
