- **Spell Eater:** If the carnivorous sod is in an area targeted by a spell that enhances plants in that area, such as the entangle, plant growth, and spike growth spells, the carnivorous sod absorbs the spell, ending it, and gains 10 temporary hp for each level of the spell it absorbed for 1 hour.
- **Tripping Grass:** If the carnivorous sod didn’t move on its previous turn and hits a target with its Grass Trip, it can make one attack with its bite as a bonus action.
