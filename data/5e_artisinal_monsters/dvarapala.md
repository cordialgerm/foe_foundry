- **Divine Words:** In addition to Common, a dvarapala can speak one language associated with its patron deity: Abyssal (chaotic or neutral evil deities), Celestial (good deities), or Infernal (lawful evil deities). A dvarapala who serves a neutral deity knows a language that is most appropriate for service to its deity (such as Primordial for a neutral god of elementals or Sylvan for a neutral god of nature).

- **Magic Resistance:** The dvarapala has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
