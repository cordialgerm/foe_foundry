### Special Abilities

- **Spider Climb.** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.
- **Web Walker.** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions

- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 13 CON save, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 HP, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining HP, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

### Bonus Actions

- **Web (Recharge 4–6).** The spider launches a gob of webbing at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 DEX save or be restrained. A creature, including the restrained target, can take its action to free the target from the webbing by succeeding on a DC 12 STR check. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; HP 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
