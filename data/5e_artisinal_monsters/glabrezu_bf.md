### Special Abilities

- **Demonic Resilience.** The glabrezu is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage. In addition, it is immune to poison damage and to the poisoned condition.
- **Magic Resistance.** The glabrezu has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.
- **Point Blank Grappler.** When the glabrezu makes a Crackling Flame Bolt attack, it doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll from being within 5 feet of a hostile creature, provided it is grappling that creature.

### Actions

- **Multiattack.** The glabrezu makes two Claw attacks and two Pincer attacks, or it makes four Crackling Flame Bolt attacks. It can replace both Claw attacks with two Crackling Flame Bolt attacks.
- **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage and 3 (1d6) lightning damage.
- **Pincer.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). The glabrezu has two pincers, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Crackling Flame Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) fire damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Manipulating Whispers.** The glabrezu whispers in the mind of one creature it can see within 120 feet of it, encouraging the creature to commit wicked acts. The target must succeed on a DC 17 CHA save or succumb to one of the following urges:
	- Boastful Stance. The target is overcome with surety of its own battle prowess, momentarily letting down its guard. Creatures have advantage on attack rolls against the target until the start of the glabrezu’s next turn.
	- Confirmation of Wealth. The target is briefly overcome with the desire to confirm the amount and status of its valuables. It uses either an action or bonus action on its next turn (the glabrezu’s choice) to count and take stock of its valuables.
	- Wrathful Strike. Anger temporarily fills the target, and it immediately lashes out at those nearby. The target uses its reaction to make one melee weapon attack against a creature of the glabrezu’s choice within 5 feet of the target.
