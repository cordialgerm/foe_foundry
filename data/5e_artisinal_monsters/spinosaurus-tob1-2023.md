### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath:** The spinosaurus can hold its breath for 1 hour.
- **Reptilian Affinity:** The spinosaurus never willingly attacks a reptilian Humanoid, such as a lizardfolk or dragonborn, unless attacked first. If magically forced to attack such a creature, the spinosaurus has disadvantage on attack rolls against it. This trait doesn’t function if the spinosaurus’s rider or tamer directs it to attack.
- **Siege Monster:** The spinosaurus deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The spinosaurus makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 33 (4d12 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the spinosaurus can’t Bite another target.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (4d6 + 7) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the spinosaurus’ choice that is within 120 feet of the spinosaurus and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the spinosaurus’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

The spinosaurus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The spinosaurus regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
