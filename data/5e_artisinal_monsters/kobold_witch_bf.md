- **Eldritch Burst.** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) force damage.
- **Spellcasting.** The kobold witch casts one of the following spells, using CHA as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15).
	- At will: disguise self, druidcraft, guidance
	- 2/day each: command, ray of enfeeblement
	- 1/day: bestow curse

### Bonus Actions

- **Scurry.** The kobold moves up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. If the kobold is aware of traps in the area, the kobold can choose if this movement triggers any of them.
- **Witch’s Cauldron.** The kobold witch ladles steaming brew out of a small cauldron it is holding and flings the substance at one friendly creature it can see within 15 feet of it. The target gains 5 (2d4) temporary HP until the start of the witch’s next turn.

### Reactions

- **Hex.** When a creature the kobold witch can see within 60 feet of it makes an ability check, attack roll, or save, the target must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from that ability check, attack roll, or save.
