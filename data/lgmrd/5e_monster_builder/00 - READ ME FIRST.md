This is the [The Lazy GM's 5e Monster Builder Resource Document](https://github.com/crit-tech/LGMRD?tab=readme-ov-file) (LGMMBRD) in Markdown format for use in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

LGMMBRD is officially pronounced "Lymm Bard".

## Fantasy Statblocks plugin

In the Statblocks folder, there are statblocks in a format that can be used with the [Fantasy Statblocks](https://plugins.javalent.com/statblocks) plugin. If you don't have it installed, you can still use the rest of the LGMMBRD, but you won't be able to see the statblocks in a nice format.

These can also be imported into your [Bestiary](https://plugins.javalent.com/statblocks/readme/bestiary#Accessing%20the%20bestiary).

## Force note view mode by front matter

Install this plugin to force the view of the content to always be in preview mode. The files already have `obsidianUIMode` set to `preview` in the front matter.
