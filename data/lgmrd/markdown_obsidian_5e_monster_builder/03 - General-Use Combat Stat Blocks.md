This section contains several general-use stat blocks specifically built for reskinning into whatever monsters you need for your combat encounters.

Each stat block uses d8 Hit Dice, but can be used for creatures in a range of sizes. Each focuses on a primary ability score, but you can shift abilities as needed to better fit the story of the creature the stat block represents. Swap Strength and Intelligence to run a spellcaster instead of a melee combatant, or switch Dexterity and Strength to turn a shifty rogue into a powerful fighter.

A stat block's attack lets you choose the most appropriate type of damage for a creature, and you can easily increase an attack's reach or range. Ranges for attacks are given as a single number indicating maximum range, but you can modify that range or replace it with the normal and long range of a specific weapon as you wish.

The spread of challenge ratings of these stat blocks provides options for weak, moderate, and strong foes at any character level. Each stat block description includes comparisons between the stat block and characters of different levels, providing guidelines for when a stat block can serve as a boss, an elite foe (suitable for two characters against one creature), or a one-on-one combatant, or in larger groups of two to four monsters per character. All these setups are geared toward a hard encounter, but one that the characters should definitely be able to win.

## Minion (CR 1/8)

The low-CR minions represented by this stat block might include ravenous rats, weak skeletons, shifty bandits, or low-ranking cultists. A minion can serve as a one-on-one combatant against 1st-level characters, or can be deployed in large groups at 4th level or above. This stat block focuses on Dexterity as its primary ability.
