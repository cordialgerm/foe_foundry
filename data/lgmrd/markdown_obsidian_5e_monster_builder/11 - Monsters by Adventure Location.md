This section offers quick starting points for building encounters, in the form of tables that cover a broad range of foes in twelve types of common adventure location. The tables serve four purposes:

* They show which creatures might inhabit a particular adventure location.
* They highlight foes appropriate for a given level range in that location.
* They show which foes might naturally pair up with other foes.
* They offer example relationships between creatures and suggest what they might be doing in a location.

Though you can use the setups in the tables directly, you'll get even more value from them by customizing your own list of foes for these common locations and scenariosâ€”or by adding environments and scenarios that fit the specifics of your campaign.

Each line in the "Example Encounters" column contains an example encounter with multiple monsters. You can decide how many monsters are appropriate given the scenario, the number of characters, and their level.

Monsters who are in **bold** represent potential bosses for an encounter.
