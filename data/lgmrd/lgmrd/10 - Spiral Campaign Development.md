Spiral campaign development builds campaign worlds starting in the area immediately surrounding the characters, then spirals out, expanding the world as the characters experience it. This section offers suggestions and inspiration for building a spiral campaign.

## Campaign Pitch

Start off by describing the central theme of your campaign in a single sentence. This campaign pitch becomes the main focus of the campaign, and might be given to the players during your session zero so they can build their characters around it. Use the following campaign pitches as a starting point for a campaign, or as inspiration for pitches of your own.

## Six Truths

Once you have your pitch, identify six truths that set your campaign apart from others, then share them with your players. Here are six example truths for a campaign built around the coming of the Black Moon from above.

* Sages and cultists describe the coming of the Black Moon â€” an elder evil that will swallow the world.
* Monsters have been sighted along what were once the safest roads. The populations of whole villages are disappearing without a trace.
* A floating obsidian citadel has appeared above the Cragteeth Mountains to the north.
* Folk once had to deal with the coming of the Black Moon, but their secrets for surviving it were lost.
* The evil King Trex uses the chaos created by the coming of the Black Moon to wage war across the land.
* Prophecy speaks of the return of the Knights of the White Sun, who will restore light to the land.

## Starting Location

Spiral campaigns begin in a central location, often a small settlement from which the characters set out to explore neighboring lands. A village always works well as a starting location, but there are many alternatives.

## Campaign Fronts

Campaign fronts are the external motivators in a campaign. Like a battlefront (from which they're named), a front is a point of conflict that advances and retreats as the campaign develops. Fronts are often villains, but might also be external forces such as natural disasters or grim fate. Campaigns might have up to three fronts at any given time, including any of the following.
