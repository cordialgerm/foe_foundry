This is the [Lazy GM's Resource Document](https://github.com/crit-tech/LGMRD?tab=readme-ov-file) (LGMRD) in Markdown format for use in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

LGMRD is officially pronounced "Lymm Grid".

## Dice Roller plugin

Many of the Markdown files assume that you have the [Dice Roller](https://plugins.javalent.com/Dice+Roller/Dice+Roller) plugin installed. If you don't have it installed, you can still use the LGMRD, but you won't be able to roll dice directly from the document.

Dice rolls are inserted before all random tables.

## Force note view mode by front matter

Install this plugin to force the view of the content to always be in preview mode. The files already have `obsidianUIMode` set to `preview` in the front matter.
