Representing seasoned guards, trained soldiers, powerful bandits, murderous humanoids, or armed undead, the soldier stat block works well as a boss at 1st level, an elite foe for two 2nd-level characters, or one-on-one combatants at 4th level, or in large groups at 6th level and above. Strength is this stat block's primary ability.
