# The Lazy GM's Resource Document

This is the [Lazy GM's Resource Document](https://slyflourish.com/lazy_gm_resource_document.html) as a JavaScript package (both ESM and CommonJS supported).

LGMRD is officially pronounced "Lymm Grid" and [LGMMBRD](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@crit-tech/lgmmbrd) "Lymm Bard".

## Usage

### ESM

```js
import lgmrd from "@crit-tech/lgmrd";

console.log(lgmrd);
```

Or, you may want to import it asynchronously so it's not part of your main bundle:

```js
import("@crit-tech/lgmrd").then((lgmrd) => {
  console.log(lgmrd);
});
```

Or, you can just import specific sections (see `package.json` for the full list of exported sections):

```js
import data from "@crit-tech/lgmrd/index/default";

console.log(data);
```

### CommonJS

```js
const lgmrd = require("@crit-tech/lgmrd");

console.log(lgmrd);
```

Or, you can just import specific sections (see `package.json` for the full list of exported sections):

```js
const data = require("@crit-tech/lgmrd/index/default");

console.log(data);
```
