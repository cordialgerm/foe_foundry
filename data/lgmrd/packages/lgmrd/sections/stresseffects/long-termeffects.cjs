        'GMs and players can work together to determine whether stress effects have longer-term ramifications. Any such long-term results should reflect not just the character and the situation, but also the players\' desires.\n\nBe mindful to avoid terms such as "madness" or "crazy" to describe the long-term effects of stressful encounters. Consider instead the otherworldly nature of the situation and effect, and focus on how the character might respond to such a stressful experience.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Megan Connell and Dr. Michael Mallen for their feedback on this section.',
