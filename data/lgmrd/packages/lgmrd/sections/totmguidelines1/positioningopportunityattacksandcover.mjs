Examples of movement in the theater of the mind might include moving next to an ally, moving next to two enemies, or staying out of reach while attacking with a polearm.\n\nIf a creature is within an enemy's reach, it will likely provoke an opportunity attack if it tries to move away from that enemy. Creatures able to disengage can do so and avoid opportunity attacks.\n\nAs you describe the features of the area, make a note of which ones can provide cover to the characters or their enemies, and how much cover.",
