        "Players love magic items, and it's worthwhile to spend time preparing items they'll find interesting. This step also helps to directly impact the characters â€” by dropping an interesting part of the story literally into their hands. You can use a mixture of techniques to reward magic items, from selecting items randomly to selecting specific items based on the themes of the characters and the desires of the players. Magic items are also a great mechanism for delivering secrets and clues.",
