If you're able to play with as few as three and have a regular group of six, it should take four players canceling before you have to call off a game. The more consistent the game, the more likely that the players will make it a part of their regular schedule.\n\nIf you find that certain players are regularly missing the game, ask if they would prefer to be on your on-call list, and then seek a new player with better availability.",
