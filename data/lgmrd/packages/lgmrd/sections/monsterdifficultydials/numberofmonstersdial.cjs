        "The \"number of monsters in a battle\" dial alters combat challenge the most dramatically of all the dials â€” but because it's so clearly visible to players, this dial is also sometimes difficult to change during a fight.\n\nIf circumstances allow for it, some monsters might flee or automatically fall depending on the events of a fight. Undead might break if their necromancer master is killed, and many intelligent creatures will flee a fight they can't win. Other times, more monsters might enter the fray in a second wave if the first wave isn't standing up to the characters.\n\nWhen developing a combat encounter in which you think you might turn this dial, consider beforehand how monsters might leave the battle or how other monsters might join the fight as reinforcements in a realistic way.",
