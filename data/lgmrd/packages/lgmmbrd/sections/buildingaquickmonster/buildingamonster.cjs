        "With the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table at hand, you can use the following quick steps to build a custom monster from scratch. The first four steps alone let you easily create a monster ready to run in your game. The optional steps that follow then let you fill out the monster's details and custom mechanics as desired.\n\n### Step 1: Determine Challenge Rating\n\nBegin by determining the challenge rating for your quick monster based on that creature's fiction in the world. When considering the challenge rating of a custom monster, you might compare them to existing creatures on the table. If the in-world power of your monster compares well to a skeleton, the monster might have a challenge rating of 1/4. If they're more like a fire giant, they might have a challenge rating of 9. Look at the list of example monsters and ask yourself which monster makes the best comparison to yours. Then assign your creature that monster's challenge rating.\n\n### Alternatively, What Challenge Rating Do You Need?\n\nYou might also want to choose a challenge rating based on the level of the characters, using the Equivalent Character Level column of the table. If you want an encounter with four monsters who are roughly equal in power to four characters, this column lets you figure out those monsters' statistics. It also helps you build NPCs—knights, mages, thieves, and so forth—intended to be a match for characters of a particular level.\n\n### Step 2: Write Down the Baseline Statistics\n\nOnce you've determined a challenge rating for your monster, write down their statistics. You might jot them on an index card, in a text editor on your computer, or wherever you keep notes for your adventures and campaigns. You might end up customizing those statistics, though, so be ready to change them.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Proficient Abilities\n\nNext, determine which abilities—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma—a monster is proficient in, using the Proficient Ability Bonus column on the table. This sets up the bonus a monster has when using any ability with which they're proficient, and is largely based on the monster's story. A big, beefy monster might be proficient in skills or saving throws involving Strength and Constitution. A mastermind monster might be proficient in Wisdom- and Intelligence-based skills and saving throws. A fast monster might be proficient in Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and Dexterity saving throws, while an otherworldly monster might be proficient in Charisma-based skills and saves.\n\nThe bonus indicated in the table is what the monster uses to make saving throws and ability checks with those proficient abilities. Just remember that the number on the table already includes a monster's proficiency bonus, in addition to their ability score modifier.\n\n### Step 4: Determine Remaining Abilities\n\nNext, you can determine the modifier (either a penalty or a bonus) that a monster uses for their nonproficient abilities. This is for all the ability checks and saving throws a monster isn't great at, and can be determined by asking yourself how strong a monster feels in those abilities. The bonus can range anywhere from −2 to +4, and is independent of a monster's challenge rating. Even a high-challenge monster might have a lousy Dexterity saving throw. When in doubt, or to speed things up, use a modifier of +0 for these nonproficient abilities. You can always change this during the game if a higher or lower number makes sense.\n\nA creature's Dexterity modifier is also used to determine their initiative modifier. Or you can skip your improvised creature's initiative roll and use a static initiative of 12.\n\n### You're Ready to Go\n\nAt this point, you have enough information on hand to run your monster in a game, with little else needed. However, you can also continue with a few more quick steps to further customize your monster, making them more distinct.",
