        'Getting the characters to enter an arena (literal or metaphorical) and move around can be hard. Advantageous positions give them a reason to do so. Areas of high ground where they can gain cover against their foes—and perhaps advantage on attacks—are highly sought after by ranged attackers. Arcane circles that infuse a spellcaster\'s magic with greater power might draw wizards into a room. This approach can turn a whole encounter into a fun game of "king of the hill" as the characters and their enemies fight for superior position.',
