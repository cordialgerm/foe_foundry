        "Certain parts of a battlefield might contain traps or hazards. Some of these might be easily seen, such as bladed pillars or spike-lined pits. Others might come as a surprise, such as a trap door over an acid pool.\n\nCharacters with high passive Wisdom (Perception) scores might notice hidden traps automatically, or you might give each character a chance to make a Wisdom (Perception) check requiring no action—maybe even rolling on their behalf—to detect a trap before stumbling into it.\n\nMake sure these traps matter if you're going to put them in an encounter. Traps that are too far out of the way might never come into play. Likewise, it can be fun for players to spring traps on their opponents, so don't use them only as a threat against the characters.",
