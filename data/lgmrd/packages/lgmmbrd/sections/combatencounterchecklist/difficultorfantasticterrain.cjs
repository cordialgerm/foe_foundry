Difficult terrain is the easiest option, making it challenging but not impossible to take certain routes across the battlefield. But other areas of interesting terrain can also shake up a physical encounter. Icy floors where the characters might slip don't work well as a zone-wide effect. But they can be great in specific areas, forcing the characters to avoid those areas as they move.\n\nAny of the following terrain features can make a big battle location more interesting:",
