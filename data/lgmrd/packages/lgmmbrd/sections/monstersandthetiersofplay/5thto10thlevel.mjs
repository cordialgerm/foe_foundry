        "At 5th level, character power spikes up. Fighters can attack twice, and can double that double attack with Action Surge. Spellcasters gain access to spells such as *fireball*, *spirit guardians*, and *hypnotic pattern*. As characters rise above 5th level, their capabilities increase quickly. Monks get Stunning Strike. Spellcasters learn spells able to take out a foe with a single failed saving throw, including *banishment* and *polymorph*.\n\nAt 5th level and above, you can no longer trust a lone nonlegendary monster to challenge a group of characters. Often a single spell, class feature, or volley of attacks can incapacitate or kill any such creature. Against large groups of foes, a casting of *fireball* or a use of Turn Undead can end the fight. Get comfortable with this change to how your encounters are going to play out, and use lightning rod monsters to let the characters show off these potent capabilities without ruining your fun.\n\nAt these levels, the heroes' defensive capabilities increase as well. Characters can fly, turn invisible, or block off entire sections of the battlefield with spells like *wall of fire*. Healing becomes plentiful. Paladins can protect entire parties with their defensive features. Even lower-level defensive features such as the *shield* spell can be used more often with a larger number of available spell slots.\n\nAt 5th level and above, a GM's understanding of the capabilities of the characters and how those capabilities relate to a monster's stat block is vital to building challenging encounters. Creatures who challenge characters at 5th level and above (roughly CR 4 and up) are usually more complicated than those of lower challenge ratings. Hard encounters put together using default encounter-building rules might be less challenging than expected.\n\nCharacters of 5th to 10th level can often take on hordes of foes of CR 1/4 to CR 1. They can usually survive battles against groups of CR 2 to CR 5 monsters, small groups of CR 6 to CR 10 foes, and single monsters up to CR 15.\n\nGreat foes at this tier include young dragons, giants, mages, and lower-CR demons and devils. Bosses can include medusas, lower-CR adult dragons, mid-CR demons and devils, and maybe even an archmage.",
