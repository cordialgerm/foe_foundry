When you use an action to present this scroll to an aberration whose Challenge Rating is equal to or less than your level, the binding powers of the scroll compel it to listen to you. You can then attempt to strike a bargain with the aberration, negotiating a service from it in exchange for a reward. The aberration is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the aberration, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the aberration refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the aberration reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the agreement and have the aberration do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the aberration to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll blackens and crumbles to dust. An aberration's thinking is alien to most humanoids, and vaguely worded contracts may result in unintended consequences, as the creature may have different thoughts as to how to best meet the goal. If either party breaks the bargain, that creature immediately takes 10d6 psychic damage, and the charter is destroyed, ending the contract.",

Retrieving items takes at least 2 actions (or more for larger objects) and things like loose coins tend to get lost inside it. No matter how full, the web never weighs more than a half pound.\n\nA creature attempting to divine the contents of the web via magic must first succeed on a DC 28 Arcana check which can only be attempted once between _long rests_ .\n\nAny creature placed into the extradimensional space is placed into stasis for up to a month, needing no food or water but still healing at a natural pace. Dead creatures in the web do not decay. If a living creature is not freed within a month, it is shunted from the web and appears beneath a large spider web 1d6 miles away in the real world.",

Artifacts, legendary magic items, and any magic item that won't physically fit into the alembic (anything larger than a shortsword or a cloak) can't be dissolved in this way. Full dissolution and distillation of an item's magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10 minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical. If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic, its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as a lump of material resembling gray-purple, stiff dough known as arcanoplasm. This material is safe to handle and easy to incorporate into new magic items. Using arcanoplasm while creating a magic item reduces the cost of the new item by 10 percent per degree of rarity of the magic item that was distilled into the arcanoplasm.

The broom\u2019s handle is said to have come from the first tree and the bristles stolen from a god, but its beginnings are far more humble\u2014just a simple mundane object that accrued its first enchantment by chance after years of exposure to countless rituals. Since then its attraction to magic has grown, and so too has its admiration for the arcane. The broom has been in the hands of countless spellcasters, many of them unlikely candidates to pursue magic, though it cannot remember their names. Only the feats of magic they achieved are of any worth to the broom.\n\n_**Sentience.**_ The broom is a sentient construct with Intelligence 19, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 17\\. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet. The broom communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Sylvan, and Undercommon. \n\n_**Personality.**_ The broom\u2019s purpose is to encourage the use of magic\u2014the more powerful the better\u2014regardless of any consequences. It is unconcerned with the goings on of mortals or anyone not engaged with magic, and it demands a certain amount of respect and appreciation for its service.\n\n**_Demands._** If you are unable to cast spells and attune to the broom, it relentlessly argues for you to pursue magical training and if none is achieved within a month it goes dormant in your hands (becoming a very durable stick). In addition, the broom is a repository of magic over the ages and it strongly encourages you to seek out monsters to harvest powerful reagents, explore cursed ruins in search of forbidden knowledge, and undertake precarious rituals.\n\nYou have a +3 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with the magic broom, and when the broom deals damage with a critical hit the target is _blinded_  until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Ancient Broom_, used by spellcasters since the dawn of time.\n\n**DC 18** The broom is able to animate itself and attack your enemies, it has the power to open locks and break shackles, and it enables you to move without leaving a trace of your passing.\n\n**DC 21** Many of those who have wielded the _Ancient Broom_ came from humble and unlikely backgrounds.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Ancient Broom_ has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment.\n\n**Magic**\n\nWhile you are attuned to the broom you gain an expertise die on checks made with Arcana, and while holding it you can innately cast __pass without trace_  (no _concentration_  required) and _nondetection_ at will.\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to knock the broom against a lock, door, lid, chains, shackles, or the like to open them. Once you have done so 3 times, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest. You can speak with the broom over the course of a _short rest_ , learning one ritual spell. The next time you use this feature, you forget the last spell learned from it.\n\n**Dancing Broom**\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to toss this broom into the air and cackle. When you do so, the broom begins to hover, flies up to 60 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The broom uses your _attack roll_  and ability score modifier to damage rolls, and unless a target is hidden or _invisible_  it has _advantage_  on its attack roll.\n\n While the broom hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the broom to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.\n\n The broom ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.",

The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 20\n\n**Hit Points:** 200\n\n**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\n**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down.
