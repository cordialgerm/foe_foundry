You know how people think, what they want, and how to best use that to your advantage.\n\nPeople should know better than to trust you when you offer exactly what they need for exactly as much money as they have, but for the desperate caution is a resource in short supply. Your mysterious bottles, unlikely rumors, and secret maps offer to deliver the salvation they need. When they realize they've been had, you're nowhere to be found.",

You may have been lucky enough to have a leaky roof over your head, or perhaps you grew up sleeping in doorways or on the rooftops. Either way, you didn't have it easy, and you lived by your wits. While never a hardened criminal, you fell in with the wrong crowd, or you ended up in trouble for stealing food from an orange cart or clean clothes from a washing line.

You have a knack for leading pursuers into a crowded market filled with stalls piled high with breakable merchandise, or down a narrow alley just as a dung cart is coming in the other direction.",
    "suggested_characteristics": "Despite their poor upbringing, scoundrels tend to live a charmed lifeâ€”never far from trouble, but usually coming out on top. Many are thrill-seekers who delight in taunting their opponents before making a flashy and daring escape. Most are generally good-hearted, but some are self-centered to the point of arrogance. Quieter, introverted types and the lawfully-inclined can find them very annoying.\n\n| d8 | Personality Trait                                                     |\n|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | Flashing a big smile often gets me out of trouble.                    |\n| 2  | If I can just keep them talking, it will give me time to escape.      |\n| 3  | I get fidgety if I have to sit still for more than ten minutes or so. |\n| 4  | Whatever I do, I try to do it with style and panache.                 |\n| 5  | I don't hold back when there's free food and drink on offer.          |\n| 6  | Nothing gets me more annoyed than being ignored.                      |\n| 7  | I always sit with my back to the wall and my eyes on the exits.       |\n| 8  | Why walk down the street when you can run across the rooftops?        |\n\n| d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                 |\n|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | **Freedom.** Ropes and chains are made to be broken.
