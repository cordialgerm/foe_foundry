When you hit with it, your tentacle deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. This tentacle has a reach of 5 feet and can lift a number of pounds equal to double your Strength score. The tentacle can't wield weapons or shields or perform tasks that require manual precision, such as performing the somatic components of a spell, but it can perform simple tasks, such as opening an unlocked door or container, stowing or retrieving an object, or pouring the contents out of a vial.\n* **Tainted Blood.** Your blood is tainted by your connection with otherworldly entities. When you take piercing or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to force your blood to spray out of the wound. You and each creature within 5 feet of you take necrotic damage equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n* **Tenebrous Flesh.** Your skin is rubbery and tenebrous, granting you a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.",
