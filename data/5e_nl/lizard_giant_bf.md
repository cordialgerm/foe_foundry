The Giant Lizard is a large beast characterized by its agility and natural instincts. With a challenge rating of 1/4, this creature is relatively weak in terms of overall power but can still pose a threat to unsuspecting adventurers, especially in environments where it can utilize its climbing ability. The lizard has decent armor and hit points for its challenge level, with its primary strength resting in its bite attack, which can inflict a moderate amount of damage. However, its intelligence is very low, making it limited in tactical capabilities. In combat, its ability to detach its tail provides a unique advantage that allows it to escape damage while maintaining mobility.

The Giant Lizard has the following statistics: its Strength is +2, Dexterity is +1, Constitution is +1, Intelligence is -4 (very bad), Wisdom is +0 (average), and Charisma is -3 (very bad). These attributes make the lizard physically capable but intellectually deficient, limiting its interactions and strategic options in gameplay.

The lizard's senses include darkvision up to 30 feet, allowing it to see in dim conditions, which can be advantageous in stealthy or dark environments. Its Perception score is 10, indicating an average ability to notice things in its surroundings. With a Stealth score of 13, the Giant Lizard can conceal itself effectively, making it an ambush predator when it desires. The creature does not speak any languages.

For special abilities, the Giant Lizard has a bite attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 bonus to hit, which is considered good. It can reach one creature within 5 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage on a successful hit, reflecting its capability as a damaging adversary in close quarters.

The lizard also possesses a reaction called Detach Tail, which triggers when it has 9 hit points or fewer. Upon taking damage, the Giant Lizard can detach its tail to reduce the incoming damage by 4 (1d8) and then move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. This ability can be a strategic choice for the lizard, allowing it to evade potential threats while minimizing damage taken in combat. The tail can be detached once per encounter and recharges after a short or long rest, making it a key defensive mechanism.
