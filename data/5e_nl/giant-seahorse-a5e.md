The Giant Seahorse is a large beast well-suited to aquatic environments. Its primary role in encounters is often as a minor threat or as a transportation option, given its capability to swim efficiently. With an Armor Class of 13, it can withstand moderate attacks, though its 22 hit points (4d10) make it relatively fragile compared to stronger monsters. The Giant Seahorse lacks terrestrial mobility due to its speed of 0 feet on land, but it excels in water, boasting a swimming speed of 40 feet. Its challenge rating of 1/2 indicates that it is intended for low-level encounters, providing 100 experience points when defeated. Generally, the Giant Seahorse has decent Dexterity and a good initiative which allows it to be somewhat agile in the water, while its Strength is above average, making its physical attacks potent. However, its low Intelligence and Charisma limit its role in social interactions and complex actions.

The Giant Seahorse possesses the following attributes: 

- Strength: 12, providing a good modifier of +1 for melee attack rolls and Strength-related checks.
- Dexterity: 14, giving it a good +2 modifier which enhances its initiative and improves its Armor Class slightly.
- Constitution: 10 results in an average +0 modifier, meaning it doesn't have significant resilience or health boosts.
- Intelligence: 2 represents a very bad -4 modifier, indicating an inability to understand complex concepts or engage in logical reasoning.
- Wisdom: 12 grants a good +1 modifier, useful for Perception checks and some saving throws.
- Charisma: 4 results in a very bad -3 modifier, affecting its ability to influence others.

In terms of sensory capabilities, the Giant Seahorse has a passive Perception score of 11, which is average for detecting surroundings. Notably, it has the special ability of Water Breathing, allowing it to breathe without any issues in aquatic environments, but it cannot breathe air, significantly limiting its versatility outside of water.

In combat, the Giant Seahorse can use its primary action, Ram, which is a melee weapon attack. It has a +3 to hit with this ability and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to target enemies nearby. Upon hitting, the Ram deals 6 (2d4+1) bludgeoning damage, which is reasonably effective for a creature of its challenge rating. If the Seahorse moves at least 20 feet straight towards its target before executing the Ram attack, the damage increases significantly by an additional 5 (2d4), making the total potential damage 11 (2d4 + 1). Moreover, the target must make a DC 11 Strength saving throw; failure results in the target falling prone, which can severely impact the target’s ability to act in subsequent turns. This ability not only contributes to its offensive capabilities but also increases battlefield control, making the Giant Seahorse a formidable challenger in the water.
