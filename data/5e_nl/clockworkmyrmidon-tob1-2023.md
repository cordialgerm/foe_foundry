The Clockwork Myrmidon is a powerful adversary designed to function as a front-line combatant within encounters. As a large construct, it possesses formidable physical attributes with a Strength score of 20, resulting in an exceptional attack power. With a good Constitution score of 16, it can endure significant damage before falling, boasting a total of 136 hit points. The myrmidon is remarkably resilient, especially against spells, thanks to its Magic Resistance, which grants it an advantage on saving throws against magical effects. Its main weaknesses lie in its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, making it inept at tasks requiring mental acuity or social interaction. In combat, it excels in both melee engagements and area control, showcasing mechanisms that can spread damage and hinder movement.

The Clockwork Myrmidon has the following attributes: it has a Strength of 20 (+5 modifier, very good), Dexterity of 14 (+2 modifier, average), Constitution of 16 (+3 modifier, good), Intelligence of 6 (-2 modifier, very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0 modifier, average), and Charisma of 1 (-5 modifier, very bad). Its saving throws are strong, with a +8 to Strength saves and +5 to Dexterity saves, indicating its high resilience. The creature is skilled in Athletics (+8) and has a decent Perception (+6), allowing it to perceive its surroundings adequately. Notably, it is immune to various damage types, including poison and psychic damage, and is also immune to many conditions such as being charmed or paralyzed, further enhancing its durability in combat scenarios.

The Clockwork Myrmidon possesses a variety of special abilities that heighten its threat level. Upon destruction, its Alchemical Fireball ability causes an explosion that damages nearby creatures, requiring them to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16) to reduce the damage taken from 14 (4d6) fire damage. It has a unique Construct Nature, freeing it from needs such as air, food, or sleep, thus enhancing its usefulness in long campaigns or battles. Its Immutable Form renders it immune to transformations, while Magic Resistance provides a safeguard against spells, illustrating its resilience against magical threats.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Clockwork Myrmidon performs a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Slam attack along with two Heavy Pick attacks or to use its Alchemical Flame Jet as an alternative to either of the melee attacks. Its War Pick attack has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage upon hitting a target. The Slam attack works similarly, allowing for 11 (1d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

The Alchemical Flame Jet is a potent ability that allows the myrmidon to shoot a 30-foot line of fire, requiring creatures within its path to undertake a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16). On a failed save, they suffer 14 (4d6) fire damage or half on a successful one, making it an area threat that can severely impact multiple foes at once.

As a Bonus Action, the myrmidon can use Grease Spray, releasing alchemical grease in a 10-foot area, turning it into difficult terrain. Creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16) to avoid falling prone, which can significantly control the battlefield and disrupt enemy movements during combat. Each creature that enters or remains in that area also needs to make the same saving throw, reinforcing the area’s hazard nature.

Overall, the Clockwork Myrmidon serves as a formidable foe in various combat scenarios, presenting threats both through its strong physical attacks and through area denial tactics.
