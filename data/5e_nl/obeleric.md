The Obeleric is a Medium aberration characterized by its chaotic evil nature. It stands out with an impressive physical presence and various combat abilities, making it a formidable opponent in battle. It possesses a total of 75 hit points, signifying above-average durability, and an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, which provides decent protection. The creature's speed allows it to walk up to 30 feet and burrow 15 feet, offering tactical mobility in combat. With a challenge rating of 3, the Obeleric is a moderate threat to adventurers and can deal significant damage with its various attacks, while its skills and special abilities provide it with unique advantages in combat scenarios. However, it has a low intelligence and charisma, indicating weaknesses in social or cognitive situations.

The Obeleric has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16 (+3), representing a very good physical power, which aids in its melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2), indicating a good level of agility that enhances its maneuverability.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), showing very good resilience and contributing to its high hit point total of 75, calculated from 10d8+30.
- Intelligence: 7 (-2), denoting a very bad ability to solve problems or think critically.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), reflecting an average perception and insight.
- Charisma: 7 (-2), highlighting a very bad ability to influence or charm others.

In terms of skills, the Obeleric has a perception modifier of +1, which is average for detecting hidden objects or noticing details. It is immune to becoming petrified or prone, lending it an edge in keeping mobile during combat. The creature has tremorsense within a range of 30 feet, allowing it to detect the presence of creatures without the need for sight. While it understands Common and Void Speech, it cannot communicate verbally.

The Obeleric has several notable special abilities. Its False Appearance allows it to remain motionless and appear as a regular boulder, making it hard to identify until it chooses to move. The Ricochet Charge ability activates when the Obeleric moves straight towards a target and successfully strikes them with a Boulder Bash attack. This grants the target disadvantage on their saving throw against being knocked prone. Additionally, if the target ends up prone, the Obeleric can quickly target a second creature with a bonus Boulder Bash attack, showcasing its capacity for multiple strikes in a single turn.

When it comes to actions, the Obeleric can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make two attacks using either Tentacle Slam or Acid Spit. The Boulder Bash, a melee weapon attack made only in its defensive form, has a +5 to hit and can deal significant damage at 14 (2d10+3). If the attack is successful, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone. The Tentacle Slam also has a +5 to hit and deals 8 (2d4+3) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 3 (1d6) acid damage, enhancing its offensive capabilities. The Spit Acid ranged attack has a +4 to hit and can strike at a distance of 20/60 feet, dealing 9 (2d6+2) acid damage; moreover, the target suffers additional acid damage at the start of its next turn if hit.

As a bonus action, the Obeleric can perform a Defensive Roll, allowing it to shift into a boulder-like form. While in this defensive shape, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, but it cannot use its Tentacle Slam or Spit Acid attacks. 

Its reaction, Reflux, enables the Obeleric to vomit acid when it takes bludgeoning damage, targeting a creature within 5 feet. This attack requires the creature to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, or it takes 3 (1d6) acid damage. 

Overall, the Obeleric combines strong physical abilities and damaging attacks with strategic defense options, making it a versatile threat in combat situations.
