The Werewolf is a Medium-sized humanoid that embodies the dual nature of humanity and beast. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a moderate level of threat, capable of dealing significant damage when engaging in combat. Its notable strengths include a solid Armor Class of 12 and decent Hit Points, totaling 58. Werewolves possess strong physical attributes with a Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution score of 14, each providing a good modifier of +2, which enhances their effectiveness in combat and physical activities. However, their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are average, each sitting at 10, offering no bonus or drawback to their social interactions or ability checks reliant on those attributes. 

Werewolves have some unique traits that bolster their combat effectiveness. They are immune to damage from nonmagical and non-silvered weapons, making them quite resilient against standard attacks unless the foe employs magical or silvered weapons. They have access to skills that include a good Stealth modifier of +4, enabling them to move undetected, and average perception and survival skills, each with a +2 modifier. Their keen senses grant them advantage on perception checks that rely on hearing or smell, giving them an exceptional edge in detecting hidden threats or prey. Additionally, their Pack Tactics ability allows them to gain advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is within close proximity, enhancing their offensive capabilities significantly when fighting alongside others.

The Werewolf’s primary actions showcase its brutality in combat. It can make two melee attacks with its Multiattack feature, allowing for versatility in choosing between a bite or strikes with claws or a greatclub. In humanoid or hybrid form, it wields a greatclub, which deals 6 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. In its wolf or hybrid form, it uses its claws or bite, each having a damage output of 6 (1d8 + 2). The bite attack also inflicts the risk of werewolf lycanthropy on targets that fail a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, introducing a significant narrative twist and potential for further conflicts.

As a bonus action, the Werewolf can shapeshift between its humanoid, wolf, and hybrid forms without changing its underlying statistics. This transformation allows strategic flexibility, as it can choose the form that best suits the current situation in battle. However, it cannot speak in wolf form, limiting communication in that state. Finally, if the Werewolf is bloodied—reduced to half its hit points or lower—it gains a frenzied bite, allowing it to make an additional bite attack in its desperation, making it even more dangerous when wounded.
