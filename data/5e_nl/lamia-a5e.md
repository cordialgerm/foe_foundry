The Lamia is a large monstrosity characterized by its chaotic and evil nature, serving as a formidable foe in combat. It possesses a strong combination of physical and magical abilities, with a total of 85 hit points, making it quite durable for a challenge rating of 4. Its various skills, such as Deception and Stealth, enhance its cunning, while its innate spellcasting allows it to manipulate and control others effectively. However, while its Armor Class is decent at 13, any armor or defensive bonuses are limited, making it somewhat vulnerable to sustained attacks.

The Lamia has an impressive array of attribute scores: it boasts a Strength of 16, Dexterity of 16, Constitution of 16, Intelligence of 14, Wisdom of 16, and Charisma of 18. The modifiers for these attributes range from good to exceptional, which translates to effective physical prowess and strong spellcasting capabilities. For skills, it has a Deception modifier of +6 (very good), a Perception modifier of +5 (good), and a Stealth modifier of +5 (good), which reflects its effectiveness in sneaky maneuvers and manipulation.

In terms of senses, the Lamia has darkvision extending to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 15, allowing it to notice hidden or invisible creatures effectively. It communicates in Abyssal and Common, facilitating interaction with a variety of characters.

One of its notable special abilities is its innate spellcasting, which relies on its high Charisma with a spell save DC of 14. The Lamia can cast the following spells without needing material components: it can use *charm person*, *disguise self* to take on a humanoid form, and *major image* at will, providing it a means to deceive foes. It also has access to *misty step* for teleportation, and once per day, it can use *geas*, *hallucinatory terrain*, *hypnotic pattern*, and *scrying* to influence or track targets.

The Lamia's actions include *Dizzying Touch*, which is a melee spell attack with a +6 to hit; it can charm its target for one hour or until that target takes damage, during which the target has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and ability checks. The Lamia also has claws that deal 17 (4d6 + 3) slashing damage and a dagger attack that can either be melee or ranged, causing 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage along with poison that may deal additional damage if the target fails a Constitution saving throw.

Furthermore, the Lamia has a powerful spell, *Hypnotic Pattern*, that creates a mesmerizing swirl of lights affecting creatures within 10 feet who can see it. Affected creatures must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated for one minute, rendering them unable to act unless attacked or shaken out of their stupor. This ability can drastically alter the course of battle by incapacitating multiple foes.

As a bonus action, the Lamia can use *Misty Step*, allowing it to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space. However, it cannot cast another spell of 1st level or higher during that turn after using this ability, defining its tactical positioning in combat scenarios. Overall, the Lamia thrives in deception and crowd control, posing a clever and dangerous threat to adventurers.
