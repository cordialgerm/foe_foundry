The Ancient Blue Dragon is a formidable gargantuan creature that serves as a powerful adversary in any campaign. With a challenge rating of 20, this dragon boasts impressive stats, making it a significant threat in combat situations. It features exceptional armor class and hit points, which contribute to its durability. The dragon’s abilities include formidable lightning attacks and the capacity to instill fright into its enemies. Additionally, it has a range of special abilities and actions that can incapacitate foes and control the battlefield. However, it is important to note that while it excels in offense and defense, characters equipped with the right tactics can challenge this powerful being.

The Ancient Blue Dragon has an Armor Class of 21, attributed to its natural armor, making it very good in terms of defense. It possesses a hefty 355 hit points, allowing it to withstand significant damage during encounters. The creature's movement capabilities include a speed of 40 feet on land, 40 feet while burrowing, and 80 feet when flying, providing it with exceptional mobility across different terrains.

The dragon’s attribute scores include a Strength of +9 (very good), Dexterity of +6 (good), Constitution of +14 (exceptional), Intelligence of +4 (average), Wisdom of +9 (very good), and Charisma of +11 (exceptional). Its sensory abilities include darkvision up to 120 feet and keen senses allowing it to detect creatures within 60 feet. The dragon has a notable Perception score of 27, making it very adept at noticing its surroundings, while its Stealth score of 16 is also good for sneaking and ambushing.

In terms of special abilities, the Ancient Blue Dragon has "Charged Hide," which causes electric charges to build up on its body. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the dragon while it has not used its Lightning Breath, they must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of their next turn. This ability can manipulate the battlefield significantly by restricting enemy movement.

The dragon also exhibits "Legendary Resistance," allowing it to automatically succeed on saving throws three times per day, making it resilient against effects that involve saving throws.

During its turn, the Ancient Blue Dragon can use its Multiattack action to employ its "Frightful Presence," which forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. Following that, it may execute one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite is a melee weapon attack with a +15 to hit, reaching out 15 feet, damaging 20 piercing and 11 lightning damage on a hit. The Claw attack (also +15 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet) deals 16 slashing damage, while the Tail attack, also +15 to hit and reaching 20 feet, inflicts 18 bludgeoning damage.

The dragon's "Lightning Breath," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows it to exhale a stream of lightning in a 120-foot line. Each creature caught in this line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 99 lightning damage on a failed save or half that amount if they succeed.

As a creature of significant power, the Ancient Blue Dragon also has legendary actions it can take at the end of another creature's turn. One such action is "Detect," which automatically reveals every creature and trap within 30 feet. The "Tail Attack" enables it to hit a target with its tail and "Elemental Roar" forces up to two creatures within 120 feet to potentially become vulnerable to lightning damage. The "Wing Attack," which requires two actions, allows it to cause bludgeoning damage to creatures within 15 feet and lets the dragon fly up to half its flying speed without provoking attack opportunities.

Finally, upon the dragon's demise, it generates regional effects that can manifest until it fades after a short period, although the specifics are randomly determined. This attribute adds a layer of intrigue to any campaign involving the Ancient Blue Dragon, ensuring that it leaves a lasting impact on the narrative even in death.
