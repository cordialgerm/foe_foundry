The Irid is a Tiny Celestial creature that embodies chaos, aligning itself with a chaotic neutral disposition. Known for its playful nature, it leverages its abilities to manipulate scenarios to its advantage, often employing deception and charm in interactions. With a challenge rating of 1, the Irid is not overly formidable in combat but compensates with clever tactics and magical prowess. Its strengths include good Dexterity and Charisma scores, granting it significant bonuses in stealth and social interactions. However, it has poor Strength and average Constitution, making it weak in physical confrontations and resistance to damage. Notably, the Irid possesses abilities that enhance its survivability, such as Magic Resistance and conditions immunity.

The Irid's attributes are as follows: Strength at 4 (with a modifier of -3, which is very bad), Dexterity at 17 (+3, good), Constitution at 10 (+0, average), Intelligence at 12 (+1, average), Wisdom at 10 (+0, average), and Charisma at 16 (+3, good). The saving throws reflect its strengths with Wisdom at +2 and Charisma at +5. In skills, the Irid excels in deception and persuasion, both at +7 (very good), and also possesses stealth at +5 (good), while perception remains at +2 (average).

The Irid is immune to poison damage and resistant to radiant damage, making it particularly resilient against certain types of attacks. It is also immune to conditions like charmed, exhaustion, frightened, and poisoned, allowing it to remain effective in various scenarios. With darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 12, the Irid is aware of its surroundings and can communicate in Celestial, Common, and via telepathy over the same distance.

Among its special abilities, the Irid can create a magical light called Iridescence, which it can turn on or off at will as a bonus action. This light can illuminate its surroundings in a colorful display and can serve as a distraction or advantage in certain situations. Its Magic Resistance grants it an exceptional benefit by allowing it to have an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, reinforcing its survivability. With Photographic Memory, it possesses an exceptional capacity to recall anything it has encountered in the last month, which can be invaluable for gathering information or planning.

In combat, the Irid can perform a Multiattack, using its Gossip ability followed by an Iridescent Blast. The Gossip action allows the Irid to influence a target within 30 feet, forcing hostile creatures to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their next attack roll. Conversely, friendly targets gain advantage on their next attack roll. The Iridescent Blast is a ranged spell attack that can hit targets 60 feet away, dealing 7 (2d6) radiant damage on a successful hit. Lastly, the Irid can turn invisible, providing it with excellent tactical options for escaping danger or ambushing foes, remaining invisible until it attacks or uses Gossip. This ability combines well with its other tactics to create a character that thrives on manipulation, magic, and misdirection.
