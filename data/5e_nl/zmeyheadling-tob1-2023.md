The Zmey Headling is a medium-sized dragon that embodies chaotic evil. It is a formidable opponent in combat due to its high Armor Class of 16 and robust Hit Points totaling 105, making it resilient in battle. This creature has a slower movement speed of 20 feet on land, which could hinder its mobility compared to faster adversaries. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it offers a moderate challenge to adventurers, providing 1,800 experience points upon defeat. The Zmey Headling possesses a combination of physical strength, represented by a Strength score of 16 (+3 modifier, categorized as good), and solid Constitution at 17 (+3 modifier, also good). However, it has poor mental statistics, especially with Intelligence at 8 (-1, very bad) and Charisma at 8 (-1, very bad). The creature has some notable resistances to cold and fire damage, making it less vulnerable to elemental attacks.

In terms of special abilities, the Zmey Headling has the Amphibious trait, allowing it to breathe both air and water, which enhances its versatility in various environments. It also has Regeneration, where it regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn, allowing it to sustain itself in protracted battles. 

The creature's main combat actions are its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks each turn. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit and can deal significant damage of 16 piercing damage, while each Claw attack also has a +6 to hit, inflicting 10 slashing damage. The Zmey Headling can unleash a powerful Fire Breath attack, which has a recharge mechanic of 5-6. When used, it exhales fire in a 30-foot cone, demanding a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw from affected creatures. On a failure, they suffer 28 fire damage (8d6), and on a success, they take half damage. The ability to choose not to harm plants or Plant creatures enhances its strategic potential in combat.

Overall, the Zmey Headling is a dangerous adversary for adventurers, armed with a mix of physical attacks, regenerative capabilities, and devastating breath weapon.
