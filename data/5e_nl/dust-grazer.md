The Dust Grazer is a large aberration known for its grotesque nature and unique adaptations for survival. It presents a challenge for adventurers due to its high health pool and ability to inflict debilitating poison damage. With an exceptional Constitution score of 20, the Dust Grazer boasts impressive hit points, making it a tough opponent to bring down. Its primary methods of attack include its tendrils and a dangerous special ability called Death Spores, which can severely harm or incapacitate creatures around it. However, its low Dexterity makes it somewhat vulnerable to ranged attacks and quick maneuvers. 

The Dust Grazer has an Armor Class of 12, considered average, and 105 hit points, which is derived from rolling 10d10 and adding 50. It has a movement speed of 0 feet but can fly up to 30 feet per round, making it somewhat mobile in combat despite being grounded for more traditional movement. The challenge rating of 4 suggests that it is a moderately difficult foe, suitable for a party of adventurers of appropriate level. 

The Dust Grazer's attributes include Strength 19 (+4), Dexterity 7 (-2), Constitution 20 (+5), Intelligence 2 (-4), Wisdom 7 (-2), and Charisma 2 (-4). Its high Strength provides a good melee combat option, contributing positively to its Tendril attack, while its exceptional Constitution ensures it can withstand substantial damage. The low Dexterity reflects its poor ability to avoid attacks and act quickly in combat, and its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma show its minimal capabilities in skill checks and social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Dust Grazer possesses a passive Perception of 8, which is considered very bad, limiting its ability to notice hidden threats. It is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, providing it a good defense against certain attacks. The creature relies on its blindsight, which extends up to 120 feet, to navigate its environment entirely without sight.

The Dust Grazer has two notable special abilities. The first is Death Spores, which activates upon its death. Any creature within 20 feet of the Dust Grazer when it dies takes 14 poison damage (rolled as 4d6) and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 14 to avoid being poisoned and infected with grazer spores disease. This disease hinders healing and inflicts ongoing poison damage every 24 hours until cured. A potentially lethal consequence is that if the target’s hit point maximum reaches zero due to the poison damage, the target dies and rises as a Dust Grazer after two days. 

In combat, the Dust Grazer employs two actions. The first is the Tendril attack, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +6 to hit, allowing it to strike effectively within a 15-foot reach. On a successful hit, it deals 11 bludgeoning damage (rolled as 2d6+4) and inflicts an additional 7 acid damage (rolled as 2d6) to the target. If the target is a creature, it is grappled, requiring a DC 14 escape check to break free if the Dust Grazer is not already grappling another target. 

The second action is Absorb, which can only be used against a medium or smaller creature that the Dust Grazer has already grappled. If the Tendril attack used for this action succeeds against the grappled creature, that creature is absorbed into the Dust Grazer’s body. While absorbed, the creature is blinded and restrained, taking 7 acid damage at the start of each of the Dust Grazer’s turns. If the absorbed creature deals 10 or more damage to the Dust Grazer in a single turn, the Dust Grazer must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 15. Failure results in the creature being expelled to an adjacent space, potentially falling if the Dust Grazer was airborne. Should the Dust Grazer be slain, the absorbed creature is freed but suffers disadvantage on saving throws against the deadly Death Spores.
