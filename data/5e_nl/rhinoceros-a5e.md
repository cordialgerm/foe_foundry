The rhinoceros is a large beast known for its immense physical strength and simple but powerful attacks. It has moderate defensive capabilities with an Armor Class of 12 and a total of 45 hit points, allowing it to absorb a fair amount of damage in combat. The rhinoceros moves quickly for its size, boasting a walking speed of 40 feet. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a reasonable threat to low-level adventuring parties. Its main strengths lie in its powerful melee attack called Gore, which can deal significant bludgeoning damage and potentially knock down opponents. However, it has a low Dexterity score, making it less agile, and its Intelligence and Charisma scores are also notably low, indicating that it lacks complex thought and social interaction capabilities.

In terms of attributes, the rhinoceros has a Strength score of 20, which provides it with a +5 modifier, leading to very good effectiveness in physical tasks and combat situations. Its Dexterity score of 8 gives it a -1 modifier, resulting in poor agility and reflexes, classifying it as bad. With a Constitution score of 14, it provides a +2 modifier, indicating good resilience, while its low Intelligence score of 2 gives it a -4 modifier, making it exceptionally unwise in matters of knowledge and understanding. A Wisdom score of 12 grants a +1 modifier, which is average and offers a slight edge in perception. Finally, its Charisma score of 4 yields a -3 modifier, categorizing it as very bad when it comes to social interactions.

The rhinoceros has the following notable action:

- **Gore:** This melee weapon attack allows the rhinoceros to strike at a target with a +7 to hit, making it very good at landing its blows. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and targets one opponent. On a successful hit, this attack deals 14 (2d8+5) bludgeoning damage. Additionally, if the rhinoceros has moved at least 20 feet in a straight line toward the target before executing this attack, it deals an additional 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage and forces the target to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. If the target fails this saving throw, it falls prone, giving the rhinoceros and its allies an advantageous position in combat.
