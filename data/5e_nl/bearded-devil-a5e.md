The Bearded Devil is a medium fiend that embodies a mix of brute strength and cunning. With an Armor Class of 13 and 52 hit points, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers, fitting a Challenge Rating of 3. It is known for its unique combination of resilience and potent attacks, particularly through its multiattack capability, allowing it to engage foes with both its genetically enhanced beard and a glaive. This fiend is particularly effective against characters with low Constitution due to its poisoning ability, which prevents healing. However, its lower Intelligence and Charisma make it less effective in social situations and strategic spellcasting.

The Bearded Devil has the following attributes: Strength of 16 grants a very good modifier of +3, enabling effective physical attacks. It has a Dexterity of 14, translating into a good +2 modifier, which benefits its initiative and some ranged attacks. Its Constitution is also at 14, providing a good +2 modifier which aids in stamina and resilience. With an Intelligence of 8, it suffers from a bad -1 modifier, limiting its cognitive skills. The Wisdom score of 12 gives it a slightly above-average +1 modifier, useful for perception and insight checks, while its Charisma of 10 results in an average modifier of +0, making it less impactful in interactions that rely on charm or persuasion.

In terms of defenses, the Bearded Devil has several advantages. It exhibits saving throws of +5 for Strength, +4 for Constitution, and +3 for Wisdom, which are all considered good. It is immune to fire and poison damage and has resistance against cold damage, as well as damage from nonmagical and non-silvered weapons. Furthermore, it is immune to the frightened and poisoned conditions, showcasing its resilience in combat scenarios. Notably, it possesses darkvision that extends to 120 feet, excellent for detecting foes in low-light conditions, and can communicate through telepathy over the same distance.

The Bearded Devil also has some special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. With Devil's Sight, it can see in magical darkness, giving it a tactical edge in dimly lit environments. Its innate Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it challenging for spellcasters to overcome its defenses.

In combat, the Bearded Devil's actions include a multiattack option where it can strike once with its beard and once with its glaive. When it uses its beard, it makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit against a target within 5 feet. If it hits, the attack inflicts 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage and poisons the target until the end of the Devil's next turn, preventing them from regaining hit points during this time. The glaive attack has a reach of 10 feet and also has a +5 to hit. A successful hit deals 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage and forces the target, unless undead or construct, to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failing this save results in an infernal wound, causing an additional 5 (1d10) ongoing slashing damage. Each subsequent hit on the same target with the glaive increases this ongoing damage by 5 (1d10). This wound can be treated by spending an action to succeed on a DC 12 Medicine check or healed with at least 1 hit point of magical healing, which effectively ends the ongoing damage.

Overall, the Bearded Devil is a formidable opponent, capable of both dealing significant damage and sabotaging foes' ability to heal, making it a dangerous adversary in any encounter.
