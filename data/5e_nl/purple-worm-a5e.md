The Purple Worm is a gargantuan monstrosity known for its immense size and devastating attacks. With a high armor class of 18 and substantial hit points totaling 247, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. Its primary role in combat is that of a powerful melee attacker, utilizing its formidable strength to inflict severe damage while also possessing unique abilities that can dominate the battlefield. Despite its strengths, the Purple Worm has low Dexterity, making it somewhat sluggish and vulnerable to certain tactics, especially those that rely on speed and precision. The creature is particularly dangerous due to its unique swallowing ability, allowing it to incapacitate large foes while dealing acid damage over time. 

The Purple Worm has the following attributes: a Strength score of 28, which grants it a very good attack and damage modifier (+9); a Dexterity score of 8, resulting in a bad modifier (-1); a Constitution score of 22, providing a good modifier (+6), and a very good saving throw bonus of +11 against Constitution effects; an Intelligence score of 2, which is extremely low (-4), leading to very average effectiveness with Intelligence-based checks; a Wisdom score of 10, giving it an average modifier (+0) for Wisdom saves; and a Charisma score of 4, resulting in a very bad modifier (-3). Its saving throws are as follows: +14 for Strength (very good), +11 for Constitution (good), +1 for Intelligence (very bad), +5 for Wisdom (average), and +2 for Charisma (bad). The creature has blindsight within 30 feet and tremorsense up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect nearby creatures and navigate through darkness and obstacles effectively.

The Purple Worm possesses the special ability "Tunneler," enabling it to burrow through both earth and solid rock, leaving a substantial 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake. This ability enhances its mobility and allows for strategic retreats or surprise attacks against unsuspecting foes.

In terms of actions, the Purple Worm employs a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike two targets during a turn using its bite and tail stinger attacks. The "Bite" is a melee weapon attack with a +14 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 25 piercing damage (3d10 + 9). Notably, if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in being swallowed, which imposes being blinded and restrained with total cover from attacks outside the worm while suffering 24 acid damage (7d6) at the start of each of the worm's turns. If the swallowed creature inflicts 35 or more damage to the worm in a single turn, or if the worm dies, it vomits up all swallowed creatures.

The "Tail Stinger" is another melee weapon attack with the same +14 to hit and 10-foot reach. On success, it deals 19 piercing damage (3d6 + 9) and forces the target to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. A failed save leads to taking 42 poison damage (12d6), while a successful save results in halving the damage taken.

As a reaction, the Purple Worm can perform a "Fighting Retreat," allowing it to make a bite or tail stinger attack in response to an opportunity attack from a creature. This ability allows it to counterattack while attempting to escape, increasing its chance for survival and dealing additional damage to attackers.
