The Vampiric Vanguard is a formidable Medium undead creature that embodies the essence of vampiric entities. Leaning toward a neutral evil alignment, this creature is designed to instill fear in its enemies while being notably resilient in combat. With a robust armor class of 14, high hit points totaling 127, and excellent physical attributes, the Vampiric Vanguard excels in melee engagements. Characterized by its ability to recover health through its attacks, it becomes a significant threat, especially when its health drops below half, granting it greater efficiency in striking against non-undead foes. Despite its strengths, the Vampiric Vanguard suffers from several vulnerabilities, particularly to sunlight and wooden weapons, which can leave it at a severe disadvantage if not careful in its environment.

The Vampiric Vanguard possesses the following attributes: Strength is rated at 19, providing a very good +4 modifier; Dexterity at 16, offering a good +3 modifier; Constitution at 18, granting another very good +4 modifier; Intelligence at 11 reflects an average capability with a +0 modifier; Wisdom at 10 yields a neutral +0 modifier; and Charisma at 8 results in a bad -1 modifier. The creature has saving throw bonuses with a +6 for Dexterity and +3 for Wisdom. It is ultimately resilient against necrotic damage and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. The Vampiric Vanguard possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and operates with a passive perception score of 13, allowing it to notice threats easily in low-light conditions. The creature retains the languages it knew in life, enabling it to communicate verbally.

A few special abilities enhance the Vampiric Vanguard's combat effectiveness. The "Bloodthirsty" ability allows the creature to make melee attack rolls with advantage when it is below half its maximum hit points against non-Construct or non-undead creatures. The "Spider Climb" feature grants it the ability to traverse difficult surfaces and ceilings without needing any ability checks. However, it also carries vampire weaknesses, such as "Forbiddance," which restricts its entry into residences without an invitation, "Harmed by Running Water," which forces it to take 20 acid damage when ending its turn in running water, and the destruction condition involving a wooden stake to the heart when incapacitated in its resting place. Additionally, it suffers from "Sunlight Hypersensitivity," taking 20 radiant damage when starting its turn in sunlight and having disadvantage on attacks and ability checks in such conditions.

In terms of attacks, the Vampiric Vanguard can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to use one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack consists of a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, an effective range of 5 feet, and inflicts 13 piercing damage alongside 7 necrotic damage. Notably, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by the amount of necrotic damage taken, while the Vampiric Vanguard heals for the same amount. This reduction persists until the target completes a long rest, and if this reduction lowers the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies. Each Claw attack also boasts a +7 to hit, dealing 11 slashing damage on a successful strike.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Vampiric Vanguard can perform the "Fleet of Foot" ability, enabling it to take the Dash action, enhancing its mobility significantly in combat scenarios. This combination of swift attacks, health regeneration, and versatility in movement ensures that the Vampiric Vanguard is a dangerous foe, capable of turning the tide of battle with its deadly presence.
