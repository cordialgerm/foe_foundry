The Mountain Dwarf Soldier is a robust and disciplined humanoid warrior known for its resilience and combat proficiency. With an Armor Class of 16, this soldier is relatively difficult to hit, making them a formidable presence on the battlefield. Their Hit Points total 19, providing them with decent survivability for their Challenge Rating of 1/2, which allows them to be a viable opponent for low-level adventurers. They possess a balanced mix of physical strength and endurance, with a Strength score of 14, which gives them a good modifier of +2, and a Constitution score of 14, also granting a +2 modifier. However, they are not overly charismatic or wise, with scores of 10 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, translating to average performance in those areas. 

The Mountain Dwarf Soldier has proficiency in two saving throws, Strength and Constitution, both of which are rated as good with a +4 modifier. In addition, they have skills in perception and survival, with modifiers of +2 for both. They possess a passive perception of 12, enabling them to notice hidden creatures or traps effectively.

In terms of actions, the Mountain Dwarf Soldier can use a handaxe for combat either in melee or ranged situations. The modifier to hit is +4, with a reach of 5 feet in melee or a range of 20/60 feet for ranged attacks. When the soldier hits with a handaxe, they deal 5 slashing damage (1d6 + 2), or 9 slashing damage (2d6 + 2) if they are within 5 feet of an ally who is not incapacitated. This reflects their ability to coordinate tactics effectively in a group, increasing their damage output when working alongside allies.

This ability is useful for repositioning or retreating safely in combat without exposing themselves to further damage after engaging in combat. Overall, the Mountain Dwarf Soldier is a solid and capable fighter in melee or ranged situations, well-suited for group tactics and battlefield coordination.
