The Hooden Horse is a medium undead creature embodying a lawful evil alignment. This monstrous, spectral steed is characterized by its ability to hunt down wrongdoers and exact a chilling form of justice. With a formidable presence on the battlefield, it boasts a good armor class of 14 and 117 hit points, allowing it to endure significant damage. The Hooden Horse has high strength, good dexterity, and an exceptional charisma, enabling it to be both a formidable combatant and an eerie manipulator in social situations. It has vulnerabilities to fire, but it is immune to necrotic and poison damage, making it resistant to common damage types faced by many foes. 

In terms of attributes, the Hooden Horse exhibits a strength of 18, granting it a +4 modifier, making its physical attacks very good. It has a dexterity of 14 (+2 modifier), which is good, and a constitution of 14 (+2 modifier), offering solid durability. Its intelligence is 12 (+1 modifier), which is average, while its wisdom is 15 (+2 modifier), providing it with keen perception, as reflected in its perception skill of +5. The creature's charisma is exceptionally high at 19, providing it with a +4 modifier that significantly enhances its interaction abilities and charm effects.

The Hooden Horse is armed with special abilities that enhance its capabilities in combat. The *Harvest Life* ability allows it to regain 10 hit points (3d6) whenever it reduces a creature to 0 hit points, giving it a sustainable edge in prolonged encounters. The *Seek Wrongdoer* ability automatically guides the Hooden Horse to the nearest surviving criminal connected to its creation, ensuring it is always focused on its target.

In combat, the Hooden Horse can execute a *Multiattack*, using its action to make two *Blade of Retribution* attacks. This melee weapon attack comes with a +7 to hit and inflicts 9 (1d10 + 4) necrotic damage. Notably, targets hit by this attack must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, suffering 14 (4d6) psychic damage if they fail, or half on a successful save. If the target is identified as the wrongdoer that summoned the Hooden Horse, they suffer disadvantage on this saving throw, making it very effective against its intended prey.

Additionally, the Hooden Horse has the *Call to Judgment* action, which allows it to demand submission from a visible target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become charmed for one minute. Charmed targets are compelled to move towards the Hooden Horse, taking the Dash action to do so. They can repeat their saving throw to break the effect if they are more than 5 feet away or when they take damage from the Hooden Horse. This ability can control the battlefield effectively, forcing enemies to confront the Hooden Horse while also allowing for opportunities to deal immediate damage.

Overall, the Hooden Horse is a powerful undead adversary that combines physical prowess with manipulation and restorative capabilities, making it a potentially terrifying foe for any adventuring party.
