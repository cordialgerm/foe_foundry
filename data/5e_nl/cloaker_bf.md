The Cloaker is a large aberration that embodies an unusual combination of menace and deception. It is characterized by its ability to blend into its surroundings, disguising itself as an ordinary dark leather cloak. This allows it to ambush unsuspecting prey with devastating attacks. With a respectable challenge rating of 8, the Cloaker boasts strengths in both offense and defense, including high damage potential and various abilities that let it resist control effects and mitigate damage when it is attached to a victim. However, the creature is significantly less effective in bright light, which can hinder its attack capabilities and perception. Its blend of brute force with psychological tactics makes it a formidable opponent in combat situations.

The Cloaker has an Armor Class of 14, which is considered good, and 105 hit points, providing it with a solid amount of durability. Its movement speed is 10 feet on the ground and 40 feet when flying, allowing it to maneuver effectively in battle. The Cloaker has the following attributes: Strength at +4 (good), Dexterity at +5 (very good), Constitution at +1 (average), Intelligence at +1 (average), Wisdom at +1 (average), and Charisma at +2 (average). It possesses darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, a Perception score of 11 (average), and Stealth capabilities with a score of 15 (good). The Cloaker understands Deep Speech and Undercommon languages.

The Cloaker’s special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness. It has Aberrant Resilience, which grants it resistance against the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, while also providing it advantage on saves against spells or effects that would alter its form, making its resilience exceptional. Its Damage Transfer ability allows it to take only half of the damage dealt to it while it is attached to a creature, with the other half inflicted on the victim. The False Appearance ability enables the Cloaker to remain undetected while motionless as it camouflages itself as a cloak, which is a very effective tactic for surprise attacks. Additionally, it suffers from Light Sensitivity, giving it disadvantage on attack rolls and significantly reducing its Perception score when exposed to bright light.

In combat, the Cloaker can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack followed by two Tail attacks. The Bite has a +7 to hit and deals 18 piercing damage (4d6 + 4), and if the target is Large or smaller, the Cloaker attaches to it, blinding the target and preventing it from breathing. While attached, the Cloaker inflicts ongoing damage of 18 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns, making it extremely dangerous when it successfully attaches to a target. The Tail attack also has a +7 to hit and reaches out to 10 feet, dealing 17 slashing damage (3d8 + 4).

The Cloaker has a special action called Moan, which can be used after a recharge of 6 turns. The Cloaker emits a deep, resonating moan that must be heard to affect enemies. Creatures within 30 feet that aren't aberrations must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 40 psychic damage (9d8) and be frightened until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the damage is halved, but they remain unaffected by the fear condition.

As a bonus action, the Cloaker can use the Cloak of Shadows ability three times per day. In darkness, it obscures its form for 1 minute or until it is hit by an attack. During this time, its Stealth score increases to 20, and attackers against it suffer disadvantage, making it even harder for foes to successfully land their hits.
