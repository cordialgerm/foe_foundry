The Venom Elemental is a large, neutral elemental creature characterized by its ability to inflict poison damage and evade attacks through its unique abilities and resistances. With anArmor Class of 14, it possesses good defenses, while its 93 hit points grant it relatively high survivability in combat. This creature swims swiftly at a speed of 50 feet and can walk at 40 feet, making it very mobile both in water and on land. As a challenge rating of 4, the Venom Elemental poses a moderate threat, granting 1,100 experience points upon defeat. Notable strengths include its immunity to poison damage and various conditions, alongside an effective multiattack option that can incapacitate adversaries through poison effects. However, it has lower-than-average intelligence, making it less nuanced in combat strategy, and its ability to understand Primordial without being able to speak limits its communication with other creatures.

The Venom Elemental possesses the following attributes: Strength is rated at 17, granting it a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee combat. Dexterity is at 14 with a +2 modifier, indicating good defensive capabilities through stealth and evasion. Constitution is rated at 16, also with a +3 modifier, providing favorable hit points. Intelligence is low at 6 (-2 modifier), resulting in very bad cognitive abilities. Wisdom is average at 10 (0 modifier), and Charisma is weak at 8 (-1 modifier), reflecting a general lack of social prowess.

The creature has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. With the ability "Liquid Form," the Venom Elemental can move through a space as narrow as one inch without squeezing, allowing it to navigate tight spaces and surprise enemies. This ability enables it to enter hostile creatures' spaces, potentially giving it a tactical advantage. Additionally, "Underwater Camouflage" grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while underwater, making it exceptionally difficult to detect in watery environments.

In terms of actions, the Venom Elemental can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two bite attacks during its turn. Each "Bite" is a melee weapon attack made with a +5 to hit, which is a good bonus for landing successful hits against opponents. The reach of this attack is 10 feet, enabling it to target foes from a distance. On a successful hit, it deals 6 piercing damage from the bite, plus an additional 7 poison damage (2d6), making it a significant threat to health. Furthermore, any creature struck must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failure results in the target being poisoned until the end of its next turn, thereby impairing their abilities in combat. This combination of damage and conditions makes the Venom Elemental a formidable opponent in battle.
