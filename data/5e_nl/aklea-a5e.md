Aklea is a gargantuan celestial creature, embodying immense power and divine authority. With a formidable Armor Class of 21 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 656, it is a challenging opponent rated at Challenge Level 22, making it a significant threat in any encounter. Aklea possesses tremendous physical and magical capabilities, evidenced by its high attributes across Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Its distinguishing features include exceptional damage immunities to radiant damage and damage from non-magical weapons, positioning it as a resilient adversary. However, despite its strengths, the creature is primarily reliant on its spellcasting and physical attacks to dominate the battlefield.

Aklea's statistics are notably impressive. It has a Strength score of 30 which translates to a +10 modifier, making its attack potential exceptionally high. Its Dexterity of 24 grants it a +7 modifier, contributing to its speed and evasiveness. With a Constitution score of 30, it also has a +10 modifier, reinforcing its substantial health pool. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are also high at 22 (+6), 24 (+7), and 26 (+8), respectively, indicating Aklea's strong spellcasting ability and social prowess. 

For saving throws, Aklea has bonuses of +17 for Strength and Constitution, +13 for Intelligence, +14 for Wisdom, and +15 for Charisma, all of which are considered very good, indicating proficiency in resisting various effects. Its skills and sense of truesight at 120 feet, along with a passive Perception score of 17, further enhance its battlefield awareness and strategic capabilities.

Aklea's unique abilities include Divine Grace, where it nullifies damage on successful saving throws against effects that deal half damage, and takes only half damage on failures. While wearing medium armor, it can add its entire Dexterity modifier to its Armor Class, which is noted in its statistics. Its innate spellcasting ability, powered by Charisma with a spell save DC of 23, allows it to cast a variety of spells without the need for material components. This includes spells cast at will like charm person and telekinesis, as well as more powerful spells such as flame strike and hold monster used three times a day, and commune and greater restoration available once daily. 

In terms of actions, Aklea's Maul attack inflicts an average of 38 bludgeoning damage plus 14 radiant damage, with the added risk of pushing the target back and knocking them prone on a failed Strength saving throw (DC 25). Its Lightning Bolt lets it unleash a powerful bolt of 100 feet, dealing a tremendous average of 28 lightning damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw (DC 23), allowing for the potential to hit multiple foes. Flame Strike sends a column of flame that deals both fire and radiant damage to enemies within a specific radius. Hold Monster allows Aklea to paralyze a creature, potentially removing them from the fight for a significant duration unless they can succeed on repeated Wisdom saving throws.

Aklea also possesses a Bonus Action called Immortal Form, allowing it to change size between Gargantuan and Medium, although it gains disadvantage on Strength checks when in its smaller form. 

In combat, Aklea can take up to one legendary action at a time, choosing to attack, cast a spell, fly a short distance, or unleash a powerful shout that can stun and damage creatures within range. The knockdown nature of many of its actions and legendary capabilities makes Aklea a force to be reckoned with, often controlling the flow of battle through its diverse array of offensive and defensive options.
