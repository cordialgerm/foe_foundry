The Clockwork Servant is a Medium Construct with an unaligned nature, making it a versatile helper rather than a combat-focused creature. With a modest armor class of 11 and 22 hit points, it is not particularly durable, but its strengths lie in its ability to assist characters and its immunity to a variety of detrimental effects, making it a reliable ally in non-combat scenarios. The servant's challenge rating of 1/8 indicates that it is a low-level threat, providing only 25 experience points upon defeat. 

The attributes of the Clockwork Servant are as follows: Strength is 14, providing a good modifier of +2 which adds to its melee attack effectiveness. Dexterity is 12, giving a modifier of +1, resulting in average agility and reflexes. Constitution sits at 13 with a +1 modifier, indicating average resilience. Intelligence is 8, reflecting a very bad capability for complex reasoning with a -1 modifier. Wisdom is 12, resulting in a +1 modifier, which provides average insight. Charisma is 7, resulting in a very bad -2 modifier, signifying a lack of charm and social skills.

The Clockwork Servant is proficient in Investigation with a +3 modifier, which is considered good, and has a high Perception score with a +5, allowing it to notice details effectively in its surroundings. Additionally, it has immunities to poison and psychic damage, as well as immunity to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it a stable companion in many situations. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 15, allowing it to see in low-light conditions effectively. Finally, it can understand Common but does not possess the ability to speak.

In terms of special abilities, the Clockwork Servant possesses "Domestic Retainer," allowing it to cast the mending and prestidigitation cantrips at will without the need for spell components. This makes it particularly useful for minor repairs and maintaining cleanliness or creating small magical effects. The ability "Immutable Form" grants it immunity to any spell or effect that seeks to alter its form, which means it cannot be transformed or reshaped through magical means. Additionally, "Magic Resistance" provides it with an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its resilience against magic.

For its actions, the Clockwork Servant has a melee weapon attack called "Slam" that allows it to strike a target within 5 feet. It attacks with a +4 bonus to hit, which is good, making it relatively effective in combat situations. On a successful hit, the slam deals 5 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 1d6 plus 2 from its Strength modifier. While it is not primarily a combatant, this ability allows it to defend itself if necessary.
