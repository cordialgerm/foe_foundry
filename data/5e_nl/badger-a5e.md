The badger is a tiny beast known for its strong sense of smell and modest physical capabilities. With an Armor Class of 10 and only 3 hit points, it is not a formidable opponent in combat; however, it can be useful for scouting and sneaking due to its burrowing ability and keen senses. The badger has a challenge rating of 0, indicating it poses very little threat to experienced adventurers, granting only 25 experience points upon defeat. Its low strength and intelligence make it weak in direct confrontations, but its advantage in Perception checks relying on smell allows it to be a relatively effective tracker or scout in specific scenarios.

The badger's attributes show a low strength score of 4, resulting in a modifier of -3, which is considered very bad. It has a dexterity score of 10, giving it an average modifier of +0, meaning it does not excel in agility but can perform basic maneuvers. Its constitution score is 12, translating to a good modifier of +1, allowing it to endure minor harm. The intelligence score is extremely low at 2, leading to a modifier of -4, which is exceptionally poor. The wisdom score is moderate at 12, providing a good +1 modifier that supports its perception abilities, while its charisma of 4 results in a very bad modifier of -3.

In terms of senses, the badger possesses darkvision that allows it to see in low light up to 30 feet, augmenting its ability to navigate dark environments. It has a passive perception score of 11, reflecting its capability to notice details in its surroundings without actively seeking them out.

One of the badger's notable special abilities is "Keen Smell," which grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell. This means when the badger attempts to detect creatures or objects through scent, it can roll two d20s and take the higher result, significantly increasing its chances of success.

In combat, the badger can perform a "Bite" action, which is a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit and a reach of 5 feet targeting one creature. If it successfully hits, it deals 1 piercing damage. However, a unique aspect of this attack is that if the damage would reduce a Small or larger target to 0 hit points, that target takes no damage from the badger’s bite. This mechanic helps prevent the badger from potentially eliminating larger creatures outright, highlighting its role as more of an annoyance rather than a serious threat in battles.
