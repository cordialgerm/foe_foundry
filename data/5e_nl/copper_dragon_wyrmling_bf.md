The Copper Dragon Wyrmling is a medium dragon known for its agility and cunning, serving as a formidable foe or a potential ally in adventures. This creature has a challenge rating of 1, indicating it is a reasonable threat for lower-level adventurers. The wyrmling possesses strong Dexterity and Charisma, making it effective in stealth and social interactions. However, it has average Strength but decent Constitution, implying some resilience in combat. With respectable armor and mobility, alongside special abilities, this dragon can be formidable, especially when leveraging its unique breath attacks. Its vulnerabilities stem primarily from its lower hit points compared to other dragons and its dependence on positioning for maximum effectiveness in combat.

The Copper Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: 

- Strength: +2 (average modifier)
- Dexterity: +3 (good modifier)
- Constitution: +3 (good modifier)
- Intelligence: +2 (average modifier)
- Wisdom: +2 (average modifier)
- Charisma: +3 (good modifier)

For senses, it has darkvision up to 60 feet and keensense for an additional 10 feet, allowing it to see in dim light and detect nearby creatures easily. Its Perception score is 14, providing it with a good awareness of its surroundings, while its Stealth score is 13 enables it to move quietly and remain undetected. The wyrmling speaks Draconic, which grants it the ability to communicate with other creatures fluent in that language.

The Copper Dragon Wyrmling has several special abilities:

- **Pounce:** If the dragon moves at least 15 feet toward a creature and successfully hits it with a claw attack, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the dragon can use a bonus action to make an additional claw attack against it, increasing its damage output when it successfully executes this maneuver.

The dragon can perform the following actions during combat:

- **Multiattack:** This allows the dragon to make one bite attack and one claw attack on its turn, providing flexibility and the ability to deal different types of damage.
  
- **Bite:** This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage on a successful attack.
  
- **Claw:** Similar to the bite, this melee attack also has a +4 to hit and deals 5 slashing damage.

In addition to its physical attacks, the Copper Dragon Wyrmling possesses breath attacks:

- **Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon can exhale acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures in the line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful save. This ability can impact multiple targets at once, making it a potent area-of-effect attack.
  
- **Slowing Breath (Recharge 6):** The dragon can exhale a slowing gas in a 15-foot cone, affecting creatures in that area. Those who fail a DC 11 Constitution saving throw find their reactions unusable, speed halved, and can only take one attack on their turn. They may act with either an action or a bonus action but not both. The effects can be repeated at the end of each creature's turn, potentially weakening enemies significantly for the duration of one minute.

Overall, the Copper Dragon Wyrmling is a dynamic creature whose unique combination of speed, dexterity, and powerful breath attacks can give it a strategic advantage in encounters.
