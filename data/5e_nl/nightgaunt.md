The Nightgaunt is a formidable aberration characterized by its large size and lawful evil alignment. Serving as a hunter of dreams and nightmares, it is a creature that utilizes stealth and psychological terror to dominate its foes. With an Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of 142 hit points, the Nightgaunt is capable of withstanding a good deal of damage while effectively dealing it in return. It boasts strong physical attributes—particularly in Strength and Constitution, both rated at +4—making it a very good melee combatant. Despite its low Intelligence, reflected by a -3 modifier, the Nightgaunt compensates with a good Wisdom modifier of +3, allowing it to be perceptive and intimidating. Its abilities grant it advantages in combat, particularly when it is not alone, enhancing its threat level significantly.

The Nightgaunt has various abilities that add to its effectiveness during encounters. It has a flying speed of 60 feet, allowing it to maneuver effortlessly across the battlefield. Thanks to its Flyby ability, it can evade opportunity attacks when leaving an enemy's reach, increasing its mobility. With Pack Tactics, it gains advantage on attack rolls against targets within 5 feet of any of its allies, making it particularly dangerous when engaging in group tactics. Additionally, its Magic Resistance gives it an edge against spellcasters, as it has advantage on saving throws against spells. The Utterly Silent ability allows it to be exceptionally stealthy, granting it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, making it difficult for enemies to detect.

The Nightgaunt possesses several actions that enhance its combat abilities. Through its Multiattack feature, it can initiate its Baneful Presence and then follow up with three attacks, which consist of two Clutching Claw strikes and one attack with its Barbed Tail. 

The Clutching Claws allow the Nightgaunt to make melee weapon attacks with a +8 to hit. Each successful hit deals an average of 13 slashing damage (2d8 + 4) and grapples any Medium or smaller target, which restrains them until the grapple ends. The escape DC is 16, making it moderately difficult for targets to break free. During this grapple, the Nightgaunt cannot use that claw to attack.

The Barbed Tail also has a +8 to hit and deals 8 piercing damage (1d8 + 4) plus an additional 10 poison damage (3d6), making it a potent attack when employed. 

The Baneful Presence ability affects all creatures within 30 feet who are aware of the Nightgaunt, requiring them to succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in disadvantage on all attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute, significantly impairing the affected creatures. They can attempt to shake off the effect at the end of each of their turns, but a successful saving throw grants immunity to Baneful Presence for the following 24 hours. 

Overall, the Nightgaunt presents a unique combination of terror, stealth, and physical prowess, making it a dangerous entity in any encounter, particularly when working alongside allies to capitalize on its pack tactics.
