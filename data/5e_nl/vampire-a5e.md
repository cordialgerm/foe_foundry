The Vampire is a formidable Medium Undead creature, known for its cunning and overwhelming strength on the battlefield. With a challenge rating of 11, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, bolstered by impressive abilities and high defenses. The Vampire possesses strong melee capabilities, allowing it to grapple and drain the life force of its victims while also charming them, making it a dangerous adversary both in combat and when manipulating party dynamics. Its high Armor Class of 16 and substantial hit points of 142 provide resilience. However, it is vulnerable to sunlight and running water, which can impose significant damage and deactivate some of its abilities. This combination of strengths and weaknesses makes the Vampire a challenging foe that requires careful strategy to defeat.

It has resistances to necrotic damage and damage from non-magical, non-silvered weapons, which makes it fairly durable against standard physical attacks.

It can understand the languages it knew in life but cannot speak.

The Vampire has notable special abilities:
- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): This ability allows the Vampire to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, showcasing its exceptional resilience. Each time it uses this ability, it visibly ages until it completes a long rest.
- Misty Recovery: Upon reaching 0 hit points, instead of falling unconscious, the Vampire turns to mist and must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. It becomes paralyzed for one hour upon returning to its resting place, resetting its hit points while vulnerable to certain types of damage during that time.
- Regeneration: The Vampire heals for 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and has not taken radiant damage since its last turn, making it very hard to defeat without specific strategies.
- Spider Climb: It can traverse difficult surfaces and odd orientations like ceilings, enhancing its mobility.
- Vampire Weaknesses: Vulnerable to sunlight and running water, taking 20 radiant damage upon ending its turn in contact with either, which also prevents it from using certain abilities.
- Resting Place: It must spend at least one hour per day in a specially prepared resting place to regain its powers.

The Vampire’s attacks include:
- Grab (Vampire Form Only): Makes a melee attack with an attack bonus of +9, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage plus 4 necrotic damage, and can grapple the target, which can attempt to escape with a DC of 17. This is a good tactical attack for control.
- Charm: Targets a creature within 30 feet, forcing a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the target becomes charmed and views the Vampire as a trusted ally for 24 hours. This is an excellent ability to manipulate combat dynamics as the charmed target will be willing to cooperate with the Vampire's actions.

In terms of bonus actions, the Vampire can use:
- Bite: A melee attack with +9 to hit, it deals 10 piercing damage plus 21 necrotic damage. This ability reduces the target’s hit point maximum by the necrotic damage dealt and allows the Vampire to regain that many hit points, making it very dangerous.

For reactions, the Vampire can utilize:
- Hissing Scuttle (1/Day): Avoids opportunity attacks and moves up to its speed when taking radiant damage, which is a good escape tactic when injured.
- Warding Charm (1/Day): Can use Charm as a reaction when targeted by a melee attack, offering significant defensive and strategic options.

The Vampire also has legendary actions it can utilize at the end of another creature's turn:
- Blood Charm: Uses Charm with disadvantage on the initial saving throw against a target it has bitten recently.
- Grab: Makes a grab attack as an additional action.
- Mist Form: Transforms into mist, gaining advantages for stealth and evasion.
- Shapechange: Transforms into a Medium or smaller beast, allowing versatility in approaches.

Overall, the Vampire is a powerful creature that combines melee prowess, life-draining capabilities, charm, and resilience, making it a complex and formidable opponent in combat scenarios.
