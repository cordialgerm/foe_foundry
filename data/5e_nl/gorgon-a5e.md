The Gorgon is a formidable and large monstrosity known for its brute strength and petrifying abilities. With a solid Armor Class of 19 and a substantial pool of 110 hit points, the Gorgon is quite durable in combat, making it a challenging foe for adventurers. Its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it poses a significant threat to parties of mid-level adventurers, rewarding them with 2,300 experience points upon defeat. The Gorgon excels in melee combat, utilizing its powerful Gore and Hooves attacks to inflict considerable damage. However, its intelligence is low, limiting its strategic capabilities. The Gorgon can also utilize its petrifying breath to immobilize and potentially eliminate foes, making it vital to manage position and distance during encounters.

In terms of attributes, the Gorgon has a Strength of 20, offering an exceptional modifier of +5, making it highly effective in physical combat. Its Dexterity is average at 10, providing a modifier of +0 that does not significantly enhance its agility. With a Constitution of 16 (+3) and a good hit point total of 110, the Gorgon can endure considerable damage during battles. Its Intelligence is very low at 2 (-4), indicating poor cognitive abilities, while its Wisdom at 12 (+1) gives it an average perception. The Charisma score of 5 (-3) signifies that it is not influential in social interactions.

The Gorgon has a perception skill of +4, which is good and allows it to notice hidden creatures or objects effectively. It is immune to the petrified condition, meaning it cannot be turned to stone itself. The creature's senses provide a passive perception of 14, allowing it to detect threats nearby without active searching.

In combat, the Gorgon has several actions. Its Gore attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, if the Gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before executing this attack, it deals an extra 6 (1d12) piercing damage, making it a highly impactful move when positioned correctly. The Hooves attack is similarly structured with a +8 to hit and delivers 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, underscoring the Gorgon's brute force.

The Gorgon also possesses a powerful special ability called Petrifying Breath, which can be used after a recharge period of rolling a 5 or 6 on a six-sided die. This ability allows the Gorgon to exhale petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone, requiring all creatures in the area to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in a creature being restrained and beginning to turn to stone. This status persists until the beginning of the Gorgon's next turn, at which point the creature must repeat the saving throw. Success will end the effect, while failure will result in full petrification, which can only be removed through effects such as greater restoration.

As a bonus action, the Gorgon can use Trample Underfoot to attack a creature that is already prone, demonstrating its capability to take advantage of its enemies' misfortune in combat.

Overall, the Gorgon is an encapsulation of raw strength and dangerous abilities, making it a worthy adversary in any high-stakes encounter.
