The Drider is a large monstrosity that combines the traits of both a spider and a humanoid. This creature is formidable in combat, boasting an Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor and a robust 112 hit points, making it well-equipped to withstand attacks. It has a challenge rating of 6, indicating a significant threat to adventurers. The Drider possesses high Dexterity, giving it an exceptional modifier of +6, which enhances its ability to dodge attacks and improve its stealth capabilities, as reflected in its Stealth score of 19. Despite its strengths, the Drider has a notable weakness: it is sensitive to sunlight, suffering disadvantage on attack rolls and a reduced perception while exposed to it. With its combination of stealth and strength, the Drider is a dangerous opponent that can manipulate the battlefield with its web abilities.

The attributes of the Drider include the following. It has a Strength score of 13, with a modifier of +3, which is considered average for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is 22, giving it an exceptional +6 modifier, significantly enhancing its agility and stealth. The Constitution score is 18, with a +4 modifier that grants it very good resilience to damage and status effects. Intelligence is 12, with a +1 modifier, indicating basic mental acuity. Wisdom is 14, with a +2 modifier, providing it with a good perception score of 15. Lastly, its Charisma is 12, also with a +1 modifier, showing that it has average social interaction capabilities.

The Drider has several special abilities that enhance its prowess in and out of combat. "Fey Ancestry" grants it resistance to the charmed condition, making it harder for magical influences to sway it, and it cannot be put to sleep by magic, which is a very good advantage in many situations. "Monstrosity Resilience" allows it to resist exhaustion and the frightened condition, providing it with average endurance under pressure. "Spider Climb" enables the Drider to effortlessly climb on difficult surfaces, including upside-down on ceilings, without needing to roll for the check, making it exceptionally mobile in environments where vertical movement is advantageous. However, it suffers from "Sunlight Sensitivity" which causes disadvantage on attack rolls while in sunlight and reduces its perception by sight to a score of 10. "Web Sense" allows the Drider to know the exact location of any creature touching the same web it is in contact with, providing significant tactical advantages when setting ambushes. Finally, "Web Walker" means the Drider can move freely without restrictions caused by webbing.

In terms of combat actions, the Drider can utilize a "Multiattack" option, which allows it to make one Longsword attack and two Skewer attacks, or it can choose to make three Web Shot attacks in a single turn. The "Longsword" attack has a +6 to hit and can deal either 7 slashing damage with one hand or 8 slashing damage with both hands, making it a good melee option. The "Skewer" attack, also with a +6 to hit, deals 6 piercing damage plus an additional 13 poison damage on a successful hit, making it a potent choice against foes vulnerable to poison. The "Web Shot" is a ranged attack that also benefits from a +6 to hit. It has a range of 30 feet normally and 60 feet at disadvantage, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage. Importantly, it forces the target to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become restrained by webbing, presenting a strong tactical advantage. A creature can attempt to break free with a successful DC 15 Strength check on its action, which invites interesting interactions and cooperative tactics among players.

Overall, the Drider is a cunning adversary that skillfully uses its abilities and combat options to maintain a dangerous presence on the battlefield.
