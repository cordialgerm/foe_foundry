The Witchalder is a Medium-sized plant creature with a neutral evil alignment, embodying a blend of resilience and menace in its environment. With an Armor Class of 15, the Witchalder boasts solid natural defenses complemented by its Hit Points totaling 102, derived from rolling 12d8 plus a substantial Constitution modifier. It has a walking speed of 30 feet, making it moderately mobile in engagements. Assigned a Challenge Rating of 6, it can provide a significant challenge for lower-level adventurers. The creature is adept at grappling and control tactics, capable of dealing substantial bludgeoning damage and applying debilitating effects in combat. Its vulnerabilities to fire, combined with resistances to bludgeoning damage and immunities to being charmed or poisoned, highlight its strengths while revealing its weaknesses.

The Witchalder's attributes reflect its nature as a formidable foe. It has a Strength score of 19, translating to a very good modifier of +4, allowing for powerful physical attacks. Its Dexterity is low, at 9 with a negative modifier, indicating very bad agility. The Constitution score of 18 results in a very good +4 modifier, contributing to its impressive durability. An Intelligence score of 9 gives it a bad modifier, minimizing its mental capabilities. Wisdom is relatively strong with a score of 16, leading to a good +3 modifier, which aids in perception and offers some resilience against mental effects. The Charisma score is average at 10, providing a neutral modifier.

In terms of saving throws, the Witchalder has a +2 modifier for Dexterity saves, indicative of good efficacy despite its low base score, and a +6 modifier for Wisdom saves, which is very good and aids in resisting many harmful effects. With a passive perception of 15, it can effectively notice threats and surroundings. The creature can understand Sylvan but is unable to speak, which may impact interactions with characters that rely on communication.

The Witchalder possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and survival. With Deep Roots, it has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws against effects that would move it against its will, giving it exceptional stability. Its False Appearance ability allows it to remain motionless and appear indistinguishable from a disease-ridden tree, granting it an advantage in ambush situations. The Sunlight Regeneration feature enables it to regain 5 hit points at the start of its turn while in sunlight if it has at least 1 hit point remaining, providing remarkable sustainability during the day. Showcasing its connection to nature, the Speak with Plants ability allows the Witchalder to communicate with plant life, which could prove useful in gathering information or manipulating its natural surroundings.

In combat, the Witchalder's Multiattack action allows it to make two Slam attacks, potentially dealing notable damage, totaling 18 (4d6+4) bludgeoning damage with a +7 to hit. It can replace one Slam with Throttle, which targets one creature it is grappling, dealing the same damage of 18 while also restricting the creature's ability to breathe, speak, or cast verbal spells until it escapes the grapple. The Shape Wood ability gives it the power to alter the form of wooden objects within a 30-foot range, with significant tactical implications for manipulating the battlefield. Lastly, its Pollen Cloud ability, which can be used after a recharge period, releases a cloud that inflicts 22 (5d8) poison damage to all creatures within a 15-foot radius, and potentially incapacitates them for 1 minute unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw.

Overall, the Witchalder is a dangerous enemy well-equipped for ambush tactics and control in combat, capable of inflicting damage while exploiting its surroundings to gain tactical advantages.
