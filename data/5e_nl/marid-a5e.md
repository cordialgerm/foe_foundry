The Marid is a formidable Large Elemental creature, embodying the essence of water and capable of both melee and magical combat. With an Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of 172 hit points, it is well-equipped to endure extended conflicts. The Marid boasts impressive Strength and Constitution scores, both at 22, which grants it exceptional attack capabilities and resilience in battle, while its Dexterity of 16 ensures decent mobility. As a Challenge Rating 11 creature, it is intended for high-level encounters, providing considerable challenge and tactical depth.

The Marid has a diverse set of abilities and weaknesses that shape its role in combat. It possesses damage resistances to acid, cold, and lightning, making it resilient against many elemental attacks. It also has impressive saving throws with a +10 in Constitution and +7 in Intelligence and Charisma, indicating strong defenses against effects that target those attributes. 

In gameplay, the Marid can utilize its Amphibious ability to thrive both in water and on land, breathing air and water without limitation. Its innate spellcasting, with a spell save DC of 15, allows it to cast spells such as "alter self" to change its form, "control water" for battlefield manipulation, and "conjure elemental" to summon allies when needed. This flexibility in casting enhances its adaptability during encounters. 

In terms of actions, the Marid can perform a Multiattack, making two trident strikes, which utilize a +10 to hit and have a reach of 10 feet or a range of 20/60 feet, delivering solid pierce damage alongside additional lightning damage if successful. The trident can return to the Marid after being thrown, making it an effective ranged weapon as well. The Marid can also employ a net attack to restrain enemies, requiring a DC 18 Strength check to free those ensnared.

Using its bonus actions, the Marid can create a Fog Cloud, obscuring a 30-foot radius area, useful for controlling visibility and surprise tactics. It can also unleash a Water Jet when bloodied, forcing creatures in a designated area to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw against bludgeoning damage while potentially pushing them away and knocking them proneâ€”an effective area control ability that can shift combat dynamics.

Overall, the Marid combines physical prowess with magical versatility, making it a potent adversary or ally, capable of swaying the tide of battle with its diverse range of abilities and strategic options.
