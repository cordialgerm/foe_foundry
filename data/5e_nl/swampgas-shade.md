The Swampgas Shade is a Medium-sized undead creature that embodies a neutral evil alignment. It serves as a lurking menace in swampy environments, utilizing its ability to fly and natural camouflage to ambush unsuspecting prey. With a moderate challenge rating of 2, the shade is a formidable foe thanks to its ability to drain the life force of others and the capacity to return from death, making it a persistent threat in its domain. While it is vulnerable to radiant damage, it is immune to necrotic and poison damage, and it exhibits numerous immunities to various conditions, which makes it tough to deal with in combat. Despite its relatively low armor class of 13, its hit points (39) provide it with decent durability, especially when coupled with its ability to return after death.

The Swampgas Shade has the following attributes: Strength 6 with a modifier of -2, Dexterity 17 with a modifier of +3 (which is good), Constitution 15 with a modifier of +2 (which is average), Intelligence 8 with a modifier of -1 (which is bad), Wisdom 12 with a modifier of +1 (average), and Charisma 8 with a modifier of -1 (bad). It is particularly dexterous, contributing positively to its stealth capabilities, and has a good saving throw against Wisdom with a +3 modifier.

In terms of special abilities, the shade possesses several unique features: 

- **Amorphous:** This ability allows the Swampgas Shade to move through spaces that are only 1 foot wide or larger without squeezing, giving it significant maneuverability in tight areas.
- **Rejuvenation:** If the Swampgas Shade dies within its designated swamp region, it can revive in 1d4 days and will regain all its hit points unless it is put to rest, which requires reburial of its corpse outside the swamp.
- **Swampbound:** This ability binds the shade to a specific swamp area within a one-mile radius of its corpse. If it exits this area, it loses its Soul Drain action until it returns. Moreover, if it remains outside for 24 hours, it automatically teleports back to its body, ensuring it remains a threat.
- **Swamp Camouflage:** The shade gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in swamp environments, making it difficult for adversaries to detect it.
- **Undead Nature:** As an undead creature, it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate without the restrictions of biological needs.

In terms of actions, the Swampgas Shade can perform the following:

- **Soul Drain:** This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, impacting one creature. It deals 12 (2d8+3) psychic damage and reduces the target's Charisma score by 1d4. If the Charisma score drops to 0, the target dies. Otherwise, the reduction persists until the target completes a short or long rest. Notably, if a humanoid dies from this attack, they cannot be restored to life until the shade is finally put to rest.
- **Haunting Murmurs:** This ranged spell attack also has a +3 to hit, with a range of 60 feet. It deals 8 (1d8+3) psychic damage upon a successful hit.

The shade also has a bonus action available: 

- **Swampland Stealth:** In swampy terrain, the shade can take the Hide action as a bonus action, further enhancing its stealth capabilities and ability to ambush foes effectively. 

Overall, the Swampgas Shade is a clever and dangerous opponent, adept at evasion and life-draining tactics, making it an excellent adversary for adventurers navigating its murky territory.
