The eagle is a small beast known for its agility and keen senses, suitable for aerial surveillance and rapid movement. With a challenge rating of 0, it poses little threat to adventurers but can provide valuable support in scouting missions or as an animal companion. Its notable strengths include heightened perception, making it an exceptional observer, and the ability to swim, which adds a layer of versatility to its movement. However, it has weaknesses such as low hit points and poor physical strength, making it vulnerable in direct combat.

The eagle has an Armor Class of 11, which is average, and only 8 hit points, making it easily defeated. Its movement consists of a speed of 10 feet on the ground and an impressive flying speed of 60 feet, allowing it to navigate quickly in aerial combat or while scouting. 

In terms of ability scores, the eagle has a Strength score of -2, which is very bad and indicates poor physical prowess. Its Dexterity is +1, considered average, and grants it some agility. The eagle has Constitution at +0, which is average; its Intelligence is -4, notably very bad, reflecting its lack of cognitive abilities. Wisdom is +2, which is good, reflecting its attunement to its environment and enabling heightened sensory perception. Finally, the Charisma score of -2 is very bad, indicating that the eagle lacks social interaction capabilities.

The eagle's special abilities enhance its utility: its heightened sight ability increases its Perception score to 19 when using sight, making it exceptional for spotting hidden creatures or objects. Additionally, as a seabird, the eagle can swim up to 30 feet but must ensure it starts and ends its movement on solid surfaces or flying. If it fails to manage its position correctly while swimming, it risks sinking and suffocating unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw of DC 10. If it finds itself suffocating, it must succeed on a Strength check of DC 8 to escape the water.

For actions, the eagle has a talons attack. It makes a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, which is considered good. If it hits, it deals 3 slashing damage, calculated by rolling 1d4 and adding 1 to the result.

Overall, the eagle serves as a nimble and perceptive creature in the wilderness, providing utility without posing a significant threat in combat. Its ability to fly and swim adds an interesting dynamic, primarily when used alongside characters who require scouting or reconnaissance.
