The Dogmole is a medium-sized beast that serves as a formidable yet unaligned creature in the wild. With its strong physical attributes and unique burrowing abilities, the Dogmole is capable of navigating underground terrain, making it an interesting foe for adventurers who may find themselves in its territory. It boasts a solid Armor Class of 14 and a decent pool of hit points totaling 58, which allows it to withstand moderate amounts of damage in combat. Its overall challenge rating of 1 indicates it should present a reasonable encounter for low-level adventurers, providing both physical attacks and a special reaction ability that can turn the tide in battle. However, its weaknesses lie in its low Intelligence, lack of magical abilities, and vulnerability to overwhelming force from multiple foes.

In terms of attributes, the Dogmole has a Strength score of 14, granting it a good modifier of +2 for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is 17, which provides an exceptional +3 modifier that enhances its ability to avoid attacks, making it quite agile despite its burly appearance. The Constitution is 15 with a +2 modifier, indicating that it is robust and capable of withstanding physical challenges. Notably, its Intelligence is very low at 2, leading to a -4 modifier, which means it lacks advanced reasoning and can be easily outsmarted. Its Wisdom is average at 12 (+1), and Charisma is neutral at 10 (+0).

The Dogmole has a couple of special abilities to enhance its gameplay. Its "Burrowed Tunnels" ability allows it to create a 5-foot diameter tunnel while burrowing at half speed, useful for ambush tactics or for escaping from combat. This ability highlights its burrowing nature and can have strategic significance when exploring underground environments.

With regards to actions, the Dogmole can utilize a "Multiattack," meaning it can perform both a Bite and a Claw attack in one turn. The "Bite" attack rolls with a +5 to hit and can inflict 6 piercing damage on a successful strike. The "Claw" attack, also with a +5 to hit, does 8 slashing damage, making it quite effective in melee combat.

In terms of reactions, the Dogmole can access its "Wormkiller Rage" when it takes damage from or damages a Small or larger insectoid beast. This special rage lasts for 3 rounds and grants the Dogmole advantage on its attack rolls and Strength checks while also enhancing its Bite attack with an extra 2 piercing damage. While in this rage, its Armor Class drops by 2, making it riskier to engage, but the offensive advantages can be quite significant. However, it cannot willfully end this rage, which introduces an element of unpredictability to its behavior in combat.
