The Fidele Angel possesses several special abilities that greatly enhance its effectiveness in combat and support. The "Ever Connected" ability allows damage taken by the angel to be split evenly with its paired Fidele Angel, ensuring they share the burden of harm, while all other effects apply only to the specific target. The "Immortal Nature" ability indicates that the angel does not require food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to stay vigilant and active for prolonged periods. With "Magic Resistance," it gains advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its resilience to magic attacks. Its weapon attacks are classified as magical due to the "Magic Weapons" trait, ensuring that it can bypass many resistances enemies may have. The "Unshakeable Fidelity" ability guarantees that the Fidele Angel will not act against its mate or be swayed from its loyalty, emphasizing its unwavering devotion.

In terms of actions, the Fidele Angel can perform a "Multiattack," enabling it to make three attacks with either its Longsword or Radiant Bolt, or alternatively, it can make one Beak attack and two Talon attacks. The Longsword attack requires a +8 modifier to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 9 slashing damage on a hit (1d8 + 5), or 10 slashing damage (1d10 + 5) if used two-handed. The Beak attack, suitable only in bird form, also requires a +8 modifier to hit and delivers 8 piercing damage (1d6 + 5). The Talons attack, again limited to bird form, provides increased damage potential with +8 to hit and inflicting 12 slashing damage (2d6 + 5). The "Radiant Bolt," a ranged spell attack with a +7 modifier and a range of 120 feet, hits for 11 radiant damage (2d6 + 4).

The angel can use the "To My Lover’s Side" ability to magically teleport to its mate if they are more than one mile apart, allowing it to rapidly respond to threats or support its partner across distances and planes. For spellcasting, the angel can perform various spells without requiring material components, using its Charisma for spellcasting. It can cast spells such as "detect evil and good," "purify food and drink," and "spare the dying" at will, providing utility and support. Additionally, it can cast "bless," "cure wounds," and "daylight" three times a day, which can significantly enhance allies' combat effectiveness and support their survival in encounters.

Lastly, as a bonus action, the Fidele Angel can utilize "Change Shape" to transform into a Medium or smaller humanoid form, a large or smaller birdlike beast, or revert to its true form as a winged celestial. This transformation does not change its statistics aside from size and speed, allowing it to adapt as needed while keeping its gear intact, reverting to its true form upon death.
