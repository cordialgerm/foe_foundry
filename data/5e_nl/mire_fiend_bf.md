The Mire Fiend is a Medium fiend classified as a demon, presenting a mix of resilience and agility that makes it a formidable foe in combat. With an Armor Class of 22 due to its natural armor, it possesses good defenses and can absorb damage effectively, reinforced by its 94 hit points. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 5, indicating it's a significant threat to a party of adventurers. It can move quickly across land and swim with equal prowess, boasting a speed of 40 feet both on land and in water. The Mire Fiend has a variety of strengths including its ability to breathe in both air and water, resistance to multiple damage types, and an advantage on saving throws against magical effects. However, it exhibits weaknesses, such as being reliant on allies for maximizing its attack potency through its Pack Tactics ability and reduced effectiveness in non-swampy terrain due to its Swamp Camouflage feature.

The Mire Fiend has the following attributes: Strength +2 (average), Dexterity +6 (very good), Constitution +3 (good), Intelligence -3 (very bad), Wisdom +2 (average), and Charisma -2 (bad). Its Dexterity grants it a high initiative and increased Stealth with a value of 16 (good), making it difficult to detect. It can see in darkness for 60 feet and has keensense up to 10 feet, allowing it to detect hidden creatures. It speaks Abyssal, the language of demons.

The special abilities of the Mire Fiend enhance its effectiveness in combat. It is amphibious, able to function seamlessly in aquatic environments, and its Demonic Resilience grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage while being immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. This resilience allows it to withstand a variety of attacks. The creature also has Magic Resistance, giving it advantage on saving throws against spells, making it harder to impede its actions through magical means. Pack Tactics is an invaluable ability that provides an advantage to attack rolls against a target when an ally is nearby, significantly increasing its hit probability. In swampy terrain, its Stealth score of 21 (very good) makes it exceptionally difficult to detect.

In terms of actions, the Mire Fiend can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one attack with its Mandibles, one with its Spear, and one with its Stinger. The Mandibles attack has a +6 to hit and, on a successful hit, deals 12 slashing damage. The Spear can be used for both melee and ranged attacks, hitting for either 5 or 6 piercing damage depending on how itâ€™s wielded. The Stinger attack is particularly dangerous, with a +6 to hit, dealing 5 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being poisoned.

The Mire Fiend can also unleash a unique ability called Stunning Snap that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. If it has no creature grappled, it creates a powerful sonic attack in a 30-foot cone, requiring creatures in that area to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 21 thunder damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn, while a successful save results in half damage with no stunning effect.

As a reaction, the Mire Fiend possesses Acidic Retribution. Upon taking any damage, it can retaliate by expelling acid in a 15-foot line. Creatures within this line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 10 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. This reaction allows it to maintain aggression even when required to defend itself, keeping enemies on their toes.
