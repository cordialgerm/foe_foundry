The Sap Demon is a small, chaotic evil ooze that serves as a unique threat on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 13, it is moderately difficult to hit, and with 81 hit points, it can absorb a significant amount of damage before being defeated. The creature possesses a blend of both physical and magical capabilities, allowing it to grapple opponents, inflict bludgeoning and acid damage, and even possess humanoid targets. The Sap Demon's abilities allow for tactical maneuvering in combat, with particular strengths against smaller foes and an interesting interaction with elemental damage. However, its low Dexterity makes it less effective at avoiding attacks, and its lack of ranged attacks for all but one option may limit its options for dealing damage when out of reach.

The Sap Demon has a Strength score of 14, yielding a +2 modifier which is considered good, allowing it to excel in grappling opponents. Its Dexterity is low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, making it very bad in avoiding attacks and improving its initiative. Constitution is average at 12, providing a +1 modifier, which contributes to its hit points and overall durability. The creature's Intelligence is low at 7, giving it a -2 modifier, indicating limited cognitive abilities and a poor capacity for complex strategies. Wisdom is relatively better at 14, yielding a +2 modifier, reflecting a decent awareness of surroundings, while Charisma is low at 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, showing it lacks the social skills to influence others.

In terms of defenses, the Sap Demon is immune to acid damage, making it particularly resilient against those types of attacks. It also has resistance to bludgeoning damage, providing some mitigation against physical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to various conditions including blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, and prone, enhancing its survival in combat. It has blindsight to a range of 90 feet, enabling it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, although it is rendered blind beyond this radius. It has a passive Perception score of 12, which is average, suggesting it can notice things in its vicinity, but not exceptionally well.

The Sap Demon possesses several special abilities that enhance its capabilities in unique ways. With Amorphous, the demon can squeeze through narrow spaces, allowing for flexibility in movement and positioning during combat. The Ooze Nature ability means it does not require sleep, allowing it to remain active and dangerous continuously. Its Season’s Change ability introduces an interesting dynamic: taking fire damage increases its speed for the next turn, while cold damage reduces its speed, adding a layer of strategy when deciding how to engage it.

In terms of actions, the Sap Demon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks with either Slam or Lob Sap. The Slam attack has a +4 to hit and deals a total of 7 bludgeoning damage along with 7 acid damage on a successful hit. This dual damage type can be quite punishing for enemies who may not be resistant or immune to acid. The Lob Sap attack also has a +4 to hit and deals 12 bludgeoning damage, additionally reducing the target's speed by 10 feet until the end of its next turn, limiting their mobility.

The Soul Sap ability recharges on a roll of a 6 and can potentially turn the tide of battle significantly. When a humanoid is grappled or incapacitated within 5 feet of the Sap Demon, they must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to avoid being possessed. Upon possession, the sap demon disappears but takes control of the target, leaving them incapacitated while keeping their awareness. During this time, the demon retains its own intelligence and condition immunities while using the possessed target’s statistics, thereby making it a powerful threat that could strategically switch who is in control during a fight. Overall, the Sap Demon presents a mix of direct confrontation and eerie manipulation that can challenge players in unique ways.
