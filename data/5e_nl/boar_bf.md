The Boar is a Medium beast characterized by its straightforward yet effective combat capabilities. With an Armor Class of 11, it offers a moderate level of protection, while its 15 hit points allow it to absorb some damage before going down. The Boar has a movement speed of 40 feet, which provides good mobility on the battlefield. It holds a Challenge Rating of 1/4, indicating it's a relatively low-level threat, suitable for early encounters or as a minor adversary in a larger confrontation. Its primary strength lies in its Charge ability, which can deal extra damage and potentially knock opponents prone, making it a disruptive force in melee combat. However, its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores indicate that it lacks sophisticated tactics, communication, and social interaction skills.

The Boar's attributes are as follows: Strength is +2 (good), Dexterity is +0 (average), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is -4 (very bad), Wisdom is -1 (bad), and Charisma is -3 (very bad). The Strength modifier contributes positively to its melee attack power, while its other attributes limit its effectiveness in non-combat situations.

The Boar has two notable special abilities: Charge and Relentless. The Charge ability allows the Boar to deal an extra 3 (1d6) slashing damage if it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target before hitting with a Tusk attack. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can turn the tide of battle by rendering foes vulnerable to subsequent attacks. The Relentless ability prevents the Boar from being easily dispatched; if it takes 4 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it instead drops to 1 hit point. This ability recharges after a short or long rest, allowing the Boar to potentially survive encounters that would otherwise defeat it.

In terms of actions, the Boar primarily utilizes its Tusk attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, the attack deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage, making it a straightforward and effective way to apply pressure in combat. The high likelihood of hitting due to its modifier, alongside its Charge ability, makes it a notably aggressive creature in close quarters.
