For actions, the Cultist Psychophant can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to use three Psychic Strikes against opponents, potentially stunning one target if it successfully hits with two Psychic Strikes. Each Psychic Strike is a melee or ranged spell attack that adds +8 to hit and deals 18 (4d6+4) psychic damage. The Brain Storm ability, which can be used after a recharge of 6 rounds, allows the psychophant to unleash a devastating psychic attack that affects all creatures within 30 feet, dealing 31 (9d6) psychic damage and inflicting the poisoned condition for one minute. The affected creatures can attempt to resist the damage with a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw.

In terms of spellcasting, the Cultist Psychophant possesses several psionic abilities. It can cast the detect thoughts and mage hand spells at will without components, with the hand being invisible.

The Cultist Psychophant has a unique bonus action called Bend the Spoon, which allows it to magically warp a visible nonmagical weapon within 30 feet. The creature can choose to prevent this effect by making a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw if they are wielding the weapon. When warped, the weapon deals only half damage and imposes disadvantage on attacks made with it. A creature can fix the weapon using the mending spell or spend a short rest repairing it with tools.

Finally, the psychophant’s reaction, Appeal to the Fervent, enables it to call upon its followers for help. When attacked, it can switch places with a friendly creature within 5 feet, designating that ally as the new target for the attack. This tactical ability allows the psychophant to redirect danger away from itself, showcasing its cunning and strategic nature in battle.
