The Swampgas Bubble is a Medium ooze-type creature with an unaligned disposition, found in swampy environments. It operates with a challenge rating of 2, making it a moderate threat for adventurers, capable of dealing considerable damage through its unique abilities and actions. This creature has a notably high Constitution modifier of +4, which grants it strong hit points, totaling 59 (7d8 + 28). It is able to fly and hover but has a limited walking speed. The creature excels in dealing poison damage and can suffocate its victims, but it is particularly vulnerable to fire damage, which can result in its explosive demise when injured in critical condition. 

In terms of attributes, the Swampgas Bubble has the following scores: Strength is 16 (+3, good), Dexterity is 7 (-2, bad), Constitution is 18 (+4, exceptional), Intelligence is 1 (-5, very bad), Wisdom is 10 (+0, average), and Charisma is 3 (-4, very bad). This distribution highlights its physical robustness and endurance while revealing its lack of mental acuity and agility.

The creature has several special characteristics that affect how it engages in combat. The "Bludgeoning Bounce" ability means that any time the Swampgas Bubble takes bludgeoning damage, it does not suffer damage and is instead pushed away from the source of that damage. If it is attached to a creature when it takes such damage, it can detach itself with a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw. This makes it particularly resilient against blunt attacks and allows it to reposition in battle effectively.

Another notable ability is "Fiery Death." If the Swampgas Bubble has half or fewer hit points remaining and it takes fire damage, it explodes, dealing 7 (2d6) fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius. Affected creatures must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take full damage, halving it on a success. This explosive end makes it dangerous for nearby foes when the bubble is severely injured.

In combat, the Swampgas Bubble has two main actions it can take. The "Pseudopod" attack allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and 4 (1d8) poison damage on a hit. The "Suffocating Grasp" allows it to attach itself to a creature's head if the target is Medium or smaller, blinding that creature while the bubble is attached and dealing 9 (2d8) poison damage at the start of its turns. The target may attempt to detach the bubble with a DC 13 Strength check during its action, or the bubble can detach itself if it spends 5 feet of movement or if its target loses consciousness.

Overall, the Swampgas Bubble poses a significant threat through its ability to deal poison damage and suffocate opponents, while also having strategic resilience against certain types of damage, particularly bludgeoning. However, its vulnerability to fire remains a critical weakness that opponents can exploit.
