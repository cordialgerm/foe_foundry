The Kadag Ogre is a Large Giant characterized by a neutral evil alignment, embodying a fearsome presence in combat thanks to its significant physical strength and unique abilities. With a high Armor Class of 14, bolstered by natural armor, it boasts impressive durability, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of punishment. The ogre has 133 hit points, which translates to a solid resilience in battles, making it difficult to take down quickly. Its strengths lie in its high Strength score of 20, allowing for devastating melee attacks, and a decent Constitution score of 18, which provides substantial damage resistance. However, its Dexterity is notably low at 8, making it less effective in ranged combat maneuverability. The Kadag Ogre's innate abilities revolve around influencing both living creatures and the undead, providing it with tactical advantages in scenarios involving necromancy. Its weaknesses include a relatively low Intelligence and Charisma, hindering its ability to engage in social interactions and strategic thinking.

The Kadag Ogre has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 20 (+5), which is exceptional, allowing for powerful physical attacks. 
- Dexterity: 8 (-1), which is bad, affecting its agility and ranged attack effectiveness. 
- Constitution: 18 (+4), providing a good boost to its hit points and ability to resist effects. 
- Intelligence: 10 (+0), which is average, indicating basic cognitive function. 
- Wisdom: 16 (+3), which is good, enhancing its insights and perception. 
- Charisma: 5 (-3), very bad, limiting its ability to influence others or perform in social situations. 

The Kadag Ogre is proficient in perception with a +3 modifier, allowing for an average level of awareness in its surroundings. It has damage resistances to necrotic damage and piercing damage from nonmagical attacks, providing it with additional durability in combat. With darkvision extending 60 feet, the ogre can see in low-light environments, giving it an advantage during nighttime encounters. It can communicate in Common and Giant, enabling it to interact with various creatures.

The special abilities of the Kadag Ogre include the Scent of Death, which affects creatures that start their turn within 5 feet of it. Those creatures are poisoned until the start of their next turn unless they succeed in a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If successful, the target becomes immune to this effect for 1 hour. The ogre's Undead Affinity grants it an edge over undead foes, imposing disadvantage on their attack rolls against it if it has not attacked them in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, it can command any skeleton or zombie within 30 feet that has no master, directing their actions through verbal commands.

In terms of actions, the Kadag Ogre can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to launch three spear attacks during its turn. It makes a Spear attack with a +7 to hit, dealing either 12 (2d6+5) piercing damage at a range of 10 feet or 14 (2d8+5) piercing damage if used as a two-handed melee weapon at ranges of 20/60 feet. The Master of Death is a recharge ability (5-6) that empowers up to three friendly Undead within 30 feet, allowing them to move and make one melee attack as a reaction. Each empowered Undead also gains temporary hit points, which enhances its survivability in combat. However, the Kadag Ogre can only empower Undead with an Intelligence score lower than 10, adding a layer of strategy to its usage of this ability.
