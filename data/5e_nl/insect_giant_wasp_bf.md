The Giant Wasp is a Medium-sized beast, presenting a challenge rating of 1/2, making it a moderately threatening foe for lower-level adventurers. With an Armor Class of 12 and 25 hit points, it has a decent level of durability, though it remains vulnerable to effective attacks due to its relatively flat physical defenses. Its movement capabilities are notable, allowing it to fly at a speed of 50 feet, making it agile and able to bypass obstacles on the ground. The wasp's strengths lie in its agility, with a Dexterity modifier of +2, indicating a good level of nimbleness when dodging attacks. However, it possesses a weakness in its mental attributes, particularly Intelligence and Charisma, which are very low, making it ineffective in social interactions and strategy. Notably, the Giant Wasp inflicts both piercing and poison damage through its sting, presenting a significant threat due to its capacity to paralyze victims.

The Giant Wasp has the following ability scores: Strength +0 (average), Dexterity +2 (good), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence -5 (very bad), Wisdom +0 (average), and Charisma -4 (very bad). Its poor Intelligence and Charisma hinder its ability to engage in social or mental challenges, while its average other attributes highlight a creature more suited for combat and ambush rather than strategic planning.

The wasp's primary action is its Sting, which is a melee weapon attack benefiting from a +4 bonus to hit, meaning it can reliably land hits against lower Armor Classes. The reach of the sting is 5 feet, targeting one creature. On a successful hit, it deals 6 piercing damage (1d8 + 2) and imposes a Constitution saving throw with a difficulty of 12. If the target fails this saving throw, it takes an additional 10 poison damage (3d6). Should this poison damage reduce the target to 0 hit points, that target is stabilized but remains poisoned for 1 hour. This prolonged poisoning causes paralysis, adding a strategic layer to the Giant Wasp’s attacks, as it can effectively remove enemies from combat.

In addition to its sting, the Giant Wasp possesses a special reactive ability called Assailing Pheromone. When this creature takes damage, it can emit a pheromone that enhances the capabilities of its fellow wasps within 10 feet, granting them advantage on their next attack roll before the end of their next turn. This ability significantly amplifies the wasps' damage output in tight situations, allowing them to coordinate attacks effectively if multiple wasps are present.

Overall, the Giant Wasp poses a vicious threat, leveraging its poison capabilities and access to pheromones to incapacitate foes while remaining relatively agile in combat.
