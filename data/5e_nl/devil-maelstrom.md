The Maelstrom Devil is a formidable fiend known for its ability to manipulate weather and its impressive combat capabilities. With its lawful evil nature, the Maelstrom Devil excels in controlling both the battlefield and the environment to its advantage. It has a robust pool of hit points, making it a resilient adversary in combat. This creature's ability to resist various damage types, paired with high attack output and tactical control over its surroundings, makes it a dangerous opponent. However, it has a relatively low passive perception and lacks certain saving throws, which could be exploited by clever players.

The Maelstrom Devil possesses the following attributes: Strength of 17 gives it a good attack bonus of +7, Dexterity of 16 also provides a good bonus of +3 to dexterity-related actions. Its Constitution is 15, resulting in a decent +6 modifier for saving throws relating to endurance. Intelligence stands at 19, with an exceptional +4 modifier, allowing for strategic thinking and spellcasting. Wisdom is somewhat average at 12, yielding a +1 modifier, while its Charisma is exceptional at 21, granting it a +5 modifier, important for its social interactions and spellcasting effectiveness.

The Maelstrom Devil's saving throw bonuses include a very good +7 for Strength saves, a good +6 for Constitution, and a good +5 for Wisdom. It is proficient in perception, but only has a bad +1 modifier. The creature has significant damage immunities, being immune to fire, lightning, and poison, while it resists cold and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Additionally, it is immune to the poisoned condition. The Maelstrom Devil has darkvision up to 120 feet and unusual telepathic abilities allowing communication within the same range in Infernal.

Special abilities of the Maelstrom Devil include "Devil’s Sight," which allows it to see in magical darkness as if it were bright light, making it a potent threat in dark environments. Its "Influence Weather" ability lets it alter the weather within a mile of its position once per minute, effectively shaping the battlefield to its strategic advantage without any action required. It also has "Magic Resistance," granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, ensuring it can withstand magical attacks better than most foes.

In terms of actions during combat, the Maelstrom Devil can perform a "Multiattack," where it can either make three Claws attacks and one Tempest Trident attack or it may opt for three Lightning Ray attacks. Its Claw attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 10 slashing damage. The Tempest Trident deal substantial piercing damage of 16 plus an additional cold damage of 7, along with a chance to knock the target prone, subject to a Strength save. Its Lightning Ray is a ranged attack with a +8 to hit, dealing an average of 18 lightning damage, presenting a significant ranged threat. 

Lastly, the Maelstrom Devil has a unique spell-like ability called "Crown of Water," which it can use once per day. This spell causes a geyser of water to erupt from its head, inflicting an average of 35 cold damage to creatures within a 10-foot radius. Additionally, if a creature enters or starts its turn in this area, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take an extra average of 10 cold damage. This ability underlines the Maelstrom Devil's capacity to control its environment and devastate multiple foes at once.
