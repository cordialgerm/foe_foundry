The Incinis is a formidable large elemental creature, embodying the destructive aspects of magma and fire. With a challenge rating of 10, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, capable of dealing both bludgeoning and fire damage through its unique abilities. Its high Armor Class of 17 and impressive Hit Points totaling 171 make it a resilient opponent in battle. The Incinis thrives in close combat, using its high Dexterity and Constitution to outmaneuver and withstand attacks while inflicting substantial damage. Notably, it is immune to fire and poison damage, as well as many conditions such as being grappled or paralyzed, which gives it a tactical edge in prolonged encounters. However, it has average mental stats with an Intelligence of 10 and Charisma of 10, meaning it may not excel in charm or cunning tactics.

The statistical attributes of the Incinis are as follows: it possesses a Strength of 12 with a modifier of +1, which is considered average; a Dexterity of 20 with a modifier of +5, indicating very good agility; a Constitution of 18 with a modifier of +4, categorized as good; an Intelligence of 10, with a modifier of +0, regarded as average; a Wisdom of 16 with a modifier of +3, which is good; and a Charisma of 10, also average. The creature has skills that enhance its combat effectiveness, notably with damage immunities to fire and poison, along with resistances to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The Incinis can see in darkness up to 60 feet thanks to its darkvision, and it speaks both Common and Ignan.

The Incinis wields several special abilities that significantly impact gameplay. Its "Magma Form" allows it to move through very narrow spaces easily and causes damage when touched or when it is attacked with melee weapons. Specifically, any creature that makes contact or strikes at the elemental with a melee attack must endure 5 fire damage and must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. If they fail, their weapon becomes stuck in the elemental, and they risk being grappled by it, which inflicts continuous fire damage until the grapple ends.

In combat, the Incinis can execute a "Multiattack" action, where it can make two magma fist attacks in a single turn. Each "Magma Fist" melee attack has a +9 to hit and can reach an opponent up to 10 feet away, potentially dealing 14 bludgeoning damage in addition to 9 fire damage per hit, which is substantial. Furthermore, the Incinis can unleash a powerful "Wave of Magma" attack after recharging, allowing it to move in a wave-like motion that inflicts damage on all creatures in its path. Creatures must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the worst of the damage, with failure meaning they take up to 21 fire damage and may be pushed and knocked prone. Success results in taking only half damage without any additional effects. This ability makes the Incinis particularly dangerous in combat, allowing it to control the battlefield dynamics and potentially disrupt enemy formations.
