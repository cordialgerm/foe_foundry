The Razorleaf is a medium-sized plant creature with a neutral evil alignment. It is primarily characterized by its unique abilities that allow it to control its surroundings and deal substantial damage. With an Armor Class of 14, it possesses reliable defense thanks to its natural armor. It has a hefty pool of Hit Points totaling 112, providing it with considerable endurance in battle, making it a challenging opponent with a Challenge Rating of 5. Its strengths lie in its capacity to manipulate the battlefield through shadowy effects and its ability to inflict damage on attackers that come too close. However, it has a weakness to fire damage, which makes it vulnerable to certain spells and attacks. Overall, the Razorleaf is a formidable adversary, leveraging its abilities to hinder and harm its foes while maintaining a tough presence in combat.

In terms of attributes, the Razorleaf has a Strength score of 14, which gives it a good modifier of +2, allowing it to be strong in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity score of 12 yields an average modifier of +1. The creature has a high Constitution score of 16, providing a very good +3 modifier, which contributes to its impressive Hit Points and overall durability. With an Intelligence of 7, it has a very bad -2 modifier, indicating limitations in cognitive abilities. It has a Wisdom score of 12, resulting in an average +1 modifier, and a Charisma score of 10, with no modifier, reflecting a lack of persuasive skills. 

The Razorleaf has a perception skill bonus of +4, allowing it to detect hidden creatures effectively. It is vulnerable to fire damage, making it susceptible to fire-based attacks. However, it has resistance to cold and necrotic damage, which diminishes the effectiveness of those types of attacks against it. The creature enjoys immunity to conditions such as being blinded, deafened, and exhausted, providing it with significant advantages in prolonged encounters. Its blindsight ability extends 60 feet, meaning it can perceive its surroundings without needing sight beyond that range.

The Razorleaf has a special ability called Dark Ground, which allows it to dig its roots into the ground as an action. This action creates a 20-foot radius of shadow around it, making the area difficult terrain. While in this rooted position, the Razorleaf's speed becomes 0, it cannot be knocked prone, and it enhances its attacks to deal an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. Any small or smaller beasts with low intelligence within this area lose their natural coloration and become charmed, while plants turn an ashen color. The Razorleaf can end this rooted state as a bonus action. Another significant ability, Do Not Touch, causes any creature that touches the Razorleaf or attacks it from close range to take 3 (1d6) slashing damage. Additionally, due to Light Sensitivity, the Razorleaf suffers a disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when in bright light.

In combat, the Razorleaf can use the Multiattack action to make two melee attacks with its Lacerating Leaves. This attack has a +5 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 12 (3d6 + 2) slashing damage, making it a potent threat in melee range. It also has a powerful special action known as Shower of Razors, which can be used when it is recharged on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability forces all creatures within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 21 (6d6) slashing damage on a failed save while halving the damage on a successful one. This ability emphasizes the Razorleaf's role as a battlefield control creature, able to inflict area-of-effect damage to multiple foes at once.
