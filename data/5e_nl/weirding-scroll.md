The Weirding Scroll is a tiny, unaligned construct that possesses unique magical abilities, making it a fascinating creature in Dungeons & Dragons. It has low defensive capabilities, reflected in its Armor Class of 10, and a moderate pool of Hit Points totaling 27, utilizing a roll of six four-sided dice plus twelve for calculated resilience. Its challenge rating of 1/2 indicates that it is a relatively low threat compared to more formidable foes, providing only 100 experience points upon defeat. The Weirding Scroll can fly, albeit slowly at a speed of 10 feet, but cannot walk, revealing its reliance on its magical properties rather than physical movement. 

The attributes of the Weirding Scroll are as follows: Strength is exceptionally low at 1 with a modifier of -5, making it very ineffective in physical confrontations. Dexterity is average at 10, with no modifier, contributing to its minimal physical agility. Constitution is good at 15 with a modifier of +2, providing some resilience against effects that target its health. Intelligence is notable at 16, giving it a +3 modifier, indicating a high level of cunning or magical understanding. Wisdom remains average at 10, with a +0 modifier, while Charisma is low at 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, signaling difficulties in social interactions. 

The Weirding Scroll has a +2 modifier in Wisdom saving throws, which is average in terms of effectiveness. It is skilled in deception with a +5 modifier, resulting in good capability for trickery and manipulation. Vulnerabilities include fire damage, which can be very detrimental to its survival. Its immunities consist of poison and psychic damage, providing strong defense against those types of attacks. Additionally, it has resistance to cold damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, making it somewhat resilient in various combat scenarios. The creature is immune to numerous conditions such as blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, indicating exceptional durability against status effects. It possesses blindsight within a 60-foot radius, enhancing its ability to detect creatures without relying on sight, as well as a passive perception score of 10. The Weirding Scroll can understand all languages and communicate telepathically within a range of 120 feet. 

In terms of special abilities, the Weirding Scroll is susceptible to antimagic fields, becoming incapacitated while in such an area. If it is targeted by dispel magic, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or become unconscious for one minute. Furthermore, its false appearance ability allows it to remain motionless and blend in perfectly as a normal scroll, thereby avoiding detection.

For its actions, the Weirding Scroll can dominate a humanoid it sees within a 30-foot range. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If failed, the target is charmed for one hour and must obey the telepathic commands of the Weirding Scroll to the best of its ability. This ability functions similarly to the dominate person spell but without the need for concentration, and the control exerted over the target is not total. The Weirding Scroll can only maintain control over one humanoid at a time, and claiming a new target ends the effect on the previous one. Additionally, the Weirding Scroll can use a melee spell attack called Tendril of Light, which has a +5 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals a total of 6 psychic damage by rolling one six-sided die, and an additional 3 radiant damage, making it a diverse and potentially damaging offensive option.
