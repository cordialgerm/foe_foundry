The Infernal Swarm is a formidable Huge fiend that embodies both cunning and chaotic power. As a lawful evil creature, it operates within a structured framework of malevolence, using its shape-shifting abilities to confuse and overwhelm foes. With a high Armor Class of 16, significant Hit Points totaling 150, and a Challenge Rating of 12, it poses a serious threat in combat. Its strengths include impressive combat capabilities, including resistance to a variety of damage types and several abilities that allow it to manipulate its form and the environment. However, it is vulnerable to thunder damage, which could significantly impair its abilities and force it into a shapeless form. 

The Infernal Swarm has noteworthy attributes, reflecting its combat effectiveness: 

- Strength: 18 (+4) - exceptional, giving it formidable physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 16 (+3) - good, enhancing its agility and ability to avoid attacks.
- Constitution: 13 (+1) - average, providing decent resilience.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1) - very bad, indicating a lack of mental sharpness and reasoning.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1) - average, allowing for moderate perception and insight.
- Charisma: 19 (+4) - exceptional, contributing to its powerful spell-like abilities and telepathy.

In terms of defensive capabilities, the Infernal Swarm has damage vulnerabilities to thunder, meaning it suffers more from this type of damage. It is immune to fire and poison, making it particularly tough against elemental attacks, and resistant to bludgeoning, cold, piercing, psychic, and slashing damage, which helps mitigate incoming physical hits. Furthermore, it is immune to many conditions including charmed, frightened, and stunned.

The creature possesses several special abilities that enhance its survivability and tactical options:

1. **Devil’s Sight**: This ability allows the Infernal Swarm to see in magical darkness as if it were normal light, giving it a clear advantage in low-visibility scenarios.
2. **Magic Resistance**: With advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, the Infernal Swarm is exceptionally difficult to control with magic.
3. **Shaped Swarm**: This unique ability allows it to transform between a Huge fiend and a shapeless mass as a bonus action. While in fiend form, it retains all combat statistics and can interact with objects but is affected by thunder damage, which forces it back to shapeless form. When in shapeless form, it can occupy a creature's space but is unable to grapple.

The monster's actions are defined by its ability to switch between forms, significantly influencing its attack strategy:

- **Multiattack**: In fiend form, the Infernal Swarm can perform three attacks—either two with its scimitar and one with a slam, or three attacks with its scimitars, which allows it to output considerable damage during its turn.
- **Bites (Shapeless Form Only)**: As a melee attack with a +9 to hit, when engaging in shapeless form, it deals 28 piercing damage to targets within its space. This damage is reduced to 14 if the swarm has half of its total HP or less.
- **Poisonous Barb**: This ranged attack can hit a target at a distance with a +8 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 10 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking potentially substantial poison damage (18 on a failed save, or half on success).
- **Scimitar (Fiend Form Only)**: In fiend form, the Infernal Swarm attacks with its scimitar for 14 slashing damage, which is a reliable source of damage.
- **Slam (Fiend Form Only)**: This attack deals 18 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target, causing 14 piercing damage at the start of its turns when restrained. This ability immobilizes foes, offering strategic control in combat.

The Infernal Swarm's blend of defensive capabilities and versatile attack options makes it a dangerous opponent that can adapt to various combat scenarios while maintaining a malevolent edge.
