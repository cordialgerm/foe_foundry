The Crime Boss is a formidable Medium humanoid antagonist known for its leadership and cunning in combat. With a robust Armor Class of 15 and a hefty 127 hit points, this character poses a considerable challenge to adventurers, making it a notable presence in encounters. The Crime Boss is equipped with impressive strength and constitution, boasting a Strength score of 18 (+4) and Constitution of 18 (+4), enabling it to endure and deliver substantial damage. Its high Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores (16, +3 each) provide it with excellent capabilities in social interactions and insight, as well as proficiency in combat strategies. The Crime Boss thrives on deception and intimidation, making it a dangerous opponent who often commands loyalty from allies while cunningly manipulating its foes.

In terms of attributes, the Crime Boss exhibits good Dexterity (14, +2), which allows it to maintain a decent level of agility in combat. However, its primary strengths lie in melee combat, utilizing its Multiattack feature to strike three times with its shortsword, demonstrating its exceptional combat effectiveness. The Crime Boss has a strong skill set with bonuses including Deception (+6), Insight (+6), Intimidation (+6), Perception (+6), Persuasion (+6), and Stealth (+5), with a passive Perception score of 16, making it an average scout or infiltrator.

The first action, Multiattack, allows the Crime Boss to strike three times with its shortsword, each attack benefiting from a +7 to hit. In melee range, a successful hit deals 7 piercing damage (1d6 + 4). Additionally, the Crime Boss can utilize a dagger for versatile damage, either in melee or as ranged attacks, also with a +7 to hit that deals 6 piercing damage (1d4 + 4). 

One of the Crime Boss's signature abilities is Mark for Death. This ability targets an enemy within 30 feet that can either see or hear the boss. For a duration of 1 minute, or until the boss chooses a new target, the marked enemy suffers an additional 7 damage (2d6) whenever hit by the Crime Boss's weapon attacks. This ability significantly increases the danger level for marked targets, drawing the attention of the party.

In terms of reactions, the Crime Boss has two notable abilities. With Command Bodyguard, if the Crime Boss is about to be hit by an attack, it can use its reaction to command an adjacent ally to switch positions with it, allowing the ally to take the hit instead. This ability demonstrates the boss’s tactical positioning and protection strategy for itself. Additionally, Offhand Dagger allows the Crime Boss to counterattack; if it is missed by an attack, it can make a dagger attack on the assailant, demonstrating its cunning nature and immediate retaliation in combat.

Overall, the Crime Boss serves as an engaging and tactically challenging opponent for players, leveraging its skills and combat abilities effectively while employing strategy and manipulation both in and out of battle.
