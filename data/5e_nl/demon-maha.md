The Maha is a formidable medium fiend of chaotic evil alignment, presenting a significant challenge to adventurers. With a challenge rating of 12, it offers 8,400 experience points upon defeat. The Maha possesses impressive physical attributes, including a high Dexterity of 21, which grants it exceptional agility, and strong Strength and Constitution scores, making it durable and capable in combat. Its notable features include abilities that manipulate the battlefield through its Frozen Aura, which hinders movement, and its ability to resist many magical effects, making it hard to control through spells. The Maha’s actions can incapacitate foes with its laughter, allowing it to control the flow of battle while dealing psychic damage. However, its low Intelligence indicates a lack of strategic awareness, and its vulnerability to nonmagical attacks in certain conditions can be exploited by clever adventurers.

The Maha has an Armor Class of 15, representing a good level of defense, and a considerable pool of Hit Points totaling 178, which provides it with significant endurance in battle thanks to its Constitution score of 18. The creature has a walking speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively on the battlefield.

The Maha’s attribute scores are as follows: Strength is 18 with a modifier of +4 (very good), Dexterity is 21 with a +5 modifier (exceptional), Constitution is 18 with a +4 modifier (very good), Intelligence is 7 with a -2 modifier (very bad), Wisdom is 16 with a +3 modifier (good), and Charisma is 12 with a +1 modifier (average). It has robust saving throws, including +8 to Strength, +9 to Dexterity, +8 to Constitution, and +7 to Wisdom.

In terms of skills, it has a +3 modifier in perception, making it relatively capable at detecting hidden creatures or objects. The Maha has immunities to cold and poison, resistance to fire and lightning damage, and it is also resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. It is immune to the poisoned condition, which further fortifies its defensive capabilities. The creature possesses truesight, allowing it to see things as they truly are within a range of 120 feet, and has a passive perception of 13.

The Maha understands Abyssal and can communicate telepathically up to 120 feet away. Among its special abilities, the Frozen Aura forces creatures that enter or start their turn within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 17. Failure results in their speed being reduced by 10 feet until they leave the aura, thus controlling movement on the battlefield. The Magic Resistance feature gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it exceptionally hard to take down with magic. Its Snow Camouflage grants it an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy or icy terrain, leveraging its environment effectively.

The Maha’s primary attack is its Multiattack, allowing it to strike with three claws. Each claw attack has a +8 to hit and deals an average of 14 (3d6 + 4) piercing damage plus an additional 9 (2d8) cold damage. If it successfully strikes the same creature with two claw attacks, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 17) or succumb to fits of chuckling until the end of its next turn. While chuckling, the target is unable to speak coherently, cast spells that require verbal components, and has disadvantage on attacks made with Strength or Dexterity.

The Deadly Laughter ability is a powerful experience that allows the Maha to incapacitate numerous opponents at once. It can use this ability after a recharge of 5 to 6 rounds. The attack impacts every creature within a 30-foot radius, dealing 42 (12d6) psychic damage, and forcing them to drop whatever they are holding while laughing for one minute. The affected creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 17) to take half damage and resist laughing. While incapacitated, affected creatures take 7 (2d6) psychic damage at the start of their turns and can attempt to save at the end of each round to end the effect. If a creature dies while laughing, its face turns pale blue, displaying a wide grin, which adds a morbid flair to the encounter.

Overall, the Maha represents a dangerous opponent with powerful control abilities and resilient defenses, making it a noteworthy adversary for any adventuring party.
