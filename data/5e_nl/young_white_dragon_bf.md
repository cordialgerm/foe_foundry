Its impressive array of movement options includes a speed of 40 feet on land, burrowing at 20 feet, flying at 80 feet, and swimming at 40 feet, allowing it to navigate diverse environments effectively. The Young White Dragon's ability to walk effortlessly on icy surfaces and reduce the movement speed of nearby foes with a numbing chill further enhances its combat prowess. However, its Intelligence score of -2 reflects a significant weakness, making its strategic thinking less effective compared to other creatures.

The Young White Dragonâ€™s attributes include Strength of +4 (good), Dexterity of +3 (average), Constitution of +7 (exceptional), Intelligence of -2 (very bad), Wisdom of +4 (good), and Charisma of +4 (good). The creature has a darkvision range of 120 feet and keen senses extending 30 feet, which allows it to detect foes easily in dim light or darkness.

The Young White Dragon has several notable special abilities. It can perform Ice Walk, which allows it to traverse icy surfaces without difficulty, mitigating the effects of difficult terrain composed of ice or snow. Additionally, through its Numbing Chill ability, when the dragon has not yet used its Cold Breath, it generates a cold aura within a 10-foot radius. Any creature that begins its turn within this radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 15, or its speed will be reduced by 10 feet, potential hindering its mobility in combat.

In terms of actions, the Young White Dragon can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to use one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage and an additional 4 (1d8) cold damage on a hit. The Claw attack also has a +7 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. 

One of the dragon's most formidable abilities is its Cold Breath, which has a recharge condition of 5-6. This ability allows the dragon to exhale an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Any creature caught within this area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers 31 (7d8) cold damage, while a successful save results in half that damage. This powerful area attack can significantly impact the battlefield by damaging multiple foes at once, making the Young White Dragon a dangerous opponent in combat.
