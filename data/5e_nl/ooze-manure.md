The Manure Ooze is a Medium-sized unaligned ooze that presents a unique challenge for adventurers due to its solid defenses and distinctive abilities. With an Armor Class of 7 and 45 hit points, it is not particularly difficult to hit, yet its damage immunities and condition immunities make it a formidable opponent in its element. Its challenge rating of 1 suggests it is appropriate for low-level encounters, granting 200 experience points upon defeat. The Manure Ooze has a Strength score of 14 (+2), allowing it to maintain a good physical presence in combat, while its Dexterity score is very bad at 5 (-3), indicating sluggishness in agility. The creature's Constitution score of 16 (+3) grants it exceptional durability, making it hard to take down, especially as it can regenerate health by consuming corpses. 

The Manure Ooze is capable of moving through tight spaces due to its Amorphous ability, which allows it to squeeze through spaces that are just 1 foot wide. This makes it challenging for opponents to contain it, as it can attack from unexpected angles. Its Eye-Watering Stench ability emits a noxious odor, causing creatures within a 20-foot radius to suffer disadvantage on their attack rolls until the start of their next turn unless they succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. This effect can significantly diminish the effectiveness of nearby attackers. Additionally, should the ooze suffer fire damage, it becomes Flammable, igniting and dealing extra fire damage on its attacks while on fire. Lastly, the ooze does not require sleep due to its Ooze Nature ability, allowing it to stay active and potentially ambush unsuspecting adventurers at any time.

In terms of actions, the Manure Ooze can make a Pseudopod melee attack. It has a +4 to hit and deals 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage alongside an additional 3 (1d6) poison damage, making it a versatile attacker in melee combat. Furthermore, it can Digest Corpse, allowing it to dissolve a corpse within its space that is less than a week old, regaining hit points based on the size of the creature it consumes. This ability not only enables the ooze to recover health, but it also permanently destroys the corpse, preventing enemies from reviving their fallen allies. 

The Manure Ooze also possesses a Split reaction. If it takes slashing damage while having 10 or more hit points, it splits into two smaller oozes, each with half the original's hit points rounded down. This ability can complicate battles, as it can multiply itself, thereby increasing the threat it poses to adventurers who attempt to dispatch it quickly.
