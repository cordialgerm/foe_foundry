The Young Amethyst Dragon possesses the special ability "Far Thoughts," allowing it to become aware of any creature using psionic abilities or communicating telepathically within a 100-mile radius. This ability enables it to psionically observe any creature, object, or location it is familiar with within that range during combat, enabling strategic advantages. While observing, it can see, hear, and communicate telepathically, although it becomes blind and deaf to its physical surroundings. This observation can continue indefinitely, showcasing the dragon's exceptional psionic prowess. 

Additionally, the dragon's "Innate Spellcasting" ability allows it to cast spells using its Charisma as the spellcasting ability with a save DC of 19. It can cast "calm emotions" and "charm person" three times each per day without needing material components, giving it a good level of control in social or combat situations.

For its actions, the Young Amethyst Dragon can perform a "Multiattack," which allows it to attack once using its bite and twice using its claws. The "Bite" attack is a melee attack with a +7 to hit that deals 19 piercing damage along with an additional 4 force damage. Its "Claws" attacks, which also have a +7 to hit, inflict 12 slashing damage each. Furthermore, it has the "Concussive Breath," a powerful ability that can be used once the dragon recharges it on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability unleashes a wave of telekinetic energy in a 30-foot cone, requiring creatures within that area to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 44 force damage, while a successful save results in half damage. This attack can significantly impact the battlefield, damaging multiple foes at once and disrupting their positioning.
