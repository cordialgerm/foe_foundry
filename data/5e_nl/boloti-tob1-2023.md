The Boloti is a Tiny Fey creature known for its cunning and agility, embodying a neutral evil alignment. This creature excels in aquatic environments, using its special abilities and skills to enhance its combat effectiveness, particularly when submerged in water. With an Armor Class of 15 and Hit Points totaling 45, the Boloti can withstand a fair amount of damage while also being exceptionally fast, capable of walking 60 feet per turn. Its defining feature is its dual nature, allowing it to switch between a true form and a vortex form, adapting its tactics to the environment. However, it is somewhat limited when on dry land, facing disadvantages that can be exploited by careful opponents. Overall, the Boloti poses a moderate threat in aquatic scenarios, boasting good offensive capabilities coupled with strategic maneuvering.

The Boloti has the following attributes: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 20 (+5), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 13 (+1), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 11 (+0). The Dexterity score is particularly notable as it provides exceptional effectiveness in stealth and evasiveness, enhancing its chances of avoiding attacks. Alongside this, the Boloti possesses skills in Perception (+3) and Stealth (+7), allowing it to remain undetected in its preferred aquatic environments. Its darkvision extends to 60 feet, giving it the ability to see in darker areas, while a passive Perception score of 13 enables it to notice hidden threats or opportunities.

The Boloti has several special abilities that define its interactions and combat style. The Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, making it versatile in various environments. Its Water Camouflage ability grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when at least half its body is submerged, making it very good at hiding from potential enemies. The Water Mastery ability gives it advantage on attack rolls when both the Boloti and its target share the same body of water; however, it incurs disadvantage on attack rolls when on dry land, which is a significant weakness.

In terms of actions, the Boloti can make use of its Dagger attack in true form, where it has a +7 modifier to hit with a reach of 5 feet or a ranged attack of 20/60 feet, dealing an average of 7 piercing damage (1d4 + 5). In its vortex form, it uses the Whirlpool action, requiring a DC 12 Strength saving throw from one creature within its space. A failed save results in 9 bludgeoning damage (2d8) and grapples the target if it is Medium or smaller, restraining it and possibly drowning it if it cannot breathe water. A successful save halves the damage and pushes the target away from the Boloti.

The Boloti also has spellcasting abilities in its true form, casting spells using Intelligence with a spell save DC of 11. It can cast water breathing and water walk at will, which aids in navigation across aquatic terrains. It can cast create or destroy water, fog cloud, and sleep three times a day each, useful for controlling the battlefield and manipulating encounters. Once per day, it can cast control water, further increasing its effectiveness in aquatic settings.

As a bonus action, the Boloti can transform into a Vortex Form, allowing it to become a swirling mass of water while still maintaining the same statistics. This transformation can only occur when it is partially submerged. Any creature it is grappling with the Whirlpool ability is released immediately upon changing back to its true form, providing tactical flexibility in combat situations.
