The Eye Golem is a formidable Large Construct with an unaligned nature, primarily serving as a potent guardian or tool for its creator. With a strong Armor Class of 20 and a significant pool of 157 hit points, it can withstand considerable punishment in battle. It boasts exceptional physical strength with a Strength score of 22, granting it a +6 modifier, and a good Constitution score of 20, giving it a +5 modifier for resilience. However, its Dexterity is notably low at 9, resulting in a -1 modifier, making it vulnerable to ranged attacks. The golem’s damage immunities include poison, psychic, and radiant damage, and it is particularly resilient against nonmagical attacks not made with adamantine. Its unique abilities enable it to deliver devastating attacks, inflict blindness, and resist magical spells effectively, making it a significant threat in combat scenarios.

The Eye Golem has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 22 (+6), which is exceptional and allows it to deal significant melee damage. 
- Dexterity: 9 (-1), which is very bad, resulting in reduced agility. 
- Constitution: 20 (+5), which is good, affording it considerable durability in combat. 
- Intelligence: 5 (-3), which is very bad, indicating it has limited problem-solving skills or tactics. 
- Wisdom: 11 (+0), which is average, providing modest perceptiveness. 
- Charisma: 1 (-5), which is very bad, highlighting a lack of social influence.

The Eye Golem possesses several special abilities:
- Blinding Demise allows the golem to blind an opponent permanently if it reduces them to 0 hit points, reducing the creature to 1 hit point instead. 
- Construct Nature indicates that the golem does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, making it a low-maintenance entity in a campaign.
- Immutable Form makes it immune to spells or effects that alter its form, ensuring it remains consistent in battle.
- Light-Infused Fists enhances its Slam attacks by adding an additional 4d8 radiant damage, making its melee attacks particularly dangerous.
- Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, increasing its survivability against spellcasting foes.

In combat, the Eye Golem can take the following actions:
- Multiattack enables it to utilize its Primal Voice of Doom and then make two Slam attacks in a single turn, maximizing its damage output.
- Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit, providing a good chance to strike targets within reach. Upon a hit, it deals 17 bludgeoning damage plus 18 radiant damage, totaling a substantial amount of damage for each successful hit.
- Gaze of Ancient Light, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, emits a blinding light that forces creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 35 radiant damage and blindness for one minute, while a success halves the damage and avoids blinding. If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the affected creature is also stunned until the end of its next turn, potentially taking them out of combat for a critical period. 
- Primal Voice of Doom targets a single creature within 30 feet, requiring a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the target being frightened for one minute and concluding the effect if they succeed on subsequent saves at the end of their turns.

Overall, the Eye Golem is a major asset in a confrontation, capable of delivering significant damage and controlling the battlefield with its blinding and frightening abilities.
