The Unska is a Medium fiend classified as a demon in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. This creature possesses notable defensive capabilities, such as a high Armor Class of 17 due to natural armor, and it has a solid pool of Hit Points totaling 88, making it a durable opponent for adventurers. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it is considered a moderate threat. The Unska’s strengths lie in its magical resilience and damage resistances; it can withstand harsh elemental attacks and is immune to poison. Although its Strength of +3 and Constitution of +2 provide it with average physical prowess, the Unska's true danger emerges from its array of attacks that can poison and weaken foes, as well as its ability to disrupt opponents' strategies through enchantments.

The Unska's attributes include Strength at +3 (good), Dexterity at +2 (average), Constitution at +2 (average), Intelligence at -1 (bad), Wisdom at +0 (average), and Charisma at +2 (average). These scores allow the Unska to perform moderately well in physical confrontations, while its lower Intelligence may hinder its problem-solving abilities outside of combat.

The Unska has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in battle. It has Demonic Resilience, granting it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, and immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition, making it very difficult to incapacitate in combat. In addition, with Magic Resistance, the Unska gains advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further increasing its survivability.

During combat, the Unska can execute a Multiattack action, choosing between making two Claw attacks and one Tongue attack or three Ink Blast attacks. The Claw attack has a +6 to hit and deals 10 slashing damage plus 3 poison damage, which may lead the target to be poisoned unless they succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If poisoned, they suffer disadvantage on saves against the Unska’s Whirl of Ink ability. The Tongue attack, also with a +6 to hit, inflicts 12 piercing damage along with the risk of reducing the target's maximum hit points until they complete a long rest, potentially resulting in their demise if their maximum hits 0. The Ink Blast is a ranged attack that deals 12 poison damage and, if the target fails a Constitution saving throw, puts them at a disadvantage on their next save against Whirl of Ink.

The Unska also possesses a bonus action known as Whirl of Ink. In this action, the Unska targets a creature within 30 feet, compelling it to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. If unsuccessful, the target may be charmed, disoriented, or frightened, at the Unska’s discretion, until the end of its next turn. A disoriented target even has their movement altered to a random direction, effectively making them less reliable in the next round.

Overall, the Unska presents a mix of solid offensive capabilities and troublesome magical effects, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers that requires strategic engagement to overcome.
