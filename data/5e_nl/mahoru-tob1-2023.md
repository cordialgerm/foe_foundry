Mahoru is a formidable large monstrosity with an unaligned nature, characterized by its impressive physical abilities and unique combat tactics. With an armor class of 15 derived from its natural armor and a substantial hit point pool of 105, the mahoru is quite resilient in battle. It possesses a movement speed of 60 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield swiftly. Although its challenge rating is 3, suggesting it can be a moderate threat to adventurers, its advantages in combat, particularly through its abilities, can make it a significant adversary. The mahuru excels in melee combat with strong attack rolls and devastating damage potential. Its notable weaknesses include low intelligence and charisma scores, which may restrict its ability to engage in complex interactions outside of physical confrontations.

The mahoru has a strength score of 18, which gives it an exceptional modifier of +4, making it very good at melee attacks. Its dexterity score of 19 also gives it a very good modifier of +4, enhancing its agility and effectiveness in stealth, where it has a +6 modifier. With a constitution score of 14, the mahoru has a good modifier of +2, contributing to its respectable hit points. The creature's intelligence score is 3, resulting in a very bad modifier of -4, making it rather dull. Its wisdom score of 12 grants it an average modifier of +1, and a charisma score of 7 results in a bad modifier of -2, further indicating its lack of social interaction dexterity.

Several special abilities enhance the mahuru's combat prowess. The amphibious feature allows it to breathe both air and water, making it versatile in aquatic or terrestrial environments. Blood frenzy gives it advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that is not at full hit points, making it particularly dangerous when targeting weakened foes. Keen sight and smell offer it an advantage on perception checks related to these senses, improving its ability to detect its surroundings. Lastly, pack tactics allow the mahoru to gain advantage on attack rolls against foes when it has allies nearby, reinforcing its strength in group encounters.

In terms of actions, the mahoru can perform a melee attack using its bite, which has a +6 to hit, allowing it to inflict an average of 20 (3d10 + 4) slashing damage per successful hit. In addition, if it scores a critical hit, the targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or suffer the loss of a limb, a severe and debilitating effect if they are not immune to slashing damage. The roar action allows the mahoru to emit a terrifying sound that affects creatures within a 30-foot radius. Affected creatures must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. Those who fail by 5 or more also become paralyzed until the end of their next turn. A creature that successfully saves or has the effect end can resist future roars from any mahoru for the next 24 hours, limiting the ability's repeated impact.

Overall, the mahuru is a vicious predator best encountered with caution, armed with specialized abilities and formidable attacks that make it a dangerous foe for adventurers.
