The Merfolk is a Medium humanoid creature that thrives in aquatic environments and possesses the unique ability to move easily between water and land. As a challenge-rated 1/8 creature, the Merfolk is relatively weak, making it a good target for lower-level adventurers. With an Armor Class of 11 and 11 hit points, it can be considered somewhat fragile, although its swimming speed of 40 feet grants it an advantage in water-based encounters. The Merfolk's strengths lie in its Amphibious ability, allowing it to breathe both air and water, which broadens its capabilities for exploration and combat in different environments. However, its average Strength and Wisdom scores mean it does not excel in direct confrontations or perceptive tasks.

The Merfolk has the following ability scores: Strength is 10, which corresponds to no modifier (very bad for physical confrontations), Dexterity is 12 (+1 modifier, considered average), Constitution is also 12 (+1 modifier, considered average), Intelligence is 10 (no modifier), Wisdom is 10 (no modifier), and Charisma is 10 (no modifier). It possesses a skill in perception with a +2 modifier, which can be considered good, allowing it to notice hidden threats or detect other creatures in its environment. The Merfolk has darkvision out to 30 feet, meaning it can see in darkness as if it were dim light, enhancing its ability to navigate murky waters. It understands Aquan and Common languages, enabling communication with other aquatic beings and adventurers.

One of the special abilities of the Merfolk is its Amphibious trait, which allows it to breathe both air and water, effectively removing the limitation of needing to remain submerged in water while on land or engaging with surface-dwelling creatures.

In terms of actions during gameplay, the Merfolk can attack with a trident. This trident can be used as either a melee weapon or thrown as a ranged weapon. When making a melee attack with the trident using both hands, the Merfolk has a +2 bonus to hit, dealing 4 piercing damage on a successful hit. When throwing the trident, it has a range of 20 feet normally and can reach up to 60 feet at disadvantage, dealing 3 piercing damage if it connects. This ability allows the Merfolk to engage in combat from a distance or up close, making it versatile in its attack options.
