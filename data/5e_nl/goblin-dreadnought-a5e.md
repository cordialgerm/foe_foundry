The Goblin Dreadnought is a small humanoid creature known for its agility and tactical prowess. With an armor class of 17, it boasts a good defensive capability, allowing it to withstand attacks relatively well for its challenge rating of 1/2, offering 100 experience points upon defeat. Its hit points are limited to 10, which indicates a vulnerability to sustained attacks. The Goblin Dreadnought possesses average strength and constitution, but its dexterity of 12 provides it with good mobility and evasion. This creature excels in stealth, making it a valuable ambusher in combat scenarios, but it lacks any extraordinary intelligence, wisdom, or charisma, limiting its social interactions and tactical complexity. 

In terms of its attributes:
- Strength is 8 with a modifier of -1, which is very bad for melee combat effectiveness.
- Dexterity is 12 with a modifier of +1, resulting in a good agility for dodging and ranged attacks.
- Constitution is 10 with a modifier of +0, showing average resilience to physical effects.
- Intelligence is 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average, reflecting basic cunning.

The Goblin Dreadnought possesses a skill bonus in stealth of +3, allowing it to sneak effectively in environments that support such tactics, making it a solid choice for ambushes. It has darkvision that allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light up to 60 feet, aiding its stealth capabilities in darker areas. With a passive Perception score of 10, it can detect enemies and changes in its surroundings at an average level. The creature speaks Common and Goblin, ensuring it can communicate with both common folk and its own kind.

The Goblin Dreadnought can execute two primary actions in combat:
- **Sabre:** The Goblin Dreadnought can perform a melee weapon attack with its sabre, rolling +3 to hit against a target within a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 5 slashing damage, which can be significant when attacking foes who are weakened or surprised.
- **Shortbow:** As a ranged option, it can attack with a shortbow, also rolling +3 to hit at a range of 80 to 320 feet. A successful hit delivers 4 piercing damage. This makes the goblin effective at attacking from afar, keeping it at a safer distance from melee combat.

In addition to its regular actions, the Goblin Dreadnought has a bonus action called **Nimble Escape**, which allows it to take the Disengage or Hide action. This ability enhances its survivability by enabling it to evade attacks when retreating or to reposition itself unnoticed, making it difficult for enemies to pin it down during combat scenarios. This combination of agility and stealth allows the Goblin Dreadnought to be a tricky and elusive opponent on the battlefield.
