The Al-Aeshma Genie is a large and chaotic evil elemental creature known for its agility and commanding presence in combat. With a formidable combination of high armor class and robust hit points, the Al-Aeshma poses a significant threat to adventurers, inflicting both slashing and necrotic damage through its attacks. It excels in aerial encounters, having advantages against flying enemies due to its Air Hatred ability. However, it is somewhat grounded by its Earth Bound trait, which limits its altitude and exposes it to vulnerabilities when flying too high. The Al-Aeshma possesses a unique form of regeneration that allows it to recover health every turn while also making it exceptionally resilient to damage, barring certain types. Despite these strengths, the Al-Aeshma remains susceptible to fire and radiant damage, adding a layer of strategy for those looking to defeat it.

The creature has an armor class of 17, which provides a good level of defense against attacks. Its hit points total 149, calculated as 13d10 plus an additional 78, indicating a very good stamina for prolonged encounters. The Al-Aeshma's movement speed is impressive; it can walk 90 feet and fly 30 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. With a challenge rating of 9, it poses a challenging encounter worth 5,000 experience points.

The Al-Aeshma Genie’s ability scores are as follows: Strength at 21 (+5), Dexterity at 15 (+2), Constitution at 22 (+6), Intelligence at 15 (+2), Wisdom at 16 (+3), and Charisma at 20 (+5). Its Constitution score is very good, enhancing its durability and resilience, while its Charisma score supports its potent spellcasting abilities. The Genie has good saving throws in Dexterity (+6), Wisdom (+7), and Charisma (+9), making it effective at resisting various effects.

As for skills, the Al-Aeshma is immune to lightning and thunder damage, showcasing its elemental nature. It has darkvision with a range of 120 feet and a passive Perception of 13, allowing it to detect hidden creatures effectively. The creature can communicate in Auran, Common, and Ignan.

The Al-Aeshma possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Air Hatred ability provides it with advantage on attack rolls against flying creatures, making it a formidable opponent in aerial battles. The Earth Bound trait, while limiting its flying capabilities to 30 feet above the ground, prevents it from soaring too far and exposes it to vulnerabilities against lightning and thunder damage when elevated.

Upon death, the Al-Aeshma experiences an Elemental Demise, disintegrating into a spray of coarse sand while leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. Notably, the Al-Aeshma has a Regeneration ability, allowing it to regain 10 hit points at the beginning of its turn, unless it has taken fire or radiant damage, which would negate this ability temporarily. It will only perish if it starts its turn at 0 hit points without the opportunity to heal.

In terms of its actions during combat, the Al-Aeshma can perform a melee weapon attack with its scimitar, which has a +9 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it inflicts 12 slashing damage from 2d6 + 5, as well as an additional 7 necrotic damage from 2d6. 

Additionally, it can create a Dust Devil in combat, which unleashes a swirling cloud of dust in a specified area. This ability is centered on a target within 120 feet of the Al-Aeshma and fills a cylindrical area that is 30 feet tall and 5 feet wide. Creatures in or entering this area must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be restrained, suffering slashing and necrotic damage each turn while restrained. Characters can attempt to free themselves or others through a successful DC 17 Strength check.

Lastly, the Al-Aeshma is a spellcaster capable of casting spells without needing material components, using its Charisma for spellcasting. It can detect magic at will and can cast create or destroy water (only the destroy aspect) and wind walk three times per day. Additionally, it has access to gaseous form and invisibility for one use each day, allowing it to manipulate its presence on the battlefield for tactical advantages.
