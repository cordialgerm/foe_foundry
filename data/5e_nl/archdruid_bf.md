The Archdruid is a powerful medium humanoid figure from the natural world, capable of harnessing the forces of nature to both protect and attack. It boasts a high armor class of 17 when in its favored natural environment, augmented by its wisdom modifier, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With a significant pool of hit points at 210, it can endure a considerable amount of punishment. The Archdruid has a challenge rating of 12, indicating its strong presence in powerful encounters, and a variety of spells and abilities that provide utility in both offense and defense. It excels in its ability to deal additional elemental damage through its attacks and can change its form to a beast, allowing for surprising strategies in combat. Although it has weaknesses in terms of a lower constitution and charisma score, its other abilities compensate well, making it an exceptional asset for any nature-themed campaign.

In terms of its attributes, the Archdruid has the following scores: Strength of 13 (+3, which is average), Dexterity of 12 (+2, also average), Constitution of 11 (+1, considered bad), Intelligence of 20 (+6, which is very good), Wisdom of 23 (+9, exceptional), and Charisma of 12 (+1, bad). Its high Wisdom supports its abilities and spellcasting, while its Intelligence enhances its magical prowess. The Archdruid’s perception score of 19 is very good, allowing it to detect threats effectively, while its Stealth score of 12 is average. It can communicate in Common, Druidic, and an additional language of its choice.

The Archdruid's special abilities enhance its combative and defensive strategies significantly. Its Nature’s Champion ability allows it to increase its armor class based on its wisdom when wearing no armor in a natural environment, and it grants resistance to several damage types including cold, fire, lightning, poison, and thunder. This makes it very durable in various combat situations. Additionally, with Nature’s Weapons, any melee attack it performs adds 4d8 damage of an elemental type of its choice, making its strikes incredibly potent.

In terms of actions, the Archdruid has a Multiattack option that allows it to make three Thorned Staff or Nature’s Wrath attacks in a single turn, showing its ability to overwhelm foes. The Thorned Staff is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, reaching up to 5 feet, dealing 10 piercing damage plus an additional 18 damage of an elemental type (4d8). Nature's Wrath is quite powerful as a ranged spell attack, requiring a +9 to hit, with a range of 120 feet dealing 27 damage (5d8) of fire, cold, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, chosen at the time of the attack.

The Archdruid's spellcasting capability further enhances its versatility. It can cast the following spells using its Wisdom as the spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 17: At will, it can use animal friendship, druidcraft, entangle, and speak with animals for utility and communication. It can cast spike growth, plant growth, speak with plants, and heat metal three times per day, providing control and manipulation of the battlefield. Once per day, it can cast polymorph and insect plague, allowing for significant tactical advantages in combat situations.

Additionally, the Archdruid has a unique bonus action called Change Shape, allowing it to transform into a beast with a challenge rating no higher than its own. This transformation retains its hit points, ability to speak, and specific ability modifiers, but gains the statistics of the new beast form. This ability enables the Archdruid to adapt its strategies dynamically during encounters, further increasing its effectiveness in both combat and exploratory scenarios.
