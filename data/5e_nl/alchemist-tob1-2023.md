The Alchemist is a small humanoid creature characterized by its lawful neutral alignment. This kobold excels in alchemical skills, boasting impressive intelligence and dexterity while being physically weaker in strength and charisma. With an Armor Class of 15 due to its studded leather armor and a total of 44 hit points, the Alchemist can be a resilient opponent. However, its weak constitution and low wisdom make it somewhat vulnerable to certain situations. Notably, the Alchemist has a challenge rating of 2, indicating it is a moderate threat to adventurers. Equipped with various alchemical feats, this creature focuses on dealing versatile damage and supporting allied creatures in combat.

The Alchemist has the following attributes: Strength at 7, which results in a very bad modifier of -2; Dexterity at 16, giving a good modifier of +3; Constitution at 15, yielding a good modifier of +2; Intelligence at 16, resulting in a good modifier of +3; Wisdom at 9, contributing to a bad modifier of -1; and Charisma at 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1. The Alchemist has proficiency in Dexterity saving throws, with a +5 total modifier, making it quite effective in dodging attacks. In terms of skills, it has a +5 bonus in Arcana, indicating a strong capacity to understand magical phenomena, and a +3 in Medicine, showing adequate knowledge about healing and ailments. The Alchemist is immune to poison damage and cannot be poisoned, has darkvision allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright, and understands both Common and Draconic languages.

One of the Alchemist's special abilities is Apothecary, allowing it to choose one type of damage—acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison—at the start of each turn to gain resistance against until the start of its next turn. This offers it a very good defensive strategy by adapting to the type of damage it might face. Its Pack Tactics ability grants it advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is within 5 feet, reinforcing its strengths when in a group. However, the Alchemist suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, imposing disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks while in sunlight, which is a significant weakness.

In combat, the Alchemist can utilize its Multiattack ability to make two attacks with either Alchemical Dagger or Alchemical Bolt. The Alchemical Dagger attack has a +5 to hit and deals 5 piercing damage plus an additional 3 damage of a type it chooses with Apothecary. The Alchemical Bolt is a ranged attack with the same +5 modifier, dealing 10 damage of the type chosen by Apothecary. 

The Alchemist also possesses powerful special attacks such as Alchemical Vapors, which can be used after a recharge of 6 turns. This ability releases toxic vapors harming all but dragonborn or kobold creatures, forcing them to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid taking 17 poison damage. If successful, they still suffer reduced damage. Additionally, for dragonborn and kobolds within the area, they gain resistance to the damage type chosen by Apothecary for 1 minute, creating a tactical advantage for allies. The Explosive Flask ability, requiring a recharge of 5 to 6, allows the Alchemist to hurl a damaging flask that explodes on impact, dealing 14 damage of the chosen type to creatures in its vicinity. Failure to save against a DC 13 Dexterity throw leads to being poisoned for 1 minute, with the ability to repeat the saving throw on subsequent turns to end the effect on a success. This ability effectively combines area control and damage to control the battlefield.
