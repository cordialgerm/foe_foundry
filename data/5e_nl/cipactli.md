The Cipactli is a Medium-sized chaotic evil fiend that thrives in aquatic environments as well as on land. With an Armor Class of 15 derived from its natural armor, and an impressive 78 hit points, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. Its ability to swim at a speed of 30 feet and walk at 20 feet allows it to maneuver effectively in both water and on land. The Cipactli has a Challenge Rating of 5, meaning it is a moderately dangerous opponent, providing 1,800 experience points upon defeat. Notably, it has immunity to cold and poison damage and can breathe both air and water, while being vulnerable to fire damage and resistant to lightning, making it a tricky foe in various combat scenarios.

The creature's physical attributes are as follows: Strength at 16 provides a good modifier of +3, enabling it to deal considerable physical damage; Dexterity at 14 gives it a +2 modifier, allowing for average agility and acrobatics; Constitution at 14 also provides a +2 modifier, giving it good resilience; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma all sit at 10 with no bonuses. This gives the Cipactli an above-average physical capability but average mental stats. 

The Cipactli boasts a stealth skill modifier of +5, making it very good at avoiding detection, particularly when it uses its Underwater Camouflage ability, which grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while submerged. The Cipactli also possesses the special ability called Water Step, allowing it to transform into liquid form and teleport through water up to 20 feet away as a bonus action. This grants it exceptional mobility in combat situations.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Cipactli utilizes a multiattack action to make two bite attacks. Each bite attack has a +6 to hit and deals 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage; if both attacks successfully hit a Medium or smaller target, that target is grappled. Once grappled, the Cipactli can use Devouring Embrace, which allows it to consume the target, rendering it blinded and restrained, while also inflicting 14 (4d6) piercing damage at the start of each of Cipactli's turns. This is particularly devastating as the victim receives no external help while devoured and moving with the Cipactli.

The Cipactli can also evoke the powerful Ancient Lullaby ability (which requires a recharge on a roll of 5-6). This ability allows it to sing a mesmerizing song that puts creatures within 100 feet to sleep unless they succeed in a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. Affected creatures remain asleep for 10 minutes or until they take damage or are woken by another creature. Remarkably, this song does not affect constructs or undead, making it particularly effective against living foes.

Overall, the Cipactli is a formidable opponent, especially in aquatic environments, and possesses a unique combination of mobility, stealth, and debilitating attack strategies that can catch adventurers off guard.
