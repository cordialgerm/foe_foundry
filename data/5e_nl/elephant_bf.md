The Elephant is a huge beast known for its formidable presence on the battlefield. With a challenge rating of 4, it is capable of absorbing a significant amount of damage with 105 hit points and has an armor class of 12 due to its natural armor. Its strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks and unique trampling ability, making it a threat in direct combat. While its Dexterity is below average, leading to poorer mobility, the Elephant compensates with a strong Strength score of +5 and decent Constitution score of +3. However, it lacks intelligence and charisma, which may limit its role outside of combat scenarios. The creature is noteworthy for its Trampling Charge ability, which can turn simple charges into powerful attacks that can knock opponents prone, allowing for additional follow-up attacks.

The Elephant has notable attributes: a Strength of +5, which provides a very good modifier for physical attacks; Dexterity of -1, which is considered bad and affects its initiative and ability to avoid attacks; Constitution of +3, giving it a good level of hit points; Intelligence of -4, resulting in a very bad score which means it cannot engage in any meaningful mental challenges; Wisdom of +0, an average score that reflects basic situational awareness; and Charisma of -2, demonstrating its lack of social effectiveness. The Elephant's Perception score of 12 allows it to detect threats reasonably well, while a Stealth score of 9 indicates that it has a bad capacity for sneaking.

For actions, the Elephant can perform a Multiattack, making two Gore attacks in one turn. Each Gore attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, which is very good, against targets within a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit deals a substantial 16 piercing damage, calculated using 2d10 plus its Strength modifier. Additionally, the Elephant can use a Stomp attack as a bonus action against any opponent that it has knocked prone. The Stomp also has a +7 to hit and inflicts 14 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 5) on the target.

The special ability, Trampling Charge, allows the Elephant to charge at least 20 feet straight towards a creature and use its Gore attack. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which is a challenging save for many creatures. If the target ends up prone, the Elephant can make a bonus action Stomp attack against it, increasing its damage output in a single turn significantly.

Finally, the Elephant has a bonus action called Trunk Grab, where it can grab one Large or smaller creature within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be grappled, making it unable to move until it escapes. This ability gives the Elephant further control over the battlefield, allowing it to incapacitate a target while it uses its other powerful attacks. Overall, the Elephant is a dangerous combatant that can dominate encounters through sheer brute force and tactical maneuvers.
