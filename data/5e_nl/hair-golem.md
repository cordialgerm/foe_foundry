The Hair Golem is a small, unaligned construct characterized by its unique composition and specialized abilities. With an Armor Class of 13 and a relatively low hit point total of 13, the Hair Golem is not particularly robust, making it a target for attacking characters. However, it is fast and agile, boasting a Dexterity score of 17 that grants it a +3 modifier, resulting in good performance in terms of dodging attacks and landing its own. Its key strength lies in its special abilities, such as immunity to various conditions and the ability to resist certain types of damage, along with the unique ability called Immutable Form, which prevents any alteration to its structure. Despite these strengths, its low challenge rating of 1/4 suggests it is best suited for low-level encounters or as a minion under the command of a more powerful foe.

The Hair Golem has the following attributes: Strength 10 (average), Dexterity 17 (good), Constitution 13 (average), Intelligence 3 (very bad), Wisdom 8 (bad), and Charisma 1 (very bad). This implies that while it can move swiftly, it lacks the intellect or charm to interact effectively outside of combat situations. Its damage vulnerabilities lie in slashing attacks, meaning it takes double damage from such sources. In terms of damage immunity, it cannot be affected by poison or psychic damage, and it has resistances to bludgeoning and piercing damage from non-magical attacks that are not made with adamantine materials. Additionally, it is immune to a range of conditions including being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, emphasizing its reliability in battle. The Hair Golem possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, which is beneficial for nighttime or poorly lit encounters, although its passive Perception is just 9, making it average at noticing hidden entities.

The special ability of the Hair Golem, Immutable Form, renders it immune to any spells or effects that would attempt to change its form. This makes it an excellent guardian against magical manipulation, adding to its effectiveness in combat scenarios. 

In terms of actions, the Hair Golem can perform the Lash attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, allowing it to effectively strike enemies within a 5-foot reach. On a successful hit, it inflicts 5 slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. This ability can significantly affect the battlefield dynamics by potentially incapacitating a foe, allowing the golem to control the flow of combat.

In summary, the Hair Golem is a construct that excels in speed and immunity to various damaging effects while relying on its Lash ability to incapacitate foes in melee combat. Its effectiveness is bolstered by its resilience against magical and physical forms of attack, although it is more vulnerable to slashing damage and lacks offensive spells or higher intelligence.
