The Solar is a formidable celestial creature, embodying divine power and serving as a beacon of truth and justice. With a large frame and impressive stats, it boasts an exceptional Armor Class of 21, making it quite difficult to hit. With a robust health pool of 319 hit points, the Solar can withstand considerable damage. Being a challenge rating 21 creature means it is designed for high-level encounters, presenting both a threat and a source of aid to those who respect its virtues. Notably, the Solar is immune to necrotic and poison damage, has resistance against radiant damage and nonmagical weapons, and possesses several unique abilities that define its combat style. However, despite its strengths, it relies heavily on its melee capabilities and spellcasting for damage output, making it somewhat limited against ranged combat without relying on its innate abilities.

The Solar has the following attributes, which reflect its incredible physical and mental prowess: a Strength score of 28, which translates to a +9 modifier, indicating exceptional physical power; a Dexterity score of 22 (+6), reflecting above-average agility; a Constitution score of 28 (+9), offering exceptional vitality; an Intelligence score of 22 (+6) denoting above-average intellect; a Wisdom score of 30 (+10), marking it as exceptionally perceptive; and a Charisma score of 30 (+10), demonstrating an extraordinary ability to influence others. In terms of saving throws, it is particularly adept at Charisma-based checks with a +17 bonus, while its Wisdom saving throw is significantly lower, being effectively average at +0.

In combat, the Solar can take multiple actions, starting with a Multiattack option that allows it to strike twice with its Holy Sword. This melee weapon attack has a +16 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals substantial damage of 23 (4d6 + 9) slashing plus an additional 21 (6d6) radiant damage on a successful hit. Additionally, the Solar possesses a potent area attack known as Column of Flame, which creates a fiery cylinder in a specified area that inflicts both fire and radiant damage (21 (6d6) of each) to those caught within it unless they succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw.

One of the Solar's defensive abilities is its replenishing defenses via Forceful Parry, which activates when the Solar is bloodied. If a creature misses with a melee attack against it, the Solar's parry inflicts 21 (6d6) lightning damage, along with a DC 24 Constitution saving throw that, upon failure, pushes the attacker back and prone.

Furthermore, the Solar can utilize legendary actions, taking up to three during other creaturesâ€™ turns. This includes Teleportation, allowing it to move up to 120 feet to any location it sees. It can also Heal others by restoring 60 hit points and cleansing them of certain ailments. A notably powerful legendary action is Deafening Command, which affects creatures within 30 feet who can hear it. Affected creatures must make a DC 24 Charisma saving throw, suffering 21 (6d6) thunder damage upon failure, and must obey the Solar's commands, which may result in them falling prone, using their reactions to approach, fleeing, or surrendering.

Additionally, the Solar benefits from special abilities like Champion of Truth, automatically detecting lies while being unable to tell them. Its innate spellcasting allows it to cast powerful spells such as commune, control weather, and resurrection once per day without the need for material components, showcasing its ability to interact with the world beyond physical combat.

Through these varied abilities and high stats, the Solar stands as a powerful guardian and a force of divine retribution, making it a memorable encounter within any campaign.
