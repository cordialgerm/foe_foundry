The Spinosaurus is a gargantuan, unaligned beast that thrives as a formidable predator in its environment. With an impressive array of physical attributes and a challenge rating of 13, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. The creature excels in melee combat, boasting high damage output and the ability to incapacitate foes with its grapple attack. However, it has weaknesses in terms of dexterity and intelligence, which may limit its effectiveness in more strategic scenarios. Notably, the Spinosaurus has a unique affinity for reptilian humanoids, avoiding attacks against them unless provoked, which sets it apart from typical monsters.

The Spinosaurus has an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, making it moderately difficult to hit. It possesses a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 232 (15d20 + 75), providing it with excellent durability in combat. It has a walking speed of 40 feet, allowing it considerable mobility on the battlefield. The creature's Strength score is exceptionally high at 25, which grants a +7 modifier, resulting in powerful physical attacks. Its Constitution score is also very good at 21, giving it a +5 modifier and contributing to its high hit points. However, its Dexterity is low at 9, giving a -1 modifier, indicating it may struggle with evasive maneuvers. The Spinosaurus has an Intelligence score of 2, classified as very bad, meaning it has little capacity for complex thought. Its Wisdom is average at 11 with a +0 modifier, while its Charisma is also average at 10 with a +0 modifier.

The Spinosaurus has several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. It can hold its breath for up to 1 hour, making it suitable for aquatic environments. Its Reptilian Affinity means that it will not attack reptilian humanoids unless they strike it first; if magically compelled to do so, it suffers a disadvantage on attack rolls against them. The Siege Monster ability allows the Spinosaurus to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it a threat to fortifications.

In combat, the Spinosaurus can make a Multiattack, allowing it to perform one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite has a +12 to hit and can deal 33 (4d12 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it will grapple the target, rendering them restrained and unable to escape easily. The two Claw attacks also have a +12 to hit and deal damage of 21 (4d6 + 7) slashing each. Additionally, the creature has a Tail attack that also carries a +12 to hit, dealing 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage at a longer reach of 20 feet. 

The Spinosaurus can invoke its Frightful Presence ability, forcing nearby creatures to succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. Victims can attempt to break free from the effect at the end of each of their turns. If they succeed at the save or the effect ends, they become immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.

Moreover, the Spinosaurus can take legendary actions, allowing it to perform additional maneuvers between other creatures' turns. It may choose to move up to half its speed without incurring opportunity attacks, use its Frightful Presence again, or make a Tail attack at the cost of two legendary actions. These actions enhance its dynamic presence in combat scenarios and make it a challenging opponent for adventuring parties. All these factors combined make the Spinosaurus a fearsome creature that can dominate the battlefield with its sheer size and strength.
