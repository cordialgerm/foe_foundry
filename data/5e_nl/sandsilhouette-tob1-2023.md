The Sand Silhouette is a Medium undead creature that embodies the dark, eerie aspects of the desert. It serves as a formidable adversary in encounters, especially in sandy terrains where it can utilize its special abilities to stealthily approach and ensnare its prey. With a notable high Strength score of 18, it excels in physical combat, dealing substantial damage with its Slam attacks, which combine bludgeoning and necrotic damage. However, it does have weaknesses, particularly to water; when exposed, it takes cold damage that can quickly mitigate its effectiveness in battle. This creature's unique abilities, such as its capability to engender storms of sand and engulf enemies, allow it to dominate the battlefield and apply pressure on its foes.

The Sand Silhouette has an Armor Class of 15, which offers it reasonable protection against attacks. It possesses 105 hit points, representing a considerable amount of durability for its Challenge Rating of 6, making it an adequate challenge for mid-level adventurers. Its movement options include a walking speed of 30 feet and a burrowing speed of 30 feet, allowing for versatile positioning during encounters. 

In terms of abilities, the attributes of the Sand Silhouette are as follows:
- Strength: 18 (+4) – This exceptional strength allows it to deliver powerful physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1) – This value is considered average, giving it decent agility without being agile.
- Constitution: 17 (+3) – This is a very good score, contributing to its resilience and hit points.
- Intelligence: 7 (-2) – This very bad score reflects its lack of intelligence and tactical thinking.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1) – This is average, giving it a slight edge in perception and insight checks.
- Charisma: 10 (+0) – This average score indicates it does not possess any significant social capabilities.

The Sand Silhouette is immune to necrotic and poison damage and has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It is also immune to exhaustion, frightened, and poisoned conditions, making it a resilient opponent in combat. It has darkvision and tremorsense within a range of 60 feet, allowing it to detect movements in darkness or through the ground, with a passive Perception score of 11. It can understand the languages it knew in life, adding an interesting aspect to character interactions.

Special abilities of the Sand Silhouette include:
- Sand Camouflage: This ability grants the silhouette an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while hiding in desert terrain, making it very difficult to detect.
- Sand Form: It can effortlessly move through very narrow spaces without squeezing, allowing for stealthy approaches and escape options.
- Sand Glide: This unique ability allows it to burrow through loose sand quietly, making it an excellent ambusher.
- Undead Nature: It does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, which can be particularly useful in prolonged encounters.
- Water Hypersusceptibility: This ability makes it vulnerable to water, causing it to take cold damage when moving through it or when splashed.

Actions that the Sand Silhouette can take include:
- Multiattack: It can make two Slam attacks and may grapple a target if both attacks hit, applying an escape DC of 15.
- Slam: This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit and a 5-foot reach, delivering 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.
- Engulf: If the silhouette grapples a Medium or smaller creature, it can engulf them, causing them to be blinded and restrained. The engulfed creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the beginning of each of the silhouette’s turns or suffer 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.
- Haunted Haboob (3/Day): This ability creates a whirling sandstorm around the silhouette, which is 10 feet in radius and 30 feet tall. The storm obscures vision and damages any creature that fails a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw when entering or starting their turn in its area, inflicting 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and causing them to become frightened for one minute. Engulfed creatures automatically succeed on their saving throw against this effect.

Overall, the Sand Silhouette is a cunning and menacing undead creature, wielding physical might and unique abilities to sow fear and confusion among adventurers while capitalizing on its environment’s advantages.
