The Giant Weasel is a medium-sized beast known for its agility and keen senses, making it an adept hunter and scout. It possesses a decent Armor Class of 12, which provides it with a modest level of defense, while its low Hit Points of 9 (calculated from rolling 2d8) indicate that it is somewhat fragile and should avoid direct confrontations with stronger foes. With a movement speed of 40 feet, the Giant Weasel can swiftly maneuver around the battlefield, allowing it to engage or evade targets effectively. It is rated at a Challenge Rating of 1/8, making it a weaker opponent intended for low-level encounters, yielding 25 experience points upon defeat.

The attributes of the Giant Weasel include a Strength score of 10, giving it an average physical power, Dexterity at 14, which provides it with a good level of quickness, Constitution at 10 resulting in average endurance, Intelligence at 4 denoting very bad cognitive capabilities, Wisdom at 12 indicating an average awareness, and Charisma at 4 reflecting very bad social skills. Its Dexterity modifier of +2 enhances its agility-related tasks, while the Wisdom modifier of +1 improves its perception abilities.

The Giant Weasel has proficiency in two skills: Perception with a total modifier of +3, which is good, allowing it to detect hidden foes or obstacles, and Stealth with a total modifier of +4, which is very good, enabling it to move quietly and avoid detection. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, making it effective in low-light conditions. Its passive Perception score of 13 suggests it is quite aware of its surroundings, helping it to notice hidden creatures or traps easily.

The Giant Weasel has a special ability called "Keen Hearing and Smell," which grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on these senses. This means when attempting to detect sounds or scents, the Giant Weasel can roll twice and take the higher result, significantly enhancing its capability to track or identify nearby creatures.

In terms of actions, the Giant Weasel can make a Bite attack, which uses a melee weapon attack modifier of +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet against one target. Upon a successful hit, it deals 4 piercing damage (calculated as 1d4 + 2), or 7 piercing damage (calculated as 2d4 + 2) if the target is currently grappled by the weasel. Additionally, it can perform a Grab attack, also using a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, which, upon hitting, allows it to grapple the target with an escape DC of 12. This grappling ability makes the Giant Weasel a tactical opponent, as it can restrain enemies and potentially set them up for further attacks or allow allies to capitalize on the situation.
