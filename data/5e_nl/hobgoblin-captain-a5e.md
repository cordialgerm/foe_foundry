The Hobgoblin Captain is a formidable Medium humanoid creature that takes on the role of a tactical leader within a hobgoblin military structure. With an Armor Class of 18, it is well-defended against attacks, and boasts a respectable pool of Hit Points totaling 52, allowing it to withstand significant damage in combat. This captain is skilled both in physical combat and in leadership, having strong physical attributes and access to strategic abilities that enhance its allies' effectiveness. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it represents a moderate challenge for adventurers, rewarding careful planning and teamwork to overcome. The hobgoblin captain's ability to command fire, along with its various attack options, makes it a notable threat on the battlefield. However, without allies nearby, its combat effectiveness may diminish, particularly in terms of movement.

The Hobgoblin Captain's primary attributes include a Strength score of 16 (+3 modifier, categorized as very good), Dexterity of 14 (+2, good), Constitution of 14 (+2, good), and Intelligence of 14 (+2, good). The captain's Wisdom is rated at 12 (+1, average), and Charisma at 14 (+2, good). It possesses saving throw bonuses of +5 for Strength and +3 for Wisdom, indicating a solid defense against physical and mental challenges. The captain also has skills such as Athletics (+5, very good), Engineering (+4, good), Intimidation (+4, good), and Perception (+3, good), showcasing its prowess in both combat and strategic contexts. With darkvision extending up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 13, it has enhanced sensory abilities that aid in various situations. The captain can communicate in both Common and Goblin languages.

One special ability of the Hobgoblin Captain is Formation Movement. This allows the captain to avoid provoking opportunity attacks when it begins its turn within 5 feet of an ally that is not incapacitated, enabling tactical positioning during combat situations.

In terms of actions, the captain can execute a Multiattack, which allows it to strike twice with its greatsword. The greatsword melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts an average of 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage upon a successful hit. The captain can also wield a javelin, which can be thrown or used in melee. The javelin attack similarly has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 30/120 feet, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage when it hits.

An important special ability is Officers Command, which can be used once per day. This ability allows the hobgoblin captain to inspire creatures of its choice within 30 feet that can hear and understand it, provided that their Challenge Rating is 2 or lower. For the next minute, the inspired creatures gain an expertise die on their attack rolls and saving throws, significantly boosting their effectiveness in combat. However, a creature can only benefit from one instance of Officers Command at a time, which adds a strategic layer to its usage in the field.
