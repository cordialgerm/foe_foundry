The Dryad is a Medium-sized Fey creature known for its strong connection to nature and its ability to magically influence the environment around it. With an armor class of 15, it is relatively tough for its challenge rating of 1/2, making it a suitable challenge for low-level adventurers. The Dryad has a total of 22 hit points, which provides it with some durability in combat, yet it is susceptible to fire damage, indicating a notable weakness. Its attributes reveal good physical and mental capabilities, particularly in wisdom and charisma, where it excels, making it effective at manipulation and perception. The Dryad is capable of using plants and animals to its advantage, allowing for interesting interactions in gameplay.

The Dryad has several important attributes. Its strength is 14 with a +2 modifier, which is considered good, allowing for effective melee attacks. Dexterity is at 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average, contributing to its agility. Constitution is 10 with no modifier, signifying an average resilience to physical stress. Intelligence is 12 with a +1 modifier, which is also average and shows some comprehension of complex ideas. Wisdom stands at 16 with a +3 modifier, which is very good, enabling excellent perception and insight skills. Finally, its charisma is 18 with a +4 modifier, which is exceptional, making the Dryad highly persuasive in social situations.

The Dryad has several special abilities that enhance its versatility. Its Magic Resistance provides advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it difficult to affect with such abilities. With Speak with Nature, the Dryad can communicate effectively with beasts and plants, allowing for potential alliances or avoidance of conflict. The Tree Stride ability allows the Dryad to enter a living tree and emerge from another within 60 feet, effectively granting it enhanced mobility during combat or exploration.

In terms of actions, the Dryad can make a melee attack with a club, which has a +4 to hit and deals an average of 6 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Its Entangling Plants ability magically causes plants within a 20-foot radius to erupt, forcing affected creatures to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw, with a failure resulting in them being restrained for 1 minute. This ability transforms the area into difficult terrain, providing strategic advantages during combat. For socially manipulating its environment, the Dryad can use its Fey Charm ability up to three times per day, allowing it to charm a humanoid or beast within 30 feet. This requires a target to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw; on failure, the charm makes them regard the Dryad as a trusted ally for 24 hours, although the effect can end if the Dryad or its allies harm the charmed creature. If the target successfully resists, they are immune to the charm for a day.

Overall, the Dryad offers unique gameplay interactions centered around nature and charm, allowing players to employ tactics that involve manipulation and environmental advantages.
