The Behir is a huge monstrosity known for its speed and strength, functioning as a formidable foe in combat. With high hit points and decent armor class, it can absorb considerable damage while dealing significant amounts of damage itself. It excels in both melee and lightning damage, making it a versatile threat in various scenarios. The Behir has the unique ability to maneuver through tight spaces despite its large size and can climb and swim efficiently, giving it substantial mobility in diverse environments as well as the ability to capture smaller prey by swallowing them whole. Its main weaknesses include its reliance on direct melee attacks and the risks associated with being overwhelmed by multiple attackers.

The Behir has the following attributes: Strength 20 (+5, which is exceptional), Dexterity 14 (+2, which is average), Constitution 18 (+4, which is very good), Intelligence 10 (+0, which is bad), Wisdom 16 (+3, which is good), and Charisma 12 (+1, which is average). It excels in saving throws with Dexterity +6 (good), Intelligence +4 (average), and Wisdom +7 (very good). Its skills include athletics +9 (very good), perception +7 (good), and stealth +6 (good). The Behir is immune to lightning damage, has darkvision with a range of 90 feet, and possesses a passive perception score of 17. It can communicate in Common and Draconic.

The Behir has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness: 

- Spider Climb allows the Behir to use its climbing speed on challenging surfaces and even while inverted on ceilings, making it an unpredictable opponent in vertical encounters.
- Serpentine enables it to squeeze through spaces as narrow as 5 feet wide without hindering its movement speed, allowing it to ambush or escape effectively.

In combat, the Behir can perform the following actions:

- Multiattack allows the Behir to make a bite attack followed by a constrict attack. 
- The Bite attack features a +10 to hit, has a reach of 10 feet, and deals 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature that is grappled, the Behir can swallow it, inflicting ongoing acid damage while the creature is blinded and restrained.
- The Constrict attack also has a +10 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled with an escape DC of 17 and restrained while grappled. The Behir can grapple two creatures at once.
- Lightning Breath can be used once per recharge (5-6) to unleash a 5-foot wide, 20-foot long line of lightning. Creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 56 (16d6) lightning damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.

Its reaction, Vengeful Breath, allows the Behir to immediately use its Lightning Breath whenever it is struck by a melee attack, including the attacker within the area of effect, potentially turning the tides of combat in its favor.
