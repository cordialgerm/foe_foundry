The Jaanavar Jal is a massive, amphibious monstrosity characterized by its dual capability to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. With a formidable Armor Class of 15, this creature exhibits substantial resilience due to its regenerative abilities, allowing it to recover hit points each turn under normal conditions. However, it has specific vulnerabilities, particularly to cold damage which can temporarily prevent its regeneration. This creature is particularly deadly in combat, as it can deal significant damage through its multiattack actions, combining biting and grappling tactics to control the battlefield. 

The Jaanavar Jal has impressive physical attributes, with a Strength score of 20, granting it a modifier of +5, making it exceptional at physical attacks and grappling. Its Constitution is also high at 20, providing a +5 modifier which significantly boosts its hit points and durability. The creature's Dexterity is average at 14, providing an additional +2 modifier, which impacts its defense and ability to dodge attacks to some extent. Intelligence is low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, making the Jaanavar Jal unfit for complex problem-solving or spellcasting. Wisdom is somewhat decent at 13 (+1 modifier), allowing for reasonable perception, while its Charisma sits at an average level of 10, indicating no special influence in social interactions.

The Jaanavar Jal's saving throws reflect its physical prowess: it gains a +8 bonus to both Strength and Constitution saves, making it very resilient against physical attacks and spells that target these attributes. The creature excels in the Perception skill with a +4 modifier, demonstrating its ability to notice threats, and it is stealthy, evidenced by its +5 modifier. However, it is vulnerable to cold damage, which can undermine its regenerative capabilities.

The creature's unique special abilities include being amphibious, which allows it to breathe underwater and on land seamlessly. Its regeneration ability lets it heal for 10 hit points at the start of each turn unless it has taken cold damage, which prevents this ability for the next turn. Additionally, the Jaanavar Jal can only die if it starts its turn with 0 hit points without the potential to regenerate.

In terms of actions, the Jaanavar Jal can execute a Multiattack, permitting it to perform two separate attacks in a single turn: one bite attack and one constrict attack. The bite attack has a +8 to hit and can deal an average of 21 piercing damage. The constrict ability also has a +8 to hit and deals 10 bludgeoning damage, while also grappling the target, restraining them, and preventing the Jaanavar Jal from constricting another creature until the grapple ends.

Lastly, the creature can use Flaming Oil Spittle, a powerful attack that recharges on a roll of 5-6. This attack projects a line of burning oil that is 40 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures caught within this line must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or suffer an average of 31 fire damage (based on 9d6) on a failed save, or half that damage on a successful save. This ability not only inflicts heavy damage but can also control space on the battlefield by threatening a significant area.
