The Derro Guard is a small humanoid creature that serves as a guardian or combatant within its underground realm, often aligned with non-good moralities. Weighing in at a challenge rating of 1/2, this creature possesses a combination of moderate physical resilience and dexterity, making it reasonably effective in combat, particularly with its ranged attacks. Its strengths lie in its ability to maneuver stealthily and its proficiency with the aklys, a type of throwing weapon, granting it multiple chances to strike its enemies from a distance. However, it has several notable weaknesses: it is particularly hampered by sunlight, where its combat capabilities are significantly diminished, and it has very low wisdom, which negatively affects its perception skills.

The Derro Guard has an Armor Class of 13, providing it with decent protection, particularly for a creature of its challenge rating. It has 18 hit points, which equates to an average resilience for a creature of this type, allowing it to endure a moderate amount of damage in combat. With a movement speed of 30 feet, it can relocate during combat effectively. The Derro has a Strength of 10, which is average, contributing nothing special in terms of physical power. The Dexterity score of 14 gives it a good modifier of +2, enhancing its attack and defense capabilities. Its Constitution is 12, offering a good +1 modifier for health and durability. Intelligence is average at 11, with no particular strengths or weaknesses. However, its Wisdom is very low at 5, resulting in a -3 modifier, causing significant difficulties in perception-related checks. Its Charisma is similarly low at 9, which is also a -1 modifier, indicating limited social skills.

For skills, the Derro Guard has proficiency in stealth, allowing for a +4 modifier, which is good and supports its ability to remain unnoticed while ambushing foes or avoiding detection. It possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as though it were dim light. Its passive perception is poor, sitting at 7, which paired with its low Wisdom makes it ineffective at noticing threats. The creature can converse in several languages, including Common, Dwarvish, and Undercommon.

The Derro Guard's special abilities enhance its effectiveness in combat and defense. As an Aklys Thrower, if it successfully hits a target within 30 feet with its aklys, it can use its bonus action to quickly retrieve the aklys and immediately make another attack against the same target. This ability allows the Derro Guard to maintain pressure and potentially deal additional damage in a single turn. Its Magic Resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, allowing it to resist such effects better than most combatants, resulting in good survivability against magical threats. However, the Derro Guard suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight while in sunlight, making it less effective when exposed.

In terms of actions, the Derro Guard wields an aklys, allowing it to make melee or ranged weapon attacks with a +4 to hit. The aklys has a reach of 5 feet or a ranged capability of 10/30 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 5 piercing damage, which is moderate for its challenge rating. Additionally, it can attack with a light crossbow, also with a +4 to hit and a longer range of 80/320 feet. When it successfully hits with the light crossbow, it inflicts 6 piercing damage. These attacks provide the Derro Guard with versatility in both close and ranged combat, effectively allowing it to adapt to various scenarios on the battlefield.
