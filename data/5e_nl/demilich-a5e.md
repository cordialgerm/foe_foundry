The Demilich is a powerful and eerie undead creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat. Drawing from its magical background, it possesses exceptional intelligence and charisma, making it a master of manipulation and defense. With an Armor Class of 20 and 159 hit points, it can withstand considerable damage, while its ability to fly enhances its mobility on the battlefield. The Demilich excels in debilitating foes, stealing their souls, and using them to heal itself, making it a dangerous entity that can shift the tide of battle in its favor. However, its reliance on souls for sustenance means that if faced with opponents who can destroy its soul gems, it becomes vulnerable. 

The Demilich has the following attributes: Strength 10, Dexterity 24, Constitution 16, Intelligence 24, Wisdom 22, and Charisma 20. Its Dexterity score is 24 (+7), giving it good agility, while its Intelligence and Wisdom are equally high at 24 (+7) and 22 (+6) respectively, making it exceptionally savvy and perceptive. It has average Strength (10) and good Constitution (16) scores, translating to a very good overall survivability. The modifiers for saving throws are as follows: Strength +6 (average), Constitution +9 (good), Intelligence +13 (exceptional), Wisdom +12 (exceptional), and Charisma +11 (exceptional). It has a stealth skill of +13 (exceptional), making it hard to detect, and an arcana skill of +13 (exceptional), highlighting its magical prowess.

In terms of damage and conditions, the Demilich is immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, as well as damage from nonmagical weapons. It also cannot be charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, or fatigued, granting it exceptional resilience in various combat scenarios. The creature possesses truesight up to 60 feet, allowing it to see through illusions and darkness, and has a passive perception of 22 (good). 

The Demilich has several significant abilities that enhance its survival and combat effectiveness. Its Avoidance ability allows it to take no damage on successful saving throws against effects that deal half damage, making it exceptional at dodging harm. The creature can use Legendary Resistance five times per day to deny a failed saving throw, a trait that can render it incredibly hard to disable. Additionally, its Undead Nature means it does not require air, food, or sleep, allowing for relentless pursuit of its goals.

Among its actions, the Devour Soul ability is particularly noteworthy. The Demilich can target a creature within 120 feet, requiring a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. A successful save results in the target taking 40 necrotic damage, allowing the Demilich to regain the same amount of hit points. If the target fails the throw and there is at least one unoccupied soul gem on the Demilich’s skull, the target instantly dies, and its soul is trapped within a gem, preventing resurrection for a time. This action can turn the tide of combat very quickly because successful targets become immune to the effect for 24 hours. 

The Demilich can take three legendary actions, with options including Cranial Transposition, which allows it to teleport and disguise itself as a nonmagical skull, making it deceptively hard to target. The Dust Storm ability (costing two actions) engulfs its surroundings, dealing necrotic damage and blinding enemies, enhancing its tactical control over the battlefield. Another powerful option is the Ringing Laugh (also costing two actions), which frightens creatures within 60 feet, potentially causing them to flee in terror. Finally, with a Telekinesis ability, it can manipulate a creature or an object, moving it strategically and creating opportunities for further attack or defense, causing additional damage if another entity halts the target’s movement.

In summary, the Demilich is a highly intelligent and deadly foe, capable of evading damage and manipulating the battlefield to its advantage while striking fear into the hearts of its opponents. Its blend of spells, abilities to steal souls, and legendary actions make it a central figure in any high-level confrontation.
