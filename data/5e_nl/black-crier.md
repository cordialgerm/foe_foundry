The Black Crier is a formidable Medium Undead creature, known for its ominous presence and dire prophecies heralding major catastrophes. This creature serves as a harbinger of doom, possessing a significant amount of hit points at 150, making it robust during combat. Its natural armor grants it an Armor Class of 16, providing good protection against attacks. With a Challenge Rating of 11, the Black Crier is an exceptional threat to adventurers, yielding 7,200 experience points upon defeat. It has a range of mobility, able to walk and hover or fly, which gives it strategic advantages in combat. While it is immune to poison damage and resistant to necrotic, psychic, and nonmagical physical attacks, its vulnerabilities lie in its reliance on its bound region to utilize its special abilities effectively. The Black Crier struggles with low Intelligence and Charisma but compensates with high Wisdom and Dexterity, making it a tactician in battle and a wise entity.

The Black Crier has the following attributes:
- Strength: 14, which provides a good melee attack modifier of +2.
- Dexterity: 19, offering an exceptional modifier of +4, enhancing its agility in combat.
- Constitution: 16 grants a very good +3 modifier contributing to its health pool.
- Intelligence: 11, providing an average modifier of +0, indicating limited cognitive skills.
- Wisdom: 20 supplies an exceptional +5 modifier, reflecting its keen insight and perception.
- Charisma: 12 results in a bad +1 modifier, indicating it lacks persuasive abilities.

In terms of saving throws, the Black Crier is proficient in Dexterity (+8), Wisdom (+9), and Intelligence (+4). Its skill set includes notable proficiencies in history (+4), perception (+9), performance (+9), and religion (+4), emphasizing its depth of knowledge and insight. The creature's darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, while a passive perception of 15 aids in detecting hidden threats.

The Black Crier possesses the following special abilities:
- Bound by Calamity: This ability ties the Black Crier to a specified region where a calamity is destined to occur. If it strays beyond its bounds for over 24 hours, it loses its Rejuvenation trait and Crier's Lament action, leading to permanent death.
- Rejuvenation: If the Black Crier is slain within its designated area before the catastrophe occurs, it will resurrect in 1d6 days with full hit points. This cycle concludes once the predicted disaster has transpired, and only a wish spell can bypass this trait.

During combat, the Black Crier can perform the following actions:
- Multiattack: This allows the creature to use its Bell Toll ability and then make two melee attacks.
- Bell: This melee weapon attack has a +8 to hit and targets one enemy within a 5-foot reach, dealing 7 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 14 necrotic damage.
- Bell Toll: The Black Crier can target a creature within 60 feet, forcing them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the victim suffers 14 necrotic damage and becomes frightened until the end of their next turn. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also gains one level of exhaustion, making it significantly more vulnerable in future encounters. On a successful save, the target only takes half damage and remains unfrightened.
- Crier’s Lament (1/Day): This potent ability produces a frightful wave in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. A failing creature is immediately reduced to 0 hit points, while a successful one suffers 21 psychic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can attempt to shake off this effect at the end of its turns.

The Black Crier is a strategically complex foe due to its abilities that manipulate both the battlefield and the emotional state of adventurers, making encounters with it a unique and challenging experience for players.
