The Fixer has a Strength score of 10, which provides no modifier (very bad) in melee combat; its Dexterity is 14, granting a +2 modifier (good), enhancing its agility and ranged attack capabilities. The Constitution score of 12 gives a +1 modifier (average), contributing to its hit points. Intelligence rests at 13, allowing a +1 modifier (average) that enables some reasoning skills.

In terms of special abilities, the Fixer can perform a "Ritual Cleansing," which takes 10 minutes to execute. This ability allows the Fixer to cleanse a creature, object, or area within a 30-foot radius that doesn't exceed a 20-foot cube. For 8 hours after the ritual, the affected entities become hidden from all divination magic, similar to the nondetection spell. In addition, divination spells of 4th level or lower do not function in the cleansed area, and creatures within cannot be targeted by scrying.

During combat, the Fixer utilizes a "Multiattack" feature, allowing it to make two weapon attacks with either shortswords or a sling in a single turn. The shortsword attack has a +4 to hit and deals 5 piercing damage along with an additional 3 poison damage. The hand crossbow can be used at a range of 30 feet up to 120 feet, with the same +4 to hit, also dealing 5 piercing damage and then 3 poison damage.

Additionally, the Fixer has a unique action called "Cleaner," allowing it to cast the spells prestidigitation and unseen servant at will. These spells do not require material components and use Wisdom as the spellcasting ability. Prestidigitation is a versatile spell that can create minor magical effects, while unseen servant summons an invisible helper that can perform simple tasks, providing utility both in and out of combat. Overall, the Fixer excels in support roles, strategic gameplay, and providing utility to allies in a cohesive manner.
