With an Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of 102 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage before being brought down, making it a formidable opponent. It possesses a Challenge Rating of 5, indicating that it is a suitable challenge for a party of experienced adventurers. The Empusa's strengths lie in its high Strength, effective deception skills, and special abilities that enhance its combat performance, such as the ability to ambush unsuspecting foes and transform into various forms. Its primary weaknesses are its reliance on surprise and its relatively average Dexterity, which might limit its evasiveness in certain situations.

The Empusa has an impressive Strength of 20, giving it a +5 modifier, which is exceptional for melee attacks, coupled with an above-average Constitution score of 18, providing it with a +4 modifier for saving throws. It also has a good Wisdom score of 14 (+2), enhancing its ability to perceive threats. With a Charisma score of 19 (+4), this creature excels in manipulation and deceit, further bolstered by a +7 modifier in deception.

In terms of special abilities, the Empusa has several notable traits. The first is "Ambusher," which grants the Empusa advantage on attack rolls during the first round of combat against any creature it has managed to surprise, making it deadly in ambush situations. "Magical Copper" indicates that its claw and kick attacks are magical in nature, bypassing certain resistances. The "Nimble Fighter" ability allows the Empusa to take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each turn, enhancing its mobility in combat significantly, allowing for both attack and retreat tactics without losing momentum. The "Shapechanger" ability allows the Empusa to polymorph into a Small or Medium beast with a challenge rating no higher than its own. This transformation keeps its statistics consistent aside from size, allowing it to blend into environments or escape from threats effectively, while the transformed form retains a coppery color on at least one limb.

In combat, the Empusa’s primary method of attack is through its Multiattack option, wherein it can perform two claw attacks or one claw and one kick attack each turn. The claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 14 slashing damage on a hit, making it a potent threat. The kick attack, also with a +8 to hit, deals 12 bludgeoning damage and forces the target to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On failure, this kick can push the target back up to 10 feet and knock them prone, giving the Empusa control over the battlefield and potentially setting up further attacks.

Overall, the Empusa is a dangerous foe with a blend of physical prowess, magical attacks, and strategic capabilities that highlight its nature as a chaotic evil creature, making it a memorable adversary for any adventuring party.
