Vallowex is a large aberration with chaotic neutral alignment, designed to serve as a formidable challenge in combat and an eerie encounter for players. With a solid armor class of 14 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 123, the vallowex is resilient in battle. It combines aquatic and terrestrial movement, capable of swimming 30 feet and walking the same distance. The challenge rating of 7 indicates it can present a significant challenge to a party, earning 2,900 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the vallowex possesses an array of special abilities that can debilitate its foes while also utilizing effective offensive capabilities through its Multiattack action.

The vallowex has the following ability scores: a very good Strength score of 20 (+5), average Dexterity score of 10 (+0), good Constitution score of 18 (+4), and exceptionally low intelligence and charisma, both at 5 (-3). Its Wisdom is decent, measuring at 12 (+1). The creature has effective saving throws with a +4 on Wisdom saves, making it somewhat resilient against mental attacks. Its skills include a good Stealth score (+6) and competent Perception (+4), allowing it to be both elusive in water and aware of its surroundings.

Vallowex has several notable abilities that enhance its gameplay effectiveness. It can breathe both air and water due to its Amphibious trait, allowing it to operate in various environments. Its Aura of Thirst is particularly impactful; as the vallowex starts its turns, each creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their next attack or ability check. This aura can lead to gradual exhaustion, with one level acquired for every minute spent within its range unless the affected creature drinks water, which adds a layer of strategy for parties facing the vallowex.

In combat, the vallowex can make two attacks thanks to its Multiattack actionâ€”one with its spiked tongue and one with its tail. The spiked tongue attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, dealing an average of 14 piercing damage (2d8 + 5) and grappling the target (with a grapple escape DC of 15). This grapple restrains the target, preventing it from escaping easily. The tail attack also boasts a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, capable of inflicting 16 bludgeoning damage (2d10 + 5) on a single enemy.

Additionally, the vallowex can utilize its Swallow action against any Medium or smaller creature it has grappled. If the spiked tongue attack successfully hits, the target is swallowed, rendering it blinded and restrained, while taking 10 acid damage (3d6) at the start of each of the vallowex's turns. There is a critical dynamic at play here, as if the swallowed target deals 15 damage or more in one turn, the vallowex must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate that creature, which then falls prone nearby. If the vallowex happens to perish, the swallowed creature can escape freely, illustrating the precarious nature of battling this aberration.

Once per week, the vallowex can unleash a 40-foot-radius cloud of microscopic eggs into the water, threatening those that come into contact with them. Any humanoid or beast that ingests these eggs must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with a vallowex tadpole disease. This disease imposes a potential strength reduction, which can ultimately lead to death if the victim's Strength drops to zero, creating an ominous threat that lingers beyond the initial encounter. Players must navigate the interaction with this terrifying aberration, balancing direct confrontation with potential long-term consequences.
