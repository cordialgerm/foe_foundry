The Flumph is a small aberration that serves as a unique and quirky creature in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, often filling a supportive or informative role in adventures. With a challenge rating of 1/8, it is relatively weak, primarily relying on its abilities to gather information and support its allies rather than direct combat. It features exceptional dexterity and intelligence, providing it with good evasion capabilities and problem-solving skills. However, its low strength and vulnerability to psychic damage make it particularly susceptible in physical confrontations. Notably, the Flumph can communicate telepathically and has an ability to both illuminate and conceal itself, contributing to its stealthy nature.

The Flumph has an armor class of 12, which is average, and it has 7 hit points, derived from rolling 2d6. It possesses a movement speed of 5 feet on land, 30 feet in the air, and 30 feet while swimming, allowing it to navigate various environments with ease. Its strength attribute is weak at 6, giving it a modifier of -2, which is very bad for any physical attacks or checks requiring strength. The Flumph shines in dexterity with a value of 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is good for dodging attacks and avoiding traps. Its constitution is average, with a score of 10 and a +0 modifier, making it neither resilient nor particularly frail. Intelligence is again strong at 14 (+2), allowing it to effectively solve puzzles and utilize spells. Wisdom matches its intelligence at 14 (+2), giving it good perception and insight. Lastly, its charisma is average at 10 (+0), which does not significantly enhance its social interactions.

The Flumph has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in encounters. It is amphibious, enabling it to breathe both air and water without hindrance. The Flumph Light ability allows it to emit dim light in a 30-foot radius as a bonus action, providing good utility for navigation or stealth operations, and it can extinguish this light or change its color at will. The Telepathic Spy feature enables the Flumph to perceive any telepathic messages in its vicinity, allowing it to remain aware of information otherwise unnoticed, while also being immune to attempts to read its thoughts or detect its emotions. The ability to be tipped over means that if the Flumph finds itself knocked prone, it can become incapacitated but has a chance at the end of its turns to use a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to flip itself back over, ending the incapacitated condition.

In combat, the Flumph can use its Tendrils action to make a melee weapon attack. This has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 1 piercing damage plus an additional 3 (1d6) acid damage, representing a moderate threat in close quarters. Additionally, it can use its Stench Spray once a day, creating a 15-foot cone and forcing each creature within it to make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail become affected by a horrible stench for one hour, poisoning them and any nearby creatures. This ability can severely hinder enemies’ effectiveness while providing a tactical advantage to allies. Affected creatures can eliminate the stench by bathing during a rest, allowing for potential recovery after the encounter.
