The Medusa is a medium monstrosity known for its potent combination of physical attacks and its exceptional petrifying gaze. This creature is capable of inflicting significant damage and dishing out debilitating effects in combat, making it a formidable opponent at its Challenge Rating of 6. While it possesses notable resilience to exhaustion and fear, it also has decent Armor Class and a substantial pool of hit points, allowing it to withstand a decent amount of punishment. The Medusa's strengths lie in its ability to control the battlefield with its petrifying gaze and deliver powerful poison-infused attacks using its snake-like hair and weapons. However, it may be weaker in terms of mobility compared to faster creatures and relies heavily on its gaze for crowd control.

The Medusa has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good, making it moderately difficult to hit. It possesses 112 hit points, providing it with a very good durability in battle. Its speed is average at 30 feet, which allows it to maneuver effectively within combat zones. The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength of +0 (very bad), Dexterity of +4 (very good), Constitution of +3 (good), Intelligence of +2 (average), Wisdom of +1 (average), and Charisma of +6 (exceptional). The Medusa's high Charisma contributes significantly to its ability to influence and intimidate opponents.

The Medusa has several key special abilities. Firstly, its "Monstrosity Resilience" grants it effective protection against exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it better suited for protracted encounters. The "Petrifying Gaze" ability is a potent feature; any creature that can see the Medusa's eyes and starts its turn within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails this save by 5 or more, it is instantly petrified; otherwise, it becomes restrained and must repeat the saving throw on its next turn. Petrification is a powerful effect that can permanently remove threats from the battlefield, lasting until magical means are used to undo it. Finally, the "Snake Friend" ability allows the Medusa to communicate with snakes and protects them from her own gaze.

In terms of actions, the Medusa can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make one Snake Hair attack and two Shortsword attacks or three Longbow attacks in a turn. The "Snake Hair" attack is a melee weapon attack that uses +7 to hit, has a reach of 10 feet, and targets one creature, dealing 6 piercing damage plus an additional 14 poison damage. Its Shortsword attack also uses +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage plus 7 poison damage, while its Longbow attacks, which are ranged, also leverage a +7 to hit and can strike at a range of 150 feet with 8 piercing damage alongside 7 poison damage.

The Medusa also has a reaction called "Interruptive Hiss." When targeted by an attack, the Medusa can use its snakes to distract the attacker, requiring them to succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or face a disadvantage on their attack roll.

Overall, the Medusa presents a complex combination of offensive capabilities and crowd control, making her a significant threat in any encounter.
