The Giant Ape is a formidable creature in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a Huge beast. Renowned for its immense physical power, it boasts high hit points and a solid challenge rating of 7, making it a significant foe in combat scenarios. The creature's key strengths lie in its formidable attacks that can deal substantial bludgeoning damage, particularly with its multiattack capability that allows it to strike twice in a single turn. However, it does have limitations, such as its low Armor Class of 12, which makes it somewhat vulnerable to attacks. The Giant Ape's ability to grapple opponents adds a layer of tactical depth, allowing it to control the battlefield by restricting movement and potentially throwing enemies.

The Giant Ape has the following attributes:
- Strength: +8 (exceptional)
- Dexterity: +2 (average)
- Constitution: +4 (good)
- Intelligence: -2 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +1 (average)
- Charisma: -2 (very bad)

For senses, the Giant Ape does not have any special features, but its Perception score of 14 provides a good awareness level, while a Stealth score of 12 indicates an average ability to remain unnoticed.

The Giant Ape possesses several special abilities:
- Multiattack allows the ape to make two attacks either with its fists or by throwing rocks. If it uses its fists and successfully hits the same Large or smaller creature with both attacks, it grapples the target, which can make it difficult for other players to maneuver.
- The Fist attack is a melee weapon strike that has a +8 to hit and deals 27 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. With a reach of 10 feet, it remains effective at close quarters.
- The Rock attack is a ranged option with the same +8 to hit, a range of 50 feet normal and 100 feet at disadvantage, dealing 23 bludgeoning damage.

In terms of actions, the Giant Ape can again use Multiattack, Fist, or Rock in its turn. Additionally, it has a notable Bonus Action:
- The Throw action allows the Giant Ape to toss a grappled Large or smaller creature up to 50 feet in a random direction, knocking it prone. This can be particularly devastating as the creature takes 3 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet thrown and can potentially strike another creature, forcing a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the same consequences.

Overall, the Giant Ape excels in physical combat and battlefield control, making it both a dangerous opponent and a source of strategic opportunities for its handler.
