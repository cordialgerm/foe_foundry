The Gerridae is a unique large fey creature that possesses both strengths and weaknesses, making it a notable presence in any encounter. While it has a decent armor class of 14 and a robust 76 hit points, its low speed of 20 feet limits mobility. The challenge rating of 1 indicates that it is suitable for low-level adventurers, providing 200 experience points upon defeat. It has excellent physical attributes, particularly in Strength (16) and Constitution (17), showcasing its ability to withstand attacks effectively. However, its Intelligence, Charisma, and even Wisdom scores are quite low, rendering it less competent in social or cognitive challenges. Its special abilities emphasize its aquatic nature and adaptability while engaging with riders.

The Gerridae has several attributes that are important for gameplay. It has a Strength score of 16, translating to a +3 modifier, which provides good effectiveness in melee attacks; its Dexterity is slightly lower at 15, giving it a +2 modifier, which is average for dodging attacks. Its Constitution of 17 results in a +3 modifier, contributing to its good resilience in combat. The creature has a very low Intelligence of 2, meaning it has a -4 modifier, which is very bad; this affects its ability to understand complex commands or engage in strategic planning. Its Wisdom of 13 gives it a +1 modifier, allowing it to be somewhat aware of its surroundings, while its Charisma of 7 results in a -2 modifier, indicating poor social skills.

The Gerridae has a few notable special abilities that enhance its combat and role-playing potential. The ability "Bred to the Saddle" means it cannot be charmed or frightened while it has a rider, making it largely unwavering in intimidating scenarios. The "Water Bound" trait showcases its dependency on water, as it loses 2 hit points for every hour spent on dry land, emphasizing its need to stay hydrated for optimal health. Lastly, the "Water Walker" ability allows the Gerridae to traverse water surfaces as if they were solid ground, emulating the effects of the water walk spell, which can be strategically advantageous in encounters involving water bodies.

In terms of actions, the Gerridae can execute a multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite and one Claw attack during its turn. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 6 piercing damage (1d6 + 3). The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 5 slashing damage (1d4 + 3). These attacks provide the Gerridae with a balanced option for dealing damage in close combat, leveraging its solid Strength modifier to hit effectively.
