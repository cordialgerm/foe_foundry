The Ancient Red Dragon is a gargantuan and fearsome creature characterized by its immense physical strength, resilience, and mastery over fire. As one of the most powerful monsters in Dungeons & Dragons, it holds a challenge rating of 21, making it a formidable foe for even the most experienced adventurers. With a staggering 382 hit points, an impressive Armor Class of 22, and notable abilities that allow it to dominate the battlefield, this dragon embodies the terror and majesty of its kind. Its mobility is remarkable, as it can fly at 80 feet and has climbing and walking speeds of 40 feet. However, its intimidating presence and powerful attacks can be countered through strategic planning by players, especially considering its reliance on saving throws and possible vulnerabilities.

The Ancient Red Dragon possesses an array of attributes that greatly enhance its combat capabilities. It has a Strength of +10, which is exceptionally effective for physical attacks. Its Dexterity of +7 is very good, granting it a decent level of agility. With a Constitution of +16, the dragon showcases an exceptional capacity to absorb damage, benefiting its already high hit points. Intellect and Wisdom are average at +4 and +9, respectively, allowing it limited effectiveness in certain mental challenges, while a Charisma score of +13 is very good, enhancing its fear-inducing abilities.

The dragon's senses include darkvision up to 120 feet and keen senses at 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures in darkness and gain a significant advantage in stealth-related scenarios. It has a Perception skill of 26, making it excellent at noticing threats or hidden foes and a Stealth score of 17, which is good for remaining undetected. The Ancient Red Dragon is fluent in Common and Draconic, allowing it to communicate effectively with multiple characters.

One of the dragon's notable abilities is "Boil Over," which produces extreme heat around the dragon when its Fire Breath weapon is not in use. Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage. Failing this save by 5 or more also inflicts one level of exhaustion on the creature, which can severely limit its abilities in combat.

Additionally, the dragon has "Legendary Resistance," allowing it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw up to three times per day, effectively mitigating its susceptibility to certain effects and spells.

In combat, the Ancient Red Dragon carries out a "Multiattack," first invoking its "Frightful Presence" ability, which forces nearby creatures to make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw to avoid becoming frightened, incapacitating them with fear for up to one minute. It can then make a bite attack with a +17 to hit, delivering 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage and adding 14 (4d6) fire damage, demonstrating its exceptional offensive power. In addition to its bite, it can make two claw attacks, each providing 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage and another tail attack delivering 19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

The dragon's "Fire Breath" is a devastating ranged attack that can be unleashed in a 90-foot cone. Creatures caught in this fiery breath must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 105 (30d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on success. This attack is available once every few rounds, provided a recharge roll of 5 or 6 is successful.

Moreover, the dragon possesses legendary actions to manipulate the battlefield further. It can use "Detect" to pinpoint every creature and trap within 30 feet. With a "Tail Attack," it can deliver additional damage to a target. "Elemental Roar" allows the dragon to roar at two creatures within 120 feet, requiring them to make a DC 21 Charisma save or become vulnerable to fire damage for a turn. Lastly, the "Wing Attack" allows it to clear space around it, dealing damage and knocking opponents prone if they fail a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw.

In terms of environmental impact, the dragon creates regional effects that can lead to various hazards and dangers in its territory, persisting for a certain number of days after its death. Overall, the Ancient Red Dragon is a powerful and iconic monster, with abilities that can deeply influence encounters in any Dungeons & Dragons campaign.
