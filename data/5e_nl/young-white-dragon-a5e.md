The Young White Dragon is a formidable creature that represents the powerful and often feared nature of dragonkind. This large dragon features a high Armor Class of 17 and boasts an impressive pool of Hit Points totaling 152. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it is suitable for mid-level adventurers who may find themselves in peril when facing this icy predator. Its strengths lie primarily in its robust Constitution and strong attack capabilities, while it can easily navigate through icy environments due to its special abilities. However, its average Dexterity and low Intelligence may leave it susceptible to certain tactics from clever opponents. The dragon is proficient in various skills such as perception and history, and its immunities to cold damage make it an exceptionally resilient foe in wintry conditions.

The Young White Dragon has a unique immunity to cold damage, which makes it especially dangerous in icy terrains. Its senses are sharp; it has blindsight at 30 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, granting it an effective passive Perception score of 18. The creature can communicate in Common and Draconic, enabling it to interact with adventurers and other beings.

Special abilities include Cold Mastery, allowing the dragon to navigate freely through cold environments without challenges. This includes burrowing through snow and ice without leaving traces. The dragon also possesses innate spellcasting abilities, with a spellcasting ability based on Charisma (save DC 13), allowing it to cast animal friendship and sleet storm three times each per day without needing material components.

In combat, the Young White Dragon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to bite once and slash with its claws twice during its turn. The Bite action is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, having a reach of 10 feet, dealing significant damage of 20 (3d10 + 4) piercing damage in addition to 4 (1d8) cold damage on a hit. The Claw attack also carries a +8 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet and dealing 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

Additionally, it can unleash a Cold Breath attack that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This powerful attack allows the dragon to exhale a freezing cone extending 30 feet, dealing 35 (10d6) cold damage to all creatures within. Victims can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to mitigate damage, taking half on a successful save. This powerful and versatile attack can greatly sway the tide of battle against unprepared foes.
