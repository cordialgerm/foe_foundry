The Kobold Empyrean is an extraordinary creature representing a blend of celestial and draconic powers, embodying the virtues of dragons and serving as a source of strength and inspiration for other kobolds. This small celestial being thrives in combat and supports its allies on the battlefield, all the while possessing formidable defenses and a unique array of abilities. With its robust armor class of 18 and significant hit points totaling 150, the Empyrean is well-equipped to withstand attacks, making it a stalwart presence. However, while its melee and magical attacks are powerful, they are somewhat limited by its reliance on situational effects and the nature of its actions. The creature excels in supporting its kin, providing advantages and moments of inspiration, but it may be vulnerable if isolated from its allies.

The Kobold Empyrean has the following attributes: Strength 19 (+4, very good), Dexterity 18 (+4, very good), Constitution 18 (+4, very good), Intelligence 17 (+3, good), Wisdom 20 (+5, exceptional), and Charisma 18 (+4, very good). Its saving throws are impressive, with Constitution +8, Wisdom +9, and Charisma +8, indicating a strong ability to resist various effects. The creature has a perception skill modifier of +5, indicating an average ability to notice details. It is immune to radiant damage and has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Additionally, it cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, or poisoned, making it extremely resilient against many debilitating conditions. Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 19, providing it excellent awareness of its surroundings. The Kobold Empyrean can communicate in all languages and has telepathy that extends to 120 feet.

The Empyrean's special abilities significantly enhance its effectiveness in battle. The Aura of Draconic Virtue grants kobolds within a 30-foot range advantage on attack rolls and ability checks. This ability can be selectively applied, as the Empyrean can choose to exclude any number of kobolds from this aura at the beginning of its turn without using an action. The Elemental Weapons ability makes its weapon attacks magical and allows it to deal an additional 3d8 of a chosen elemental damage type such as acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. The Empyrean has an Immortal Nature, meaning it does not require food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to continue its duties indefinitely. Furthermore, it possesses Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its defensive capabilities.

For actions, the Empyrean has a multiattack option that consists of three claw attacks and the ability to replace one of these with Divine Command. A single claw attack has a +8 to hit with a range of 5 feet, dealing 7 (1d6+4) slashing damage plus an additional 13 (3d8) of the Empyreanâ€™s chosen elemental damage. The Invoke the Dragon Gods action has a recharge period of 5 to 6 rounds and allows the Empyrean to exhale elemental energy in a 60-foot cone, dealing a total of 49 (14d6) damage of the chosen type with a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to take half damage. The Divine Command action targets a creature within the Aura of Draconic Virtue, allowing a kobold within that aura to make a weapon attack against the target as a reaction, effectively coordinating attacks. Additionally, the Invisibility ability lets the Empyrean turn invisible until it attacks or until concentration ends, meaning it can maintain stealth while planning its next move, with its worn or carried items also becoming invisible.

As a reaction, the Draconic Ascension ability allows the Kobold Empyrean to reincarnate any kobold it can see that has been reduced to 0 hit points, transforming them into a wyrmling dragon that reflects the virtues of the original kobold. This remarkable ability can be used to elevate up to two kobolds every hour, granting them a second chance at life in a powerful form, which can dramatically shift the tides of battle in favor of the kobold horde.

Overall, the Kobold Empyrean is a powerful and inspiring force among kobolds, enhancing their capabilities and standing tall in the face of adversity. With strong offensive capabilities, exceptional resilience, and the ability to boost its allies, this celestial creature is a formidable opponent and an invaluable ally.
