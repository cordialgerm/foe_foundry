Naina is a large, lawful evil dragon characterized by her cunning and formidable presence. With an Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 231, Naina can withstand considerable damage while delivering devastating attacks. Her strengths lie in her powerful physique with a Strength of 20 and Constitution of 21, making her very good at grappling opponents and resisting physical damage. Coupled with her ability to resist nonmagical attacks, Naina proves to be a challenging foe. Nevertheless, her weaknesses include being vulnerable to magical attacks and her reliance on her effective breath weapons and spellcasting for crowd control. Naina's Challenge Rating of 11 indicates she presents a significant threat to adventurers, providing a unique mix of melee combat and spell-based manipulation.

Naina possesses the following attributes: 

- Strength: 20, with a modifier of +5, categorized as very good, making her extremely potent in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity: 16, with a modifier of +3, considered good, which aids her in dodging attacks and enhancing her agility.
- Constitution: 21, with a modifier of +5, also very good, supporting her high durability and stamina in battles.
- Intelligence: 15, with a modifier of +2, average for a dragon of her status, representing a decent level of cunning.
- Wisdom: 18, with a modifier of +4, which is very good, allowing her to pick up on subtle cues and resist mental effects.
- Charisma: 18, also with a modifier of +4, which is very good, enhancing her skills in social interactions and spellcasting.

For Saving Throws, she has bonuses of +7 to Dexterity, +9 to Constitution, +8 to Wisdom, and +8 to Charisma, indicating good resilience against various threats. Her skills include Deception, Insight, Perception, and Persuasion, all at +8, which makes her exceptionally capable in social and perceptive situations.

Naina is immune to poison damage, resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing, and is also immune to paralysis, poison, and unconsciousness. She has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and a passive Perception of 18, further enhancing her ability to perceive threats.

In her Special Abilities, Naina has "Sense Magic," which allows her to detect magic within a 120-foot radius at will, functioning similarly to the detect magic spell but not being inherently magical.

Regarding her Actions, Naina can make a Multiattack, allowing her to either deliver one Bite attack along with two Claw attacks, or she can opt for three Slam attacks. Each of her physical attacks carries significant damage: the Bite and Claw attacks each inflict 24 damage (3d12 + 5), while the Slam attack does 23 damage (4d8 + 5) in her humanoid form.

Naina's formidable Breath Weapons can be used once she recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. She has three kinds of breath attacks: 

- "Poison Breath" allows her to exhale poison in a 60-foot cone, requiring affected creatures to succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw to avoid taking 40 poison damage (9d8) and being poisoned for 1 minute. If successful, the damage is halved, and they avoid being poisoned.
- "Paralysis Breath," a 30-foot cone, forces creatures to succeed on the same DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute, repeatable at the end of their turns to attempt to break free.
- "Sleep Breath" affects creatures within 20 feet with a DC 17 Constitution saving throw; failed attempts lead to falling unconscious for 10 minutes unless they take damage or another creature wakes them up.

In terms of spellcasting, Naina can cast spells without material components, utilizing her Charisma for spell saving (DC 16). Her at-will spells include charm person, dancing lights, and silent image, offering not just combat utility but also creation and manipulation. She can cast dispel magic, hypnotic pattern, and invisibility three times a day each, balancing offense and defense techniques. Her daily spells, including dimension door and dominate person, emphasize her ability to control the battlefield and manipulate foes.

As a Bonus Action, Naina can utilize "Change Shape" to transform into a Medium Humanoid or revert back to her true dragon form, maintaining her statistics despite the change in size. Equipment she carries will not alter with her form but reverts to dragon form upon her death.
