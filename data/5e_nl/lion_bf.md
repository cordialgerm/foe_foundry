The lion is a large beast known for its strength and agility, often serving as a formidable predator in its environment. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers. Its notable features include heightened senses and the ability to coordinate attacks effectively with allies due to its Pack Tactics ability. The lion's high movement speed of 50 feet allows it to close distances quickly, making it a dangerous foe in a skirmish. While it possesses decent defenses with an Armor Class of 12 and solid hit points totaling 42, the lion's weaknesses lie in its low Intelligence score and limited magical abilities, resulting in average survivability against more cunning adversaries.

The lion has several key attributes: Strength at +3, Dexterity at +2, Constitution at +1, Intelligence at -4, Wisdom at +1, and Charisma at -1. This distribution gives the lion good physical prowess and moderate agility, while its Intelligence and Charisma scores reflect its lack of complex thought and social skills. Its Perception score is 13, indicating average awareness, while its Stealth score is particularly high at 16, showing that it can be quite sneaky. 

The lion's special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness. Heightened Smell allows it to perceive things with a total Perception score of 18 when using smell, greatly improving its tracking capabilities. Pack Tactics grants the lion advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is within 5 feet, providing a significant tactical advantage in group battles. The Pounce ability enables the lion to knock targets prone with a successful attack after a 20-foot move, creating opportunities for additional attacks. Additionally, Running Leap allows the lion to make impressive long jumps with a 10-foot run, enhancing its mobility during encounters.

For its actions, the lion can perform a Multiattack, making one Bite and one Claws attack in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage on a successful hit, which represents a good damage output. The Claws attack has the same +5 to hit and deals 6 slashing damage, which also qualifies as a good amount of damage against targets.

As a bonus action, the lion can use Rattling Roar, which has a recharge mechanic that activates on a roll of 4 to 6. This roar affects all creatures within a 15-foot cone, forcing them to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in disadvantage on their attack rolls until the end of their next turn, which can significantly impact the effectiveness of opposing attackers in an encounter.
