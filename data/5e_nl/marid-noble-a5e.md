The Marid Noble is a powerful large elemental creature, known for its dominion over water and its majestic presence. It has a high armor class of 17, making it fairly difficult to hit, while boasting an impressive pool of hit points totaling 344, derived from 30d10 plus an additional 180. With a challenge rating of 11, it is a formidable opponent capable of dealing significant damage in combat, especially with its unique spellcasting abilities and a versatile range of attacks. The Marid Noble excels in both aquatic and aerial environments, as it can swim at a speed of 90 feet and fly at 60 feet. Despite its strengths, it has weaknesses such as being vulnerable to certain magical effects despite its resistances to acid, cold, and lightning damage. 

The Marid Noble's attributes are defined by a strength score of 22 (+6, exceptional), contributing to its high melee damage capability. It has a dexterity score of 16 (+3, good), which aids in both attack rolls and evasiveness. The creature's constitution of 22 (+6, exceptional) indicates its resilience, while an intelligence score of 16 (+3, good) allows for a solid command of spellcasting. Charisma, its primary spellcasting ability, is also 16 (+3, good), allowing it to influence others and cast spells effectively. The Marid has saving throw bonuses that reflect its resilience and mental acuity: +10 Constitution, +7 Intelligence, +6 Wisdom, and +7 Charisma. In terms of skills, it excels in perception (+6, good) and persuasion (+7, good), indicating its prowess in both awareness and social interactions. 

The Marid's special abilities greatly enhance its versatility in combat and exploration. The amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, making it well-suited for various environments. With innate spellcasting reliant on Charisma, the Marid can cast numerous spells without the need for material components. It can cast spells such as "alter self" to change its form, "create or destroy water" for utility, and "detect magic" for awareness of magical phenomena at will. Additionally, spells like "control water" and "creation" can be cast three times per day, while it can summon a water elemental or shift to the Elemental Plane of Water just once per day. 

In combat, the Marid Noble can execute a multiattack, making two trident attacks, one of which can be substituted for a net attack. The trident attack has a +10 to hit and inflicts an average of 13 piercing damage alongside an additional 5 lightning damage. If the trident is thrown, it magically returns to the Marid's hand, making it a reliable weapon. The net attack can restrain a target, requiring an action and a successful DC 18 Strength check to escape. The net itself is a fragile object, easily destroyed by slashing damage but immune to other forms of damage. 

As a bonus action, the Marid Noble can create a "Fog Cloud" once a day, obscuring vision within a 30-foot radius, providing tactical advantages in battle. Furthermore, while bloodied, it can unleash a powerful "Water Jet" attack in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line, forcing creatures caught within it to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 21 bludgeoning damage and a forced push of 20 feet away, knocking the target prone, while success mitigates the damage to half. These abilities combined make the Marid Noble a strategic and formidable presence on the battlefield, capable of controlling the fight and adapting to varying combat situations.
