The Phase Giant is a formidable creature classified as a Huge, neutral giant. Its notable strengths include high hit points, effective physical attacks, and the ability to shift between the Material and Ethereal Planes, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 15, it possesses a good defense derived from its natural armor. The giant's formidable Strength and Constitution values imply it is a powerful melee combatant, while its average Dexterity makes it somewhat less agile. Its challenge rating of 5 indicates that it can serve as a significant threat in battle while offering a rewarding experience for defeated players.

The Phase Giant's attributes are as follows: Strength is rated at 21 with a +5 modifier, which is considered exceptional and allows it to deal substantial melee damage. Dexterity is 11 with a +0 modifier, representing average agility, making it less effective in ranged combat. Constitution stands at 18 with a +4 modifier, providing it with a very good amount of hit points. Intelligence is low at 8 with a -1 modifier, indicating limited cognitive abilities, while Wisdom is fairly decent at 15 with a +2 modifier, allowing it to perceive its surroundings moderately well. Finally, Charisma is also low at 8 with a -1 modifier, suggesting poor social skills.

The Phase Giant possesses the Ethereal Jaunt special ability, which allows it to move as a bonus action from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane or the other way around. This shift renders it immune to physical attacks while in the Ethereal Plane, although any equipment it is carrying will move with it. However, if the giant is grappling a creature when it uses this ability, that creature is left behind, indicating a strategic combat advantage.

In terms of actions, the Phase Giant can execute a Multiattack, making two separate melee attacks with its spiked fists. If it successfully hits a Large or smaller target with both attacks, that target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or suffer an additional 7 (2d6) piercing damage as it is impaled on the giant's body spikes. The spiked fist attack itself has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it becomes grappled, with a DC 16 escape requirement. This grapple ability allows the Phase Giant to maintain control over opponents and inflict further damage.

Furthermore, the giant can employ a ranged attack known as Rock. This attack has a +8 to hit, with a range of 60/240 feet, and deals significant damage of 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. A creature hit by this attack must also make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can strategically incapacitate enemies and change the flow of battle.

Overall, the Phase Giant is a dangerous opponent in combat, capable of dealing heavy damage both at range and in melee, and utilizing its ethereal abilities to evade attacks or reposition itself in battle effectively.
