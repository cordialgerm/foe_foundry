The White Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable medium-sized dragon known for its icy innate abilities and ferocity in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, especially those unprepared for its cold attacks and tactical movement. Its strengths lie in its decent armor class of 16, offering good protection due to natural armor, and its mobility, which includes flying and swimming capabilities. It has a good pool of hit points totaling 54, allowing it to endure some damage in a fight. While its intelligence score is relatively low, its other abilities, such as a solid Constitution modifier of +4, indicate that it can endure physical confrontations well. However, it has a weak intelligence score of -3, which limits its capacity for strategic thinking or problem-solving outside of combat. 

Looking at the attributes, the White Dragon Wyrmling possesses a Strength of +2, Dexterity of +2, Constitution of +4, Intelligence of -3, Wisdom of +2, and Charisma of +2. The Constitution modifier is very good, enhancing its hit point total significantly, while its Dexterity and Strength are average, allowing for decent physical attacks. The Intelligence modifier is very bad, indicating poor cognitive capabilities, while Wisdom and Charisma are average. 

In terms of senses, the wyrmling has darkvision that extends 60 feet and exceptionally keen senses, which provide it an enhanced ability to detect creatures and navigate effectively in low-light conditions. It boasts a Perception skill score of 14, which is good, enhancing its awareness in its environment. The creature can also excel in stealth with a score of 12, enabling it to move quietly when needed. It speaks Draconic, allowing it to communicate with other dragons and certain spellcasters.

The Wyrmling has several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. Ice Walk allows it to traverse icy surfaces without hindrance, effectively rendering difficult terrains like snow and ice irrelevant to its movement. The Pounce ability lets the wyrmling launch an attack after a substantial charge, where if it successfully hits with its claws, it can knock the target prone if they fail a Strength saving throw against a DC of 12. While prone, the target becomes vulnerable to an additional claw attack, increasing the dragonâ€™s damage potential during combat.

When it comes to its actions, the White Dragon Wyrmling can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make one Bite attack and one Claw attack in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +4 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage plus an additional 2 cold damage. The Claw attack also has a +4 to hit and deals 5 slashing damage. 

Its signature ability is the Cold Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This powerful action lets the wyrmling exhale a chilling blast in a cone measuring 15 feet, forcing creatures within the area to make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 12. On a failed save, a creature takes a significant 22 cold damage (calculated as 5d8), or half damage if they succeed on the save. This ability not only deals substantial damage but can also control the battlefield by impacting the positioning and actions of enemies.

Overall, the White Dragon Wyrmling is a fearsome creature that combines mobility, damage-dealing capabilities, and battlefield control through its icy breath attacks. It is particularly dangerous to groups without adequate preparation against cold damage or positioned in places where they might be vulnerable to its abilities.
