The Razorfeather Raptor is a medium-sized monstrosity characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This creature serves as a cunning predator on the battlefield, capable of dealing significant damage while also impairing its foes' ability to maneuver. With an Armor Class of 16, it possesses good defensive capabilities due to its natural armor. Its Hit Points are 39, reflecting a moderate level of durability for a creature of its Challenge Rating of 2. The Razorfeather Raptor is very mobile with a walking speed of 40 feet, allowing it to engage quickly in combat. Its strengths lie in its Dexterity and Strength scores, which are good at 17 (+3) and 15 (+2) respectively, making it nimble and capable of dealing consistent damage. However, it has low Charisma and Intelligence scores, which makes it ineffective at social interactions and mental tasks.

The Razorfeather Raptor has a Dexterity saving throw modifier of +5, indicating a good ability to dodge or escape dangerous effects. It has an average Wisdom score of 12 (+1), which is useful for perception checks, but its skills in this area are limited, reflected by a perception modifier of +1. The creature can understand Common, but it lacks the ability to communicate verbally.

This raptor has two notable special abilities. The first is Pack Tactics, which grants it advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one other unincapacitated ally is within 5 feet of that target. This ability significantly enhances its effectiveness in group engagements. The second ability, Pounce, allows the raptor to knock a target prone if it charges at least 20 feet straight toward it and successfully hits with its Claw attack. If the target is knocked prone, the raptor can follow up with a Bladed Feather attack as a bonus action, further increasing its damage potential.

In combat, the Razorfeather Raptor can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bladed Feather attack and one Claw attack in a single turn. The Bladed Feather attack is a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +5 to hit and deals 8 (1d10+3) slashing damage. Additionally, if the attack hits, it reduces the target's speed by 10 feet until the end of their next turn, hindering their mobility. The Claw attack similarly has a +5 to hit and inflicts 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage, directly threatening its prey.

Overall, the Razorfeather Raptor is a formidable opponent that thrives in pack tactics, capable of executing rapid and damaging strikes while maintaining the pressure on its foes.
