The Imperial Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable creature often encountered in the realms of fantasy and adventure. This Medium-sized dragon embodies neutrality and possesses a strong combat presence, evidenced by its exceptional strength and resilience. With an Armor Class of 17, it is well-defended thanks to its natural armor, and its 60 hit points make it a durable foe in battle. The dragon's flight speed of 60 feet, combined with its swimming and walking speeds, allows for versatile movement in various environments. While it has solid offensive capabilities, particularly with its lightning breath, it has weaknesses in areas such as Dexterity, where it has only an average score. Its abilities include resistance to lightning and thunder damage, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers unprepared for elemental attacks.

The Imperial Dragon Wyrmling has impressive attributes with a Strength score of 19, giving it a +4 modifier, which is considered exceptional. Its Constitution score of 17 grants a +3 modifier, providing a good level of durability and hit points. Intelligence and Charisma are both decent at 14, resulting in +2 modifiers, offering effective spellcasting options. Dexterity and Wisdom are slightly below average, with scores of 12 and 12 respectively, giving them +1 modifiers, which are mostly sufficient for defense and perception.

The dragon has notable saving throws: +3 for Dexterity, +5 for Constitution, +3 for Wisdom, and +4 for Charisma. These values indicate good resilience against physical attacks, spell effects, and mental manipulations. The creature also possesses skills that enhance its effectiveness in gameplay, including a +3 in Insight, +5 in Perception, which is considered good, and a +3 in Stealth, indicating it can become a threat from the shadows.

One important special ability is its Amphibious nature, allowing it to breathe air and water, which opens up tactical options in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. The creature also has Innate Spellcasting, giving it the ability to cast fog cloud once per day without the need for material components. This spell creates a thick cloud of mist, obscuring vision and allowing for strategic repositioning during combat or escape from threats.

In terms of actions, the dragon's Bite attack has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 9 piercing damage, demonstrating consistent melee capabilities. Its most powerful option, Lightning Breath, recharges on a 5-6. This move enables the dragon to unleash a devastating 30-foot line of lightning that deals 22 lightning damage on a failed save (DC 13 Dexterity saving throw) or half damage on a successful one. This ability adds considerable area control and damage potential to the Imperial Dragon Wyrmling's arsenal, making it a fearsome adversary on the battlefield.
