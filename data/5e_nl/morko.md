Morko is a small fey creature embodying chaotic evil traits, thriving in deception and mischief. With a modest armor class of 12 and a total of 17 hit points, this creature is considered relatively weak and can be easily dispatched if caught off guard. However, its innate magical abilities and skills make it a cunning opponent. Morko has a Challenge Rating of 1/4, indicating it poses a minor threat to adventurers, typically rewarding 50 experience points upon defeat. Notable for its resistance to fire and poison damage, as well as its ability to manipulate its size, the Morko can create disruptive tactical advantages during encounters.

The Morko has a Strength score of 12, reflecting a good physical capability with a modifier of +1, which is somewhat effective. It boasts a Dexterity score of 15, providing a good modifier of +2, enhancing its agility and effectiveness in stealth maneuversâ€”especially since it has a significant stealth skill modifier of +6. The Constitution score is average at 11, providing no modifier, while its Intelligence is also average with a score of 12, giving a +1 modifier. Wisdom is at 10, which is average with no modifier, but the Charisma score is notably low at 8, imposing a -1 modifier that indicates a very bad effectiveness in social interactions reliant on charm.

Morko possesses a special ability called Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. This makes it more resilient to magical attacks, providing it a very good defense in combat situations involving spellcasters. 

For actions, Morko can make a spear attack that offers a +3 to hit, which is average, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet. Upon a successful hit, it deals either 4 piercing damage (1d6 + 1) for ranged attacks or 5 piercing damage (1d8 + 1) if using the spear two-handed. 

In addition to its physical attacks, Morko has unique abilities such as Disdainful Eye, which it can use after a recharge of 6. This ability allows Morko to fix its gaze upon a target within 30 feet, forcing the creature to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the target becoming cursed, suffering disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws based on Charisma until the curse is lifted through magic, making it a potent tool for manipulation.

Another ability, called Shrink, recharges after a short or long rest. This enables Morko to become Tiny for a minute, reducing the size of everything it carries or wears. While shrunken, Morko deals half damage with Strength-based weapon attacks, and it rolls with disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws, which can limit its effectiveness in physical confrontations. However, if there is limited space for the Morko to grow back, it still retains the ability to reach its maximum possible size within whatever confines it finds itself.

Overall, Morko serves as a tricky adversary, relying on magical resistance and cunning strategies to outmaneuver foes, making it a surprisingly challenging encounter in its own right despite its low hit points and damage thresholds.
