The Bone Golem is a medium-sized construct that embodies a formidable presence on the battlefield. With an armor class of 16 and a total of 60 hit points, it serves as a durable adversary for adventurers. The golem's challenge rating of 7 indicates that it poses a significant threat, making it suitable for encounters designed for mid-tier parties. Its strengths lie in its damage immunities to necrotic, poison, and psychic attacks, as well as resistances against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, unless the attack is made with adamantine. However, the Bone Golem has very poor intelligence and charisma, which limits its interactions beyond combat. Notably, it possesses several special abilities that can turn the tide in battle, such as the potential to go berserk when critically injured.

The Bone Golem has the following attributes: Strength of 10, Dexterity of 16, Constitution of 17, Intelligence of 3, Wisdom of 10, and Charisma of 1. Its Dexterity and Constitution scores grant it a good level of agility and resilience, while its intelligence and charisma scores are exceptionally low, indicating that it is not capable of complex thought or persuasion.

The Bone Golem has a range of special abilities that affect its behavior and durability in combat. It is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form due to its Immutable Form ability. Additionally, it has Magic Resistance, giving it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which enhances its durability against magic-based attacks. The Necrotic Absorption ability allows it to recover hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt to it, providing it with exceptional sustainability against necrotic attacks. 

The special ability called Berserk triggers when the Bone Golem's hit points drop to 30 or fewer. When this happens, the golem rolls a d6, and on a 6, it enters a berserk state. During this time, it becomes uncontrollable and will attack the nearest visible creature or an object if no creatures are nearby. If its creator is within 60 feet, they can attempt to calm it using a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, which, if successful, halts the berserk state; however, further damage while still low on health could re-trigger this ability.

The Bone Golem has a unique False Appearance ability, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings when motionless, making it difficult to discern from ordinary bones. 

In combat, the Bone Golem can execute various actions. It has a Multiattack ability, allowing it to make two attacks in a single turn. The Claw attack involves a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, reaching out to 5 feet to target foes with 10 slashing damage and an additional 7 necrotic damage. Additionally, the Bone Shard attack functions as a ranged weapon attack with a range of 60 feet and a maximum reach of 240 feet, also sporting a +6 to hit, inflicting 7 piercing damage and an extra 7 necrotic damage upon success. Both attacks exploit the bone golem's physical prowess and necrotic properties, making it a dangerous foe to face in combat.
