The Grim Jester is a Medium undead creature with a chaotic evil alignment, embodying both a whimsical and sinister presence. With an Armor Class of 18, it is relatively tough to hit due to its natural armor, and it has a substantial pool of Hit Points at 136, making it resilient in prolonged combat encounters. The creature possesses exceptional dexterity and charisma scores, allowing it to excel in stealth, deception, and performance. Its strengths lie in its ability to incapacitate foes with laughter, its spellcasting capability, and its ability to regenerate after death, which can make it a persistent foe in a campaign. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage and relies on clever tactics to navigate combat, making it less effective in straightforward melee engagements.

The Grim Jester's attributes include a Strength of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 22 (+6), Constitution of 18 (+4), Intelligence of 16 (+3), Wisdom of 16 (+3), and Charisma of 20 (+5). Its Dexterity modifier is exceptional, granting it high initiative and making it difficult to hit in combat. Its Constitution gives it good survivability, while its high Charisma enhances its spellcasting and social interactions, yielding a very good modifier for both Deception and Performance skills. The Grim Jester has saving throw bonuses of +10 for Dexterity, +8 for Constitution, and +9 for Charisma, indicating its proficiency in dodging effects that target these attributes.

Damage immunities include necrotic and poison damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, making it hard to harm with standard weapon attacks. It also has damage resistance to cold damage. The jester is immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned. Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 17, giving it strong awareness in low-light conditions. It can communicate in Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Gnomish, and has a telepathy range of 120 feet.

The Grim Jester has several notable special abilities: 

- **Last Laugh** allows it to regenerate its body within 1d20 days unless destroyed in a manner deemed amusing to its chaotic creator, restoring it to full health and activity.
- **Mock the Dying** imposes disadvantage on death saving throws for creatures within 60 feet, increasing their likelihood of failing to stabilize.
- **Turn Resistance** provides it with advantage on saving throws against effects that attempt to turn undead, enhancing its resilience against certain clerical spells.
- **Undead Nature** signifies that it doesn't require basic needs like food, air, water, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously.

In terms of actions, the Grim Jester can perform the following: 

- **Necrotic Claw** is a melee spell attack with a +9 to hit that deals 14 slashing damage along with an additional 14 necrotic damage on a hit, making it quite powerful for a close-range attack.
  
- **Killing Joke** allows the Grim Jester to tell an ancient joke to a target within 60 feet, forcing them to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated in laughter for 1 minute. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they are reduced to 0 hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking additional necrotic damage for failed attempts.

As for spellcasting, the Jester can cast spells without components, utilizing its Charisma for a spell save DC of 17. It has the ability to cast *disguise self* and *grease* at will, while it can cast *magic mouth* and *mirror image* up to three times per day. Additionally, once per day, it can cast *mislead* and *seeming*, providing it with versatile options for deception and battlefield control.

For bonus actions, the **Joker’s Shuffle** can be used once per six rounds. This ability enables the Grim Jester to switch positions with a Medium or smaller creature within 60 feet, instantly creating illusory duplicates of each other that last for one minute or until dismissed. The illusion can confuse opponents as they must succeed on a DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation) check to realize the swap has occurred.

Overall, the Grim Jester is a whimsical yet deadly adversary, capable of manipulating the battlefield through laughter and deception, while enjoying a variety of spells to enhance its tactical capabilities.
