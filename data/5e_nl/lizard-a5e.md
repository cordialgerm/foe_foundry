The Lizard is a tiny, unassuming beast often found in various environments, primarily thriving in wetlands and rocky terrains. While it has a low challenge rating, making it a very weak combatant, the Lizard's role is primarily that of an insignificant creature in the world, harmless and easily overlooked. Its strengths lie in its low profile and ability to evade detection due to its small size, while its weaknesses are pronounced contributions to its minimal combat effectiveness and low hit points. Notably, the Lizard has unique game mechanics that allow it to participate in the ecosystem as a prey animal, but it can also serve as a useful, if inconsequential, familiar or companion for low-level characters.

The Lizard has an Armor Class of 10, which is considered very bad, indicating it can be easily hit by attackers. With only 2 hit points, represented by a roll of 1d4, it is extremely fragile and can be defeated with a single successful hit. The Lizard's speed is moderate, allowing it to walk or climb at a pace of 20 feet per turn, facilitating movement through its environment.

Its ability scores are as follows: Strength is 2 with a modifier of -4, which is extremely bad, making it virtually incapable of performing physically demanding tasks. Dexterity is 10, offering an average modifier of +0, indicating it has normal reflexes but is neither particularly nimble nor clumsy. Constitution also sits at 10, providing an average modifier that reflects its general resilience. Intelligence is 2 with a modifier of -4, indicating very poor cognitive abilities, while Wisdom is average at 10, allowing for basic perceptiveness. Charisma is low at 4 with a modifier of -3, denoting an ineffective presence in social situations.

In terms of abilities, the Lizard has the following skills: none listed, meaning it lacks specialized proficiencies. It possesses darkvision with a range of 30 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, which enhances its ability to navigate nocturnal environments. The Lizard also has a passive Perception score of 10, signifying average awareness to detect nearby threats or stimuli.

The Lizard has one primary action: Bite. This is a melee weapon attack that uses the Lizard's Dexterity modifier for its attack roll, resulting in a total of +0 to hit. The reach of the bite is 5 feet, and it can target one creature. When it succeeds, the bite inflicts 1 piercing damage. Notably, if this damage would bring a Small or larger creature to 0 hit points, that creature takes no damage from the Lizard's attack, representing this creature's capacity to avoid significant confrontations with larger foes, further emphasizing its role as a non-threatening animal within its habitat.
