The Kobold Swiftblade is a small humanoid creature renowned for its agility and cunning in combat. With an Armor Class of 15 due to its leather armor, it is relatively hard to hit, although it has moderate durability with 80 hit points. It moves quickly on the ground with a speed of 30 feet and can climb at a rate of 15 feet, enhancing its mobility in various environments. The creature is rated at a Challenge Rating of 3, indicating that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. Its high Dexterity of +6 gives it exceptional competence in ranged and melee attacks, allowing it to strike with accuracy and deal significant damage using its weapons. However, its low Strength (-1) and average Constitution (+0) make it less effective in straightforward physical confrontations. Notably, the Kobold Swiftblade benefits from its Pack Tactics ability, which grants it advantage on attack rolls when its allies are near, making it particularly deadly in groups. Conversely, its Sunlight Sensitivity exposes it to disadvantages while in bright light, reducing its effectiveness in daylight encounters.

The Kobold Swiftblade has the following ability scores: Strength -1 (very bad), Dexterity +6 (exceptional), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence +1 (average), Wisdom +2 (good), and Charisma +0 (average). Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a Perception score of 12, which allows it to detect hidden threats and ambushes competently. With a Stealth score of 16, it is quite adept at remaining unseen, crucial for its role as a sneaky attacker. The creature can communicate in Common and Draconic, giving it basic conversational abilities.

In terms of special abilities, the Kobold Swiftblade has Pack Tactics, which means it gains advantage on attacks against a target if an ally is within 5 feet, enhancing its effectiveness in battle by increasing the likelihood of successful hits. However, its Sunlight Sensitivity is a significant drawback, as it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls in bright light, drastically reducing its combat ability during the day.

During combat, the Kobold Swiftblade can make two attacks with either its scimitar or hand crossbow due to its Multiattack feature. When using the Scimitar, it has a +6 to hit, and if successful, it deals 7 slashing damage plus an additional 7 poison damage from the attack, combining for a total potential average damage of 14 if both hit. With its Hand Crossbow, it also has a +6 to hit, dealing a similar amount of damage with a different range, making it versatile at both short and long distances. 

As a bonus action, the Kobold Swiftblade can use Hidden Scurry to move up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, allowing for strategic repositioning in combat. If it moves into an obscured area, it can then take the Hide action, utilizing its Stealth score to potentially avoid detection. It also has a unique capability to choose whether its movement triggers any traps it might be aware of, further emphasizing its cunning nature. 

Overall, the Kobold Swiftblade excels at ambushing and flanking opponents, making it a fearsome foe in grouped encounters while simultaneously possessing vulnerabilities when exposed to bright light.
