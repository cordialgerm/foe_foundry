The Swarm of Vampire Blossoms is a menacing and unique creature that embodies the traits of a large, unaligned plant. Its primary role lies in its ability to manipulate the battlefield through an array of strong offensive capabilities while simultaneously exhibiting several defensive traits. The swarm is particularly notable for its advantage in attacking weakened foes, making it especially dangerous in protracted encounters. With a decent amount of hit points at 82, the swarm can endure a fair amount of damage, but its low Strength and moderate Constitution indicate significant vulnerabilities to overpowering physical attacks. The challenge rating of 3 suggests that it poses a moderate threat to parties at lower levels, granting 700 experience points upon defeat.

The Swarm of Vampire Blossoms has the following attributes: Strength 3 (very bad), Dexterity 19 (exceptional), Constitution 14 (good), Intelligence 3 (very bad), Wisdom 14 (good), and Charisma 13 (average). Its Dexterity allows it to move quickly and dodge attacks, making it a hard target to hit, while its Constitution provides a medium-level resilience against damage. The swarm has saving throws in Charisma with a modifier of +3, which is considered average. Perception is bolstered with a +2 modifier, reinforcing its ability to sense its surroundings.

This creature benefits from several inherent immunities and resistances: it is immune to psychic damage, making it highly effective against opponents that rely on mental attacks. It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, allowing it to soak up physical harm. Additionally, it cannot be affected by conditions such as charmed, frightened, grappling, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, or stunned, making it exceptionally difficult to control or manipulate in combat.

The special abilities of the Swarm of Vampire Blossoms include Blood Frenzy, Blood Sense, False Appearance, and its Swarm ability. Blood Frenzy grants the swarm advantageous conditions when attacking creatures who are not at full hit points, effectively making it more lethal as foes are injured. Blood Sense allows it to locate any creature nearby that is not a construct or undead, with the range of 30 feet; however, it remains fundamentally blind without this ability. The False Appearance ability allows the swarm to blend in seamlessly with its environment when motionless, appearing as a harmless carpet of flower petals. The Swarm ability permits it to occupy the same space as another creature and move through small openings, although it cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

In terms of offensive actions, the Swarm can use Petal Slashes, a melee weapon attack that has a +6 to hit. This attack inflicts 18 (4d8) slashing damage, or 9 (2d8) slashing damage if it is at or below half its hit points. A successful hit forces the target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; a failed save reduces the target's maximum hit points by the damage taken, lasting until the target completes a long rest. If this reduction causes the target's maximum hit points to reach zero, the creature dies. This ability adds an extra layer of danger to the swarm, making encounters with it life-threatening, especially for characters with limited healing capabilities.
