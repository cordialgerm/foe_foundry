The Quasit is a tiny fiend notable for its cunning and deceptive abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it is relatively weak compared to larger foes, making it an excellent opponent for low-level adventurers. Its key strengths lie in its high Dexterity and damage immunities and resistances, which allow it to evade attacks and endure combat more effectively. The Quasit specializes in stealth and trickery, making it an adept ambush attacker. However, it has low health points and minimal physical strength, rendering it vulnerable in direct confrontations, especially against characters with strong physical attacks or area-of-effect spells.

The Quasit has an Armor Class of 13, indicating it has average defensive capabilities. It possesses 14 hit points, derived from rolling 4d4 plus an additional 4, which provides it with a moderate buffer in combat. The creature has a walking speed of 40 feet, allowing it to navigate quickly in and out of combat situations. 

In terms of abilities, the Quasitâ€™s Strength score is 5, which provides a very bad modifier of -3, reflecting its inability to perform physical tasks that require brute force. Its Dexterity score, however, is 16, resulting in a good modifier of +3, making it nimble and hard to hit. The Constitution is 12, yielding an average +1 modifier, which gives the Quasit some resilience. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma all have scores of 10, 12, and 12 respectively, with Charisma granting it an average +1 modifier that impacts its interactions and spellcasting.

The Quasit is proficient in the Stealth skill with a total modifier of +5, which gives it a good ability to remain hidden from enemies. It is immune to poison damage and is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as damage from nonmagical weapons. Additionally, it is immune to the poisoned condition, enhancing its survivability. With darkvision extending to 120 feet, the Quasit can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, making it exceptionally skilled in low-light environments. It understands Abyssal and Common, allowing for communication with various creatures.

Among its notable special abilities, the Quasit radiates a Chaotic Evil aura, emphasizing its malevolent nature. It also possesses Magic Resistance, providing it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it particularly challenging for spellcasters.

The Quasit's actions include its Claws attack, where it makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. If successful, it deals 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage and forces the target to succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. 

In addition, it can use its Scare ability while in its true form. A creature within 20 feet that can see the Quasit must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in the creature being frightened for 1 minute, with repeated saving throws allowed at the end of its turns. If a creature succeeds on the save or if the frightened condition ends for it, the creature becomes immune to the Quasit's Scare for the next 24 hours.

The Quasit can also utilize its Shapeshift ability, which allows it to transform into a bat (speed 10 ft., fly 40 ft.), centipede (40 ft., climb 40 ft.), or toad (40 ft., swim 40 ft.) while retaining its statistics minus the movement speed changes. It reverts to its true form upon death or can shift back whenever it wishes. 

In terms of bonus actions, the Quasit can turn invisible magically, along with any equipment it carries, maintaining stealth until it attacks or falls unconscious. This invisibility grants it exceptional tactical advantages, allowing for surprise strikes or escapes.
