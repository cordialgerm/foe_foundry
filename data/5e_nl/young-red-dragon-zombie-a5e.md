The Young Red Dragon Zombie is a formidable Large Undead creature, embodying the terrifying aspects of both dragons and the undead. It possesses a strong combination of durability and offensive capabilities, boasting an impressive 178 hit points and a high Armor Class of 16. While it lacks agility due to a low Dexterity score, its exceptional Strength and Constitution make it a powerhouse in combat, capable of delivering powerful attacks and taking substantial damage. However, its intelligence and charisma are markedly low, suggesting a creature driven by instinct rather than cunning. This makes the Young Red Dragon Zombie a dangerous but straightforward adversary, particularly in environments where its fire-based abilities can be fully utilized. 

The Young Red Dragon Zombie has several noteworthy attributes. It has a Strength of 22, which gives it a very good attack modifier of +6, allowing it to impose significant physical damage in combat. Its Dexterity is notably low at 6, reflecting a bad modifier of -2, meaning it struggles with agility and dodging attacks. The Constitution of 20 provides an exceptional +5 modifier, contributing to its high hit point total, making it resilient. The creature's Intelligence sits at a mere 3, yielding a very bad modifier of -4, indicating almost no strategic reasoning capability. Wisdom is also low at 8, with a bad modifier of -1, limiting its perceptual awareness. Finally, it has a Charisma of 4, resulting in a very bad modifier of -3, which means it cannot engage meaningfully in social interactions.

In terms of special abilities, the Young Red Dragon Zombie has two notable features. The first, Undead Fortitude, allows it to potentially avoid being destroyed. If this creature is brought to 0 hit points through non-radiant damage or non-critical hits, it instead drops to 1 hit point, falls prone, and becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, which can create an illusion of defeat. This ability can change the dynamics of combat, allowing it to keep fighting longer than anticipated. The second ability, Undead Nature, provides that it does not require air, food, or sleep, indicating that it can operate indefinitely without the needs typical of living creatures.

In terms of actions, the Young Red Dragon Zombie has a Multiattack feature that allows it to make multiple strikes in a single turn. It can attack once with its bite, which has a +10 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 22 piercing damage and an additional 4 fire damage on a hit. With its claws, it can make two attacks that also carry a +10 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 15 slashing damage per strike. 

Notably, its Fire Breath ability is particularly devastating. When it uses this attack, it exhales a thrashing cone of flames that reaches out for 30 feet. Creatures within the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw; those who fail take 52 fire damage (rolling 15d6) and suffer ongoing fire damage of 5 (1d10) until they take an action to extinguish it, along with the frightening effect from being affected by the initial damage. This potent combination of damage and fear can heavily influence the course of a battle, providing both a powerful area-of-effect attack and psychological control over opponents.
