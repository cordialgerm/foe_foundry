The Giant Mongoose is a Medium-sized beast that serves as a clever and agile creature in any environment it inhabits. With a focus on speed and dexterity, it makes an exceptional scout or ambush predator. The creature has a respectable Armor Class of 13, complemented by its ability to resist poison damage and immunity to being poisoned. Although its hit points total just 13, it compensates for this with a notable speed of 30 feet and exceptional dexterity. The mongoose excels at stealth, boasting a very good stealth skill modifier, allowing it to slip past potential threats with ease. However, its low intelligence and charisma scores imply that it is not capable of complex problem-solving or persuasion. Overall, the Giant Mongoose is primarily a nimble and stealthy creature that can deal significant damage through its bite, while also being difficult to hit due to its evasive maneuvers.

The Giant Mongoose has the following attributes and modifiers: 

- Strength: 10, which is average and poses no significant advantages in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity: 16, which is rated as very good, allowing the mongoose to have highly effective attacks and defense through evasion.
- Constitution: 14, which is good and provides the mongoose with a solid pool of hit points.
- Intelligence: 3, which is very bad and indicates a lack of cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 14, rated as good, giving the mongoose perceptive abilities necessary for survival.
- Charisma: 7, which is very bad and not useful for social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Giant Mongoose has a +4 in both Constitution and Wisdom saving throws, indicating a good chance of resisting effects that require those attributes. It has an athletics skill modifier of +2, which is average, and an exceptional stealth bonus of +5, making it very proficient at avoiding detection. The creature possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in dark conditions up to 60 feet and has a passive perception of 10, making it somewhat observant.

The Giant Mongoose has a notable special ability called Keen Hearing and Smell. This ability grants the mongoose advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on either hearing or smell. This means it can detect nearby creatures or hazards more effectively than average creatures, making it a valuable asset for scouting.

When it comes to actions in combat, the Giant Mongoose can perform a Bite attack. This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, which is effective, and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to target one foe. If it successfully hits, the bite inflicts 6 piercing damage (calculated as 1d6 + 3), which can pose a significant threat to smaller or weaker creatures.

In terms of reactions, the Giant Mongoose features a Defensive Roll ability. This allows the mongoose to add its Athletics modifier to its Armor Class against a single attack that would hit it, provided it can see the attacker. This ability adds a critical layer of survivability by temporarily boosting its defenses, especially useful in tight situations where evasion can mean the difference between life and death.
