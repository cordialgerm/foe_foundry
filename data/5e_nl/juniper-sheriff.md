Noteworthy special abilities of the Juniper Sheriff include the Aura of Honesty, which creates an area of influence extending 10 feet from it. Creatures entering this area for the first time on a turn or starting their turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become unable to speak a deliberate lie until they move more than 10 feet away. This effect promotes genuine communication and ensures the sheriff is aware of any creatures affected. The Sheriff’s Duty makes the Juniper Sheriff aware of any lies it hears, and it cannot speak lies itself. Additionally, its Unfailing Memory allows it to remember every creature that has ever spoken to it, providing it with advantage on checks to identify or recognize creatures it has encountered before, even if they are polymorphed or disguised.

On a hit, it deals an average of 8 psychic damage (2d4+3) and inflicts disadvantage on the target's next saving throw against the sheriff's Aura of Honesty for the next minute, making it harder for the creature to avoid the effects of the truth-enforcing aura.

As a bonus action, the Juniper Sheriff can utilize Hop Away to take the Dash or Disengage action, allowing it to reposition itself effectively during encounters. This combination of abilities, attributes, and actions makes the Juniper Sheriff a compelling character with a unique role in any party or campaign, particularly when truth and deception are central themes.
