The Lantern Hagfish is a small aberration that serves as a unique adversary in aquatic or void-themed encounters. With an Armor Class of 11 and a mere 9 Hit Points, it is relatively fragile compared to other creatures in its challenge rating of 1/8. However, its resistance to several conditions, along with special abilities that allow it to manipulate its environment, makes it a tricky foe. The Lantern Hagfish's bioluminescent slime not only provides illumination but also enhances its combat effectiveness when partnered with other hagfish, reflecting its tactical potential in groups. Its ability to move effortlessly through the Void and ability to burrow into prey adds layers to its combat strategy, making it an effective ambush predator in the right conditions. 

The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength is -4 (very bad), Dexterity is +1 (average), Constitution is +0 (average), Intelligence is -4 (very bad), Wisdom is +0 (average), and Charisma is -5 (very bad). This combination suggests that the Lantern Hagfish is not physically strong but possesses a degree of agility. Its resilience makes it hard to control in a fight, though its damage output and intelligence are low, limiting its strategic options.

The special abilities of the Lantern Hagfish include Aberrant Resilience, which gives it resistance to charm, frighten, paralyze, and stun conditions, as well as advantage on saving throws against spells that would alter its form. This resilience makes it a difficult creature to incapacitate. Its Bioluminescent Slime ability allows it to shed light between 5 to 20 feet, either aiding visibility or creating tactical advantages when fighting alongside other hagfish since it gains advantage on attack rolls against enemies that are near allied hagfish. Additionally, the Void Traveler ability enables the hagfish to survive in the Void or similar environments without needing air or sleep, making it highly versatile in cosmic explorations. Its Void Swimmer ability allows it to swim through the Void as if it were water, showcasing its adaptation to alien environments.

In terms of actions, the Lantern Hagfish has the Bite attack, which functions as a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it does 3 piercing damage, and if the target is prone and not a Construct or Undead, the hagfish can burrow into its flesh, causing 3 damage each turn as it consumes its prey from the inside. This mechanic allows it to inflict continuous damage while attached and provides a layer of strategy as opponents must act to remove the burrowed hagfish before it fully consumes them.

Its bonus action is the Slime Slide, which allows it to slide up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. The path it takes becomes coated in slime, causing any creature that crosses it to make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. This can effectively control movement on the battlefield and create hazards that adversaries must navigate around.

Overall, the Lantern Hagfish offers both tactical challenges and thematic depth, making it a noteworthy creature in the right campaign settings, especially those involving aquatic adventures or encounters in the Void.
