The Ancient Aboleth is a formidable aberration primarily characterized by its immense size and psychic abilities. As a huge creature, it boasts a high armor class of 17 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 342, making it exceptionally durable in combat. With a challenge rating of 11, the Aboleth poses a significant threat to adventurers, especially due to its capability to manipulate weaker minds and severely afflict them through its diseases and psychic attacks. Its amphibious nature allows it to thrive in both water and air, enhancing its versatility on the battlefield. While it boasts impressive intelligence and wisdom that exceed average levels, its dexterity is only average, meaning its physical dexterity is less noteworthy compared to its mental faculties. The Aboleth can effectively attack in close range with its tentacles and utilizes insidious spells and abilities to hinder opponents while bolstering its own position, making it a dangerous adversary for any party.

The Ancient Aboleth has the following attributes with specific modifiers: Strength of 20 (+5), Dexterity of 12 (+1), Constitution of 18 (+4), Intelligence of 20 (+5), Wisdom of 20 (+5), and Charisma of 18 (+4). The saving throw modifiers for this creature are Dex +5, Con +8, Int +9, and Wis +9, representing a very good level of resilience against spells and physical effects. Skills such as deception and history show its capability to manipulate and outsmart foes, with bonuses of +8 and +9, respectively. The creature's blindsight out to 30 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet make it a formidable hunter in both bright and dark environments, and its passive perception of 15 allows it to detect hidden threats effectively. It communicates using Deep Speech and has telepathy extending 120 feet, granting it the ability to share thoughts with nearby creatures.

The Ancient Aboleth possesses several special abilities. Its amphibious trait allows it to breathe in both air and water, providing versatility in aquatic settings. It can innately cast spells using its Charisma with a spell save DC of 16. The spells it can cast three times per day include: 
- Detect Thoughts, which allows it to sense the thoughts of creatures within 120 feet,
- Project Image, enabling it to create a visual image of itself anywhere within a mile, and 
- Phantasmal Force, which can manipulate the perceptions of its foes, potentially causing them mental harm if they fail their saving throws.

In combat, the Ancient Aboleth features a multiattack action, permitting it to strike three times with its tentacle. The tentacle attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, and inflicts (4d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, totaling 19 damage on a successful hit. Should it choose, the Aboleth can deal no damage but inflict its infected target with the Sea Change disease, demanding a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in a debilitating effect where the target suffers disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and ultimately requires water to avoid suffocation. This disease is particularly insidious, as it creates a feeling of desperation in affected characters and can alter their playstyle significantly.

The Ancient Aboleth also has a devastating ability called Slimy Cloud, which it can use once per day while bloodied. This ability releases a cloud of inky slime in a 30-foot radius underwater, forcing non-Aboleth creatures in the area to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 44 (8d10) poison damage and become poisoned for one minute, creating challenging conditions that cloud visibility and hamper movement.

Finally, the Aboleth has an array of legendary actions that enhance its already formidable combat presence. It can take up to two legendary actions per turn—only one of each type may be used at the end of another creature’s turn. The move action allows it to swim up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. The Telepathic Summon ability is a magical charm effect whereby a creature within 90 feet must save against DC 16 Wisdom to avoid being compelled to move towards the Aboleth. Baleful Charm targets a creature affected by Sea Change, allowing the Aboleth to enchant it until it dies, while the Soul Drain action allows it to harm a charmed creature, healing itself for the damage inflicted. The Elite Recovery action enables it to remove one negative effect from itself, showing its resilience in prolonged combat. The Look Upon My Works action creates psychic damage while potentially imparting knowledge, showcasing its ability to confuse and interfere with the minds of adventurers. Lastly, the Lunging Attack combines movement with a tentacle strike, adding to its offensive capabilities.

In summary, the Ancient Aboleth serves as a potent adversary with a mix of physical attacks, disease-inflicting abilities, and powerful psychic manipulations, making it a terrifying challenge for any adventuring party.
