The War Wyvern is a formidable large dragon creature that operates independently, often serving as a powerful adversary in combat encounters. With a notable challenge rating of 7, it embodies significant physical strength and resilience, showcasing high hit points and effective attack capabilities. The War Wyvern has excellent mobility, able to fly up to 80 feet and walk 20 feet, giving it a tactical advantage in the air. Its primary attributes include a strength score of 20, resulting in a good modifier of +5, and a constitution score of 16, giving it a good +3 modifier, contributing to its durability in battle. However, the wyvern has a low intelligence and charisma, resulting in very bad modifiers of -2 for both, which limits its capability for complex interactions and strategizing beyond physical combat. 

The War Wyvern has an Armor Class of 15, which provides a good defense against enemy attacks. It has a total of 119 hit points calculated from 14d10 + 42, demonstrating a very good endurance in prolonged encounters. The wyvern possesses effective saving throws, particularly with a Wisdom saving throw of +5. Additionally, it shows a high skill in both athletics (+8) and perception (+5), which further enhances its combat effectiveness and situational awareness.

One of the War Wyvern's notable abilities is its status as a Siege Monster, allowing it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it a devastating foe in battles involving fortifications or siege warfare.

In combat, the War Wyvern uses a multiattack feature, allowing it to make two attacks in a single turn: one with its bite and one with its stinger. It can also use its claws as an alternative attack while flying. The bite attack has a +8 to hit and deals an average of 12 piercing damage paired with an additional 10 poison damage from a successful hit. The claws attack also has a +8 to hit and can deal a significant amount of damage â€“ an average of 18 slashing damage, while grappling the target with an escape DC of 16, restricting their movement until they escape. The stinger attack also has +8 to hit and deals 12 piercing damage. If the target fails a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, it suffers an additional 24 poison damage, which can be halved on a successful save.

The Wyvern also has a special ability known as Spit Venom, which can be used once it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the War Wyvern to spit venom at a target within 60 feet, requiring the target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in 42 poison damage, which can also be halved on a successful save, showcasing the Wyvern's capacity for significant ranged damage.

Overall, the War Wyvern is a dangerous and robust creature, adept at physical confrontations and with the ability to deliver grievous damage both in melee and at range. It presents a considerable threat to adventurers who oppose it, particularly in scenarios where it can leverage its mobility and devastating poison effects effectively.
