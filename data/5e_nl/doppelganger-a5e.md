The Doppelganger is a Medium monstrosity known for its remarkable abilities to mimic and deceive. Functioning as both a combatant and an infiltrator, it possesses a high dexterity and charisma, allowing it to excel in stealth and deception. With an Armor Class of 14, it has a decent level of defense, while its 52 hit points provide it with a fair amount of endurance in combat. The creature is classified with a Challenge Rating of 3, indicating it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. While its melee attacks are potent, particularly when hitting surprised targets, its true strength lies in its shapeshifting and mind-reading abilities, making it a formidable opponent in both direct confrontation and more subtle scenarios. However, its average physical strength and low constitution might be considered weaknesses in prolonged fighting situations.

The Doppelganger has the following ability scores: Strength 10 (0 modifier, average), Dexterity 18 (4 modifier, very good), Constitution 14 (2 modifier, good), Intelligence 10 (0 modifier, average), Wisdom 14 (2 modifier, good), and Charisma 16 (3 modifier, very good). These attributes allow the creature to navigate social and stealth situations effectively, while its dexterity makes it a nimble and effective fighter.

In terms of skills, the Doppelganger has a deception score of +5, making it exceptional at trickery and lying, an insight score of +4 for reading emotions and intentions, and a stealth score of +6, which grants it exceptional ability to remain undetected. It has darkvision that extends 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and a passive perception of 12. It communicates primarily in Common.

The Doppelganger’s primary action is a Precise Strike, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If it successfully surprises its target, it deals an additional 10 (3d6) damage, making this attack quite potent against unsuspecting foes.

For its bonus actions, the Doppelganger can use Shapeshift to transform into any Small or Medium humanoid creature it has previously observed, or revert to its original form. This shapeshifting retains its statistics, but any equipment does not change form. The creature returns to its true essence upon death. The second bonus action, Read Thoughts, allows it to magically probe the surface thoughts of a creature within 60 feet that it can see. Until the end of its turn, the Doppelganger gains advantage on attack rolls and on any Deception, Insight, Intimidation, and Persuasion checks against that creature, enhancing its effectiveness in both combat and social interactions.
