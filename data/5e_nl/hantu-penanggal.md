The Hantu Penanggal has a remarkable special ability known as "Detachable Head." This allows it to sacrifice its head as a bonus action, enabling independence of actions from its body. When detached, both the head and the body share hit points equal to half of what they had before detachment. Though the body loses truesight, it gains blindsight of 60 feet. Both forms retain the innate spellcasting trait of the full creature. If the head is destroyed while detached, the body also dies. Conversely, if the body is destroyed, the head suffers disadvantage on attacks and checks until it finds a new body. Additionally, any creature within 30 feet that sees the head must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute, with the opportunity to repeat the saving throw on each of its turns.

In terms of innate spellcasting, the Hantu Penanggal has a spell save DC of 15 and a +7 to hit with spell attacks, allowing it to cast spells without material components. It can cast the following spells at will: darkness, and detect evil and good. It can use protection from evil and good and scorching ray two times per day each, and it can use gaseous form once per day.

During combat, the Hantu Penanggal can perform a Multiattack when detached. The detached head makes one bite attack and one entrails attack, while the body can make two claw attacks. In its whole form, it can make three rapier attacks.

The Rapier attack, applicable only in its whole form, rolls a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit inflicts 7 piercing damage and an additional 7 necrotic damage. 

The Claw attack is exclusive to the body, also hitting at +6 and causing 7 slashing damage along with 3 necrotic damage.

The Bite attack, performed by the head, rolls +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit inflicts 12 piercing damage and 7 necrotic damage, also reducing the target's maximum hit points by the amount of necrotic damage dealt, a powerful mechanic that allows the Hantu Penanggal to regain health equal to the reduction.

Finally, the Entrails attack is unique to the head. This attack, rolling +6 to hit at a 10-foot reach, deals 10 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target (escape DC 15), restraining it until the grapple ends. This provides strategic control over key opponents, enhancing the creature's menace in battle.
