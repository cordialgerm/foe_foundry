The Ethereal Drake is a large dragon known for its chaotic neutral alignment and unique ability to traverse both the Material and Ethereal Planes. With a respectable Armor Class of 16, the drake can withstand significant damage while possessing a solid pool of hit points at 133, allowing it to endure engagements long enough to leverage its powerful abilities in battle. The drake has a Challenge Rating of 7, making it a formidable opponent for parties of adventurers, and it provides 2,900 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the Ethereal Drake specializes in ethereal movement, making it both elusive and unpredictable in combat scenarios.

The Ethereal Drake has the following attributes: Strength is 18 (modifier +4, very good), Dexterity is 14 (modifier +2, good), Constitution is 19 (modifier +4, exceptional), Intelligence is 8 (modifier -1, bad), Wisdom is 14 (modifier +2, good), and Charisma is 10 (modifier +0, average). It excels in saving throws against Constitution and Wisdom with bonuses of +7 and +5 respectively, showing above-average resilience against effects targeting these attributes. The drake also has proficiency in perception, enabling it to notice details in its environment with a passive perception score of 15. It is immune to poison damage and conditions, has resistance to cold and necrotic damage, and possesses darkvision capabilities, facilitating visibility in low-light conditions.

One of the Ethereal Drake's special abilities is Ethereal Sight, allowing it to see up to 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane while on the Material Plane and vice versa, giving it tactical advantages against enemies in either realm.

In combat, the Ethereal Drake can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks during its turn. The Bite attack is particularly devastating, offering a +7 to hit. It inflicts 15 piercing damage plus 9 force damage (totaling 24 potential damage) and can grapple targets if they are Large or smaller, imposing an escape DC of 15. The Claw attacks deal 11 slashing damage each, making them an effective choice for damaging opponents.

The drake's signature ability is its Phase Breath, which it can use after a recharge period of 5 to 6 rounds. This breath attack releases a blue mist in a 30-foot cone, dealing 27 force damage (6d8) to all creatures within the area. This also has the additional effect of magically shifting those creatures to the Ethereal Plane for one minute, unless they succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, in which case they take half damage without being shifted. A creature that is displaced to the Ethereal Plane may attempt to re-save at the end of each of its turns, providing them with the chance to return to the Material Plane.

As a bonus action, the Ethereal Drake can use Ethereal Step to shift between the Material and Ethereal Planes. If the drake is grappling a creature, it can bring that creature along during this shift, creating interesting tactical scenarios for its opponents who may not be familiar with the properties of the Ethereal Plane. A creature not native to the Ethereal Plane will return to the Material Plane after 1d4 rounds if they do not escape while grappled.

Overall, the Ethereal Drake's mobility, high damage potential, and ability to manipulate the battlefield make it an exciting and challenging opponent for adventurers.
