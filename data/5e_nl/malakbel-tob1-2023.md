Malakbel has notable special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Blistering Radiance ability creates bright light in a 30-foot radius that inflicts 11 (2d10) radiant damage to any creature within at the start of each of its turns. Furthermore, this light can dispel darkness of lower-level spells. The Distortion ability imposes disadvantage on ranged attacks against Malakbel, making it harder for enemies to successfully hit it with such attacks. Its Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, increasing its chances of avoiding debilitating magical attacks.

This ability allows it to either attack in melee or at range; it has a +9 to hit and can deal 18 (3d8 + 5) fire damage with each successful attack, making its offensive capabilities formidable. Additionally, it can use a powerful special attack called Searing Flare, which requires a recharge roll of 5 or 6. This attack forces all creatures within the bright light of its Blistering Radiance to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On failure, a creature suffers 13 (3d8) fire damage and 22 (4d10) radiant damage, along with one level of exhaustion, while a successful save results in halved damage and no exhaustion. Lastly, Malakbel has the ability to Teleport up to 100 feet to any visible unoccupied space, allowing it to reposition itself strategically during combat or evade danger.

Overall, Malakbel is a powerful enemy that excels in inflicting radiant and fire damage while utilizing its magical defenses to remain a challenging opponent for adventurers.
