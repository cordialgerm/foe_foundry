The Corpse Thief is a medium humanoid creature that embodies a unique blend of stealth and the ability to glean information from both the living and the dead. With a challenge rating of 1/2, this creature is considered a low-level threat, making it suitable for novice adventurers. It possesses a good balance of defensive and offensive capabilities, accentuated by its high Dexterity for stealth and decent Constitution for resilience. However, its low Charisma means it is easily outmatched in social situations. The Corpse Thief's special abilities revolve around its intriguing powers of perception and thievery, allowing it to gather intelligence from objects and stealthily relieve opponents of small items.

The Corpse Thief has an Armor Class of 13, which offers an average defense against attacks. It has 30 hit points, providing a moderate pool of health that allows it to endure some damage in combat. The creature's speeds allow it to move up to 30 feet per turn. Its Strength score is 12 (+1 modifier), which is average, but its Dexterity is outstanding at 17 (+3 modifier), drastically enhancing its agility and stealth capabilities. The Constitution score of 16 (+3 modifier) gives it good resilience, while its Intelligence is average at 11 (+0 modifier). Its Wisdom score is decent at 13 (+1 modifier), but its Charisma is quite low at 6 (-2 modifier), making it very bad at social interactions and deception.

The Corpse Thief has a stealth skill bonus of +5, which is very good, making it efficient at hiding and avoiding detection. It can see in the dark for up to 60 feet thanks to its darkvision and has a passive Perception score of 11, giving it an average ability to notice hidden things. It can speak and understand Common.

The Corpse Thief has a notable special ability called Object Reading. By concentrating for 10 minutes on an object, the creature learns about its most recent owner. If the owner is alive, the thief can see through that person's eyes for 10 minutes, working similarly to the clairvoyance spell. This ability allows the original owner to control the senses, but if they succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, they sense they are being observed. If the most recent owner is dead, the corpse thief can gain insight by experiencing five specific memories related to the object's past, akin to the speak with dead spell.

In combat, the Corpse Thief can engage in a Multiattack, allowing it to perform two claw attacks against its opponents, with a +5 to hit. Each claw attack deals 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. Additionally, the corpse thief has a unique action called Steal. This action targets a creature within 5 feet, where the thief attempts to take a small item. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; if they fail, they lose one small, non-weapon, non-armor object that can fit in a hand, illustrating the thief's cunning and quickness in combat.
