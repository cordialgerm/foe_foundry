The Werebear is a formidable Medium Humanoid with a powerful presence in any encounter. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it possesses significant combat capabilities, thanks to its strong attributes and unique abilities. The creature has a high Armor Class of 11, augmented by substantial Hit Points totaling 135, which provides it a good degree of survivability. Its physical strength is exceptional, exemplified by an impressive Strength score of 18, which grants it a +4 modifier. This strength is coupled with a good Constitution score of 16 (+3), making it resilient in battle, but its Dexterity is average at 10 (+0). The Werebear has immunity to damage from nonmagical and non-silvered weapons, which makes it challenging for unprepared adventurers to combat. With a keen sense of smell, it excels in perception, while its ability to shapeshift allows for versatility in combat and roleplaying scenarios.

The Werebear has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 12 (+1). Its proficiency in perception grants it a skill bonus of +4, making it good at detecting hidden threats. The passive perception score of 16 further enhances this capability. The creature can communicate in Common, which may facilitate interactions outside of combat.

Among its notable special abilities, the Werebear has Keen Smell, providing it with an advantage on Perception checks that rely on its sense of smell. This ability can be crucial for hunting down enemies or detecting hidden foes. The Wolbsbane ability reveals a significant weakness for lycanthropes; they are poisoned if they are within 10 feet of a wolfsbane flower, dramatically affecting their performance in battle. Additionally, any weapon or ammunition coated with wolfsbane will deal damage to lycanthropes as though it were made of silver, providing a strategic way to counter the Werebear's innate damage immunities.

In combat, the Werebear can utilize its Multiattack feature to make two attacks with claws, greataxes, or handaxes. The Greataxe attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 10 slashing damage on a successful hit, while the Handaxe attack also has a +7 to hit but deals slightly less damage at an average of 7 slashing damage. The claw attack, available in bear or hybrid forms, also has a +7 to hit, inflicting 10 slashing damage and allowing the Werebear to grapple its target if they are Medium or smaller, with an escape DC of 15. 

Furthermore, the Werebear has the Bite attack in bear or hybrid forms, which has a +7 to hit and can deal 11 piercing damage. If the target is humanoid, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werebear lycanthropy, introducing an additional layer of danger to encounters with the Werebear. 

As a bonus action, the Werebear can shapeshift into a Large bear, a Large bear-humanoid hybrid, or its true humanoid form. This transformation allows for flexibility in tactics; however, its statistics remain unchanged. It cannot communicate while in bear form, and any equipment it was wielding does not transform with it. Lastly, if the Werebear is bloodied, it gains access to its Frenzied Bite ability, allowing it to make a bite attack, potentially increasing its offensive capabilities when it is most vulnerable.
