The Gladiator is a formidable Medium humanoid known for its impressive combat skills and resilience in battle. With an Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of 105 hit points, this creature can withstand significant punishment while dealing out considerable damage with its melee and ranged attacks. The Gladiator's high Strength of 18 grants it a powerful attack bonus and enhances the damage it inflicts on adversaries. It has well-rounded Dexterity and Constitution scores, making it agile and durable, but its mental attributes are average at best. The Gladiator excels in intimidation and performance, reflecting its prowess as a fighter and showman in arenas. Notably, it benefits from a special ability that enhances its damage output, giving it an edge in encounters. 

The Gladiator has the following attributes: Strength at 18 (+4, exceptional), Dexterity at 14 (+2, good), Constitution at 16 (+3, good), Intelligence at 10 (+0, average), Wisdom at 12 (+1, average), and Charisma at 14 (+2, good). It possesses strong saving throws, particularly in Strength (+7, good) and Constitution (+6, good). Its skills include Athletics (+7, good), Intimidation (+5, good), and Performance (+5, good), further establishing its dominance in combat scenarios and social interactions.

In terms of actions, the Gladiator can make a Multiattack, allowing it to strike twice—either with a spear or by throwing two javelins. Each melee attack with the spear uses an attack roll of +7 and has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet, inflicting 11 piercing damage on a hit (calculated as 2d6 + 4). Similarly, the Shield attack also uses +7 to hit and deals 11 bludgeoning damage, while the Javelin, which can be thrown up to 30 feet effectively or at a longer range of 120 feet, deals the same damage.

As a bonus action, the Gladiator can perform a Shield Rush, attacking with its shield. If this attack hits, the targeted opponent must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone, creating a tactical advantage for the Gladiator and its allies.

For reactions, the Gladiator can utilize Shield Block while wielding a shield. By doing so, it adds 3 to its Armor Class against one attack that would hit, allowing it to effectively mitigate damage at a critical moment.

Overall, the Gladiator shines as a well-rounded combatant capable of dealing and withstanding damage, and can manipulate the battlefield dynamics to its advantage through its varied abilities.
