The Pine Doom is a formidable creature that combines the characteristics of a colossal plant with the ability to deceive its foes. Its natural armor provides a solid defense, with an Armor Class of 16, and its substantial pool of hit points, totaling 172, ensures it can withstand significant punishment in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it presents a serious threat, offering 5,000 experience points to those who manage to defeat it. The Pine Doom is exceptionally powerful in inflicting damage, especially against structures, as it has the Siege Monster ability. However, it is vulnerable to fire damage, making it susceptible to certain spells and attacks that exploit this weakness. The creature also possesses various special abilities, such as grappling opponents with sticky pine tar and disguising itself as an ordinary tree when motionless. These traits make it a cunning ambush predator.

The Pine Doom has the following attributes, with their respective modifiers: Strength is 20 (+5) indicating an exceptional physical presence; Dexterity is 7 (-2), reflecting very bad agility; Constitution is 21 (+5), showcasing exceptional toughness; Intelligence is 11 (+0), indicating average processing capability; Wisdom is 16 (+3), showcasing good perceptiveness; and Charisma is 12 (+1), suggesting an average level of social influence. Its skills include a +8 bonus to Nature and +7 to Perception, which contribute to its effectiveness in forest environments.

In terms of damage susceptibility, the Pine Doom has vulnerabilities to fire damage and resistances to bludgeoning and piercing damage. It possesses a passive perception score of 17, allowing it to be very aware of its surroundings, and it can communicate in Druidic and Sylvan languages.

The Pine Doomâ€™s special abilities include:

- **False Appearance:** While the Pine Doom remains completely still, it could easily be mistaken for an ordinary pine tree, providing excellent camouflage.

- **Sticky Pine Tar:** Any creature that touches the Pine Doom is grappled, with an escape difficulty of 16. While in this grapple, the creature is restrained, limiting its actions in combat. If a creature strikes the Pine Doom with a bludgeoning or piercing attack while within 5 feet, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become entangled, causing its weapon to stick to the tree. Removing a stuck weapon requires another creature to make a successful DC 16 Strength check. Notably, splashing the creature with a gallon of alcohol will free all stuck items and creatures and nullify this ability for a brief duration of one minute.

- **Siege Monster:** The Pine Doom inflicts double damage to any structures and objects it targets, making it especially dangerous in a fortification setting.

The Pine Doom has the following actions:

- **Multiattack:** This allows the Pine Doom to perform three slam attacks in a single turn or use the Sap-filled Pinecone attack twice.

- **Slam:** A melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, it has a reach of 10 feet and deals 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit.

- **Sap-filled Pinecone:** This ranged attack targets a single creature at a +9 to hit, with a range of 30/120 feet. It deals 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage. Furthermore, the target and all creatures within a 5-foot radius from it must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained by sap. They can escape by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.

- **Flurry of Pinecones (Recharge 6):** This area attack targets all creatures within 30 feet, requiring them to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 15 (6d4) slashing damage, or half damage on a successful save, making it a potent area damage ability.

The combination of its abilities and attacks makes the Pine Doom an intimidating opponent, capable of controlling the battlefield and devastating unsuspecting adventurers.
