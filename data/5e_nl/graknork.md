Graknork is a gargantuan monstrosity that is not aligned with any particular philosophy or force. With an impressive Armor Class of 20, it is quite difficult to damage, and its robust Hit Points totaling 201 reflect its tremendous resilience in battle. Graknork is capable of moving swiftly both through land and water, with a walking speed of 50 feet and a swimming speed of 30 feet, making it a formidable presence in various environments. As a creature with a Challenge Rating of 14, it poses a significant threat, earning 11,500 experience points for those who defeat it. Notable strengths include exceptional physical capabilities, solid defensive attributes, and powerful offensive actions, while its weaknesses include a lack of proficiency in intelligence and charisma, making it vulnerable to mind-controlling effects or manipulation.

Graknork’s attributes indicate a powerhouse; its Strength is an outstanding 25 (+7), allowing it to deliver devastating melee attacks. Its Dexterity is notable at 18 (+4), providing a good balance of agility, while its Constitution at 21 (+5) ensures remarkable durability. Intelligence at 5 (-3) shows it is not clever, while Wisdom at 13 (+1) gives it an average perception of its surroundings. Its Charisma is low at 7 (-2), further illustrating its lack of social influence. Graknork excels in Perception checks, with a skill value of +6, particularly benefiting from its Keen Sight ability, granting it advantage on sight-dependent checks.

In combat, Graknork has several actions at its disposal. Its Multiattack action is formidable, allowing it to make three attacks: one bite attack and two claw attacks, or it can target enemies with its Eye Ray twice. This multi-faceted offensive strategy can deal considerable damage, making Graknork a dangerous foe. The Bite attack has a +12 to hit and can inflict 23 (3d10 + 7) piercing damage, while each Claw attack also has a +12 to hit and deals 20 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage. If both claw attacks hit a creature of Large size or smaller, that creature must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. If they fail, they take an additional 9 (2d8) slashing damage and are knocked prone, which can severely hamper their effectiveness in battle.

Graknork also possesses the Eye Ray ranged attack, which has a +9 to hit and can deal 17 (5d6) cold damage at a distance. Additionally, it can use the Freezing Eye special ability, which has a recharge mechanic requiring a roll of 5 or 6 to be used again. By unleashing an icy beam, it can target a line 120 feet long and 10 feet wide, compelling creatures in its path to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they suffer 35 (10d6) cold damage and become restrained for one minute, which can dramatically shift the momentum of a battle. Successful saves result in half damage without restraint. Notably, creatures that are restrained can attempt to escape at the end of their turns or can be freed through fire damage, adding a layer of strategy to encounters with Graknork.
