The Eater of Dust is a Medium aberration characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It operates as a formidable adversary in combat, showcasing an impressive combination of physical and spellcasting capabilities. This creature possesses high armor class and hit points, making it resilient in battle. Its strengths lie in strong melee attacks that inflict both piercing and necrotic damage, along with the ability to regenerate health each turn. It is especially dangerous due to its capacity to diminish its opponents' hit point maximum, a feature that can potentially lead to a quick downfall for ill-prepared characters. However, it has weaknesses, including vulnerabilities to fire damage which temporarily negates its regenerative abilities.

The Eater of Dust has the following ability scores: Strength is 20 with a +5 modifier, showcasing exceptional power; Dexterity is 14, indicating an average agility with a +2 modifier; Constitution is 20 with a +5 modifier, allowing for very good durability; Intelligence is a flat 10, meaning it is average in cognitive abilities; Wisdom is 15 with a +2 modifier, signaling good perceptiveness; and Charisma is 17 with a +3 modifier, representing a good presence. The Eater of Dust has saving throw bonuses of +9 in Strength and Constitution, and +7 in Charisma, indicating very good effectiveness in avoiding physical harm and resisting magical effects. It possesses skills in Athletics at +9, Intimidation at +7, and Perception at +6, indicating strong physical prowess and the ability to influence and observe effectively.

The creature is immune to lightning and poison damage, resistant to acid and cold damage, and takes only half damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks from nonmagical sources. It is also immune to the blinded and poisoned conditions. The Eater of Dust has blindsight up to 120 feet, allowing it to detect creatures and objects within that range despite being blind outside, and has a passive Perception of 16. Furthermore, it understands Abyssal, Common, Infernal, and Void Speech languages but cannot speak. Instead, it communicates telepathically up to 120 feet.

In terms of special abilities, the Eater of Dust has a unique feature called Magic Maw, which enhances its Maw-Arm attacks to deal additional necrotic damage. Specifically, when it hits with its Maw-Arm, it can inflict an extra 3d8 necrotic damage. Additionally, the creature possesses a Regeneration ability that allows it to recover 5 hit points at the beginning of its turn. If it takes fire damage, this regeneration will not occur on its next turn. Importantly, the Eater of Dust cannot die until it starts its turn with 0 hit points and fails to regenerate.

Regarding its actions, the Eater of Dust can perform a Multiattack, which can manifest as one Maw-Arm attack combined with two Necrotic Blast attacks or can be composed solely of three Necrotic Blast attacks. The Maw-Arm attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +9 to hit and can reach up to 10 feet, dealing 12 piercing damage along with an additional 13 necrotic damage. Following this hit, the target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer a reduction in its hit point maximum equal to the necrotic damage dealt, while the Eater of Dust regains health equal to that amount. This hit point maximum reduction lasts until the target completes a long rest, and if reduced to 0, the target dies. The Necrotic Burst is either a melee or ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit. It can reach targets up to 5 feet away or 60 feet away, inflicting 16 necrotic damage on a successful hit.

Finally, the Eater of Dust can utilize a bonus action called Hungry Step, which allows it to magically teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space next to a creature that is neither a Construct nor Undead. This ability enhances its mobility in combat, allowing it to reposition strategically and threaten nearby opponents.
