The Warmth Thief is a tiny fey creature embodying the essence of cold and stealth. Its neutral evil alignment drives it to manipulate and harm those around it, using its innate abilities to siphon warmth and life force from unsuspecting victims. With impressive mobility due to its flying speed, it can maneuver easily in combat, making it hard to pin down. The creature possesses a relatively high Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of hit points, totaling 112, that makes it resilient in battle. However, it is vulnerable to the environment, as excessive warmth can cause it to suffer from exhaustion. The Warmth Thief primarily employs cold damage in its attacks and abilities, making it a formidable foe in colder climates but less effective in warmer environments.

The Warmth Thief has a Strength score of 11, which equates to an average modifier of +0, indicating its lack of physical prowess. Its Dexterity is a strong 18, resulting in a very good +4 modifier, enhancing its agility and ability to avoid attacks. With a Constitution score of 20, the Warmth Thief enjoys an exceptional +5 modifier, contributing significantly to its durability. Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are 17, 15, and 18, with respective modifiers of +3, +2, and +4, all of which contribute to its effectiveness in spellcasting and deception. For saving throws, it excels in Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma with modifiers of +8, +6, and +8 respectively, showcasing its ability to resist many effects. Its skills in deception and stealth are both at +8, demonstrating its talent for trickery and evasion.

The creature is immune to cold damage, providing it with a critical advantage in a cold environment. It also resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks unless made with cold iron weapons, which offers it a significant level of protection from most physical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to paralysis and the prone condition, allowing it to maintain its mobility during encounters. With truesight at 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 12, the Warmth Thief can detect hidden foes and avoid ambushes. It communicates fluently in Common, Sylvan, and Umbral, adding to its cunning nature.

One of the Warmth Thief's notable special abilities is the "Aura of Warmth Stealing." At the beginning of each of its turns, any creature within a 5-foot radius must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) cold damage. The Warmth Thief then regains hit points equal to the highest amount of cold damage dealt, allowing it to sustain itself by draining the life force of its foes. Another ability, "Cold Physiology," causes the Warmth Thief to struggle in warm conditions, imposing a DC 15 Constitution saving throw every hour in temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Failing this save results in one level of exhaustion that can only be removed after a long rest in a cooler environment.

During its turn, the Warmth Thief can use the action "Multiattack," allowing it to make two "Freezing Claw" attacks. Each claw attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, the attack deals 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage in addition to 14 (4d6) cold damage. The Warmth Thief also regains hit points equal to half the cold damage dealt. If the attacked target fails a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, it becomes chilled for 1 minute, suffering 7 (2d6) cold damage at the beginning of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect. Moreover, if a humanoid is killed while chilled, it rises as a chill haunt after 24 hours unless it has been restored to life or its body destroyed. This ability adds a layer of strategy, as it not only inflicts damage but can lead to the creation of new undead threats for the party to deal with.
