The Wereboar is a Medium humanoid creature with the ability to shift between humanoid, hybrid, and boar forms. It possesses a significant amount of hit points, making it a durable opponent in combat. With a strong physical presence, highlighted by its notable Strength and decent Constitution, the Wereboar excels in melee combat. Its challenge rating of 4 indicates that it can present a moderate threat to adventuring parties. One of the creature's unique features is its immunity to damage from non-magical and non-silvered weapons, which can make it tough for unprepared characters to defeat. While it has average Dexterity, its limited mobility of 30 feet per turn and lack of ranged attacks could be considered weaknesses.

The Wereboar has the following core attributes: Strength 16 (+3) which is very good for melee attack rolls; Dexterity 10 (+0) which is average and does not benefit its initiative or ranged combat; Constitution 14 (+2) which is good, adding to its hit point total and resilience; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all at 10 (+0), which are average and do not provide any notable benefits. It has a passive Perception of 12 due to its Wisdom score and can communicate in Common, though it forgoes speech when in boar form.

The Wereboar's special abilities include Relentless, which allows it to drop to 1 hit point instead of being reduced to 0 once per day when it takes up to 14 damage, emphasizing its resilience. It is also affected by wolfsbane; when within 10 feet of the flower, it is poisoned, and weapons treated with wolfsbane can harm the creature as if they were silvered, overcoming its damage immunities for 1 hour.

In terms of actions, the Wereboar can perform a Multiattack when in humanoid or hybrid form, making two attacks, limited to one tusk attack per round. It can use the Maul attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit that deals 10 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Switch to its Tusks attack in either boar or hybrid form, which also has a +5 to hit but can deal significantly more damage with an extra effect. If the Wereboar charges at least 20 feet straight towards its target before attacking, the tusk attack deals an additional 7 slashing damage (totaling 14 slashing damage), and if it hits a creature, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Additionally, if it hits a humanoid, that target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wereboar lycanthropy, adding a narrative twist to their encounter.

For bonus actions, the Wereboar can shapeshift between its forms, which does not change its statistics but limits its interaction with the worldâ€”most notably, it cannot speak in boar form. Importantly, if the Wereboar's health drops below half, it can launch a frenzied tusk attack, showcasing its aggressive nature when bloodied.
