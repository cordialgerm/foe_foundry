The Ancient Mandriano is a formidable creature in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, classified as a Huge Plant with a lawful evil alignment. It possesses a high Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor and robust hit points totaling 102, which makes it a challenging adversary for players. With a Challenge Rating of 8 and yielding 3,900 experience points upon defeat, it proves to be a significant threat, especially in terms of its unique capabilities in combat. This creature's strengths lie in its impressive physical attacks and its ability to manipulate life and death, making it a dangerous foe. However, it is vulnerable to fire damage, and its low Dexterity renders it less agile than other creatures, making its movements slightly predictable.

The Ancient Mandriano has the following ability scores: Strength of 21 (+5, which is very good), Dexterity of 8 (-1, which is bad), Constitution of 15 (+2, which is good), Intelligence of 12 (+1, which is average), Wisdom of 10 (+0, which is average), and Charisma of 7 (-2, which is bad). Its high Strength gives it powerful melee capabilities, while its low Dexterity and Charisma limit its effectiveness in stealth and social interactions. Specifically, it has athletics skill proficiency at +8, which is very good, perception skill proficiency at +3, which is average, and a stealth skill proficiency at +2, which is average as well.

In terms of damage vulnerabilities, the Ancient Mandriano is vulnerable to fire, while it has immunities to poison and resistance to necrotic damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks. It is also immune to exhaustion and poisoned conditions, which enhances its durability in prolonged encounters. The creature has a passive perception of 13, which allows it to notice its surroundings effectively.

One of the prominent special abilities of the Ancient Mandriano is "Siege Monster," which allows it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it particularly effective in destroying barriers or environmental features.

In combat, the Ancient Mandriano can take multiple actions. Its "Multiattack" allows it to make two melee attacks known as "Swipe." The Swipe attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, inflicting 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage on a hit. If it targets a creature that is Medium size or smaller, that creature is grappled and must escape using a DC of 16. While grappled, the target is restrained, and the mandriano can grapple up to three creatures at once.

Another deadly action is "Consume the Spark," which enables the mandriano to drain the life essence from one of its grappled victims. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, with half damage on a successful save. The significant consequence of this ability is the reduction of the target's hit point maximum by the amount of necrotic damage taken, lasting until the target finishes a long rest. Should this reduction bring the target's hit point maximum to zero, the target dies and rises 24 hours later as an undead under the mandriano's control, unless restored to life or destroyed. The creature can control up to twelve undead at once, enhancing its threat level substantially.

Additionally, the "Call the Dead" ability can be activated three times per day, allowing the Ancient Mandriano to animate a humanoid corpse within 60 feet. This ability works similarly to the animate dead spell, but it can only create zombies. Importantly, it expands the mandriano's control to a maximum of twenty zombies at a time, providing it a significant army to support its endeavors in battle.
