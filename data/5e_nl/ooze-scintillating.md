The Scintillating Ooze is a formidable Large ooze creature with a neutral alignment, presenting an intriguing blend of resilience and offense in combat. With a solid Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of 165 hit points, it is a durable foe that can withstand significant damage. The creature excels at close-quarters combat, utilizing its corrosive form and unique ability to create smaller oozlings under specific conditions. While its Intelligence and Charisma are exceptionally low, rendering it inept at most strategic or social interactions, its physical attributes, particularly its Strength of 20 and Constitution of 16, provide it with great raw power and survivability. However, its Dexterity is average, which may limit its agility in combat scenarios. 

The Scintillating Ooze has a Strength score of 20, granting it an exceptional modifier of +5, allowing it a high chance to succeed on melee attacks. Its Constitution score of 16 provides a good +3 modifier, contributing to its hit points and fortitude. However, its Dexterity score of 10 results in an average modifier of +0, meaning it does not benefit from heightened agility. The creature's Wisdom of 7 (with a -2 modifier) and Intelligence of 3 (with a -4 modifier) showcase its lack of insight and cognitive abilities, while a Charisma of 3 (also with a -4 modifier) highlights its utterly low appeal, making it incapable of social manipulation.

The Scintillating Ooze has several advantageous resistances and immunities: it is immune to acid, cold, lightning, and slashing damage, making it a tough adversary against many attacks. Furthermore, its condition immunities include being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, grappled, and prone, reinforcing its status as a relentless opponent. Its blindsight ability allows it to perceive its surroundings within a radius of 120 feet, even without vision, suggesting that it can navigate effectively in total darkness and is not hindered by impairments that affect sight.

Regarding its special abilities, the Scintillating Ooze is amorphous, allowing it to squeeze through spaces as narrow as 1 foot. When it comes into contact with other creatures, its corrosive form inflicts 10 (3d6) acid damage to those who touch it or strike it with melee attacks while within 5 feet. It possesses ooze nature, which means it does not require sleep, enabling it to remain an active threat continuously. Additionally, its spider climb ability allows it to traverse difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without needing to make ability checks.

In terms of combat actions, the Scintillating Ooze can perform a multiattack, making one Pseudopod attack and three Weapon Thrash attacks in one turn. For its Pseudopod attack, it has a +9 to hit and inflicts 10 (2d4+5) bludgeoning damage, alongside an additional 18 (4d8) acid damage. Each Weapon Thrash attack, also with a +9 to hit, inflicts 10 (2d4+5) bludgeoning damage, giving it versatility in choosing between bludgeoning or piercing/slashing damage types.

The ooze can also take special reactions. The Shed Oozling ability allows it to create a smaller oozling when it suffers acid, cold, lightning, or slashing damage, provided it has more than 10 hit points. This oozling shares most statistics with the Scintillating Ooze but is classified as Tiny, has only 10 hit points, and cannot make Weapon Thrash attacks.

The creature also possesses legendary actions that enhance its potential during combat. It can move up to its speed while provoking opportunity attacks from nearby opponents, perform a Grasping Pseudopod attack to pull a creature within 30 feet closer to it (with a DC 17 Strength save required to avoid this effect), or initiate a Lunging Attack which allows it to make one Weapon Thrash attack against a target it can see within 10 feet, requiring 2 points to execute. These abilities make the Scintillating Ooze a versatile threat on the battlefield, capable of controlling the positioning of enemies while dealing significant damage.
