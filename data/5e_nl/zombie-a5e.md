The Zombie is a formidable and iconic creature in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, categorized as a Medium Undead. Its low Armor Class of 8 makes it relatively easy to hit, while its 15 hit points provide a moderate buffer in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it serves as an appropriate foe for low-level adventurers, providing a balance of threat and manageability. One of the Zombie's most notable strengths is its Undead Fortitude ability, which allows it to potentially remain on the battlefield even after taking lethal damage. However, its mobility is limited to walking 20 feet per turn, and its low Dexterity means it is ineffective at dodging attacks. Overall, the Zombie excels in being a persistent and menacing opponent, particularly in numbers, but it is not particularly versatile or adaptive in combat.

The Zombie has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 12 (+1), which translates to an average modifier, allowing it to deliver moderate melee attacks. 
- Dexterity: 6 (-2), resulting in a very bad modifier that significantly hampers its ability to dodge incoming attacks or perform finesse maneuvers. 
- Constitution: 16 (+3), giving it a good modifier that enhances its durability and resilience. 
- Intelligence: 3 (-4), indicating an exceptionally low capacity for cognitive abilities, rendering it mostly mindless. 
- Wisdom: 6 (-2), also very bad, it struggles to make insightful decisions or notice threats. 
- Charisma: 4 (-3), which is poor and reflects its inability to engage in social interactions or command presence.

In terms of mechanical strengths, the Zombie has immunities to poison damage and the poisoned condition, making it resilient against certain attacks. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and it possesses a passive perception of 8, indicating it can notice some surrounding threats and details but is still relatively oblivious.

The Zombie's special abilities enhance its presence in combat. Undead Fortitude activates once per day, allowing the Zombie to cheat death by dropping to 1 hit point instead of immediately succumbing to damage that is not radiant or from a critical hit. This makes it a challenging foe, as it can continue fighting or engaging even after being seemingly defeated. Additionally, its Undead Nature means it does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, marking it as a tireless enemy.

The Zombie can take two actions during its turn:
- Grab: This melee weapon attack has a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage and can grapple a Medium or smaller creature (with an escape difficulty of 11). While it grapples one target, it cannot grab another, representing the Zombie's struggle to maintain focus on a singular victim.
- Bite: This melee weapon attack also has a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet but can only target a creature that is already grappled. If it lands a successful hit, it deals 6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage, which allows the Zombie to restore hit points equal to the damage dealt. This ability can be particularly devastating when combined with its ability to take multiple bites if other zombies are present, allowing it to revive constantly from its prey.

In summary, the Zombie is a classic adversary in D&D, notable for its resilience, straightforward attacks, and ability to sustain itself in combat, especially when facing weak opponents.
