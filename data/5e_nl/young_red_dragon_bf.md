The Young Red Dragon is a formidable and powerful creature that embodies the classic imagery of dragons in fantasy settings. It stands as a Large dragon with a robust Armor Class of 18, which provides it good protection in combat. Its Hit Points total 193, allowing it to withstand significant damage before being defeated. This dragon excels in mobility with a speed of 40 feet on the ground, 40 feet while climbing, and an impressive flight speed of 80 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 10, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who may encounter it. The Young Red Dragon possesses exceptional physical attributes, with particularly high values in Strength (+6), Constitution (+9), and Charisma (+8), making it very strong in both physical combat and commanding presence. Its weaknesses come in the form of relatively lower Intelligence (+2) and Wisdom (+4), which are average compared to its other stat values.

The Young Red Dragon has several notable abilities that enhance its threat level in battles. It possesses darkvision up to 120 feet and keen senses, granting it a Perception score of 18, allowing it to notice hidden creatures effectively. Its Stealth modifier of +14 indicates it can be very stealthy when attempting to hide or launch surprise attacks. The dragon is capable of communicating in both Common and Draconic, increasing its interaction potential with various creatures.

One of its special abilities, "Boil Over," creates an aura of intense heat around the dragon. While its Fire Breath is not yet used, it can inflict damage on any creature starting their turn within 10 feet. Affected creatures must succeed on a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 17 or take 7 fire damage. This ability creates a strategic area of control, forcing foes to stay at a distance or risk taking damage.

In combat, the dragon can make a Multiattack, allowing it to perform one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. Its Bite attack has a +10 modifier to hit and can reach targets 10 feet away, dealing an average of 17 piercing damage and an additional 3 fire damage on a hit. Its Claw attacks also have a +10 modifier to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 slashing damage. 

The Young Red Dragon possesses a powerful breath weapon called "Fire Breath," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. When unleashed, it exhales a torrent of fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature caught in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 17. Those who fail take a staggering 56 fire damage (averaging from 16d6), while successful saves still incur half damage. This ability not only inflicts heavy damage but also can change the dynamics of the battlefield, potentially incapacitating multiple enemies at once.

Overall, the Young Red Dragon is a highly dangerous opponent, possessing strong attacks, effective area control through its special abilities, and formidable mobility that makes it a prominent threat in any encounter.
