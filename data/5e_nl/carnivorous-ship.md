The Carnivorous Ship is a gargantuan monstrosity characterized by its ability to traverse both land and sea, making it a formidable foe in aquatic and coastal adventures. With an Armor Class of 17, it has a good defense due to its natural armor, and it boasts a substantial 186 hit points, allowing it to withstand significant damage. The ship can move slowly on land at 10 feet but is capable of swimming at a remarkable speed of 60 feet. The challenge it presents is rated at 13, indicating a tough opponent that rewards players with 10,000 XP upon defeat. 

Regarding its attributes, the Carnivorous Ship possesses the following scores: Strength of 23, which provides an exceptional +6 modifier, allowing it to exert immense force in combat. Its Dexterity is low at 6, resulting in a bad -2 modifier, reflecting a sluggishness in maneuverability. The Constitution of 20 gives it a very good +5 modifier, enhancing its durability and fortitude in battle. Intelligence remains low at 7, leading to a very bad -2 modifier, suggesting a lack of strategic thinking. With a Wisdom of 10, it has an average modifier of +0, while its Charisma of 14 provides a good +2 modifier, useful particularly in interactions involving deception.

The Carnivorous Ship has proficiency in deception, giving it an impressive +12 modifier in that skill, allowing it to be quite persuasive in trickery or misinformation. It also has a +5 bonus to perception, which amounts to a passive Perception score of 15, enabling it to notice hidden threats effectively. It is immune to acid damage and cannot be knocked prone, while its senses include blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision reaching 120 feet. Although it understands Common, it cannot communicate verbally.

The Carnivorous Ship has several special abilities. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water with ease. Every day at dawn, it generates up to 12 drones resembling humanoids that act under its control and share a telepathic bond with the ship. These drones have the statistics of zombies but cannot be knocked prone when on the ship, and they can attach themselves to the ship as a reaction when it moves. The ship can polymorph into a gargantuan vessel like a galleon or revert to its amorphous form, retaining its statistics and equipment through this transformation. However, it reverts back to its true form upon death.

In terms of actions, the Carnivorous Ship can perform a multiattack, allowing it to make two bite attacks. Each bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +11 to hit, reaching a target within 10 feet, and deals 22 piercing damage along with 18 acid damage on a successful hit. Additionally, it can launch a Spit Cannonball attack, which targets up to three visible points within 100 feet. Any creatures within 5 feet of those points must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 18 slashing damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. 

Another powerful action is the "Surge," allowing the Carnivorous Ship to move up to 400 feet in a straight line, freely passing through Huge and smaller objects as though they were difficult terrain, and not provoking opportunity attacks. When moving through an object, that object takes a considerable 55 bludgeoning damage. If the Carnivorous Ship moves through another ship, the pilot can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom check using navigator’s tools to halve the damage on a successful roll. This mobility and damage liability make the Carnivorous Ship a dangerous presence on the battlefield, capable of wreaking havoc in both sea and land engagements.
