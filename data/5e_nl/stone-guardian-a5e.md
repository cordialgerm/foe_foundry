The Stone Guardian is a powerful Large Construct known for its robust physical defense and high damage output. With an Armor Class of 17 and hit points totaling 178, the Guardian is a formidable opponent in combat, able to withstand significant damage while dealing heavy blows to its enemies. It possesses exceptional Strength with a score of 22, allowing for strong melee attacks, while its Constitution also provides good durability. However, its Intelligence, Charisma, and Dexterity are notably low, making it less effective in situations that require social interaction or agility. The Guardian's special abilities, such as defensive capabilities and resistance to magic, make it a reliable guardian for any site or purpose.

In terms of mechanical attributes, the Stone Guardian has a Strength score of 22, granting it a +6 modifier, which means it has very good physical power. Its Dexterity score is 10, giving it a 0 modifier, indicating average agility. The Guardian possesses a high Constitution score of 20, resulting in a +5 modifier, contributing to its very good hit point pool. Intelligence is very low at 3, resulting in a -4 modifier, reflecting its inability to solve puzzles or engage in complex thought. Wisdom at 12 provides a +1 modifier, offering average insight, while Charisma is exceptionally low at 1, resulting in a -5 modifier, indicating that it cannot influence others effectively.

The Stone Guardian has several key special abilities. Its Immutable Form renders it immune to any effect that would change its physical form, making it very difficult to manipulate. Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, allowing it to withstand magical assaults more effectively than most. With its Constructed Nature ability, the Guardian does not need air, food, or sleep, making it a persistent threat on the battlefield.

In combat, the Guardian can perform multiple attacks due to its Multiattack ability, allowing it to make two slam attacks on its turn. Each slam attack has a +10 to hit, reaching 5 feet, and deals significant bludgeoning damage with an average of 19 (3d8 + 6) on a successful hit. The Guardian can also use a ranged attack called Rock, which allows it to strike a target from up to 240 feet away. This attack also has a +10 to hit and inflicts an average of 30 (7d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the Rock attack hits, the target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or fall prone, making it easier for the Guardian to continue its assaults.

Additionally, the Stone Guardian has a unique bonus action called Slow, which can be used if it recharges on rolls of 5-6. This ability targets multiple creatures within 30 feet, requiring them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Failing this save means that the creatures are slowed for one minute, limiting their actions significantly. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns, which adds a layer of strategic control for the Guardian in combat situations.
