The Otyugh is a large aberration notable for its grotesque appearance and repulsive habits. It typically inhabits the sewers or other waste-filled areas, often lurking in filth and muck. With a solid armor class of 14 and a substantial pool of hit points totalizing 110, it presents a formidable challenge, particularly for less experienced adventurers. Its challenge rating of 6 means it can provide a significant threat, especially given its multi-attack capabilities and grappling proficiency. While its defensive attributes are decent, the Otyugh’s intelligence is notably low, reflecting its base instincts rather than strategic thinking. It excels in close combat, using its tentacles and bite as primary attacks, but its movement speed is average at 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat.

The Otyugh has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3, good), Dexterity 10 (+0, average), Constitution 16 (+3, good), Intelligence 6 (-2, very bad), Wisdom 14 (+2, good), and Charisma 5 (-3, very bad). It possesses a decent defensive presence, holding a +6 modifier for both Strength and Constitution saving throws, which falls into the good category. The creature has darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, making it quite effective in its natural habitats. It communicates through telepathy within 120 feet, enabling it to convey thoughts and images to allies.

In combat, the Otyugh makes two tentacle attacks as part of its multiattack action. Each tentacle attack has a +6 to hit and can reach up to 10 feet, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage and an additional 4 (1d8) piercing damage on a successful hit. If it grapples a Medium or smaller creature, it restrains them until the grapple is released, making it harder for the target to escape.

Furthermore, through the Tentacle Slam ability, the Otyugh can slam creatures it is grappling into a hard surface or into each other, forcing them to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. If they fail, they take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, are stunned until the end of the Otyugh’s next turn, and are pulled up to 5 feet closer to the Otyugh, which can significantly shift the dynamic of the battle.

As a bonus action, the Otyugh can perform a Bite attack with a +6 to hit, reaching 5 feet to deal 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If this attack lands and targets a creature, that creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On failure, the target contracts a disease that poisons them. This disease reduces the target's hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) with each failure on subsequent saving throws they make every 24 hours, creating a lasting threat even after the encounter ends.

Lastly, the Swallow ability allows the Otyugh to engulf Medium or smaller creatures that are stunned. If successful, the swallowed creature gains total cover from outside attacks, but is blinded and restrained within the Otyugh's body, suffering 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of the Otyugh’s turns. If the swallowed creature inflicts 15 or more damage to the Otyugh in one turn, they can escape, adding another tactical consideration during confrontations with this unsettling creature.
