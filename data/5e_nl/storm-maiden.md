The Storm Maiden is a medium-sized elemental creature embodying chaotic evil, renowned for its mastery of storms and lightning. With an Armor Class of 15 and a total of 78 hit points, it presents a formidable challenge to adventurers. It can swim, fly, and walk at a speed of 30 feet, providing it with excellent mobility. The Storm Maiden is rated with a Challenge Rating of 4, indicating it can pose a significant threat to parties of adventurers who are not adequately prepared to counter its abilities. Notably, it possesses immunity to poison damage and resistances to lightning, thunder, and non-magical physical damage, making it a durable opponent. Its strengths lie in its innate spellcasting abilities, strong physical attacks, and a unique capacity to incapacitate foes with its lightning attacks. However, it can be challenged through strategic planning and the right tactical responses.

The Storm Maiden has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 15 (+2), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 11 (+0), and Charisma 17 (+3). Its Strength and Dexterity modifiers are both good, allowing for strong melee combat and agile movements. The Constitution modifier is average, providing moderate resilience. Intelligence is average and may not greatly affect its abilities in combat directly, while Wisdom is average, giving a slight boost to perception. Charisma is exceptional, significantly enhancing its spellcasting abilities.

In terms of skills, the Storm Maiden is equipped with powerful damage immunities against poison and conditional immunities against exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, poison, and unconsciousness. Its darkvision extends to 60 feet and it has a passive perception score of 11, allowing it to perceive its surroundings effectively. The creature can communicate in both Common and Primordial, allowing for distinct interaction options within its elemental domain.

The Storm Maidenâ€™s innate spellcasting relies on Charisma, with a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 modifier to hit with spell attacks. It can cast the following spells without needing material components: 
- At will, it can use "create or destroy water" to manipulate water levels, "ray of frost" to deal cold damage and reduce a target's speed, "misty step" for teleportation, and "thunderwave" to create a wave of thunderous force that can push enemies away.
- Once per day, it can cast "sleet storm," creating hazardous terrain, and "wind wall," which can block projectile attacks.

In combat, the Storm Maiden can unleash devastating multiattack sequences with two melee "Thunderous Slam" attacks, which hit with a +5 modifier and can deal substantial bludgeoning and thunder damage combined. The thunder damage adds an extra layer of threat, especially due to the Storm Maiden's control over thunderous energy.

Additionally, it possesses a ranged attack called "Throw Lightning," which has a range of 120 feet and also uses a +5 modifier. A successful hit deals 14 lightning damage, and the target must pass a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of their next turn, potentially shifting the tide of battle significantly in the Storm Maiden's favor.

Overall, the Storm Maiden is a versatile threat in combat, bolstered by its elemental powers, physical strength, and the ability to disrupt and incapacitate enemies with its lightning-based abilities.
