The Chimera is a large monstrosity with a fearsome presence that stands out in combat with its unique multi-headed anatomy. With an armor class of 13, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, while its substantial hit points of 114, derived from rolling 12d10 plus a substantial constitution modifier of +4, give it good durability for sustained encounters. The Chimera's challenge rating of 7 indicates that it presents a moderate difficulty for adventurers, providing 2,900 experience points upon defeat. In terms of mobility, it possesses a walking speed of 30 feet and the ability to fly at a speed of 60 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in diverse terrains. However, its low intelligence score of 3 (-4 modifier) indicates poor tactical awareness and problem-solving ability, despite its very good physical attributes.

The Chimera has high physical strength with a score of 18 (+4 modifier), which contributes to its powerful melee attacks. Its constitution score of 18 provides it with effective saving throws and a strong presence in combat. It has an exceptional wisdom score of 16 (+3 modifier), enhancing its perception abilities significantly, making it very good at noticing threats and ambushes. On the defensive side, the Chimera has reactive abilities and advantageous traits derived from its unique anatomy. It can take up to three reactions per round, though only one per turn, and it benefits from having three heads, giving it advantages on saving throws against various conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or frightened, and it cannot be flanked by opponents.

The Chimera’s main actions in combat include physical attacks and a potent breath weapon. Its Headbutt attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 5 feet, dealing an average of 11 bludgeoning damage, with the potential to knock its target prone on a failed Strength saving throw. Similarly, its Bite and Claw attacks provide lethal options, both also hitting at a +7. The Bite delivers 11 piercing damage, while the Claw can deal either 9 slashing damage or a devastating 14 slashing damage against a prone target, making it very effective at taking down weakened foes. Additionally, its Breath Weapon, reusable every five to six rounds, unleashes a fiery attack in a 15-foot cone, forcing creatures in the area to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking significant fire damage.

As a reaction, the Chimera can use Tail Swipe once per day to retaliate against melee attackers, potentially pushing them away and knocking them prone on a failed Strength saving throw. Another ability, Winged Charge, allows the Chimera to leap towards a ranged attacker when it is hit, following up with a powerful Headbutt attack if within reach. It can also utilize two legendary actions per turn, allowing it to strike with its Bite or Claw attacks at the end of an opponent's turn, significantly increasing its threat level and allowing it to capitalize on enemy actions.

Overall, the Chimera stands as a fearsome opponent in battle, with its blend of multiple attack types, high mobility, and reactive capabilities making it a notable creature for any adventurers to confront. Its combination of physical power, crowd control options, and immunity to flanking make it a unique challenge that requires careful strategy to defeat.
