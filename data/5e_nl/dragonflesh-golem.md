The Dragonflesh Golem is a formidable large construct that serves as a significant adversary in combat. With a robust armor class of 18 and a total of 115 hit points from an average of rolling 11 ten-sided dice plus an additional 55 points, it is a resilient foe. This golem's challenge rating of 10 signifies it poses a serious threat, capable of delivering substantial damage while also withstanding various forms of attack. It has exceptionally high strength (22, +6), allowing it to hit with powerful melee attacks, and a very good constitution (20, +5) that contributes to its durability. However, its low dexterity (7, -2) makes it less agile in combat, which is its primary weakness, alongside a very low intelligence, charisma, and wisdom, indicating a lack of strategic capability and social interaction.

The Dragonflesh Golem boasts several impressive abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. It has an immutable form, meaning it cannot be affected by spells or effects that alter its form, providing a strong defensive mechanism against many magical influences. Additionally, it benefits from magic resistance, giving it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it hard to control or incapacitate. Its attacks are all considered magical, which allows it to bypass the resistance of many other creatures. 

In terms of action options, the Dragonflesh Golem can utilize a multiattack strategy on its turn, which allows it to employ its Terror Stare followed by two melee attacks, one with its bite and another with its claws. The bite attack has a hit bonus of +10 and does an average of 17 piercing damage with an additional 3 fire damage, while its claw attack also has a +10 hit bonus and delivers an impressive average of 16 slashing damage. 

Terror Stare serves as a unique special attack where the golem can select a creature within 30 feet that can see it. The target must pass a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. This can severely hinder a target's effectiveness in battle as frightened creatures may become overly cautious or unable to attack the golem. Even if a creature successfully saves, they cannot be subjected to this effect again for 24 hours.

Additionally, the Dragonflesh Golem possesses an Elemental Breath attack that deals significant area damage. When this ability is available, it can unleash a 30-foot cone of elemental energy, forcing all creatures within it to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, targets incur 21 points of damage from fire and an additional 21 damage from a randomly determined type (acid, cold, lightning, or poison). A successful save halves the damage taken, making this a potentially devastating multi-type attack.

Overall, the Dragonflesh Golem is a powerful construct that utilizes both its physical strength and magical resilience to dominate the battlefield, presenting a unique set of challenges for any adventurers faced with it.
