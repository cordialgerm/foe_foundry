The Living Soot is a large elemental creature that embodies the chaotic and hazardous nature of soot and ash. Its primary role in combat is as a damaging and controlling presence on the battlefield, utilizing its ability to move through tight spaces and engulf opponents in toxic fumes. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of Hit Points at 142 (which is derived from 15d10 plus an additional 60 hit points), the Living Soot proves to be a resilient adversary, capable of enduring significant damage. Its Challenge Rating of 7 indicates that it poses a moderate challenge to a party of adventurers, offering 2,900 experience points upon defeat. The Living Soot possesses various strengths, such as the ability to fly at a speed of 50 feet and it is immune to fire and poison damage, which enhances its longevity in combat. However, it is vulnerable to cold damage, as this temporarily reduces its mobility and defensive capabilities. Notably, it has a low Intelligence and Charisma, indicating its limited ability to engage in higher-level strategies or social interactions.

The Living Soot's attributes reflect its capabilities in battle. It has a Strength of 15, granting a good modifier of +2 for physical attacks. Its Dexterity is exceptional at 20, providing a +5 modifier, which significantly enhances its ability to evade attacks and act swiftly. The Constitution score of 19 gives it a very good +4 modifier, resulting in higher resilience to conditions affecting health. The low Intelligence score of 6 results in a poor -2 modifier, meaning it cannot effectively analyze situations or engage in complex reasoning. A Wisdom score of 10 indicates average perception and insight abilities, with a +0 modifier. With a Charisma of 8, the Living Soot has a bad -1 modifier, impacting any interactions requiring social or performance skills.

Several special abilities enhance the Living Soot’s combat effectiveness. Its "Brittle" ability allows it to partially freeze when exposed to cold damage, reducing its speed by 10 feet and lowering its Armor Class by 2 until the end of its next turn, which can be exploited by opponents who can deal cold damage. The "Choking Air Form" special ability permits it to move into the space of a hostile creature, causing damage and restricting breathing for anyone starting their turn in the same space, with a Constitution saving throw required to negate the effects. The "Elemental Nature" ability signifies that the Living Soot does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, which can allow it to operate independently of traditional needs. Lastly, its "False Appearance" ability allows it to remain motionless and become indistinguishable from a tangled mass of blackened, dusty webbing, aiding in stealth and ambush tactics.

In terms of actions, the Living Soot can engage in a Multiattack, allowing it to either make two Slam attacks or one Slam and one Constrict attack in a single turn. The Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, dealing 14 (2d8+5) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage. The Constrict attack also has a +8 to hit and deals the same bludgeoning damage, but it grapples the target (with an escape DC of 15), restraining them until the grapple ends. 

One of the creature's most formidable actions, "Engulfing Sootstorm," can be used once every four to six rounds, representing a substantial threat. When activated, the Living Soot spins violently to create tendrils of thick, poisonous ash. Any creature within a 20-foot radius takes 21 (6d6) poison damage, and their speed is halved. A Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) allows creatures to take half damage and avoid the speed reduction, which remains in effect until they use an action to clear off the soot. This ability exemplifies the Living Soot's capacity to control terrain and hinder the movement of its foes.
