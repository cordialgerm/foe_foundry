The Kobold is a small humanoid creature that embodies cunning and teamwork. While it possesses low resilience with only 9 hit points and a mediocre armor class of 12, its strengths lie in agility and cooperative tactics. Kobolds are particularly effective in groups due to their special ability known as Pack Tactics, which grants them an advantage when attacking alongside their allies. However, their weak physical attributes and sensitivity to sunlight pose notable weaknesses. Overall, Kobolds are best utilized in ambushes or when they can leverage their numerical advantage against unsuspecting foes.

The Kobold has the following ability scores: Strength at -2 (very bad), Dexterity at +4 (very good), Constitution at -1 (bad), Intelligence at -1 (bad), Wisdom at -2 (very bad), and Charisma at -1 (bad). This array makes the Kobold extremely nimble, allowing it to be effective in stealth situations but lacking in physical prowess and magical aptitude.

In terms of senses, the Kobold has darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light. Its Perception score is 8, which is average for a creature of its size, but it excels in Stealth with a score of 14, indicating a very good ability to hide and remain undetected. The Kobold can communicate in both Common and Draconic, giving it access to two primary languages for interaction with different groups.

The Kobold has two special abilities: Pack Tactics and Sunlight Sensitivity. Pack Tactics allows it to roll advantage on attack rolls against a creature when at least one ally is nearby, significantly increasing its chances to hit in group encounters. Sunlight Sensitivity, conversely, is a drawback that grants disadvantage on attack rolls in sunlight and reduces its Perception score to 3 when relying on sight, making it vulnerable in bright conditions.

For its actions, the Kobold can attack with a Dagger or a Sling. The Dagger can be used for melee or ranged attacks, with a +4 modifier to hit, and deals 4 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Sling is a ranged weapon attack with the same +4 modifier, capable of reaching targets up to 120 feet away, dealing 4 bludgeoning damage. Both attacks allow the Kobold to engage effectively from a distance or in melee as needed.

Additionally, the Kobold has a useful bonus action called Scurry. This ability permits the Kobold to move up to 15 feet without triggering opportunity attacks, allowing for strategic repositioning during combat. If the Kobold is aware of nearby traps, it has the option to avoid triggering them while using this movement, enhancing its survivability and tactical agility.
