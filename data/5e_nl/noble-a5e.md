The Noble is a Medium humanoid creature, serving as a representation of aristocracy and political influence in the game world. With an Armor Class of 15 and moderate hit points of 13, the Noble is relatively durable for a low-level character, allowing them to engage in conversations, negotiations, or light combat. Its Challenge Rating of 1/4 suggests that it is not a significant threat in combat but could provide minor obstacles to unprepared adventurers. The Noble's strengths lie in its Charisma and social skills, making it a good diplomat or performer, while its physical combat abilities are more limited. Notable weaknesses include average attributes for melee combat and a reliance on social skills, leaving them vulnerable to direct confrontation.

The Noble's attributes are as follows: Strength is 10, which is average, affording no modifiers for physical tasks. Dexterity is 12, translating to a good +1 modifier, providing a slight increase in agility and finesse. Constitution is again average at 10, showing that the Noble has normal fortitude. Intelligence is 10, marking it as average and showing no strengths or weaknesses in understanding or knowledge tasks. Wisdom stands at 12, granting a good +1 modifier, while Charisma is 14, providing an exceptional +2 modifier, the source of the Noble's skills and social prowess.

The Noble possesses several skills that enhance its role in social interactions and protectiveness. Deception is particularly strong at +4, allowing the Noble to easily mislead others. History and Insight are at +2 and +3 respectively, giving the Noble an understanding of lore and the ability to discern truthfulness. Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion are all at +4, showcasing the Nobleâ€™s capacity to influence others through fear, art, and charm. The Noble has a passive Perception score of 11, which is average, allowing it to notice things around them competently. The ability to speak any two languages grants a versatility in communication.

In terms of actions, the Noble can attack with a rapier, which is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, indicating a good chance to successfully strike an opponent within a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, the rapier deals 5 piercing damage, which is a decent amount for a low-level creature.

Additionally, the Noble has a useful reaction called Parry. If the Noble is wielding a melee weapon and can see the attacker, they can add 2 to their Armor Class against one melee attack that would hit them. This ability makes them a bit more resilient in combat by potentially turning a hit into a miss, compensating for their otherwise lower combat effectiveness.
