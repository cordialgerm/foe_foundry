The Púca is a large fey creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It serves as a cunning manipulator, preying upon unsuspecting travelers with its beguiling abilities. With a moderate armor class of 12 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 142 from 19d10+38, the Púca can endure significant damage while also posing a considerable threat in combat. It has a nimble speed of 50 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively during encounters. The creature's challenge rating of 7 reflects its capability to contend with mid-level adventurers, providing 2,900 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths lie in its high Strength and Charisma scores, allowing it to deliver powerful physical attacks while charming its foes. However, its weaknesses include average Wisdom, which may make it susceptible to certain forms of magic, and it is also vulnerable to attacks made with cold iron weapons.

The Púca possesses the following attributes: a Strength score of 19 provides a +4 modifier, equating to a very good effectiveness in physical confrontations; Dexterity at 14 grants a +2 modifier, presenting a good level of agility; Constitution at 15 gives it a +2 modifier, indicating a good level of resilience; Intelligence at 12 results in an average +1 modifier; Wisdom at a flat 10 yields a neutral effect with a +0 modifier; and a Charisma of 18 offers a +4 modifier, making it exceptionally potent in charm-related abilities.

In terms of defensive capabilities, the Púca benefits from saving throw bonuses with a +7 in both Strength and Charisma, marking these topics as very good areas of effectiveness. However, its perception skills are at a baseline of +0, meaning it is average in noticing hidden creatures or traps. The creature has damage resistances to nonmagic bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, provided they are not made with cold iron, giving it an edge against typical weaponry. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light up to 30 feet, and it has a passive perception score of 13, indicating average awareness.

The Púca has proficiency in the Sylvan and Umbral languages, enabling it to communicate effectively with creatures familiar with these tongues.

Regarding special abilities, the Púca has a "Beguiling Aura" that charms any creature that can see it and starts its turn within 30 feet, compelling them to dash toward it in an attempt to mount the creature. The charm lasts for one minute unless the target succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to negate the effect. Damage taken during this period allows for repeated saving throws at the end of each turn, and success grants immunity to the Púca’s charm for the next 24 hours.

Additionally, the "Nightmarish Ride" ability enables the Púca to paralyze and restrain any creature that mounts it, using a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to escape. While it has a captured rider, the Púca maneuvers quickly, either dashing or disengaging, to flee with the rider. After moving 100 feet, the Púca and the rider disappear, travelling through a nightmarish landscape until returning at dawn, when the rider suffers a level of exhaustion upon their return.

For actions during combat, the Púca can perform a "Multiattack," using two Chain Whip attacks and one Hooves attack in a single turn. The "Chain Whip" attack has an attack modifier of +7 and can grapple a medium or smaller target with escape DC 15, inflicting 15 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit and restraining the target. The "Hooves" attack also uses a +7 to hit and deals 13 bludgeoning damage. If a target fails a DC 15 Strength saving throw, they are knocked prone, which can significantly alter their positional advantage in a fight.
