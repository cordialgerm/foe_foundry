The Vampire is a formidable Medium undead creature classified as a shapechanger, known for its versatility and terrifying abilities. With a high Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of 177 hit points, it stands as a resilient threat on the battlefield. The Vampire's challenge rating of 13 signifies its potential power and difficulty in combat scenarios. Its key strengths include a high Dexterity and Charisma, granting it exceptional stealth abilities and charm magic. However, the creature faces weaknesses, particularly when exposed to radiant damage or holy water. Its unique mechanics allow it to regain health rapidly through its regeneration ability and can easily escape certain death by transforming into mist before reaching 0 hit points, provided it avoids sunlight or running water.

The Vampire possesses the following attributes, which indicate its capabilities and effectiveness in combat: Strength +4 (average), Dexterity +9 (exceptional), Constitution +4 (average), Intelligence +3 (average), Wisdom +7 (good), and Charisma +9 (exceptional). Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet, which allows it to see in darkness as if it were bright light. The Perception score of 17 showcases its keen awareness, while the Stealth score of 19 provides a very good chance of remaining undetected. It is able to communicate in the languages it knew in life.

The Vampire has several special abilities that enhance its survivability and power. Its Hungry Dead Nature ability means it does not require air or sleep, but must consume a significant amount of blood every day to maintain its abilities. Failing to do so results in exhaustion, making this a critical aspect of its gameplay. With Legendary Resistance available three times per day, the Vampire can automatically succeed on saving throws it would normally fail, demonstrating an exceptional degree of resilience. Misty Escape allows the Vampire to turn into a mist when it is about to be incapacitated, granting it the chance to escape and recover at its resting place. Regeneration is a powerful ability that allows the Vampire to regain 20 hit points at the start of its turn, as long as it is not damaged by certain sources. Finally, the Resting Place ability highlights the Vampire's need for a designated area to recover and regain its strength.

In combat, the Vampire can take multiple actions due to its Multiattack feature. It can use its Charm ability on a nearby humanoid, forcing them to make a saving throw to avoid being charmed, putting them under its control for a day. The Bite attack, usable in its bat, rat, or wolf forms, inflicts piercing and necrotic damage, while the Claw attack, only usable in its vampire form, does similar damage but is slashing instead. The Draining Bite allows the Vampire to reduce a creature’s hit point maximum while healing itself, creating devastating effects if used strategically. Children of the Night enables the Vampire to call swarms of bats, rats, or wolves to assist in battle, providing reinforcements and complicating encounters for its enemies.

The Vampire also has notable bonus actions, such as Change Shape, allowing it to transform into smaller animals and Mist Form, which provides a range of defensive benefits while in mist state. In terms of legendary actions, it can move without being hindered, summon minions with Children of the Night, or cause excessive bleeding to surrounding enemies, making it a multifaceted threat.

Lastly, the Vampire has regional effects that come into play in areas it haunts, ensuring its influence is felt even beyond its immediate presence, adding an additional layer of challenge for adventurers confronting it.
