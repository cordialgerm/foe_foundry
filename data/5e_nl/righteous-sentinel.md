The Righteous Sentinel is a powerful large construct that embodies the lawful good alignment. It serves as a steadfast guardian, effectively combining strong defensive and offensive capabilities. With an armor class of 15 and 104 hit points, it presents a challenging foe. The sentinel excels in melee combat with high strength, having a +5 modifier, while it has notable defenses against a multitude of conditions and forms, making it an exceptional protector. Its main weaknesses lie in its vulnerability to thunder damage and its limited dexterity, which is average at +0. The sentinel's notable special abilities enhance its combat prowess, allowing it to not only absorb damage but also reflect spells back at their casters.

The Righteous Sentinel has the following attributes: 

- Strength: 21 (+5) - This value is very good and contributes significantly to its attack power.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0) - With this average modifier, the sentinel lacks agility.
- Constitution: 18 (+4) - This is a very good attribute, providing substantial resilience.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1) - This low score is very bad, indicating the sentinel's limited cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 11 (+0) - This average score gives it a standard perception level.
- Charisma: 3 (-4) - With this very bad modifier, the sentinel is not capable of social interaction.

In terms of skills, the Righteous Sentinel has proficiency in perception, granting it a bonus of +6 to perceive its surroundings effectively. The sentinel is immune to both poison and psychic damage and is also protected from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks unless they are made with adamantine weapons. Additionally, it is immune to several debilitating conditions such as being charmed, frightened, or poisoned. Its senses include darkvision, allowing it to see in the dark up to 120 feet, and it has a passive perception score of 16.

The sentinel possesses several special abilities:

- Immutable Form means it cannot be affected by spells that change its form, enhancing its resilience.
- Magic Resistance grants advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it a formidable opponent against spellcasters.
- Magic Weapons ensure all its weapon attacks are considered magical, bypassing the resistance or immunity of some creatures.
- Reflective Aggression affects its attack rolls depending on the recent damage dealt to it. It has disadvantage on attacks against targets that havenâ€™t attacked it in the last minute, but it gains advantage when retaliating against those that have dealt damage.
- The Spell-Deflecting Mirror allows it to potentially reflect ranged spells back to their casters, adding a strategic layer to combat, as it disrupts magical offenses directed at it.

In combat, the Righteous Sentinel can take the following actions:

- Multiattack allows the sentinel to make two separate slam attacks on its turn, increasing its damage output.
- Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 16 bludgeoning damage (2d10 + 5) on a successful hit.
- Warp Reflection is a more advanced ability that targets a creature within 30 feet, requiring the target to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If failed, the target takes 22 psychic damage (4d10) and becomes frightened for a minute. Additionally, if the target is evil-aligned, it has disadvantage on this saving throw. If the frightened condition is in effect, the target continues to take damage each round until it succeeds on a saving throw to end the condition.

For its reactions, the Righteous Sentinel has Reflective Retribution, allowing it to enhance its AC by 3 against one melee attack it can see. If this defensive move causes the attack to miss, the attacker then suffers 11 psychic damage (2d10) as a form of retaliation. This further emphasizes the sentinel's capability to counterattack and deter opponents effectively.
