The Sathaq Worm is a massive elemental creature characterized by its neutrality and evil nature. This huge worm boasts impressive power with a strong constitution and a formidable array of abilities that make it a dangerous opponent in combat. Its strengths lie in its high hit points, strong melee attacks, and special abilities that can debilitate foes while it remains largely impervious to common forms of damage. However, it suffers from low dexterity, making it less agile compared to other foes, and its intelligence is also quite low, hindering its tactical capabilities. The Sathaq Worm is particularly effective in terrain it can camouflage into, using its ability to move through earth and stone to ambush unsuspecting adventurers. 

The Sathaq Worm has an Armor Class of 16, which is considered good, and it possesses impressive hit points amounting to 149, providing it with a very good level of durability in battle. It can move at a speed of 40 feet on the ground and burrow through nonmagical earth and stone at a speed of 20 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 10, it is suited for encounters against parties with a moderate level of experience and power.

In terms of attributes, the Sathaq Worm has a Strength score of 22, granting it a +6 modifier which is exceptional, making it a powerful melee attacker. Its Dexterity score is quite low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, which is very bad, affecting its ability to evade attacks. The Constitution score stands at 20, providing it with a +5 modifier, categorized as very good, ensuring it withstands considerable damage. Intelligence is significantly low at 5, translating to a -3 modifier, which is very bad for any strategy or skill use. It has a Wisdom score of 12, with a +1 modifier considered average, useful for perception checks. Lastly, its Charisma is 9, resulting in a -1 modifier classified as bad, indicating limited effectiveness in social interactions or manipulation of other creatures.

The Sathaq Worm has various resistances and immunities that enhance its survivability. It is immune to acid and poison damage, which is highly advantageous in many encounters. Additionally, it resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks, making it hard to harm without magical equipment. It is also immune to conditions such as exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, and poison. On the sensory front, it possesses tremorsense up to 60 feet and has a passive Perception score of 15, allowing it to detect movements in its vicinity effectively. While it understands languages like Deep Speech and Terran, it is unable to speak, which limits its communication abilities.

The Sathaq Worm's special abilities significantly impact the dynamics of combat. The **Agonizing Aura** creates an area of debilitating ultrasonic noise and vibrations; creatures starting their turn within 15 feet must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on attack rolls, making it especially disruptive to foes. The **Earth Glide** ability allows the worm to burrow through earth and stone without leaving a trace, enabling it to evade detection and surprise its enemies. With **Earthen Camouflage**, it gains advantage on Stealth checks in certain terrains, enhancing its ability to remain hidden. Finally, its **Siege Monster** ability lets it deal double damage to structures, making it especially effective against fortifications.

In combat, the Sathaq Worm uses the **Multiattack** action to perform a combination of attacks, either making one Bite attack and two Slam attacks or just three Slam attacks. The **Bite** attack has a +10 to hit and deals 24 piercing damage while also grappling the target with an escape DC of 17, rendering them restrained. The **Slam** attack, also with a +10 to hit, deals 19 bludgeoning damage. Notably, the Sathaq Worm can use **Swallow** on a creature it has grappled that is Large or smaller; if it successfully bites the target, it swallows them, inflicting ongoing damage and blinding and restraining the swallowed creature until it escapes. This ability emphasizes the threat the Sathaq Worm poses, as it can incapacitate foes while continuing to damage them internally.
