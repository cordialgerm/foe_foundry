The Bard is a Medium humanoid character known for its versatility and charm, embodying the role of a support character while still being able to hold its own in combat. With an Armor Class of 15 and a solid pool of 114 hit points, the Bard is reasonably durable on the battlefield. Its strengths include exceptional dexterity and charisma, granting it a +6 modifier to Dexterity and a +7 modifier to Charisma, which allows the Bard to excel in both ranged and spellcasting attacks. However, its physical strength is average at +0, making it less effective in melee engagements without relying on its agile talents. The Bard's unique abilities allow it to deal significant extra damage through its artistic expression and manipulate the battlefield through powerful spells and abilities. Notable strengths include strong crowd control potential and support, but its reliance on spell slots and recharge mechanics can limit its output in prolonged encounters.

The Bard has the following attributes: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 22 (+6, very good for ranged and stealth), Constitution 12 (+1, average durability), Intelligence 14 (+2, average utility), Wisdom 12 (+1, average perception), and Charisma 20 (+7, exceptional for spellcasting). These values provide a good balance of offense, defense, and utility, particularly through its charisma which serves as the main spellcasting ability.

In terms of special abilities, the Bard has two prominent ones. The first, Artistic Expression, determines a damage type resistance based on the Bard's chosen form of art. For instance, if the Bard chooses song, it gains resistance to thunder damage. The second ability, Expressive Weapons, allows the Bard's weapon attacks to deal an additional 3d8 damage of the type associated with its artistic expression, significantly increasing its damage output.

For actions, the Bard can perform a Multiattack, making two attacks with either a Rapier or a Hand Crossbow. The melee attack using the Rapier has a +6 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage plus the additional damage determined by Artistic Expression, while the Hand Crossbow also offers +6 to hit and deals 6 piercing damage plus the extra 3d8 damage. 

The Bard also has the Dissonant Outburst ability, which can be used once every four to six rounds. This area effect attack forces creatures within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 15. On failure, they take 14 thunder damage and 7 psychic damage, and suffer disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, they take half damage and do not suffer any disadvantages.

The Bard's spellcasting includes a variety of utility and control spells, employing Charisma as the spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 15. At will, the Bard can use spells like Dancing Lights, Mage Hand, and Message that provide excellent utility and utility. It can cast Faerie Fire, Hold Person, and Suggestion three times per day, each providing powerful options for crowd control and strategic advantage in combat. Once per day, the Bard can cast Confusion and Greater Invisibility, which are potent spells for chaotic and sneaky tactics, ideal for helping the Bard evade danger or disrupt enemy operations during crucial moments in battle.
