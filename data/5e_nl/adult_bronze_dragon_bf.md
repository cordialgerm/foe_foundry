The Adult Bronze Dragon is a formidable and ancient creature, known for its mastery of lightning and its ability to manipulate the battlefield. Standing as a guardian of coastal and aquatic domains, this huge dragon possesses a blend of physical prowess and magical capabilities, making it a challenging adversary for any adventuring party. Its impressive armor class of 19, along with a substantial pool of hit points totaling 255, ensures that it can withstand significant damage in combat. While it excels in melee attacks with multiple options to inflict damage, its key strengths lie in its ability to control opponents through fear and repulsion, making it a master of strategic positioning. However, this dragon is still vulnerable to sufficiently high damage output, particularly if not adequately protected against incoming attacks.

The Adult Bronze Dragon boasts strong physical attributes: it has a Strength score of +7 (very good), Dexterity of +5 (good), Constitution of +11 (exceptional), Intelligence of +3 (average), Wisdom of +7 (very good), and Charisma of +9 (exceptional). With a high Constitution, the dragon is particularly resilient, allowing it to endure long engagements. Its darkvision of 120 feet and keen senses provide it with excellent perception abilities, with a Perception score of 22, enabling it to detect hidden enemies. Additionally, a Stealth score of 15 allows it to approach unsuspecting foes quietly, although its size may hinder its stealthy maneuvers in certain environments.

This dragon possesses several significant abilities: it is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water with ease; it has Legendary Resistance, permitting it to choose to succeed on saving throws it would normally fail, usable three times per day; and it possesses a powerful area effect ability called Lightning Extraction, affecting creatures within a 20-foot radius with a DC of 19.

In terms of attacks, the Adult Bronze Dragon can perform a Multiattack, using its Frightful Presence followed by one Bite and two Claw attacks. Its Bite attack has a +12 to hit and deals 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage on a successful hit. Its Claw attacks also have a +12 to hit, dealing 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage each. Additionally, it can use a Tail attack, also with a +12 to hit, which inflicts 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. The Frightful Presence ability forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute, a powerful tool for controlling the battlefield. If the frightened creature succeeds on the saving throw, it becomes immune to the effect for the next 24 hours.

The dragon has notable breath weapons: the Lightning Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 to 6, allows it to exhale lightning in a 90-foot line. Creatures within the line must make a DC 19 Dexterity save or take 60 (11d10) lightning damage, halving it on a successful save. Its Repulsion Breath, which recharges on a roll of 6, exudes a 60-foot cone of energy, requiring creatures to make a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 30 feet away from the dragon.

Additionally, the dragon can act using bonus actions to change shape into a beast or humanoid of similar challenge rating, retaining its core characteristics while in a new form. This ability adds tactical variety during encounters or interactions. 

The Adult Bronze Dragon can also take legendary actions, allowing it to perform actions at the end of other creatures’ turns. It can use Detect to pinpoint creatures and traps nearby, execute a Tail Attack, unleash an Elemental Roar that makes targets vulnerable to lightning damage, or perform a Wing Attack to deal bludgeoning damage and potentially knock opponents prone.

Overall, the Adult Bronze Dragon is a complex foe with great battlefield control, significant damage potential, and impressive magical resistance, making it a noteworthy challenge for any adventurers who dare to confront it.
