Notably, the Monkey King has advanced abilities that make it resistant to many forms of magical effects, and its legendary actions allow it to dominate the battlefield with speed and ferocity. While its strengths are considerable, its challenges in terms of physical confrontation and charisma can be exploited by tactful players.

In terms of skills, it excels in acrobatics with a +14 modifier, deception with +10, insight and perception both at +12, and stealth again at +14, showcasing its versatility in both combat and social situations. The Monkey King is immune to necrotic, poison, and radiant damage, and it also cannot be charmed, frightened, poisoned, or stunned, making it highly resilient in various encounters. Its senses include truesight up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 22, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without hindrance. It can communicate in Celestial, Common, and Simian languages.

The Monkey King is equipped with several special abilities. It has Legendary Resistance usable three times a day, allowing it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw. This makes it exceptionally durable against effects that would otherwise incapacitate it. With Magic Resistance, it gains advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further enhancing its defense. The Simian Affinity ability allows it to communicate and control primates within a specified range, which can potentially turn allies into enemies or bolster its own forces in combat.

In terms of actions, the Monkey King can perform a Multiattack to make three golden staff attacks or a combination of two golden staff attacks and one tail attack. The Golden Staff is a melee weapon attack with a +14 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing significant damage of 18 bludgeoning alongside 7 radiant damage when it hits. The Enlightened Ray is a ranged spell attack with a +12 to hit and a range of 100 feet, dealing 18 radiant damage and stunning the target if they fail a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. The Tail attack also allows for a melee weapon strike with the same +14 modifier, dealing 16 bludgeoning damage and potentially knocking the target prone if they fail a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw.

As for reactions, Drunken Dodge lets the Monkey King gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the end of the turn when it is hit by a weapon attack. This ability can significantly mitigate damage during combat, allowing it to sustain longer.

The Monkey King has access to legendary actions, which enable it to act outside of its turn and increase its threat level. Great Leap permits it to move up to its speed without provoking attacks of opportunity. Quick Staff allows it to make an additional golden staff attack. Golden Burst, which costs three legendary actions, targets creatures within 10 feet with a DC 18 Charisma saving throw, dealing a heavy 36 radiant damage on a failed save or half damage on success. This action can potentially devastate multiple adversaries surrounding the Monkey King, making it a key strategic option in combat.
