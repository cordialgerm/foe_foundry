The Nullicorn is a Large aberration that embodies chaotic evil and serves as a formidable adversary in combat scenarios. With an Armor Class of 12 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 105, it can withstand considerable damage while dishing out its own through powerful melee and magical attacks. The creature's Challenge Rating of 5 indicates it is an appropriate challenge for mid-level adventurers. Key strengths include its high Strength and Wisdom, providing strong melee capabilities and perceptive awareness on the battlefield. The Nullicorn is particularly notable for its unique abilities, such as Magic Evasion and Limited Magic Immunity, allowing it to resist or negate magical effects. However, its somewhat moderate Dexterity and Intelligence could be considered weaknesses, particularly in scenarios requiring agility or intelligence-based skills.

The Nullicorn has the following attributes: 
- Strength of 18 (+4 modifier, which is very good)
- Dexterity of 14 (+2 modifier, which is average)
- Constitution of 15 (+2 modifier, which is good)
- Intelligence of 11 (+0 modifier, which is average)
- Wisdom of 17 (+3 modifier, which is good)
- Charisma of 16 (+3 modifier, which is good)

The creature has a proficiency in the skill of Perception with a +3 bonus, which is considered good. It is immune to necrotic and poison damage, as well as immune to conditions like charmed, paralyzed, and poisoned. It possesses blindsight up to 120 feet and can communicate in Celestial, Elvish, Sylvan, and through telepathy within 60 feet.

The Nullicorn's special abilities further enhance its capabilities in battle:
- **Magic Evasion:** When subjected to spells or magical effects that allow a saving throw for half damage, the Nullicorn takes no damage on a successful save and only half damage if it fails, making this ability exceptional.
- **Limited Magic Immunity:** At the end of its turn, all spells or magical effects with a duration affecting the Nullicorn immediately end, demonstrating significant control over its magical environment.
- **Magic Resistance:** With advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, the Nullicorn possesses exceptional durability against magical attacks.
- **Nullifying Blight:** This disease afflicts creatures that come into contact with the Nullicorn's magic. Infected creatures suffer from negative effects when using magic, including losing Hit Points and the requirement to make saving throws to avoid worsening their condition. This mechanic adds strategic depth to encounters with the Nullicorn.
- **Sense Magic:** This ability allows the Nullicorn to detect magic within 120 feet at will, functioning similarly to the detect magic spell but without being magical itself.

As for its actions during battle, the Nullicorn can execute the following:
- **Multiattack:** The Nullicorn can make two melee attacks with its Hooves and one attack using its Void Horn in a single turn, making it an aggressive combatant.
- **Hooves Attack:** This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit and deals 11 (2d6+4) bludgeoning damage, which is very good for close-range combat.
- **Void Horn Attack:** Another melee weapon attack that also has a +7 to hit and inflicts 8 (1d8+4) force damage, additionally forcing a DC 13 Constitution saving throw on the target, who risks contracting the Nullifying Blight disease if they fail.
- **Ripple of Darkness:** A powerful area effect that deals 18 (4d8) necrotic damage to each creature within a 20-foot radius and has the potential to contract Nullifying Blight, with the same DC 13 Constitution saving throw. This ability can change the dynamics of a battle by affecting multiple targets at once.

Overall, the Nullicorn represents a versatile and dangerous opponent, with strong physical attacks, unique magical resistance, and debilitating effects that can severely hinder adventurers.
