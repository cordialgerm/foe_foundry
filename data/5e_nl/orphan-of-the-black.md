The Orphan of the Black is a small fey creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It is a cunning and manipulative being that thrives on chaos and violence, taking advantage of its abilities to incite conflict among others. With decent defensive capabilities, the Orphan of the Black can absorb damage effectively, but it is primarily adept at influencing and controlling the actions of others. Its main strengths lie in its agility and unique powers, allowing it to resist various conditions and manipulate the battlefield. However, it has low physical strength and intelligence, which may limit its direct combat effectiveness. 

In terms of attributes, the Orphan of the Black has the following values: 

- Strength: 10, which is average and means it is not physically strong. 
- Dexterity: 16, with a +3 modifier that is good, allowing it to dodge attacks and act quickly.
- Constitution: 14, providing it with a +2 modifier that is average, ensuring it can take some damage in battle.
- Intelligence: 8, with a -1 modifier that is bad, indicating it lacks mental acuity.
- Wisdom: 10, which is average, suggesting it has no particular strengths or weaknesses in perception or insight.
- Charisma: 13, with a +1 modifier that is average, giving it some ability to charm but not exceptionally so.

The creature possesses several special abilities that enhance its role in encounters. 

- Forbiddance prevents the Orphan of the Black from entering any residence without an invitation, enforcing its reliance on manipulation to gain access to places.
- Sense Law allows the Orphan to locate lawful creatures within a 30-foot range, which can be used strategically to target enemies that may be particularly susceptible to its abilities.
- Transmit Pain forces any creature that successfully strikes the Orphan in melee to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the attacker takes 7 psychic damage, adding a layer of risk to physically engaging the Orphan.

In combat, the Orphan of the Black can perform the Multiattack action, enabling it to make two melee attacks in one turn. Its primary melee capability is the Slam attack, which has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, causing 6 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

One of its notable special actions is Incite Violence, which requires a recharge on rolls of 5 or 6. This ability compels a creature within 15 feet to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target must use its action to attack the nearest creature other than the Orphan of the Black on its next turn. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes 7 psychic damage instead. Notably, creatures that are immune to charm effects are unaffected by this ability, allowing it to strategically target vulnerable foes.

Overall, the Orphan of the Black plays a unique role in encounters, manipulating others to turn on each other and encouraging a chaotic environment while remaining relatively elusive itself.
