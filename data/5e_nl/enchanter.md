The Enchanter is a Medium humanoid with a versatile role in combat, primarily focused on manipulating and controlling opponents through powerful enchantments and spells. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it boasts notable strengths, including high Intelligence and Charisma, making it an exceptional spellcaster; this allows for effective crowd control and damage output. Its ability to charm and incapacitate enemies is formidable, while it benefits from enhanced defenses against charm effects itself. However, its defenses are somewhat limited with an Armor Class of 12, which can be bolstered to 15 when using mage armor. The Enchanter has moderate hit points, totaling 58, making it resilient but not invulnerable. Its array of spells, ranging from defensive measures to debilitating enchantments, provides it significant tactical versatility, but it relies heavily on these spells to maximize its effectiveness in combat.

The Enchanter's attributes are as follows: Strength is average at 10, Dexterity is good at 14 (+2), Constitution is average at 10, Intelligence is very good at 19 (+4), Wisdom is average at 13 (+1), and Charisma is very good at 19 (+4). The Enchanter has saving throws that offer a good +7 bonus in Intelligence and Charisma. Additionally, it boasts skills in arcana and history at +7, and a perception of +4, with darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 14. The Enchanter is proficient in Common, Elvish, and Sylvan languages.

One of the special abilities of the Enchanter is Fey Ancestry, which grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed and immunity to magical sleep effects. This ability enhances its durability against similar enchantments cast by other creatures. Additionally, the Reach of the Fey ability allows the Enchanter, when casting an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that targets one creature, to instead target all creatures within a 10-foot radius, increasing its area of influence significantly.

As a 13th-level spellcaster, the Enchanter uses Intelligence as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 15 and a +7 bonus to hit with spell attacks. It has prepared various spells across different levels, including cantrips like dancing lights, friends, and mage hand at will. At 1st level, it can cast charm person, hideous laughter, and magic missile; at 2nd level, it has access to hold person, invisibility, and suggestion; and at 3rd level, it can use hypnotic pattern and lightning bolt. Higher-level spells include confusion and dominate person at 5th level, as well as chain lightning and prismatic spray at 6th and 7th levels respectively. Many of these spells can incapacitate foes, create illusions, or hinder enemy movement, greatly impacting gameplay dynamics.

In terms of actions during combat, the Enchanter wields a dagger, with a melee attack bonus of +5 to hit. The dagger deals 4 piercing damage on a successful hit. One of its pivotal abilities is the Captivating Gaze, which allows it to target a creature within 30 feet. That target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for one minute; while charmed, the target cannot move and is incapacitated, reducing its speed to zero. The target also must spend each turn staring at the Enchanter, effectively blinding it to other threats. The charm effect can be broken through saving throws at the end of each turn, but damage from the Enchanter’s allies grants a bonus on the next saving throw, prolonging the incapacitation potential. 

The Enchanter also possesses the Beguiling Parry reaction, which it can use when a creature it can see targets it with an attack. The attacker must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw; failure means the attacker is unable to proceed with their attack. This reaction prevents the attacker from targeting the Enchanter again until the start of their next turn, potentially influencing the flow of combat and providing the Enchanter an opportunity to reposition or use its spells strategically.
