The Niya-Atha Warrior is a medium-sized fey creature characterized by its lawful neutral alignment. This being thrives in agile combat with a unique ability to enlarge itself, making it a formidable foe on the battlefield. With an armor class of 16, it is relatively resilient, able to withstand a decent amount of damage with its 49 hit points, rolled as 9d8 plus an additional 9. The warrior exhibits moderate strength and dexterity, both rated at 14 and 15 respectively, which makes it good at both attacking and evading enemies. The creature is equipped with notable agility in movement, capable of walking and climbing at a speed of 30 feet each. Its Challenge Rating of 2 indicates a moderate level of difficulty for adventurers, allowing it to present a challenge without overwhelming lower-level characters.

The ability scores for the Niya-Atha Warrior are as follows: Strength at 14 gives it a +2 modifier, Dexterity at 15 offers a +2 modifier, Constitution at 12 contributes a +1 modifier, Intelligence at 11 is neutral with a +0 modifier, Wisdom at 10 is also neutral with a +0 modifier, and Charisma at 14 provides a +2 modifier. The warrior's saving throws are strong in Dexterity with a +5 (very good) and average in Constitution with a +3 (good), which allows it to effectively evade attacks and resist physical effects. The creature possesses a passive perception score of 10, reflecting an average awareness of its surroundings. It can communicate in both Common and Sylvan languages.

In terms of special abilities, the Niya-Atha Warrior has two notable traits. The first trait, Reduce, allows the warrior to return to its normal size if it begins its turn while enlarged, doing so without needing an action. This grants it strategic flexibility during combat. The second trait, Standing Leap, provides enhanced jumping capabilities, allowing it to leap up to 20 feet horizontally and 10 feet vertically, but this ability cannot be used while it is enlarged.

When attacking, the Niya-Atha Warrior can execute a Multiattack, making two strikes with either a mace or longbow. The mace attack is a melee weapon strike with a +4 to hit, dealing 5 bludgeoning damage (1d6+2), or 9 bludgeoning damage (2d6+2) if it is enlarged. The longbow, which is a ranged attack option, has a +5 to hit with a range of 150 feet (up to 600 feet at disadvantage), inflicting 7 piercing damage (1d8+3), or 12 piercing damage (2d8+3) while enlarged.

Apart from its regular actions, the Niya-Atha Warrior can also perform a bonus action to Enlarge. This magical enlargement increases its size to Large, enhancing the damage output of its weapon attacks by doubling its damage dice. While enlarged, it gains advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, heightening its physical prowess significantly. However, this ability limits the use of its Standing Leap trait, imposing a tactical consideration during encounters. If the warrior lacks sufficient space to become Large, the Enlarge action fails, preventing it from taking advantage of its increased power.
