The Griffon is a formidable large monstrosity known for its fierce nature and aerial prowess. Standing as a challenging opponent with a Challenge Rating of 3, this creature possesses a strong combination of physical attributes, allowing it to be both a powerful predator on the ground and a fearsome hunter from the sky. With high Strength and Constitution scores, the Griffon can inflict significant damage, while its decent Dexterity offers it a good level of agility in combat. However, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are notably low, indicating that the Griffon lacks social finesse and complex thinking. Notably, its Keen Sight ability enhances its perceptive capabilities, making it adept at detecting hidden threats or prey from a distance.

The Griffon has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for its Challenge Rating, allowing it to withstand a moderate amount of damage before succumbing. It has 57 hit points, derived from rolling six ten-sided dice plus an additional 24. This offers it a good durability in battles. The creature's speed is 30 feet on the ground and a remarkable 80 feet while flying, granting it exceptional mobility to engage or disengage from foes effectively.

In terms of attributes, the Griffon's Strength is rated at 18, providing a +4 modifier, making its physical attacks very effective. Its Dexterity of 14 contributes a +2 modifier, which offers a decent level of agility but not stellar. With a Constitution of 18, it gains a +4 modifier, granting it excellent resilience in taking damage. The Intelligence score of 2 results in a -4 modifier, indicating that the creature is not capable of complex thoughts or tactics. Its Wisdom of 16 gives it a +3 modifier, allowing it to be reasonably perceptive. Finally, the Charisma of 8 translates to a -1 modifier, reflecting its lack of social interaction capabilities.

The Griffon's special ability, Keen Sight, provides it with advantage on all Perception checks that rely on sight. This allows it to greatly enhance its ability to notice and track opponents or prey, making it difficult to ambush.

When engaging in combat, the Griffon may use its Multiattack feature, allowing it to attack twice in a single turn—first with its Beak and then with its Talons. The Beak attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a 5-foot reach, dealing an average of 9 piercing damage. The Talons attack also has a +6 to hit with a 5-foot reach, dealing either an average of 7 slashing damage, or an impressive average of 11 slashing damage if the Griffon begins its turn at least 20 feet above its target and has successfully grappled it. The grapple mechanism has an escape DC of 14, meaning the target must make a successful check against this difficulty to break free. While grappling, the Griffon cannot attack other targets with its Talons, adding a layer of strategy to its combat options.
