The Sea Hag is a Medium-sized Fey creature that embodies the sinister and unsettling aspects of the sea. With an Armor Class of 14, it is moderately tough to hit in combat, and with 52 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage before being taken down. The hag can move at a speed of 30 feet on land and 40 feet in water, showcasing its amphibious nature, which allows it to thrive in both environments. As a Challenge Rating 2 creature, it poses a formidable threat to lower-level adventurers, primarily using deception, psychological manipulation, and spellcasting to overwhelm its foes. Key strengths include its high Strength and Constitution scores, coupled with strong Charisma, which aids in its spellcasting and social deception. However, its Dexterity is only average, making it less effective at avoiding attacks compared to faster foes. 

The Sea Hag's Strength is 16 (+3), making it very good at physical melee attacks; its Constitution score of 16 (+3) enhances its hit points and makes it resilient against effects that might cause it to be weakened. Dexterity at 12 (+1) is average, which impacts its ability to dodge attacks and affects ranged attacks. The hag's Intelligence is also average at 12 (+1), while its Wisdom and Charisma are both 12 (+1) and 16 (+3) respectively. The hag is effective at deception and charm-based attempts, benefitting from a good Deception modifier of +5 and a decent Insight score of +3. 

In terms of saving throws, the Sea Hag has a +5 for Constitution and +3 for Wisdom, making it good at resisting effects that impact health and bad mental statuses. It has darkvision, allowing it to see in low-light conditions for 60 feet, and possesses a passive perception of 11, which is average. The languages it speaks are Aquan, Common, and Giant, giving it a diverse means of communication.

The Sea Hag has several unique abilities that enhance its cryptic and deadly nature. The Amphibious trait allows it to easily navigate through water and breathe both air and water. The Curse ability lets the hag place a magical curse on any creature that makes a bargain with her, rendering them vulnerable to her spells for 30 days. When cursed, targets automatically fail saving throws against her scrying and geas spells, and the hag can cast Control Weather centered on the affected creature.

The hag's Innate Spellcasting, based on its Charisma (spell save DC 13), allows it to cast certain spells without needing material components. These spells include At Will spells such as Dancing Lights and Disguise Self, useful for creating illusions and manipulating perceptions, as well as more formidable spells like Control Weather, Geas, and Scrying, each usable once per day. 

In combat, the Sea Hag can use its Claws attack, where it strikes with a +5 to hit, making it good at engaging foes in melee. A successful hit inflicts 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. Additionally, it employs the Death Glare action, using its gaze to frighten enemies. A creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or else they drop to 0 hit points on a failure, or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage on a success.

As a bonus action, the Sea Hag can use Horrific Transformation, causing creatures that can see her within 30 feet to make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. Targets under her curse automatically fail this saving throw. On failure, they become frightened until the end of their next turn, while successful saves grant immunity to this effect for 24 hours. This ability creates tension and fear, solidifying the hagâ€™s role as a master of psychological manipulation and horror in encounters.
