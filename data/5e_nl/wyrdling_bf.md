The Wyrdling is a Medium humanoid creature known for its unique connection to fate and intuition. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it serves as an intriguing adversary or ally in various campaigns. The Wyrdling possesses a moderate Armor Class of 12 and 40 hit points, which makes it resilient without being excessively tough. Its most notable strengths lie in its high Wisdom score, which allows it to excel in perception-related checks, and a range of psychic abilities that can inflict damage or manipulate fate itself. While its physical attributes are relatively unremarkable, the Wyrdling compensates with powerful abilities and spells, making it a character agent of uncertainty on the battlefield. Its weaknesses include lower physical defenses and hit points compared to more formidable foes.

The Wyrdling has the following attributes: Strength of 0 (average), Dexterity of 2 (good), Constitution of 1 (average), Intelligence of 1 (average), Wisdom of 5 (exceptional), and Charisma of 2 (good). These scores provide it decent agility and social capabilities, while its outstanding Wisdom translates into exceptional insight and perceptiveness.

In terms of special abilities, the Wyrdling has "Intuition," allowing it to roll two dice for initiative and take the higher result, which enhances its chances of acting early in combat. Additionally, it gains advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, enhancing its skill at reading situations and intentions cleverly. Its "Read Fate" ability allows the Wyrdling to commune with fate for one minute, answering a question posed by a creature within 10 feet. This functions similarly to the divination spell but is limited to such uses no more than once every three days for the same creature.

For actions, the Wyrdling can employ "Psychic Burst," a versatile attack that can be harnessed as either a melee or ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit. It can strike a target within 5 feet or at a distance of 60 feet, dealing 13 psychic damage on a successful hit, which can be pivotal in combat situations.

The Wyrdling's bonus action, "Pronounce Fate," allows it to dictate fortune or doom to a creature within 30 feet. The affected target rolls a d4 and adds that result if fortune is chosen, or subtracts it if doom is selected, impacting the next attack roll or saving throw made by the target before the Wyrdlingâ€™s next turn.

As a reaction, the Wyrdling can use "Call on Fate" when it is attacked by a visible creature. This ability imposes disadvantage on the attack roll made against it. If the attack fails, the Wyrdling or an ally within 30 feet gains advantage on their next attack against the attacker, allowing for a counterattack that can turn the tide of battle.
