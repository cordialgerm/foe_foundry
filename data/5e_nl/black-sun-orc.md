With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers and is capable of delivering significant damage in combat. The orc's strengths lie in its physical attributes, particularly its high Strength and respectable Dexterity, allowing for effective melee and ranged attacks.

- Black Sun Sight allows the orc's darkvision to function even in magical darkness, maintaining its effectiveness in low-visibility conditions.
- Light Sensitivity puts the orc at a disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks when in bright light, which can severely hinder it in well-lit situations.
- Stone Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while hiding in rocky terrain, boosting its stealth capabilities in such environments.

For actions, the Black Sun Orc can perform a Multiattack, making two attacks either with its greatclub or sling:
- The Greatclub attack has a +5 to hit, can reach up to 5 feet, and inflicts an average of 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. This makes it a dangerous choice in close combat.
- The Sling, on the other hand, allows the orc to make a ranged attack with a +4 to hit at a range of 30 feet normally, extending up to 120 feet at disadvantage. This attack deals an average of 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage, providing versatility in combat scenarios. 

Overall, the Black Sun Orc is a hybrid predator that can engage effectively in various environments, capitalizing on its special abilities to navigate and attack within rocky locales.
