The Arcamag is a tiny monstrosity known for its cunning and deceptive nature. Often feared for its ability to manipulate spellcasters through attachment, this creature has a mix of strengths and weaknesses that make it an intriguing encounter. With an Armor Class of 13 and 22 hit points, the Arcamag is moderately difficult to harm but does not withstand many hits due to its low constitution score. Its key strengths lie in stealth, where it excels due to its ability to blend in when attached to a host, and in its unique abilities that allow it to shape-shift into small objects. However, its overall low strength and intelligence make it weak in direct combat situations, earning it an average challenge rating of 2.

The Arcamag has the following attributes: Strength of 7, which gives it a very bad ability to perform strength checks; Dexterity of 10, resulting in average agility; Constitution of 15, leading to a good resilience to damage; Intelligence of 5, categorized as very bad for understanding or learning; Wisdom of 12, which is average; and Charisma of 18, rated as exceptional, particularly useful in social or manipulative scenarios.

In terms of skills, the Arcamag has a stealth modifier of +4, which is considered good, meaning it can easily hide from unsuspecting targets. It can see in the dark up to 60 feet with its darkvision, and it has a passive perception score of 11, giving it an average capability to notice hidden threats. The Arcamag understands Common but is unable to communicate verbally.

The special abilities of the Arcamag include Camouflage, which grants advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while attached to a host. This means it can hide very effectively, making it challenging for enemies to detect it in stealth situations. Its Shapechanger ability allows it to polymorph into various small objects while maintaining its statistics. Importantly, any equipment it is wearing remains unchanged, and it appears as an ordinary object when motionless, making it difficult to identify as a threat.

For actions, the Arcamag can perform an Attach attack, making a melee weapon attack with a +2 bonus to hit against a creature capable of casting spells. If successful, the Arcamag attaches itself to the target and begins affecting the spellcaster's abilities without directly attacking. It can detach itself freely or can be removed by another creature with a successful DC 15 Strength check. When the Arcamag detaches, it inflicts psychic damage to the host based on their spellcaster level.

Additionally, the Arcamag has a special action called Teleport, which it can use once per day to magically teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space. If it is attached to a host at the time of teleportation, it automatically detaches, potentially causing further psychic damage to the spellcaster.

Overall, the Arcamag represents a stealthy and manipulative creature that can have significant impacts on gameplay, especially if it latches onto a spellcaster, altering their capabilities in unexpected ways.
