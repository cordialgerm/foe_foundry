The Young Bronze Dragon is a large, formidable creature known for its amphibious nature and mastery of lightning-based attacks. With an Armor Class of 18, it presents a robust defense, and its impressive 148 hit points make it a tough adversary in combat. Ranked at a Challenge Rating of 8, this dragon possesses strong physical and magical abilities, making it a balanced opponent. It benefits from exceptional Constitution and Charisma scores, which enhance its resilience and charming capabilities. While it showcases formidable strengths, such as its powerful breath weapons and the ability to impose penalties on opponents with its Lightning Extraction ability, it is also vulnerable to being overwhelmed by coordinated enemy attacks due to its focus on lightning-themed abilities.

The Young Bronze Dragon has the following ability scores: Strength of 20 (+5, which is very good for physical attacks), Dexterity of 16 (+3, good for agility), Constitution of 24 (+7, exceptional for damage resistance), Intelligence of 14 (+2, average intelligence), Wisdom of 18 (+4, good for perceptiveness), and Charisma of 22 (+6, very good for social interactions and spellcasting). Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet and keensense up to 30 feet, enabling it to effectively perceive its surroundings in low light and enhanced conditions. Its Perception score is 17, making it quite adept at noticing hidden threats, while a Stealth score of 13 indicates that it can move quietly but not exceptionally well. The dragon can communicate in Common and Draconic, allowing it to interact with most creatures it encounters.

Among its special abilities, the dragonâ€™s Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, enhancing its versatility in different environments. The Lightning Extraction ability, which activates after using its Lightning Breath, forces creatures within 10 feet of the dragon to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turns. If they fail, they can only use either an action or a bonus action on their turn, which can severely limit their effectiveness in combat and provide the dragon with a tactical advantage.

In combat, the Young Bronze Dragon can utilize the Multiattack action, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can also replace its Bite attack with a use of Repulsion Breath if it is available, enhancing its versatility. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit and deals 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage on a hit, while each Claw attack, also with a +8 to hit, does 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

The Lightning Breath is a powerful action that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. It allows the dragon to exhale lightning in a 60-foot line, forcing all creatures in that area to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 49 (9d10) lightning damage, while a successful save halves the damage.

The Repulsion Breath, which has a 30-foot cone area of effect and recharges on a roll of 6, pushes creatures away from the dragon. Each creature must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away. This ability can create space between the dragon and its adversaries or disrupt enemy formations.

As a bonus action, the Young Bronze Dragon can Change Shape, transforming into a Beast or Humanoid with a challenge rating no higher than its own. This ability allows it to adapt its tactics and appearances, retaining its hit points, ability to communicate, and mental characteristics while assuming the statistics and capabilities of the new form, providing a unique tactical dimension to its abilities in both combat and roleplay scenarios. If the dragon dies, it reverts to its true form.
