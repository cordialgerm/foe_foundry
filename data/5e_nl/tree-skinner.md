The Tree Skinner is a Medium-sized chaotic evil fiend that poses a significant threat to adventurers and those who venture too close to its wooded domain. With an Armor Class of 13 and a total of 38 hit points, it presents a moderate challenge, rated at Challenge Level 2, making it suitable for lower to mid-level parties. The creature's high Dexterity score of 16 (+3) makes it agile and difficult to hit, while its Charisma score of 18 (+4) enhances its interactions, giving it a forceful presence. The Tree Skinnerâ€™s primary strength lies in its ability to utilize trees as concealment, allowing it to blend in as a normal tree when motionless. However, its vulnerabilities include a susceptibility to fire damage and a limited capacity to inhabit a single tree for only three days before needing to relocate. 

In terms of attributes, the Tree Skinner has the following scores: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 16 (+3 - good), Constitution 13 (+1 - average), Intelligence 14 (+2 - average), Wisdom 15 (+2 - good), and Charisma 18 (+4 - exceptional). Its skills include a perception score of +4 and stealth at +7, which allows it to move undetected, particularly in wooded environments. The creature has damage resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks unless those attacks are made with silvered weapons, making it more resilient against mundane threats. It is also immune to the charmed condition, further enhancing its survivability in combat situations. With darkvision extending 60 feet and a passive perception score of 14, the Tree Skinner can effectively operate in low-light conditions.

The Tree Skinner possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities. Its False Appearance allows it to remain motionless and appear as a normal tree, effectively camouflaging itself from potential threats. The Inhabit Tree ability lets it vanish into a tree, gaining tremorsense (sensing movement through the ground) in a 30-foot radius. This ability also provides it with increased Armor Class of 15 while inside the tree, but it becomes vulnerable to fire damage. If reduced to 15 hit points, it causes the tree to die and re-emerge within proximity. Its Magic Resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it more resilient against magical attacks.

When it comes to actions, the Tree Skinner has a Claw attack and two tree-form special attacks: Vine Whip and Squeeze. The Claw attack has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target fails a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, it takes an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage and becomes poisoned until the end of its next turn. The Vine Whip attack can reach 20 feet and also has a +5 to hit, dealing 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled with an escape DC of 13. The Tree Skinner can grapple up to two creatures simultaneously. The Squeeze ability occurs when it grapples a creature, allowing it to make one Vine Whip attack, and if that attack hits, the creature cannot breathe or use spells with verbal components while grappled.

Overall, the Tree Skinner is a cunning and deceptive foe that combines nature's elements with fiendish traits, making encounters with it unpredictable and deadly.
