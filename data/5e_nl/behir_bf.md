The Behir is a formidable Huge monstrosity known for its impressive powers and dangerous combat abilities. With a challenge rating of 11, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, combining resilience and deadly attacks. One of its most notable strengths is its Lightning Absorption ability, which allows it to regain hit points from lightning damage, making it particularly difficult to defeat with electric attacks. The Behir's high Strength score of +10 coupled with its decent Dexterity of +3 enables it to excel in melee combat while still being nimble enough to evade some attacks. However, its intelligence is below average with a score of -2, limiting its strategic capabilities in more cerebral encounters. Adventurers must keep in mind its resilience against exhaustion and fear effects, while also strategizing on how to mitigate its potential to grapple or swallow weaker party members.

The Behir has the following attributes:
- Armor Class: 17 due to its natural armor, which is considered good, providing it substantial protection.
- Hit Points: 223, indicating exceptional durability in prolonged combat situations. 
- Speed: 50 feet walking and 40 feet climbing ensure it can cover ground quickly.

The battle prowess of the Behir is enhanced through its special abilities and actions:
- Lightning Absorption: This ability allows the Behir to completely negate any lightning damage dealt to it, conversely healing itself for that amount. This makes it exceptionally resilient against electric attacks.
- Monstrosity Resilience: The creature is resistant to exhaustion and the frightened condition, granting it an advantage in combat and keeping it operational when facing formidable foes.

In terms of actions:
- Multiattack: The Behir can launch one Bite attack and one Constrict attack during its turn, significantly increasing its damage output. Instead of a Bite attack, it can choose to use Swallow if it has a creature grappled.
- Bite: This melee weapon attack has a +10 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, it deals 22 piercing damage along with 27 additional lightning damage, making the total damage from a successful hit exceptionally high.
- Constrict: For targets that are Large or smaller, the Behir can constrict them for 17 bludgeoning damage and, if successful in grappling the target (with an escape DC of 16), it restrains them until the grapple ends. Being restrained can be detrimental as it limits the victim's actions and makes them easier targets.
- Swallow: When the Behir has a Medium or smaller target in its grapple, it can bite and swallow that target. If successful, the swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, suffering 21 acid damage at the start of each of the Behir's turns. This ability can quickly remove a player from the fight, causing significant distress.
- Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6): This devastating attack allows the Behir to exhale lightning in a line, requiring enemies within a 30-foot line to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A failure results in 54 lightning damage, while a success results in half damage. This ability can impact multiple foes at once, dealing substantial damage.

Overall, the Behir is a powerful foe that combines healing from lightning, formidable physical attacks, and unique abilities that can turn the tide in combat, making it a memorable encounter for any adventuring party.
