The Plesiosaurus is a large beast that primarily inhabits aquatic environments. Known for its notable swimming capabilities and powerful bite, it has a challenge rating of 7, allowing it to pose a considerable threat to lower-level adventurers while offering substantial experience points to those who defeat it. The creature has a strong physical presence with high strength, making it capable of dealing significant damage in combat. However, its low intelligence and charisma suggest it is not adept at interacting meaningfully with characters outside of combat. Overall, the Plesiosaurus excels in water-based combat due to its swimming ability but lacks versatility on land, which can be exploited by clever adventurers.

The Plesiosaurus has an Armor Class of 13, indicating that it can offer a moderate defense against attacks, leading to an average survivability in combat. With 45 hit points, based on rolling six ten-sided dice plus an additional twelve points, it can withstand several attacks before being defeated. Its movement capabilities include a walking speed of 20 feet and a swimming speed of 40 feet, which gives it a very good ability to navigate through water swiftly but a bad performance on land.

In terms of ability scores, the Plesiosaurus exhibits exceptional strength with a score of 18, which translates to a +4 modifier, leading to powerful melee attacks. Its dexterity of 14, with a +2 modifier, is good, allowing it to dodge some attacks effectively. However, its constitution is average at 14, providing decent resilience but not outstanding. Intelligence and charisma scores are quite low, at -4 and -3 respectively, making these attributes very bad and indicating that the creature does not possess any notable intellect or charm.

The Plesiosaurus has a passive Perception score of 11, which gives it an average perception capability in passive observations. It has no languages, limiting its ability to communicate with adventurers or other creatures outside of instinctual cues.

The Plesiosaurus possesses a special ability called "Hold Breath," which allows it to remain underwater for up to 1 hour without needing to surface for air. This can be strategically beneficial when avoiding detection by land-based threats or when stalking prey.

For its actions, the Plesiosaurus can make a melee attack using its Bite ability. This attack has a +6 to hit, which is a good modifier, and a reach of 10 feet, allowing it to strike targets from a distance. If it successfully hits a target, it deals 15 points of piercing damage, calculated by rolling two ten-sided dice and adding its strength modifier of +4. Furthermore, the victim must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw; if they fail, they are pulled up to 5 feet closer to the Plesiosaurus. This tactic can disrupt opponents' positions and create opportunities for follow-up attacks from the beast or its allies.
