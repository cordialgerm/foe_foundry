The Star Drake is a formidable large dragon with a neutral alignment, known for its blend of magical prowess and physical might. With an impressive Armor Class of 19 and a substantial pool of 189 hit points, it is a resilient combatant in battle. The drake possesses a remarkable speed, both on foot and in flight, which allows it to swiftly navigate the battlefield. As a creature with a Challenge Rating of 15, it poses a significant challenge for adventurers, earning it 13,000 experience points upon defeat. The Star Drake exhibits exceptional attributes across the board, with especially high Wisdom and Constitution scores, making it not only a powerful foe but also an intelligent and perceptive one. It has damage immunities to cold, fire, and nonmagical attacks, rendering it difficult to harm. Its magical abilities, alongside powerful melee and ranged attacks, make it a versatile and dangerous adversary.

The Star Drake's statistics include a Strength score of 20 (+5), Dexterity of 17 (+3), Constitution of 21 (+5), Intelligence of 16 (+3), Wisdom of 24 (+7), and Charisma of 20 (+5). The high Dexterity modifier (+3) translates to a good advantage over many opponents in terms of avoiding attacks, while the outstanding Wisdom modifier (+7) indicates exceptional insight and perceptiveness. The Constitution modifier (+5) provides the drake with a very good level of resilience against effects that require saving throws. The saving throws for Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma are +8, +10, +12, and +10, respectively, granting it very good protection against various effects. Additionally, it boasts skills in Arcana, History, Insight, Perception, and Religion, all at average levels, making it well-rounded in knowledge and awareness.

The Star Drake has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. "Magic Resistance" grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very difficult to control or incapacitate with magic. The "Nimbus of Swirling Stars" ability forces creatures within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw each time the drake begins its turn; failure results in a creature being incapacitated until the end of its next turn, which can significantly impact combat dynamics. Its "Planar Weapons" ability makes all its weapon attacks magical while also dealing an additional 4d8 force damage, augmenting its already powerful melee strikes.

In terms of offensive actions, the Star Drake can perform a "Multiattack," which allows it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it can launch four "Searing Star" attacks. The "Bite" attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, inflicting 16 piercing damage along with an additional 18 force damage, making it a potent attack. The "Claw" attack also features a +10 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, causing 12 slashing damage plus 18 force damage. The "Searing Star" attack is a ranged spell attack with a +12 to hit, dealing 14 radiant damage and 9 force damage, effective at a distance of up to 120 feet. Should two "Searing Star" attacks successfully hit the same target, that creature must then make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn, which could severely limit its effectiveness in combat.

Other extraordinary actions include "Planar Traveler," enabling the drake to teleport to a different plane of existence, functioning similarly to the plane shift spell but targeting only itself. The "Plane-Altered Breath," which has a recharge time of 5 to 6, allows the drake to unleash a powerful breath attack in a 60-foot cone, demanding a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw from each creature in the area. Those who fail take 55 force damage, while successful saves result in half damage. This high damage potential combined with its ability to alter the battlefield makes the Star Drake an exceptionally dangerous foe for any group of adventurers.
