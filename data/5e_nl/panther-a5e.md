The Panther is a medium-sized beast known for its agility and stealth, making it a formidable presence in the wild or as a companion in the heat of battle. With an armor class of 12 and 13 hit points, it exhibits average durability but compensates with a remarkable speed of 50 feet walking and 40 feet climbing, enabling it to maneuver easily through different terrains. The panther has a challenge rating of 1/4, indicating it poses a minor threat to adventurers, especially those who are unprepared for ambush tactics. Notably, it excels in perception and stealth, boasting keen senses that enhance its hunting capabilities.

The Panther's physical attributes are as follows: it has a strength score of 14, providing a good modifier of +2, allowing it to deal decent damage in melee combat. Its dexterity is also 14, which is beneficial for its stealth and agility, equipping it with another good +2 modifier. Its constitution of 10 is average, resulting in no modifier that would affect its hit points. However, its intelligence is quite low at 3, giving it a very bad modifier of -4, indicating it is not capable of complex thought. Its wisdom of 14 grants it a good +2 modifier, enhancing its perception and ability to sense threats. Lastly, with a charisma score of 6, it has a very bad -2 modifier, making it ineffective in social interactions.

The Panther's special ability, Keen Smell, grants it advantage on perception checks that rely on smell, greatly improving its tracking and hunting skills. This makes the panther an excellent tracker in scenarios where scent can lead to prey or inform it of an enemy's presence.

In terms of actions, the Panther has two main attacks. It can use its Claws as a melee weapon attack, rolling a +4 to hit. With a reach of 5 feet, it targets one creature, dealing 4 slashing damage on a hit, calculated as 1d4+2. Additionally, if the Panther moves at least 20 feet in a straight line towards a target and then attacks, the target must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw. A failure results in the target falling prone, creating advantageous conditions for the Panther or its allies. The Panther also has a Bite attack, which is similar in mechanics, rolling a +4 to hit and dealing 4 piercing damage.

As a bonus action, the Panther can perform an Opportune Bite attack against a creature that is prone. This allows it to take advantage of enemies who are unable to defend themselves effectively, contributing to its role as an ambusher in combat. This ability reflects the Pantherâ€™s skillful agility and predatory instincts, allowing it to capitalize on favorable circumstances on the battlefield.
