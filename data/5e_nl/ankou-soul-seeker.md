The Ankou Soul Seeker is a formidable creature, classified as a large dragon with a neutral alignment. It serves primarily as a guardian of the boundary between life and death, utilizing its unique abilities to interact with undead creatures and transport souls between planes. The Ankou possesses a strong defensive ability with a notable Armor Class of 15 and substantial hit points totaling 171, making it challenging to defeat in combat. With an impressive flight speed of 80 feet, it can maneuver swiftly around the battlefield, while its various resistances to damage, including cold, necrotic, and poison, give it resilience against many forms of attack. However, while its Dexterity modifier of +0 is average, it excels in Constitution, granting it a good saving throw of +7, and shows exceptional skill in perception with a +8 modifier. Its challenge rating of 8 reflects its significant combat and support capabilities, suitable for advanced parties.

The Ankou's attributes reveal a balanced creature emphasizing strength and health. Its Strength is rated at 17, providing a good +3 modifier for melee attacks, while its Constitution of 19 grants it a very good +4 modifier for saving throws and overall sturdiness. The Ankou has an Intelligence of 13 (average), Wisdom of 14 (good), and Charisma of 16 (very good), which enables it to be effective in social interactions and certain saving throws. Its saving throws indicate a good level of resistance to various forms of magical or physical effects.

The Ankou possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness. The "Aura of Necromancy's Bane" allows it to deal radiant damage to undead creatures within 30 feet, compelling them to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, the undead take 7 (2d6) radiant damage, while a successful save results in halved damage. This ability plays a critical role in combat against undead opponents, providing effective crowd control. 

The "Cloak of Shadows" grants the Ankou the ability to become invisible as a bonus action when in dim light or darkness. This adds a strategic element to its movements, allowing it to evade attacks or set up ambushes. This invisibility lasts until the Ankou chooses to end it, dies, or is exposed to bright light, promoting stealthy tactics.

The "Death Ascended" feature signifies its dual nature, classifying it as a celestial type in addition to being a dragon. This might provide additional benefits in certain interactions with other celestial beings or the undead.

In terms of actions, the Ankou can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three total attacks: one bite and two claw strikes. The bite attack has a +6 to hit and deals 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage, along with an extra 4 (1d8) cold damage. The claw attack also has a +6 to hit and can inflict 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. Both attacks make the Ankou a dangerous opponent in close quarters.

One of the Ankou's most powerful abilities is "Reaper's Breath," which it can use every 5 to 6 rounds. This ability allows it to exhale cold fire in a 30-foot line, requiring creatures in that line to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). On a failure, they take an overwhelming 44 (8d10) cold damage, whereas a success reduces the damage by half. Notably, undead creatures automatically fail this saving throw and take the damage as radiant, making it particularly lethal against such foes.

The "Change Shape" ability gives the Ankou the versatility to transform into any beast, humanoid, or undead it has seen previously, facilitating tactical advantages in various scenarios without losing its statistics (other than size). Lastly, the Ankou can use "Usher of Souls" to transport itself and up to eight creatures it is in contact with to another plane of existence, working similarly to the plane shift spell. This allows the Ankou to transport even unwilling or deceased beings, thereby expanding its utility and influence within the game.

Overall, the Ankou Soul Seeker is an exceptional blend of strength, stealth, and magical prowess, making it a daunting opponent and a potent ally in the game.
