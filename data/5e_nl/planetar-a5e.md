The Planetar is a large celestial creature known for its immense power and divine presence on the battlefield. It serves as a champion of truth and justice, making it a highly revered and formidable opponent or ally. With an impressive armor class of 19 and a robust pool of hit points totaling 250, it can sustain significant damage while engaging foes. The Planetar is exceptionally quick and agile, capable of both walking at 40 feet per turn and flying at an impressive 120 feet. It has a challenge rating of 16, indicating that it poses a serious threat to adventuring parties, granting a substantial 15,000 XP upon defeat. Its numerous strengths include high attributes across the board, exceptional saving throws, and immunity to various damaging effects, making it a resilient combatant. However, while it excels in several areas, its reliance on spells and actions means that it must be strategically positioned to utilize its abilities effectively.

The Planetar possesses formidable attributes: it boasts a strength of 22, dexterity of 22, constitution of 24, intelligence of 22, wisdom of 24, and charisma of 24. These values translate into an exceptional power level, allowing it to excel in combat and spellcasting. Specifically, its strength and constitution contribute to its durability and damage output, while its high wisdom and charisma enhance its spellcasting abilities and saving throws. The saving throws for wisdom and charisma are each +12, indicating their exceptional effectiveness, while skills like athletics, insight, perception, and religion also feature high modifiers, indicating a very good proficiency level in these areas. The Planetar is immune to necrotic and poison damage, giving it an edge in encounters involving those damage types. It possesses resistance against radiant damage and damage from nonmagical weapons, further solidifying its defensive capabilities. With immunities to conditions like charm, exhaustion, fear, and poison, the Planetar is highly resilient in combat situations. Its senses include truesight at 60 feet, which allows it to see through illusions and darkness, complemented with a passive perception score of 22. It understands all languages and can communicate telepathically up to 120 feet.

The Planetar has notable special abilities that enhance its capabilities. The “Champion of Truth” ability allows it to automatically detect lies, making it a formidable opponent in diplomacy or intrigue-related scenarios. Additionally, the Planetar cannot lie itself, adding to its reputation as a reliable ally. Its “Innate Spellcasting” feature enables it to cast powerful spells using charisma as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 20. It can cast spells such as "commune," which allows it to communicate with higher powers for guidance; "control weather," which provides control over environmental factors; and "raise dead," which can bring previously deceased creatures back to life, each effect usable once per day.

In terms of actions, the Planetar can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike twice with its flaming sword on each of its turns. With a +11 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, the flaming sword delivers significant damage—20 slashing damage (4d6 + 6) along with an additional 21 fire or radiant damage (6d6) of its choice. Importantly, a creature can use an action to extinguish the holy flame affecting itself or an ally within 5 feet. Additionally, it can use "Heavenly Bolt," a powerful ranged attack that unleashes a line of lightning extending 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer 56 lightning damage (16d6), taking half damage on a successful save. The Planetar can also heal allies with the "Heal" ability, which allows it to touch a creature, restoring 60 hit points and removing various harmful conditions like blindness, deafness, disease, or poison up to two times per day.

As a bonus action, the Planetar can use its "Awe-Inspiring Gaze" ability to target a creature within 90 feet, compelling it to make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the creature being frightened until the end of its next turn. Should the target succeed, they become immune to this effect for 24 hours. In terms of reactions, the Planetar can utilize "Protective Parry," imposing disadvantage on an attack roll made against a creature within 5 feet, showcasing its role as a defender of allies during combat. Overall, the Planetar stands as a beacon of celestial power, embodying both the grace and fury of divine guardianship on the battlefield.
