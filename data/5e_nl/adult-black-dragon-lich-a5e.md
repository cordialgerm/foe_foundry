The Adult Black Dragon Lich is a formidable undead creature that combines the menacing presence of a dragon with the dark magic of undeath. Possessing a challenge rating of 17, this creature is capable of significantly impacting the battlefield with its powerful attacks and spellcasting abilities. With a high Armor Class of 19 and an impressive pool of 253 hit points, it is well-equipped to withstand considerable punishment. Its exceptional Strength score of 22 allows it to deliver devastating physical attacks, while its Charisma of 16 enhances its spellcasting. Although it has vulnerabilities typical of undead, such as being susceptible to radiant damage, its array of immunities, including damage immunity to acid, necrotic, and poison, makes it a dangerous foe. The Adult Black Dragon Lich also boasts a variety of special abilities and spells that can manipulate both the battlefield and its opponents' actions, making it a tactical presence that adventurers must approach with caution.

The dragon's attributes are as follows: Strength (22, +6, exceptional), Dexterity (14, +2, average), Constitution (20, +5, very good), Intelligence (14, +2, average), Wisdom (12, +1, average), and Charisma (16, +3, good). Its saving throws are strong in Dexterity (+8), Constitution (+11), Wisdom (+7), and Charisma (+9), making it highly resilient against many forms of magic and physical attacks. It also possesses skills in history (+8), perception (+7), and stealth (+8), enhancing its versatility both in and out of combat. The dragon has damage immunities to acid, necrotic, and poison, and it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, frightened, or paralyzed. Its senses include blindsight at 60 feet, darkvision at 120 feet, and a passive Perception score of 20. The dragon can communicate in Common and Draconic.

The dragon features several potent special abilities. The Ambusher ability grants it advantage on Stealth checks while submerged in water and allows it to both deal damage and grapple a creature it surprises. Its innate spellcasting, using Charisma as its spellcasting ability (DC 17), enables it to cast spells like animate dead, fog cloud, legend lore, pass without trace, and speak with dead three times each per day without needing material components.

During combat, the Adult Black Dragon Lich can execute a Multiattack, making one bite attack and two claw attacks or, alternatively, use its Acid Spit instead of the bite attack. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +12 modifier, inflicting 22 piercing damage plus an additional 4 acid damage or grappling a target with an escape DC of 20. The Claw attack, also with a +12 modifier, inflicts 19 slashing damage. The Tail attack, again at +12 to hit, deals 15 bludgeoning damage and pushes the target away.

The Acid Spit allows the dragon to target a creature within 60 feet, necessitating a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 22 acid damage, with ongoing acid damage of 5 if the first save fails. The creature can use an action to stop the ongoing damage. Additionally, it has a devastating Acid Breath attack that requires a recharge on rolls of 5 or 6. This ability creates a 60-foot line of acid or necrotic energy, requiring a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take 31 acid damage and 31 necrotic damage on a failure or half that on a success, with the added effect of becoming blinded if they fail the save.

In response to enemy actions, the dragon can use its Tail Attack reaction against a creature that hits it with a melee attack. 

The creature also possesses legendary actions, which allow it to act outside its turn. It has three legendary actions, but only one can be utilized at the end of another creature's turn. The Darkness action creates a sphere of magical darkness that normal vision cannot penetrate, lasting for 1 minute or until used again. The Roar action frightens creatures within earshot unless they pass a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, adding an element of psychological terror to its combat strategy. Finally, the Wing Attack enables it to create disturbance in the area around it, pushing creatures away and allowing for agile repositioning in combat. Each of these abilities enhances the Adult Black Dragon Lich's tactical options, making it a terrifying adversary for any adventuring party.
