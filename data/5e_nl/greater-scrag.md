The Greater Scrag is a large, chaotic evil monstrosity found lurking in the murky depths of water bodies and swamps. Known for its formidable strength and resilience, this creature poses a significant threat to adventurers who wander near its territory. With high hit points and the ability to regenerate health as long as it remains submerged, the Greater Scrag can outlast many opponents. Its Blood Frenzy ability gives it an edge in combat by increasing its chances of successfully hitting weaker foes. However, it is not particularly quick or dexterous, which can leave it vulnerable to more agile adversaries. 

The Greater Scrag has the following attributes: Strength at 20, providing a very good modifier of +5; Dexterity at 10, leading to an average modifier of +0; Constitution at 17, granting a good modifier of +3; Intelligence at 10 with an average modifier of +0; Wisdom at 10 with an average modifier of +0; and Charisma at 11 also with an average modifier of +0. It has saving throw bonuses of +8 in Strength and +6 in Constitution, making it exceptional at resisting physical challenges. The creature possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and can communicate in the languages of Abyssal, Aquan, and Giant.

The Greater Scrag has a range of special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, thus making it versatile in its aquatic habitat. The Blood Frenzy ability gives the scrag advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that is not at full health, thereby enhancing its lethality against weakened enemies. Regeneration is another key trait, allowing the Greater Scrag to regain 10 hit points at the start of its turn while in contact with water. However, if it takes acid or fire damage, this regenerative ability ceases to function until the following turn. The creature can only be killed if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and cannot regenerate.

In combat, the Greater Scrag can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to make three attacks in a single turn: one with its bite and two with its claws. The bite attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 14 damage (2d8 + 5) if successful. Its claw attacks also have a +8 to hit but can reach targets up to 10 feet away, dealing an average of 12 damage (3d4 + 5) each. This combination of attacks allows the Greater Scrag to deliver a significant amount of damage to multiple opponents in close quarters.
