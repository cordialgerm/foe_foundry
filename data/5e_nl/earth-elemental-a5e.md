The Earth Elemental is a powerful and resilient creature, classified as a Large Elemental in Dungeons & Dragons. With a strong armor class of 17 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 114, it excels in combat situations, making it a formidable opponent with a challenge rating of 5. One of its major strengths lies in its high Strength and Constitution scores, granting it exceptional physical attacks and resilience against damage. The elemental's ability to burrow through earth without disturbing it allows for strategic movement on the battlefield, while its immunity to poison and resistance to nonmagical weapons makes it a tough adversary. However, it has low Dexterity and Intelligence scores, which limits its agility and cognitive abilities. Overall, the Earth Elemental is adept at dealing melee damage while evading most threats due to its unique characteristics.

The Earth Elemental has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 18 (+4), indicating it has exceptional physical strength, allowing it to hit hard and grapple effectively.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), representing an average level of agility, meaning it is neither particularly nimble nor clumsy.
- Constitution: 18 (+4), showcasing its exceptional durability, which contributes to its high hit points.
- Intelligence: 6 (-2) and Charisma: 6 (-2), both indicate its very bad capabilities in mental functions and social interactions.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), marking it as average in perception and insight.

The Earth Elemental has several special abilities:
- **Earth Glide:** This ability permits the elemental to burrow smoothly through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without creating disturbances, allowing for stealthy movements and surprise attacks.
- **Siege Monster:** When it attacks objects or structures, the elemental inflicts double damage, making it highly effective in demolishing fortifications.
- **Elemental Nature:** As an elemental, it does not require air, food, or sleep, which makes it tireless and unburdened by environmental needs.

In combat, the Earth Elemental employs multiple actions:
- **Multiattack:** It can make two slam attacks in a single turn, increasing its potential damage output significantly.
- **Slam:** This melee attack has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, showcasing its strength.
- **Earth's Embrace:** This attack, which also has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, targets one Large or smaller creature. If it hits, it deals a powerful 17 (2d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage and grapples the target. The grappled creature must succeed on an escape DC of 15 to break free, and while grappling, the elemental can only perform limited actions, though it has advantage on attacks against the grappled target.
- **Rock:** A ranged weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 30/90 feet. This attack deals 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage to a single target, allowing the elemental to engage enemies from a distance as well.

These attributes and abilities make the Earth Elemental a dynamic and resilient force in any encounter, capable of dealing substantial damage both in melee and at range, while also having unique capabilities for mobility and environmental interactions during gameplay.
