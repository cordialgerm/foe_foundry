The Yavalnoi is a large aberration with chaotic evil tendencies, known for its aquatic nature and its ability to manipulate water. It possesses a solid armor class of 16, long-range swimming capabilities, and a substantial hit point pool of 126, making it a formidable foe in underwater or coastal encounters. With a challenge rating of 6, it represents a significant threat to adventurers, particularly due to its strong physical attacks and potent spellcasting abilities. The Yavalnoi's strengths lie in its damage resilience against cold and its powerful multiattack, while its weaknesses include a limited movement speed on land. Additionally, its capacity to summon allies and control the environment enhances its combat effectiveness, providing both offensive and tactical advantages.

In terms of attributes, the Yavalnoi has a Strength score of 17 (+3), which is considered good, enabling it to deal decent melee damage. Its Dexterity score of 14 (+2) is average, allowing for some agility but not enough to significantly impact combat. Its Constitution score is quite high at 20 (+5), providing it with very good hit points and resilience against various effects. The Intelligence score is average at 12 (+1), which is not particularly remarkable, while its Wisdom at 16 (+3) is good, supporting its perception and saving throws. Lastly, its Charisma score of 18 (+4) is exceptional, enhancing its spellcasting capabilities and making its innate spells more effective.

Regarding saving throws, the Yavalnoi has a Constitution saving throw modifier of +8, which is very good, offering a robust defense against effects that require this save. Its Wisdom saving throw modifier of +6 is good, aiding in resisting mental effects. The Yavalnoi also has a +6 modifier for perception, indicating its keen senses.

The Yavalnoi has several special abilities that greatly influence gameplay. It can breathe underwater due to its Water Breathing ability, making it comfortable in aquatic environments. Its innate spellcasting relies on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 15, allowing it to cast spells without needing material components. The spells it can cast at will include Ray of Enfeeblement, which weakens a target by reducing its damage output, and Silent Image, which creates illusions to deceive others. Additionally, it can cast Control Water three times a day, allowing it to manipulate water within a significant area, and Slow, which hampers the actions of its enemies.

In combat, the Yavalnoi can utilize a Multiattack to perform three attacks in a single turn: a Bite attack that hits with +6 to hit, dealing 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage; a Claw attack that also hits at +6, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage; and a Tail attack that reaches out 10 feet and hits at +6, dealing 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. 

One of its most notable actions is Luminous Burst, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. When activated, it emits a blue light that forces all hostile creatures within a 30-foot radius to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they are outlined in blue light for one minute, preventing them from breathing underwater and granting the Yavalnoi and its allies advantage on attack rolls against affected creatures. Outlined creatures can attempt to save at the end of their turns to end the effect on themselves.

Finally, the Yavalnoi can use its Call of the Deep ability once per day to summon allies in the form of 2d4 giant crabs or one giant octopus, which arrive within 1d4 rounds and serve as additional combat support for the Yavalnoi. These summoned creatures stay for one hour or until dismissed, adding a tactical advantage in battles.
