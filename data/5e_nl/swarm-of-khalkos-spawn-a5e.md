The Swarm of Khalkos Spawn is a menacing Medium Aberration known for its effective combat capabilities and unique debuffing skills. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it can pose a significant threat to lesser adventurers, making it a formidable opponent in battle. This creature boasts a good Armor Class of 16 and a healthy pool of hit points totaling 71, which provides it with decent durability. The swarm's strengths lie in its above-average Dexterity and Intelligence, allowing it to strike quickly and strategically, while its ability to emit chaos pheromones can severely disrupt enemy formations. However, it has very low Strength, which makes its physical attacks less effective in raw power. The Khalkos Spawn's resistances to multiple damage types further contribute to its survivability in encounters.

The Swarm of Khalkos Spawn has the following attributes: Strength is at 6, resulting in a very bad modifier of -2, indicating weakness in physical combat. Dexterity is 16, which gives a good modifier of +3, enhancing its agility and attack efficacy. Constitution stands at 14, equating to a good modifier of +2, signifying a reasonable level of endurance. Intelligence is high at 18, resulting in an exceptional modifier of +4, allowing for strong mental maneuvers. Wisdom and Charisma are both at 14 and 12, providing good and average modifiers, respectively, with benefits to saving throws and mental interactions.

For saving throws, the Swarm of Khalkos Spawn excels particularly in Intelligence with a +5 modifier, marking it as very good against mind-influencing effects. It also has a good +4 modifier for Wisdom saving throws and a +3 modifier for Charisma saving throws. The creature enjoys resistance against fire, psychic, and radiant damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, providing it with a solid stance in combat. Additionally, it is immune to conditions like charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned, granting it an exceptional level of protection against debilitating effects.

In terms of actions, the Swarm of Khalkos Spawn has the **Sting**, which is a melee weapon attack that rolls +6 to hit at a reach of 5 feet against one creature. If successful, it deals two forms of damage: 13 piercing damage plus 14 poison damage, or if the swarm is bloodied, an alternative damage option of 8 piercing damage plus 7 poison damage. This versatility in its attack options allows it to adapt to different combat scenarios and maintain pressure on enemies.

The creatureâ€™s notable ability, **Chaos Pheromones**, creates an area of confusion for nearby foes. This ability emits pheromones in a 10-foot radius around the swarm, affecting all non-khalkos creatures within that radius. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or become confused for an effective duration of 1 minute. While confused, affected creatures will repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, allowing for potential ends to the effect. A critical aspect of this ability is that upon succeeding in the save or having the effect end, the creature becomes immune to the chaos pheromones for the next 24 hours, preventing repeated losses from this unique attack.

Overall, the Swarm of Khalkos Spawn is a dangerous adversary that can outmaneuver opponents and create chaos on the battlefield through effective debuffs and challenging attacks.
