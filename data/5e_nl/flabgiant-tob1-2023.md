The Flab Giant is a powerful creature representing the chaotic evil alignment in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. This large giant is slow-moving, with a walking speed of only 20 feet, but it compensates for this with impressive strength and durability. Boasting an Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor and a significant pool of 110 hit points, the Flab Giant can withstand a fair amount of damage in combat. It possesses an exceptional Strength score of 20, allowing it to deal hefty melee damage and grapple smaller opponents effectively. However, its Dexterity is very low, making it poor at avoiding ranged attacks, and it lacks intelligence, charisma, and wisdom, which limits its utility outside of combat. The Flab Giant's biggest strengths lie in its ability to restrain and damage foes through grappling maneuvers, making it a formidable opponent for unprepared adventurers.

The Flab Giant has several noteworthy abilities and attributes. Its Strength score of 20 grants it a +5 modifier, contributing to excellent offensive power with melee attacks. Its Constitution score of 16 gives it a +3 modifier, enhancing its overall resilience with a strong saving throw of +5 against physical ailments. With a Dexterity of 6, it suffers from a -2 modifier, which is classified as very bad, placing it at a disadvantage in Dexterity saving throws. It is immune to poison damage and cannot be poisoned due to its damage and condition immunities, which are significant advantages against certain types of attacks. This creature has a passive Perception score of 13, resulting from its Wisdom score of 13, providing it with average awareness of its surroundings. 

The Flab Giant possesses a special ability called "Massive Bulk," which prevents it from taking the Dash action, thus limiting its mobility further. However, this ability grants disadvantage to any creature that attempts to grapple, push, or knock the Flab Giant prone, making it significantly harder to control in combat.

In terms of actions, the Flab Giant can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Slam attacks in one turn. These Slam attacks have a +7 to hit, maintaining a good chance of landing strikes against opponents. Each successful Slam deals 12 bludgeoning damage. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, that creature becomes grappled, setting a challenging situation for smaller party members who could find themselves in serious trouble.

Another notable action is the "Squatting Pin." When the Flab Giant grapples a creature, that targeted creature must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw to avoid taking 22 bludgeoning damage and becoming restrained. If the creature succeeds, it takes half the damage but remains grappled, unable to escape without making a second successful check. The restraint brings further peril, as the pinned creature will suffer ongoing bludgeoning damage of 8 at the start of each of the Giant's turns until they escape. If the Flab Giant moves while holding a grappled creature, that creature is immediately freed from both the grapple and restraint.

Overall, the Flab Giant is a powerful melee combatant that can hold its own against many foes but struggles with mobility and ranged defense. It poses a unique challenge for adventurers who must strategize to avoid being pinned or severely damaged by its formidable strength.
