Among Gnyan's special abilities, "Aura of Hope" grants all friendly creatures within 30 feet advantage on saving throws against being frightened, significantly boosting morale in combat. The "Glorious Milk" ability allows Gnyan to produce healing milk over a minute, restoring 7 hit points and reducing exhaustion levels when consumed, but it can only do so until it reaches certain thresholds, requiring a long rest afterward to reuse. Gnyan can utilize a "Pounce" attack to knock a target prone if it moves straight towards them, leading to additional damage opportunities.
