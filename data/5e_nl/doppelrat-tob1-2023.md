The Doppelrat is a Tiny monstrosity known for its cunning and adaptability in combat. With an Armor Class of 13 and a hit point total of 45, this creature is relatively resilient for its size, allowing it to endure some damage. It possesses an impressive Dexterity of 17, giving it a very good modifier of +3, which enhances its ability to dodge attacks and escape danger. However, its physical strength is incredibly low, with a Strength score of just 2, resulting in a very bad modifier of -4. This imbalance makes the Doppelrat heavily reliant on its special abilities and stealth tactics rather than physical confrontation. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating it represents a moderate challenge for adventurers, with a reward of 450 experience points for defeating it. 

The Doppelrat has several notable attributes: it has a decent Constitution at +2, which provides it with some extra resilience, but it lacks intelligence and charisma, scoring only 2 in both stats, leading to very bad modifiers of -4. While its Wisdom is average at +1, it leverages its keen senses with darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 11. The creature excels in stealth, boasting a +5 skill modifier, making it particularly effective at avoiding detection in shadowy settings.

One of its defining special abilities is Arcane Doubling, which allows the Doppelrat to create duplicates of itself that act as a swarm of rats. This swarm functions as an ally and can move with the Doppelrat using its reaction, creating a tactical advantage in combat. The swarm can persist for up to one minute or until the Doppelrat is dismissed or killed, but the doppelrat is limited to controlling two swarms at a time. Another ability, Hidden Original, grants the Doppelrat total cover while it’s inside a swarm it has created, making it difficult for opponents to target it unless they succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. 

The Doppelrat is also capable of inflicting the Horrific Doppeling disease through its bite attack. This disease poisons the affected creature until cured and has a lingering effect where the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw after each long rest, or it suffers the grotesque outcome of shedding a tumor resembling a smaller version of itself. The disease requires two successful saving throws for complete recovery. 

In combat, the Doppelrat uses its Bite attack, which has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If the attack is successful, it deals 5 piercing damage (1d4 + 3), and the target must then succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract the horrific doppeling disease. 

In summary, the Doppelrat excels in evasion, deception, and inflicting debilitating conditions while relying on creating distractions through its summoning abilities.
