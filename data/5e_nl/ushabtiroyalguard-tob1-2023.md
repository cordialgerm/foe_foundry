The Ushabti Royal Guard is a large construct that serves as a formidable guardian, often positioned to protect ancient treasures or tombs. With an impressive Armor Class of 19, it boasts a significant total of 168 hit points, making it a durable combatant. This creature is classified as unaligned, relying primarily on its mechanical nature rather than moral inclinations. One of its key strengths lies in its resilience, demonstrated by its immunities to various conditions such as poison, psychic attacks, and physical damage from nonmagical sources. However, it does possess a weakness in its lack of social skills, as indicated by its low Charisma score. In combat, the Ushabti employs a combination of necrotic-infused weapon attacks and debilitating special abilities, making it a powerful foe that can control the battlefield while dealing substantial damage.

The Ushabti Royal Guard has the following ability scores: Strength at 22 (+6), Dexterity at 16 (+3), Constitution at 20 (+5), Intelligence at 11 (+0), Wisdom at 19 (+4), and Charisma at 9 (-1). These scores provide the Ushabti with very good physical capabilities and good mental fortitude, particularly in Wisdom. Its saving throw modifiers include a +9 for Wisdom and +4 for Charisma, which are considered good, allowing it to resist spells and effects that involve these attributes.

For skills, the Ushabti has proficiency in Arcana and History, both at +5, and a high Perception score of +9, making it very good at detecting and understanding magical phenomena. It also boasts several immunities to damage types and conditions, including bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, further enhancing its durability in combat.

The special abilities of the Ushabti Royal Guard are as follows:

- **Construct Nature:** This ability allows the Ushabti to function without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep, making it tireless and autonomous.
- **False Appearance:** While it is motionless, the Ushabti resembles a normal funerary statue, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting intruders.
- **Healing Leech:** If a creature within 30 feet regains hit points through spells or magical effects, it only regains half the amount, while the Ushabti receives the other half, effectively tapping into the healing magic around it.
- **Immutable Form:** This ability provides immunity to spells or effects that attempt to change the Ushabti's form, making it resistant to various magical manipulations.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When failing a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead, making it very hard to incapacitate.
- **Magic Resistance:** The Ushabti has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which is a significant asset in combat.
- **Necrotic Weapons:** Its weapon attacks are magical, dealing extra necrotic damage upon hitting, increasing its overall damage output.

In terms of actions, the Ushabti can perform the following:

- **Multiattack:** This allows the Ushabti to use its Breath-Stealing Presence and make two Khopesh attacks and one Medjai’s Scepter attack in a single turn.
- **Khopesh:** This melee attack has a +11 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 13 slashing damage and an additional 9 necrotic damage, making it a solid offensive option.
- **Medjai’s Scepter:** Similar to the Khopesh, this melee attack also has a +11 to hit and deals 15 bludgeoning damage along with 9 necrotic damage, providing versatility in damage types.
- **Breath-Stealing Presence:** Each creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 9 necrotic damage and be rendered unable to speak or breathe for one minute. This ability can severely hinder spellcasters or support characters.
- **Enervating Surge (Recharge 5–6):** This attack forces all creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against significant necrotic damage. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, they suffer a level of exhaustion and may rise as a mummy under the Ushabti’s control if they are slain.

The Ushabti also has a reaction known as **Sudden Strike**, which allows it to make a Khopesh attack against any creature moving within 5 feet, enabling it to punish movement around it.

Furthermore, the Ushabti can take legendary actions, including:

- **Move:** This allows it to reposition without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Medjai’s Scepter (Costs 2 Actions):** It makes one attack with the scepter.
- **Telekinesis (Costs 2 Actions):** It can target two creatures, forcing them to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw to avoid being moved and restrained, allowing for battlefield control.

Overall, the Ushabti Royal Guard presents a daunting challenge with its strong defenses, effective area control spells, and powerful attacks that combine both necrotic and physical damage. Its presence on the battlefield can significantly alter the dynamics of combat, requiring strategic planning from any opposing adventurers.
