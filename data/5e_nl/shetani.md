The Shetani is a Medium neutral evil fiend known for its formidable combat prowess and spellcasting abilities. With a high Armor Class of 18, it is well-protected, while its impressive 190 hit points make it a durable adversary in battle. Able to move quickly on foot and even faster while flying, the Shetani can engage or disengage from combat according to its strategy. It poses a significant challenge to adventurers due to its range of powerful attacks, magical resistance, and special abilities. However, it is not invincible; its reliance on spells and physical attacks means it can be disrupted if opponents can overcome its defenses and resistances. 

The Shetani possesses the following ability scores: Strength of 17 (+3, which is good), Dexterity of 19 (+4, which is very good), Constitution of 20 (+5, which is exceptional), Intelligence of 18 (+4, which is very good), Wisdom of 17 (+3, which is good), and Charisma of 20 (+5, which is exceptional). For saving throws, it has a good Dexterity saving throw of +9, a good Wisdom saving throw of +8, and a very bad Charisma saving throw of +1. Its skills include a moderate perception skill with a +3 modifier. Damage immunities to fire and poison grant it strong resistance against those types of attacks, while its damage resistance to cold and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attacks (except those made with silvered weapons) adds an additional layer of durability. It is immune to being poisoned and has darkvision up to 120 feet, along with a passive perception of 18, which aids in noticing hidden opponents or traps. The Shetani understands Abyssal, Common, and Infernal languages and can communicate telepathically up to 120 feet away.

The Shetani's special abilities significantly enhance its combat effectiveness. "Devil's Sight" lets the Shetani see in magical darkness, making it extremely dangerous when engaging foes who rely on darkness spells for cover. Its "Magic Resistance" provides the creature advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, allowing it to resist many forms of magical attacks effectively. Additionally, its weapon attacks are classified as magical, meaning they can bypass certain resistances, and when it strikes, it adds an additional 4d8 necrotic damage to its normal slashing damage.

In terms of actions, the Shetani can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three attacks with either its claws or necrotic bolts. It also has the option to replace one of these with an instance of spellcasting. The Shetani's "Claw" attack is a melee weapon attack that utilizes a +9 modifier to hit. When successful, it inflicts 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage, as well as 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. The "Necrotic Bolt" is a ranged spell attack with a +10 modifier to hit, which can target a creature within 120 feet and deals 27 (5d8+5) necrotic damage upon a successful hit. 

One of its most devastating abilities is "Desiccating Breath," which can be used every 5-6 rounds. This power allows Shetani to inhale and draw the moisture from surrounding creatures within a 15-foot radius. Each non-Construct or Undead creature affected must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 54 (12d8) necrotic damage. If a creature fails this saving throw by 5 or more, it suffers one level of exhaustion, drastically reducing its effectiveness in combat.

Lastly, the Shetaniâ€™s "Spellcasting" capability allows it to weave various spells into its combat strategy. With a Charisma spell save DC of 18, it can cast spells at will, such as "Charm Person" and "Silent Image." It can use "Major Image" and "Suggestion" three times a day, as well as "Mirage Arcane" and "Programmed Illusion" once a day each, which can drastically alter the battlefield or manipulate opponents.

As a bonus action, the Shetani can "Change Shape," transforming into a Large or smaller Beast or Humanoid, or reverting back to its true fiend form. In its alternate forms, its statistics remain the same aside from size and speed, and it can alter the appearance of items it wears or carries, which can be advantageous for infiltration or deception. This ability to change forms further cements the Shetani's role as a cunning and adaptable foe in any encounter.
