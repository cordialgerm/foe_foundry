The Idolic Deity is a Small Construct of neutral evil alignment that serves as a formidable adversary in combat. With its impressive armor class of 17 and a substantial 105 hit points, it can absorb a good amount of damage before falling. Its challenge rating of 8 indicates that it poses a significant threat to mid-level adventurers. The creature is highlighted by its high Dexterity and Charisma, which translate into exceptional stealth and deception skills, allowing it to operate effectively in a subtle manner. While it is immune to several damage types and conditions, its real strength lies in its ability to undermine divine power through its Apostasy Aura, making it particularly threatening to spellcasting allies.

The Idolic Deity has the following attributes: Strength of 14, Dexterity of 20, Constitution of 18, Intelligence of 10, Wisdom of 11, and Charisma of 20. Its dexterity provides a very good +5 modifier, enhancing its stealth capabilities significantly. The Constitution score results in a good +4 modifier, contributing to its resilience in battle. However, its Intelligence is average with a +0 modifier, indicating it lacks any special capabilities related to mental prowess. The Charisma score boasts an exceptional +5 modifier, affecting its ability to deceive and influence others through its skills.

The creature possesses several noteworthy special abilities. The Apostasy Aura causes any creature attempting to use divine or celestial power to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, resulting in the loss of their spell or ability on failure. This is particularly disruptive for healing and support classes. Its Construct Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing for sustained activity. The False Appearance ability enables it to blend perfectly into its surroundings when not in motion, providing an element of surprise. Finally, its Incorporeal Movement allows it to traverse through objects and creatures, creating tactical advantages at the cost of taking minor force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

In combat, the Idolic Deity can take multiple actions, beginning with a special ability called Seduce the Righteous. This ability corrupts a creature within 30 feet, imposing disadvantage on their attacks or saving throws after a failed DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. This is particularly potent against divine spellcasters who will have a harder time resisting its influence. The Multiattack action allows the Idolic Deity to use Seduce the Righteous followed by two Slam attacks. The Slam attack has a +8 to hit, making it a good weapon in close quarters, dealing 8 bludgeoning damage along with 18 psychic damage, significantly increasing the total damage potential.

Additionally, it can utilize the bonus action Shadow Stealth, allowing for a Hide action in dim light or darkness, enhancing its ability to ambush or evade during combat. The combination of abilities, defensive measures, and tactical versatility makes the Idolic Deity a complex and dangerous foe that adventurers must contend with carefully.
