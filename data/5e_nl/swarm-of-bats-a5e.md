The Swarm of Bats is a Medium-sized beast characterized by its ability to maneuver in groups, utilizing numbers to overwhelm opponents. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, this creature has a fair amount of versatility in combat, primarily relying on its speed and ability to continuously swarm its foes. It possesses reasonable defenses with an Armor Class of 12, and its Hit Points of 18 provide some resilience in battle. Notably, the swarm is immune to a variety of conditions, allowing it to maintain its effectiveness in combat against a multitude of attacks. However, its overall physical attributes are quite limited, with a very poor Strength score, making it reliant on its swarm tactics and damage output rather than sheer physical might.

The Swarm of Bats has the following attributes: Strength at 4, Dexterity at 14, Constitution at 10, Intelligence at 2, Wisdom at 12, and Charisma at 4. The Dexterity score of 14 provides a good modifier of +2, enhancing its agility and effectiveness in dodging attacks, while its Strength score of 4 results in a very bad modifier of -3, severely limiting its physical capabilities. The Constitution of 10 shows average resilience, with no modifier. Overall, the swarm's ability scores highlight its reliance on Dexterity for maneuverability and evasion, while its Strength makes it ineffective in direct confrontations.

In terms of its special abilities, the Swarm of Bats has Echolocation, meaning it cannot use its blindsight if it becomes deafened. It also has Keen Hearing, giving it an advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing, making it very effective at detecting sounds and movements in its environment. The Swarm ability allows it to occupy the space of other creatures and squeeze through tight openings suited for Tiny creatures; however, it cannot gain or benefit from hit points or temporary hit points.

In combat, the Swarm of Bats can use its Bites action, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, allowing it to strike at opponents with a reach of 0 feet. When it hits, it deals 7 piercing damage, or 3 piercing damage if it is bloodied (having lost half of its hit points). This damage output can be significant, especially when the swarm attacks in numbers, making them a nuisance in combat.

Overall, the Swarm of Bats is best used as a harassing force, targeting weaker foes and relying on its mobility and numbers to create chaos on the battlefield.
