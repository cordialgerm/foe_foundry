The Kobold Broodguard Dragon Servitor is a small humanoid creature that serves as a guardian and fighter for dragonkind, embodying the adaptable and cunning nature typical of kobolds. With an armor class of 16 and hit points totaling 44, it can withstand considerable damage in battle. It operates effectively at a Challenge Rating of 2, making it a moderately tough opponent. The Broodguard excels in coordinated attacks, leveraging its Pack Tactics to gain advantage on rolls when allies are near. However, it struggles in direct sunlight due to its Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on attacks and sight-based perception checks. This creature is particularly strong in melee combat, where its attacks can inflict significant damage, especially against smaller foes.

The attributes of the Kobold Broodguard are as follows: Strength is 14 (+2), Dexterity is 14 (+2), Constitution is 14 (+2), Intelligence is 10 (+0), Wisdom is 10 (+0), and Charisma is 12 (+1). These scores provide it with good physical capabilities for both offensive and defensive actions, with average mental attributes. The modifiers reflect that its physical strengths are good, contributing positively to attack rolls and defenses.

For special abilities, the Kobold Broodguard has several noteworthy traits: 

- **Pack Tactics** grants the creature advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is close by, enhancing its effectiveness in group combat situations. This ability is very good, as it allows for more consistent hits.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity** makes it vulnerable in bright light conditions, which is a notable weakness that can be strategically exploited by enemies. This trait can be described as bad.
- **Dragons Blood** provides resistance to a specific damage type associated with its master’s breath weapon, giving it an exceptional defensive mechanism against that type of damage.
- **Ominous Shadow** negates the Sunlight Sensitivity effect when the creature is within 60 feet of its master, allowing it to perform better in combat. This conditional ability is good, as it greatly improves its combat capabilities in the right circumstances.
- **Draconic Smite** allows the creature to deal an additional 1d4 damage on a successful melee attack if it has advantage. The extra damage type aligns with its master’s breath weapon, making it a very effective attack enhancement.

The Broodguard’s actions include a Multiattack option, allowing it to strike effectively twice in one turn: 

- **Bill Hook** has a +4 to hit with a range of 10 feet, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or fall prone, providing a strategic advantage by potentially limiting the target's movement.
- **Spiked Shield** also has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, making it a reliable melee option.
- **Sling** provides a ranged attacking option with a +4 to hit at a range of 30/120 feet, dealing 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage, which allows it to engage opponents from a distance.

As a reaction, the Kobold Broodguard can use **Rally!** once per day. When it takes damage, it can shout a rallying cry that grants immunity to the frightened condition for all kobolds within 30 feet who can hear it, lasting for 1 minute. Additionally, these allies will deal an extra 1d4 damage on their next attack roll made before the effect ends. This ability can significantly boost the morale and damage output of allied kobolds, making it a powerful team support tool.
