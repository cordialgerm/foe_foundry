The creature has a high Challenge Rating of 11, indicating its significant threat level in encounters. It excels in both melee and ranged attacks, utilizing a multi-faceted approach in battle. With resistance to several damage types and immunity to many debilitating conditions, it is a resilient adversary.

The Intelligence and Wisdom scores are both average at 12 (+1), offering only decent mental capabilities, whereas its Charisma score of 18 (+4) is exceptional, reflecting its ability to manipulate and deceive others effectively.

In terms of saving throws, the Herald has significant bonuses with a +8 in Strength and Charisma, +5 in Wisdom, and +4 in Dexterity. These high saving throw values indicate that the Herald can resist effects that might hinder its performance in combat or its inherent magical capabilities.

The creature is immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, showcasing strong defensive capabilities.

The Herald of Slaughter has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Corrupting Aura extends a 30-foot radius where creatures risk becoming hostile if they fail a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. This ability can drastically affect the battlefield dynamics, forcing enemies to attack their own allies if they are close to the Herald. The Magic Weapons feature ensures that its attacks are considered magical, allowing them to bypass certain resistances.

It possesses the Shapechanger ability, allowing it to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid or revert to its true form at will. This can be used strategically for deception or infiltration without altering its combat capabilities.

The Herald has Innate Spellcasting tied to its Charisma (spell save DC 16), enabling it to cast a selection of spells. It can cast Detect Thoughts at will, providing insight into the mind of a nearby creature. Three times a day, it may cast Charm Person, Fear, and Suggestion, each of which can manipulate and control opponents, creating chaos on the battlefield. Once per day, it can modify memory or use the Seeming spell to alter the appearances of creatures around it. These spells enhance its formidable ability to influence and disrupt encounters.

In battle, the Herald utilizes a Multiattack action, making three attacks: one Gore attack and two Cleaver attacks, or it can choose to use Enkindle Hate twice. The Gore attack is powerful, requiring a DC 16 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone, while the Cleaver attack combines slashing and necrotic damage. Enkindle Hate allows it to target an enemy from a distance with a ranged spell attack, dealing substantial fire damage and potentially blinding the victim if they fail a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Each of these attacks can turn the tide of combat in favor of the Herald, making it a terrifying force on the battlefield.
