The Kobold Sapper is a small humanoid creature that embodies cunning and resourcefulness, designed for ambush and sabotage. As a lawful neutral being, it operates with a set code of behavior, often adhering to strict loyalty towards its tribe. With an Armor Class of 15, the Sapper can evade attacks reasonably well, supported by its decent hit points of 66, allowing it to endure several rounds in battle. Although physically weak with a Strength score of 7 (-2), it possesses exceptional Dexterity with a score of 16 (+3) which enhances its agility and accuracy, making it a threat in ranged combat. The Sapper also excels in intelligence-related tasks, with an Intelligence score of 16 (+3) allowing for clever traps and tactics. However, its low Charisma and Wisdom scores may hinder its interactions with others and its perception abilities.

In terms of abilities, the Kobold Sapper has several special traits that greatly enhance its effectiveness in combat and in manipulative scenarios. The Crafty ability provides the Sapper with advantage on ability checks for picking locks and detecting traps, making it a formidable opponent in environments rich with mechanical hazards. Its Evasion ability allows the Sapper to completely avoid damage from area effects that allow a Dexterity saving throw, showcasing its exceptional agility. The Pack Tactics ability grants the Sapper an advantage on attack rolls against enemies if at least one of its allies is within proximity, which can significantly boost its damage potential in group combat situations. The Siege Monster trait empowers the Sapper to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it a considerable asset when destroying fortifications.

The Sapper also has a significant weakness; it suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, imposing disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks when exposed to sunlight, forcing it to operate primarily in darker environments. 

In terms of actions, the Kobold Sapper can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike with its Mining Picks three times in one turn, using a +5 to hit, dealing an average of 6 piercing damage per successful attack. It can replace one attack with a Throw Explosive action, which allows the Sapper to launch a small explosive within 30 feet, dealing 9 force damage and knocking the targeted creature prone if they fail a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13). 

The Sapper possesses the powerful Explosive Charge ability, which has a recharge requirement of 5 to 6. This action allows it to launch a large explosive at a designated point within 60 feet, affecting all creatures within a 15-foot radius with a damaging blast of both fire and force, pushing them away from the explosion's epicenter and potentially knocking them prone. Furthermore, if a creature fails its saving throw by 5 or more, it becomes deafened for one minute. The Sapper can also opt to place an explosive in a space near itself and delay its detonation until the end of its next turn or when a creature moves within range, demonstrating a tactical use of traps to control the battlefield.

Overall, the Kobold Sapper is a clever and dangerous creature, particularly effective in group tactics and ambushes, making it a worthwhile adversary in any encounter.
