The Leonino is a tiny beast that serves as a nimble and elusive creature in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, it is a relatively low-powered opponent, providing 25 experience points upon defeat. Notably agile, with a Dexterity score of 16, the Leonino can fly with a speed of 40 feet and walk at 30 feet. Its good mobility is complemented by a decent armor class of 13 and a modest hit point total of 13, giving it a balance of survivability and evasion. The creature possesses a variety of special abilities that enhance its capacity to stay out of harm's way while also presenting unique challenges to potential adversaries. 

In terms of attributes, the Leonino has a Strength score of 10, which is average, and an exceptional Dexterity of 16, leading to a +5 modifier for Dexterity saving throws and a +5 to its Stealth skill. Its Constitution score of 14 provides a good +2 modifier to Constitution saving throws. However, the Leonino has a very bad Intelligence of 8 (-1 modifier) and below-average Wisdom of 8 (-1 modifier). It possesses an average Charisma of 12 (+1 modifier), which supports its better-than-average persuasion skills (+3). The Leonino also has darkvision up to 30 feet and a passive perception of 11.

The Leonino's special abilities enhance its stealthy nature and survivability. The Flyby ability allows it to move away from enemies without provoking opportunity attacks, making it extremely maneuverable during combat. Its exceptional Evasion ability means that when faced with effects that require Dexterity saving throws to reduce or negate damage, the Leonino avoids damage entirely on a successful save and only suffers half damage on a failure. Additionally, the Silent Wings ability grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while flying in forested or urban settings, making it especially stealthy in such environments.

The Leonino can attack using its Bite action, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, the attack delivers 5 (1d4 + 3) points of slashing damage. A unique feature of this bite attack is its charming effect; if the Leonino has not hit the target in the previous 24 hours, the target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the Leonino for one hour, introducing a strategic element to its approach in combat or interactions. This characteristic adds a layer of complexity, as the Leonino can both inflict damage and potentially sway its enemies through charm.
