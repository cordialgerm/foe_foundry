The Goat is a Medium-sized beast with a role that primarily focuses on simple physical attacks. With a challenge rating of 0, it poses minimal threat to adventurers and is more likely to serve as a minor obstacle or wildlife encounter rather than a significant adversary. Its attributes exhibit average strength, dexterity, and constitution, making it neither particularly weak nor strong. The Goat's most notable aspect is its ram attack, which can deal decent damage to opponents, especially if it charges beforehand. While it has low hit points and armor class, it can still present a challenge for low-level characters due to its ability to knock opponents prone.

The Goat has the following ability scores: Strength at 10 with a modifier of +0, Dexterity at 10 with a modifier of +0, Constitution at 10 with a modifier of +0, Intelligence at 2 with a modifier of -4 (very bad), Wisdom at 10 with a modifier of +0, and Charisma at 4 with a modifier of -3 (bad). Its athletic skill is average, contributing a +2 modifier to athletics checks. The Goat has passive perception of 10, indicating it is average at noticing its surroundings, but it has no language capabilities.

In terms of actions, the Goat has a melee attack called "Ram." This ability allows the Goat to make an attack roll with a +2 modifier. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and targets one creature. On a successful hit, the attack deals 2 points of bludgeoning damage, based on a roll of 1d4. If the Goat charges at least 20 feet straight towards an opponent before attacking, it inflicts an additional 2 points of bludgeoning damage and forces the target to make a DC 10 Strength saving throw. If the target fails this saving throw, it will fall prone, which can significantly impact combat by making it easier for other attackers to hit the fallen opponent.
