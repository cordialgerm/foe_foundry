The Moppet is a tiny construct, primarily designed not for combat but rather as a tool for psychological manipulation and confusion. It is characterized by its low physical capabilities but compensates with a unique set of abilities that can disrupt the actions and thoughts of its foes. With an Armor Class of 10 and a modest 17 hit points, the Moppet has very low durability. However, it's immune to poison and psychic damage, and it cannot be affected by many common conditions. Its strength lies in its ability to absorb psychic energy and manifest nightmares, making it a threatening presence despite its small size. The Moppet can contribute to combat by incapacitating foes and invoking their fears, but its overall challenge rating of 1 means that it is not particularly strong in a direct confrontation.

The Moppet has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 3 (modifier: -4, which is very bad for physical attacks)
- Dexterity: 10 (modifier: +0, average agility)
- Constitution: 10 (modifier: +0, average durability)
- Intelligence: 3 (modifier: -4, very bad for mental tasks)
- Wisdom: 10 (modifier: +0, average awareness)
- Charisma: 15 (modifier: +2, good for interactions)

It has a skill in perception, with a proficiency bonus that gives it a total of +0, meaning it is not particularly good at noticing details. Moppets are immune to poison and psychic damage and cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, stunned, or rendered unconscious. They have darkvision, allowing them to see in dim light as if it were bright light, up to a range of 60 feet, with a passive perception score of 10. While they understand a language spoken by their creator, they cannot speak.

One of the Moppet's special abilities is its Construct Nature, which means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep. Its False ability allows it to appear motionless and indistinguishable from a normal doll, making it capable of stealth and deception. The Psychic Pool ability is particularly intriguing; it can absorb psychic energy up to a total of four Psychic Points. When the Moppet is within 5 feet of its owner and a spell is being cast, it can spend these points to cast the spell without using the owner's spell slot.

In terms of action options, the Moppet can use Psychic Burst, which is a melee or ranged spell attack with a +4 to hit. This deals 9 damage (2d6+2 psychic) to a target within 5 feet or up to 60 feet away. If the Moppet scores a critical hit with this attack, it gains a Psychic Point. Its other primary action is Waking Nightmare, which targets each creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher within a 60-foot radius. They must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw; failure means they enter a collective fugue state, becoming unconscious but still holding onto their belongings. In this state, they face an illusory creature resembling a brown bear that attacks with psychic damage rather than the usual physical types. The fight occurs in the minds of those affected, and while affected, if a creature takes damage from a source other than the nightmare, they can attempt a saving throw with advantage to end the effect.

For bonus actions, the Moppet has Nimble Moves, which allows it to take the Dash or Disengage action, providing it with some additional mobility and survival tactics during combat.
