The Inkling is a tiny, unaligned construct character in Dungeons & Dragons 5e, known for its agility and magical capabilities. With an Armor Class of 12 and Hit Points of 10, it can withstand a few attacks but is quite fragile overall. Its unique abilities and spells make it a fascinating ally or adversary, particularly due to its capacity for stealth and magic resistance, which allows it to effectively evade magical attacks. Although its physical Strength is very low, it is not meant for melee combat; rather, it excels with its innate spellcasting and ability to learn new spells through careful study. As a construct, it does not exhibit classic living creature traits, which may leave it vulnerable to certain forms of attack. 

The creature has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 4, with a modifier of -3, which is considered very bad and reflects its inability to perform any physical tasks effectively.
- Dexterity: 14, with a modifier of +2; this is good and highlights its agility and ability to dodge attacks.
- Constitution: 10, with a modifier of +0, which is average, indicating it has no particular resilience or frailty.
- Intelligence: 14, with a modifier of +2; this is good and emphasizes its aptitude for magic and learning.
- Wisdom: 12, with a modifier of +1, which is average, showing a decent awareness of its surroundings.
- Charisma: 10, with a modifier of +0, which is average and indicates that it does not possess any particular charm or presence.

The Inkling has skills in Arcana and Stealth, both at +4, making it very good at both recognizing magical phenomena and remaining undetected. It possesses blindsight out to 60 feet, making it aware of its surroundings without relying on sight, though it cannot perceive anything beyond this range. The creature understands the languages of its creator but cannot speak.

Several special abilities enhance its capabilities:
- Amorphous allows the Inkling to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch, offering exceptional mobility in tight situations.
- A Thirst for Knowledge enables the Inkling to learn and memorize one 2nd level or lower spell after spending 24 hours studying appropriate materials, increasing its versatility.
- Magic Resistance grants the creature advantage on saving throws against spells, providing it a very good defense against magical attacks.
- Innate Spellcasting means the Inkling can cast spells using its Intelligence, with a Spell Save DC of 12 and a +4 to hit with spell attacks. 

The spells it can cast include:
- At will: Fire Bolt, a ranged attack dealing damage; Mending, which repairs broken items; Minor Illusion, creating illusory effects; and Prestidigitation, which performs minor magical tricks.
- Once per day: Color Spray, sprays a burst of colors that can blind creatures; Detect Magic, which allows it to sense magical auras; and Magic Missile, a guaranteed hit spell that deals force damage.

In terms of actions, the Inkling can perform a melee attack called Lash, which has a +4 to hit and inflicts 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage upon a successful hit.

For reactions, it has Redirect Spell, allowing it to turn an incoming spell attack back into another target. The attacker must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw; failure means the spell hits another chosen target within 30 feet, which can greatly alter the course of battle.

Overall, the Inkling is a clever and elusive creature that can be a valuable asset in magical situations, particularly due to its ability to learn new spells and manipulate others' magical attacks.
