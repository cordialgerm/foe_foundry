The Catscratch is a huge aberration embodying chaotic evil, serving as a formidable opponent in any Dungeons and Dragons campaign. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a significant threat to low- to mid-level parties. The Catscratch relies on its physical prowess—recording a Strength score of 18, yielding a +4 modifier, which is considered very good. Its Dexterity of 14 provides a +2 modifier, resulting in a good level of agility, while its Constitution score of 17 grants it a +3 modifier, ensuring a solid amount of hit points with a total of 76, calculated as 8d12+24. While its mental attributes are notably weak, particularly with an Intelligence score of 3 (-4 modifier, which is very bad), the Catscratch compensates with its enhanced physical capabilities, speed, and special abilities that allow it to sustain itself in combat.

The Catscratch possesses an Armor Class of 13, which is average, and it can climb at a rate of 15 feet and walk 30 feet, making it quite mobile for a creature of its size. It is immune to poison damage and cannot be affected by the poisoned condition, which provides a unique resilience in battles involving poison-based attacks. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, allowing it to hunt effectively in a variety of environments.

In terms of special abilities, the Catscratch benefits from Keen Smell, granting it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve smell, which enhances its tracking and survival skills. Its Nine Lives ability allows it to survive a potentially fatal blow, instead dropping to 9 hit points once per rest, making it difficult to eliminate. The Pounce ability enhances its combat tactics, allowing it to execute a knockdown maneuver: if it travels 20 feet straight toward a target and hits with a claw attack, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, setting it up for an additional bite attack as a bonus action.

In combat, the Catscratch can execute a Multiattack, making both a bite and a claw attack on its turn. The bite attack uses a +6 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage. Additionally, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour, with felids or feline humanoids facing the risk of contracting the catscratch fugue if they fail the save. The claw attack is also made with a +6 to hit, dealing 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage. Lastly, the Catscratch can use a Vomit ability, recharging on a roll of 5 or 6, to release poisonous bile in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in this area must pass a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, risking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful save, with felids and feline humanoids facing the same catscratch fugue threat.

Overall, the Catscratch combines resilience, mobility, and a set of dangerous attacks that can disrupt and inflict significant harm on its adversaries, making it a noteworthy challenge for players to confront.
