The Scitalis is a large, unaligned monstrosity that serves as a formidable presence in aquatic environments. With its natural armor providing a decent defense rating of 13, it possesses 58 hit points, allowing it to sustain a fair amount of damage in combat. The Scitalis's swimming speed of 30 feet makes it an exceptional predator in water, while its 20 feet walking speed offers moderate mobility on land. Rated with a challenge level of 2, it poses a reasonable threat to adventurers, granting 450 experience points upon defeat. The creature has a combination of strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength with a +3 modifier, and Wisdom with a +4 modifier, making it effective at perceiving its surroundings while being able to deliver dangerous attacks. However, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are notably low, suggesting a lack of cunning and social ability. 

The creature has Saving Throws with specific modifiers: Constitution is +3, which represents a good resistance to various physical effects; Wisdom is +6, indicating exceptional resistance to mental challenges; and Charisma is +2, showcasing a very bad influence in social interactions. The Scitalis exhibits a high perception skill of +6, enhancing its ability to detect threats or hidden creatures. It also possesses damage resistance to cold, making it less vulnerable to such attacks. Additionally, its blindsight ability allows it to sense nearby creatures within 10 feet without relying on sight, augmenting its tactical advantages. 

One of the notable special abilities of the Scitalis is its Magic Resistance, which grants the creature advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. This significantly increases its survivability against spellcasting opponents. 

In terms of actions, the Scitalis can perform a Bite attack, making melee weapon attacks with a +5 to hit. This attack has a reach of 10 feet and can potentially hit one target, dealing 6 piercing damage, which is an average amount for melee encounters, alongside 9 poison damage from an additional 2d8 roll, which can be quite dangerous since it adds variety and potential for high damage in a single attack.

Another powerful ability is the Stunning Scales. This attack affects all creatures within 60 feet that can see the Scitalis, requiring them to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in being stunned for 1 minute. The creature can end this effect by succeeding on the saving throw at the end of its turns, which is quite impactful as stunning limits the affected creature's actions. If the effect ends for a creature, it gains immunity against the Stunning Scales for the next 24 hours, so it is crucial for adventurers to manage their positions carefully when facing a Scitalis.
