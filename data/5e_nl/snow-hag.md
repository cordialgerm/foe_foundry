The Snow Hag is a medium-sized fey creature known for its neutral evil alignment. As a formidable foe, it brings a combination of magical abilities and physical attacks that can catch unsuspecting adventurers off guard. With a challenge rating of 3, the Snow Hag is best suited for mid-level encounters, presenting a balanced threat due to its strong magical arsenal and decent physical prowess. It has high hit points, a good armor class, and excels in cold environments while being particularly vulnerable to fire. This makes it a strategic opponent that can manipulate its surroundings and create illusions to mislead its enemies.

The Snow Hag has an Armor Class of 17, which provides good protection in combat, making it somewhat challenging to hit. With 82 hit points, derived from 11d8 plus 33, it can withstand a fair amount of damage before being defeated, an average durability for creatures of its challenge rating. Its movement speed is 30 feet on foot, allowing for average mobility in combat scenarios. The attributes of the Snow Hag include a Strength score of 16 (+3 modifier, which is considered good), Dexterity of 12 (+1, average), Constitution of 16 (+3, good), Intelligence of 13 (+1, average), Wisdom of 14 (+2, good), and Charisma of 16 (+3, good). These attributes make it particularly effective in melee combat due to its high strength and provide it with solid spellcasting capabilities through its high charisma.

In terms of skills, the Snow Hag is proficient in arcana (+3, good), deception (+5, good), and survival (+4, good). It has vulnerabilities to fire damage, while being completely immune to cold damage. The hag possesses darkvision out to 60 feet and has a passive perception of 12, which aids in detecting hidden creatures and objects. It can communicate in Common, Giant, and Sylvan languages, giving it a diverse set of communication options.

One notable special ability is Ice Walk, which allows the Snow Hag to traverse icy surfaces without penalty and doesn't impede its movement, making it a master of icy terrains. Its innate spellcasting is based on Charisma, with a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 modifier for spell attacks. It has several spells at its disposal: it can cast minor illusion, prestidigitation, and ray of frost at will, allowing it to create diversions, clean, or deal damage at a distance. Once per day, it can charm a person, create a fog cloud, or summon a sleet storm, which are effective for controlling the battlefield and influencing enemy behavior.

For its actions, the Snow Hag utilizes its Claws attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. It deals 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage on a successful hit, providing a solid option for close-quarters combat. A powerful ability, Icy Embrace, requires recharge on a 5-6 roll, where the hag exhales a freezing fog in a 15-foot radius. Creatures in this area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) cold damage and become restrained by ice for 1 minute. Successful saves result in halved damage with no restraint. Restrained creatures can attempt to break free by making a DC 13 Strength check or may destroy the ice, which has its own stats and vulnerabilities to fire and bludgeoning damage.

The Illusory Appearance ability allows the Snow Hag to disguise itself as another creature of similar size and shape. This illusion lasts until the hag either dismisses it or dies. Physical inspection reveals inconsistencies, requiring a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check for creatures to discern the truth of the illusion effectively. This ability enhances the hag's cunning, enabling it to manipulate encounters by deceiving other creatures about its true nature.
