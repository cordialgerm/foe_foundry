The Dragon Turtle is a gargantuan dragon-like creature that poses a formidable challenge to adventurers, especially at Challenge Rating 17. Known for its immense size and power, the Dragon Turtle is capable of dealing significant damage both in melee combat and through its special abilities. With an impressive Armor Class of 20 and a massive pool of 318 hit points, it is well-equipped to withstand attacks and continue fighting. Its movement capabilities are noteworthy, allowing it to swim at an impressive speed of 40 feet, making it a natural threat in aquatic environments. While it possesses high Strength and Constitution scores, making its physical attacks particularly dangerous, its Intelligence is average at best. However, its Wisdom is good, which aids in perception and awareness during combat. The Dragon Turtle can be a relentless adversary, especially when it uses its unique abilities to latch onto or demolish vehicles and structures.

The attributes of the Dragon Turtle are as follows: Strength is +7 (very good), Dexterity is +6 (good), Constitution is +11 (exceptional), Intelligence is +0 (average), Wisdom is +7 (very good), and Charisma is +1 (bad). Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, while its perception score of 17 is good, providing it with a keen awareness of its surroundings. It has a stealth score of 16, which is also good, allowing it to hide effectively in certain environments. The Dragon Turtle can communicate using Aquan, Common, and Draconic.

Regarding special abilities, the Dragon Turtle is amphibious, meaning it can breathe both air and water. It is classified as a siege monster, allowing it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it particularly devastating in combat scenarios where it is facing vehicles or fortified positions.

In terms of actions during combat, the Dragon Turtle can engage in a multiattack, which allows it to make one Bite attack, two Claw attacks, and one Tail attack. If it is latched onto a vehicle, it can increase its claw attacks to four. 

The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +13 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, dealing 33 piercing damage and an additional 7 fire damage upon a successful hit. Notably, the Dragon Turtle can choose to latch onto a vehicle instead of dealing damage, immobilizing it if it is Huge or smaller, or halving its speed if it is Gargantuan. While latched, the Dragon Turtle can make Bite attacks that automatically hit against that vehicle. The Dragon Turtle can willingly end this latching effect at any time.

The Claw attack is also a melee weapon attack that has a +13 to hit and can reach up to 10 feet, dealing 20 slashing damage on a successful hit. Similarly, the Tail attack has a +13 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, and inflicts 29 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed back up to 15 feet and knocked prone.

The Dragon Turtle has a powerful ability called Steam Breath, which can be used after a recharge of 5 to 6 turns. It exhales a cloud of scalding steam in a 60-foot cone, forcing all creatures in that area to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 56 fire damage; on a successful save, they only take half that damage. This ability is particularly dangerous in combat since it bypasses any resistance that might be provided by being underwater.

Lastly, the Dragon Turtle possesses a reaction known as Siege Follow-Through. If it destroys an object or structure with an attack, it can immediately make a Bite or Tail attack against a creature it can see within 5 feet of that destructed object or structure, giving it an additional assault opportunity after causing destruction in its vicinity.
