The Green Dragon Wyrmling is a powerful young dragon that embodies the characteristics common to its kind, being a formidable presence in both combat and exploration. It is classified as a Huge creature, which allows it to dominate the battlefield with significant attack power and resilience. With an Armor Class of 16, the wyrmling demonstrates good defensive capabilities, while its 55 hit points provide a solid buffer in combat. This dragon excels in forest environments, utilizing its Woodland Stalker ability to become especially adept at stealth, which can be advantageous for ambush tactics. However, it is still developing its full powers compared to older dragons, making it somewhat less dangerous than its adult counterparts. It possesses strong melee attacks and a potent breath weapon, which can impact multiple characters at once, but it is somewhat limited by its recharge mechanic.

The Green Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: Strength of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 12 (+1), Intelligence of 14 (+2), Wisdom of 10 (+0), and Charisma of 12 (+1). These values indicate that the wyrmling has good physical capabilities and decent mental acuity, making it a balanced threat. Its Strength and Dexterity scores provide an average level of effectiveness in physical confrontations. The Constitution score is slightly above average, contributing to its hit point total—but not significantly enough to categorize it as good. Intelligence shows that it is clever, while average Wisdom reflects its perception capabilities. The Charisma score establishes it as being somewhat persuasive.

In terms of skills, the wyrmling has proficiency in Perception (+2) and Stealth (+4)—the latter being significantly enhanced when in its favored forested environment due to the Woodland Stalker trait. This ability grants it advantage on Stealth checks, making it exceptionally good at hiding and setting ambushes. Additionally, it has immunities to poison damage and the poisoned condition, showcasing its resilience against various threats.

The creature has a blindsight ability that allows it to detect creatures within a 10-foot radius without relying on sight, and it possesses darkvision that lets it see in dim light as though it were bright light within 60 feet. Its passive Perception score stands at 12, which is average for detecting hidden enemies. The wyrmling communicates in Draconic, a language known for being both ancient and powerful.

In terms of actions, the Green Dragon Wyrmling can perform a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals an impressive 13 (2d10 + 2) points of piercing damage, making this a solid choice for close combat.

Additionally, it possesses the Poison Breath ability, which has a recharge mechanic that requires it to roll a 5 or 6 on a six-sided die at the start of its turn to be usable. When activated, the dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within this area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage, while those who succeed take half damage. This breath weapon is particularly devastating in group encounters, as it can affect multiple targets simultaneously, making it a vital part of the wyrmling’s offensive strategy.
