The Dragon Eel is a formidable aquatic creature that embodies the might and majesty of a dragon while also possessing unique aquatic abilities. This huge, neutral dragon excels in combat with high damage output and impressive defenses, marked by a solid Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 195. Its strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks, the ability to deal additional lightning damage, and its capacity to move freely between water and air, especially during storms. However, despite its high strength and constitution, it suffers from a moderate dexterity, which could make it less agile in combat situations. The Dragon Eel presents a captivating challenge for adventurers, blending raw power with strategic placement and environmental advantages.

The Dragon Eel has the following attributes: a Strength score of 26 granting a modifier of +8, indicating exceptional physical power; a Dexterity score of 12 with a +1 modifier showing average agility; a Constitution score of 20 with a +5 modifier reflecting very good endurance; an Intelligence score of 14 providing a +2 modifier suggesting average intellect; a Wisdom score of 13 with a +1 modifier for slightly above average perception; and a Charisma score of 14 also giving a +2 modifier indicating average social potency. 

The Dragon Eel's saving throw modifiers are as follows: Strength +12 (exceptional), Dexterity +5 (good), Intelligence +6 (good), Wisdom +5 (good), and Charisma +6 (good). In terms of skills, it is proficient in Acrobatics (+5, good), Athletics (+12, exceptional), Insight (+5, good), and Perception (+5, good). Notably, the Dragon Eel is immune to lightning damage and is also immune to the conditions of being paralyzed and prone, giving it an advantage in both offensive and defensive scenarios. Its senses include darkvision extending 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 15, allowing it to detect threats even in low-light conditions. The Dragon Eel understands Common, Draconic, and Primordial languages, facilitating potential communication with various creatures.

The Dragon Eel possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat and survival capabilities. With Limited Amphibiousness, it can breathe both air and water but must remain submerged at least once every six hours to avoid suffocation. Its Shocking Hide ability punishes any creature that touches it or attacks it in melee range, dealing 5 points of lightning damage automatically. During stormy weather, its Storm Glide ability allows it to gain a flying speed equal to its swimming speed, making it very agile in a tempestuous environment.

In combat, the Dragon Eel can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite and one Tail Slap attack in the same turn. For its Bite attack, it has a +12 to hit, reaching out to 10 feet, and deals 26 (4d8 + 8) piercing damage along with an additional 5 (1d10) lightning damage. Furthermore, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute, with the possibility of repeating the saving throw at the end of their turns to shake off the effect. The Tail Slap also hit at +12 to attack with a reach of 10 feet, inflicting 30 (5d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage and 5 (1d10) lightning damage. This attack forces the target to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the Dragon Eel, although it can choose to refrain from pushing them away if desired.

Additionally, the Dragon Eel can unleash a devastating Lightning Breath, which recharges on a roll of 6. This powerful exhalation covers a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each target caught in this line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 55 (10d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. This ability can greatly impact the battlefield, potentially hitting multiple foes at once and altering the course of an encounter significantly.
