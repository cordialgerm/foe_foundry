The Hell Hound is a formidable medium fiend, known for its swift agility and its fiery breath. With an Armor Class of 15 and 52 Hit Points, it poses a moderate threat with both its physical and magical capabilities. The creature's physical attributes showcase a strong Strength of 16, providing a good melee capability, and an impressive Constitution score of 16, offering it decent durability in combat. While its intelligence and charisma are relatively low, its dexterity is good, allowing it to evade attacks effectively. The Hell Hound's challenge rating is 3, providing 700 experience points upon defeat, indicating that it is a viable opponent for mid-level adventurers. It possesses a strong fire immunity, making it resistant to many elemental attacks, but its lawful evil alignment suggests it is not bound by any morality, often working with allies to enforce its goals.

The creature has the following attributes: Strength of 16 (+3 modifier, which is good), Dexterity of 14 (+2 modifier, which is average), Constitution of 16 (+3 modifier, which is good), Intelligence of 6 (-2 modifier, which is very bad), Wisdom of 12 (+1 modifier, which is average), and Charisma of 8 (-1 modifier, which is bad). The Hell Hound has a perception skill of +3, which is good, allowing it to be vigilant in detecting its surroundings, and it can see in darkness up to 60 feet due to its darkvision. It understands Infernal but cannot communicate verbally.

The Hell Hound has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. "Keen Hearing and Smell" grants it advantage on Perception checks based on these senses, making it difficult to sneak past. The ability "Pack Tactics" allows the Hell Hound to gain advantage on attack rolls against opponents who are near its allies, increasing its probability of hitting and dealing damage significantly. Its alignment as lawful evil enhances the narrative aspect of encounters with it, often hinting at a more sinister motivation for its actions.

In combat, the Hell Hound can make melee attacks using its "Bite" action, which has a +5 to hit and deals 8 piercing damage plus an additional 7 fire damage (totaling 15 on a successful hit). The damage output is substantial and emphasizes both physical and elemental damage capabilities. The hound also possesses a formidable "Fire Breath" ability that can be used after a recharge period. This ability allows it to unleash fire in a 15-foot cone, forcing any creature within to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in 21 fire damage, while a successful save halves the damage, making it a potent area-of-effect attack that can significantly harm multiple targets at once. 

Overall, the Hell Hound is a swift and lethal adversary with strong offensive capabilities and team support mechanics, making it a challenging foe for adventuring parties.
