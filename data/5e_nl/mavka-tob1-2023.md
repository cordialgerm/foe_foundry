The Mavka is a formidable Medium undead creature that embodies chaotic evil. This creature has strong offensive capabilities, enhanced by its ability to regenerate health and utilize powerful spells. The Mavka is particularly dangerous when mounted on its nightmare, as it gains additional combat options and mobility. However, it has notable weaknesses, primarily its hypersensitivity to sunlight, which inflicts significant damage and hampers its effectiveness in combat. This combination of strengths and weaknesses positions the Mavka as a challenging adversary for adventurers, particularly in environments that limit its sunlight vulnerabilities.

The Mavka has impressive attributes, consisting of a Strength score of 20, providing a significant modifier of +5, which is exceptional. Its Dexterity score is 15, equating to a good modifier of +2, while its Constitution is high at 18, yielding a very good +4 modifier. The Intelligence score of 13 gives it an average +1, and both its Wisdom and Charisma scores are at 13 and 18, respectively, the latter providing a very good +4 modifier. For saving throws, the Mavka excels in Strength (+9), Constitution (+8), and Charisma (+8), while it performs well in Dexterity (+6). It has skills in Athletics (+9), Nature (+5), and Perception (+5).

The Mavka possesses several damage immunities, specifically to necrotic and poison damage, making it resilient against those types of attacks. Furthermore, it has damage resistance against fire and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It is also immune to the poisoned condition and has darkvision extending 90 feet, along with a passive Perception score of 15. The Mavka is fluent in Abyssal, Common, Infernal, and Sylvan.

The creature possesses special abilities that enhance its combat versatility. Its **Mounted Warrior** ability prevents its mount from being charmed or frightened while the Mavka is mounted, ensuring that its nightmare can focus on delivering devastating attacks. The **Nightmare Mount** ability allows the Mavka to effectively use its nightmare as a controllable mount, which can follow the Mavka's commands without impediment. However, the Mavka suffers from **Sunlight Hypersensitivity**, receiving 20 radiant damage when starting its turn in sunlight, and incurs disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while exposed to sunlight. Lastly, the **Undead Nature** ability grants the Mavka independence from air, food, drink, and sleep, allowing it to operate without the constraints of living creatures.

As for its actions, the Mavka is capable of executing a **Multiattack**, which allows it to make two **Enervating Slam** attacks or three **Necrotic Bolt** attacks. If mounted on a nightmare, the nightmare can make a **Hooves** attack as well. The **Enervating Slam** is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, reaching 5 feet, dealing 23 bludgeoning damage and an additional 16 necrotic damage on a hit. The **Necrotic Bolt** is a ranged spell attack with a +8 to hit, at a range of 60 feet, dealing 26 necrotic damage. 

The Mavka can also unleash a **Flame Burst**, which has a recharge of 5-6. While riding a nightmare, this ability affects every creature within 20 feet, requiring them to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw; on a failed save, they take 54 fire damage, or half damage on a successful save.

Finally, the Mavka can cast spells, using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 16. It can cast **create or destroy water** and **dancing lights** at will. It can cast **darkness**, **hold person**, and **silence** three times per day, and **bestow curse** and **dispel magic** once each day. These spells can have a significant impact on gameplay, either creating advantageous conditions for the Mavka or debilitating its enemies.
