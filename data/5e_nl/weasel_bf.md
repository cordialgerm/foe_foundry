The weasel is a tiny beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0, making it relatively inconsequential in terms of threat level, particularly when compared to more formidable creatures. It possesses a decent speed of 30 feet and an average armor class of 11, which provides minimal protection against attacks. With only 8 hit points, the weasel is not particularly durable. Its most notable strengths lie in its dexterity and stealth, where it excels, allowing it to evade detection effectively. However, it has very poor strength, intelligence, and charisma, which reflects its typical animalistic behavior and limited combat capability. The weasel is primarily recognized for its cunning theft abilities rather than direct confrontation in combat.

The weasel's attributes are as follows: Strength is at -4, which is very bad and indicates it cannot physically overpower anything. Dexterity is +1, giving it an average ability to avoid attacks and perform agile maneuvers. Constitution stands at -1, which is bad in terms of resilience against damage. Intelligence is -4, very bad for reasoning-based tasks, while Wisdom at +1 is average and allows it to notice things in its surroundings. Charisma is also at -4, which is very bad for social interactions.

The weasel has enhanced senses due to its special ability, Heightened Hearing and Smell. This ability allows the weasel to have a Perception score of 18 when relying on hearing or smell, making it better at detecting creatures nearby, which can be crucial in both survival and sneaking scenarios.

In terms of actions in combat, the weasel can use its Bite attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, offering a good chance of successfully landing the attack against its target due to its favorable modifier. The reach of this attack is 5 feet, allowing it to engage enemies in close combat. If the weasel successfully bites a target, it deals 3 piercing damage, calculated from rolling a 1d4 and adding 1. However, beyond causing damage, the weasel has the unique ability to steal an item from the target instead of inflicting damage. This item must weigh 5 pounds or less, be manageable with one hand, and cannot be a weapon or firmly attached to the target, exemplifying the weasel's dexterous and cunning nature. For instance, it could snatch a hat or a belt pouch, which adds a strategic layer to encounters involving this creature.
