The Weretiger is a medium-sized humanoid lycanthrope known for its versatility in combat and its unique ability to shapeshift between forms. It operates primarily as a formidable melee combatant and can attack both from a distance and up close. The Weretiger has decent defensive capabilities with an Armor Class of 12 and robust Hit Points totaling 95. It boasts high Dexterity, contributing to its agility and stealth, making it effective in ambushing foes. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it provides a moderate threat level for adventurers. However, it has limitations, including an average intelligence score and restrictions on spellcasting abilities while in its tiger form. 

The Weretiger has the following attributes: Strength +3 (which is good for melee damage), Dexterity +4 (very good for attack rolls and defense), Constitution +3 (good for durability), Intelligence +0 (average, meaning it has no particular strength in mental tasks), Wisdom +1 (average for insight but slightly better for tracking), and Charisma +0 (average with no special influence). The creature has darkvision extending to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions effectively, and with a strong Perception score of 13, it is adept at noticing details. Additionally, it has notable Stealth capabilities with a score of 14, making it good at sneaky maneuvers. However, it cannot speak in its tiger form but can communicate in Common in its humanoid form.

Special abilities of the Weretiger include Heightened Hearing and Smell, which boosts its Perception to a total of 18 when relying on these senses, allowing it to detect hidden or stealthy creatures more effectively. The Pounce ability allows the Weretiger to knock a creature prone by moving swiftly in a straight line and landing a Claw attack, forcing the target to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw. If the target is knocked prone, the Weretiger gains an additional Claw or Bite attack as a bonus action, enhancing its offensive potential during combat.

For its actions, the Weretiger can perform a Multiattack, delivering devastating attacks either in humanoid or hybrid form, allowing for up to four Claw or Scimitar strikes, or four ranged Longbow attacks, with the possibility of replacing one attack with a Bite attack when appropriate. The Bite attack delivers piercing damage and has the added effect of potentially cursing humanoid targets with lycanthropy if they fail a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The Claw attack does slashing damage and serves as a primary melee strike. The Scimitar serves as a standard melee weapon attack with similar damage output, and the Longbow allows for ranged attacks at a distance, with a reach of 150 feet normally, extending to 600 feet for disadvantage.

Bonus actions include "Bleed Prey," which allows the Weretiger to designate a target, tracking its location and inflicting significant bleeding damage if the prey has been struck by multiple attacks. The prey must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid losing HP at the start of its next turn due to excessive bleeding. The "Change Shape" ability permits the creature to shift between its true humanoid form, a hybrid, and a large tiger form, retaining its statistics and equipment during the transitions. This adaptability enhances its survivability and tactical options during encounters.
