Among the Dryad's special abilities, Fey Resilience allows it to have resistance against being charmed or unconscious, making it more difficult to influence during encounters. Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability against magical attacks. One with the Forest means the Dryad is impossible to surprise within its forest home and can move without leaving a trace, presenting challenges for those trying to ambush or track it.

The Tree Stride ability provides an excellent escape or repositioning option, allowing the Dryad to teleport between trees, enhancing its mobility significantly.

In combat, the Dryad utilizes its Multiattack ability, which allows it to strike twice using either Vine Whip or Blast of Pollen. The Vine Whip is a melee attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 6 slashing damage on a successful hit. If two whip attacks target the same creature, it must make a DC 14 Strength save to avoid being restrained by vines until the end of its next turn, thereby hindering its movement and actions. Meanwhile, the Blast of Pollen is a ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit and a range of 60 feet, inflicting 7 poison damage on a hit, posing a threat to unwary foes from a distance.

As a bonus action, the Dryad can utilize Charming Scent to release an alluring fragrance towards a Beast or Humanoid within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for 1 minute, perceiving the Dryad as an ally and being inclined to favor its requests, although not fully controlled. Importantly, the charmed creatures can attempt to save again at the end of each of their turns. It can charm up to two creatures simultaneously, making it a strategic option in social or combat scenarios. The Forest's Aid ability allows the Dryad to summon a horde of small animals to assist it when its hit points fall below 21. This horde acts like a swarm of rats and arrives on initiative count 20 of the next round, serving the Dryad's commands for up to an hour, providing valuable allies in combat or distractions for enemies.
