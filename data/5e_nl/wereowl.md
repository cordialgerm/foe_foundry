The Wereowl is a medium humanoid creature with a lawful evil alignment, making it a cunning and malevolent presence in any setting. With an armor class of 13 and hit points totaling 117, it possesses a solid offensive and defensive capability, allowing it to endure in combat. Its challenge rating is 5, which indicates it provides a moderate level of challenge for a party. The Wereowl has a good balance of attributes, particularly high Dexterity, which contributes to its stealthy abilities, and it possesses immunities that make it resilient against common physical attacks. It also has the versatile ability to transform between a humanoid form, an owl-humanoid hybrid, and a giant owl. This shapechanging aspect, coupled with its stealth capabilities, makes it a formidable opponent that can maneuver around enemies without provoking attacks.

The Wereowl features the following abilities: 

- Strength: 15 (+2) - Moderately strong, capable of dealing decent physical damage.
- Dexterity: 16 (+3) - Good agility, which enhances both its attack precision and defense.

In terms of skills, the Wereowl has proficiency in Perception at +7 and Stealth at +6, making it particularly adept at hiding and noticing things around it. It has immunities to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks unless the weapon is silvered, providing good protection against common types of attacks. The Wereowl has darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions effectively, and a passive Perception score of 17, which is very good. Although it can understand Common, it is unable to speak in its owl form and can only communicate in Giant Owl when in its humanoid form.

The Wereowl has several notable special abilities:

- **Flyby:** This ability allows the Wereowl to fly away without provoking opportunity attacks, making it very mobile and difficult to pin down in combat.
- **Keen Hearing and Sight:** The Wereowl gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight, greatly enhancing its ability to detect threats.
- **Shapechanger:** This ability allows the Wereowl to switch between its three forms (humanoid, hybrid, giant owl) at will, maintaining its statistics except for size. Equipment remains unchanged during transformation. If the Wereowl dies, it returns to its true human form.
- **Silent Flight (Hybrid or Owl Form Only):** When flying in either the hybrid or owl form, it gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, making it exceptionally stealthy.

For actions, the Wereowl can perform the following:

- **Multiattack:** In owl form, it makes two talon attacks. In humanoid form, it can make three shortbow or shortsword attacks. In hybrid form, it can choose to attack as either its owl or humanoid form.
- **Shortsword (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only):** This melee attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Talon (Hybrid or Owl Form Only):** This attack has a +5 to hit, reaching 5 feet, with a damage output of 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become cursed with wereowl lycanthropy, introducing a significant threat.
- **Shortbow (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only):** This ranged attack has a +6 to hit with a range of 80/320 feet, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

Overall, the Wereowl is a dangerous and versatile adversary with the potential to inflict lasting effects on characters who encounter it, especially due to its shapechanging ability and potential lycanthropy curse.
