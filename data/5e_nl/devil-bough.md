The Devil Bough is a formidable Huge Fiend characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This creature possesses significant physical strength and health, making it a robust opponent on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 14 due to natural armor and 114 hit points derived from rolling 12d12 plus an additional 36, the Devil Bough is challenging to take down. As a Challenge Rating 6 creature, it is suitable for mid-level adventurers, offering a rewarding but perilous encounter. Its main strengths lie in its ability to inflict considerable damage with its claw and bite attacks, while also possessing unique abilities like Grinding Maw, which enhances its attack against restrained foes. However, its movement is limited to walking at just 10 feet, which can be a notable weakness. Additionally, the creature has damage immunities to fire and poison, as well as the ability to sense evil-aligned creatures nearby.

The Devil Bough has the following attributes: a Strength of 18, granting it a good modifier of +4, offering it an advantage in melee combat scenarios. Its Dexterity is average at 10, which translates to a modifier of +0, indicating no advantage in agility-based situations. It possesses a Constitution of 17, leading to a solid +3 modifier, contributing to its durability in battle. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all average to low, rated at 10, 10, and 8 respectively, yielding modest bonuses that do not significantly influence its interactions outside of physical conflict.

When maneuvering through combat, the Devil Bough can leverage its special abilities effectively. With Grinding Maw, it gains advantage on attack rolls against any creature that it has successfully grappled, significantly increasing its likelihood of landing a hit. The Like Calls to Like ability allows the Devil Bough to detect the alignment of creatures within 60 feet, providing strategic insight into its foes.

In terms of attacks, the Devil Bough employs a Multiattack, allowing it to make one claw attack and one bite attack per turn. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack that adds +7 to hit, has a reach of 10 feet, and deals an average of 14 slashing damage upon a successful attack. The Bite attack also has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 17 piercing damage. Notably, if a target is Large or smaller, it is grappled, forcing it to make an escape attempt against a DC of 15. While grappling, the target is restrained, and the Devil Bough cannot bite other targets.

The Devil Bough also possesses a reaction known as Arcasynthesis, which it can use when a spell of 5th level or lower is cast within a 100-foot range. While the spell resolves normally, the Devil Bough has a 50% chance to regain health—5 hit points per level of the spell cast—creating an interesting dynamic where it can benefit from the actions of spellcasters nearby.
