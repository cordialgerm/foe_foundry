The deer is a Medium beast characterized by its speed and agility, making it an elusive creature within the wilderness. With an Armor Class of 13, it possesses moderate defense, while its low hit points of 8 indicate that it is relatively frail compared to more formidable creatures. The deer has a Challenge Rating (CR) of 0, which signifies that it is not a threat to adventurers and is often considered more of a nuisance than an enemy. Notably, its Dexterity score of +3 allows it to move swiftly and evade potential dangers effectively. However, its mental attributes are lacking, particularly in Intelligence, where it has a score of -4, indicating very poor capability in problem-solving or strategic thinking.

The deer has the following ability scores: Strength 0 (very bad), Dexterity 3 (good), Constitution 0 (very bad), Intelligence -4 (very bad), Wisdom 2 (average), and Charisma -3 (bad). The deer’s Perception score of 12 grants it a decent awareness of its environment, while its Stealth score of 13 enhances its ability to hide and remain unnoticed, making it a good stalker in natural settings.

In terms of actions, the deer can perform a melee attack known as "Kick." This attack has a +2 to hit, allowing it a fair chance to strike an opponent within a 5-foot reach. On a successful hit, it deals 2 bludgeoning damage as determined by rolling 1d4. The kick has an additional effect: if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must make a DC 10 Strength saving throw. If it fails, the creature is knocked prone, which can impact combat by giving the deer an opportunity to escape or other creatures advantage on attacks against it while it is prone.

As a bonus action, the deer can utilize its "Skittish" ability, which allows it to take the Dash or Disengage action. This enables the deer to quickly move away from threats or obstacles, highlighting its natural instinct to flee from danger rather than confront it directly. Overall, the deer serves as a representation of timid wildlife that relies on agility and awareness to evade threats in the wild.
