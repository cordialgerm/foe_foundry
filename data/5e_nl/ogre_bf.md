The Ogre is a formidable Large giant that poses a significant challenge to adventurers due to its high hit points and the ability to deliver powerful melee attacks. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it fights effectively in close quarters, utilizing its brute strength to overpower foes. The Ogre has a good Armor Class of 11, making it relatively durable, while its speed of 40 feet allows it to close distances quickly. While it has a few weaknesses, such as vulnerability to being knocked prone, the ogre's resistance to the stunned condition can make it challenging to incapacitate. This creature specializes in raw physical prowess, making it a dangerous opponent in combat scenarios. 

The Ogre has a Strength score of 18 (+4), which gives it a good modifier for melee attacks, making it effective at dealing damage. Its Dexterity score of 9 (-1) reflects poor agility, leading to a very bad modifier for Dexterity-based tasks such as stealth and ranged attacks. With a Constitution score of 16 (+3), the Ogre has an average resilience against damage, contributing to its 66 hit points. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are notably low, at -3, -2, and -2 respectively, indicating a lack of cunning, perception, and social prowess, resulting in bad effectiveness in related tasks. 

In terms of senses, the Ogre has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as though it were bright light, and darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception skill is modest at +8, allowing it some awareness of its surroundings, whereas it has decent Stealth capability with a +9 modifier, albeit hampered by its low Dexterity score. The languages it speaks include Common and Giant, enabling communication with other creatures of its kind.

The Ogre has special abilities that enhance its combat skills. Notably, it has "Giant Attributes," which make it resistant to being stunned, freeing it from potential incapacitation effects while also indicating a vulnerability to being knocked prone, a state where it could be at a significant disadvantage.

In combat, the Ogre performs a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two attacks per turn using either its Greatclub or Javelin. The Greatclub melee attack has a +6 to hit and delivers an average of 13 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, making it an effective weapon for melee encounters. The Javelin can be used in melee or ranged combat, also having a +6 to hit, and dealing an average of 11 piercing damage, giving the ogre versatility in weapon choice.

Additionally, the Ogre possesses a powerful special action called "Bowling Sweep," which recharges on rolling a 5 or 6. This action allows the Ogre to sweep its weapon in a wide arc, requiring creatures within 10 feet to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. Smaller creatures have disadvantage on this save. On a failure, creatures take 14 bludgeoning damage, are pushed up to 10 feet away, and are knocked prone, which can dramatically shift the state of battle. Success results in half damage without the push or knockdown effects, making this ability a substantial threat in close quarters.

As a bonus action, the Ogre can perform a "Shoving Rush," which allows it to take the Dash action and move toward a target it can see. If it collides with the target, the target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, all while this movement avoiding opportunity attacks from the target that fails the save. This maneuver effectively allows the Ogre to control the battlefield and apply pressure to its foes.
