The Far Wanderer is a Medium aberration characterized by its enigmatic nature and mysterious abilities. This creature serves as a manipulator on the battlefield, utilizing its unique powers to control situations and sow confusion among its foes. With a relatively high Armor Class of 14 and a total of 88 hit points, it has the capability to withstand a fair amount of damage, making it a moderately durable opponent. Its Challenge Rating of 3 indicates that it presents a balanced challenge for parties of lower-level adventurers. The Far Wanderer excels in Dexterity and Intelligence, allowing it to be both evasive and astute in its approach to combat and interaction. However, it is also limited by its lower Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, which could affect its resilience and interaction abilities in certain scenarios.

The Far Wanderer's attributes are as follows: Strength is rated at 14, which gives it a good modifier of +2, making it capable in melee situations but not excessively powerful. Dexterity is 18, providing an exceptional +4 modifier, making it very good at avoiding attacks and enhancing its stealth capabilities. Constitution stands at 12, giving a bad +1 modifier, which means it is less resilient to being injured. Intelligence is strong at 17, earning a good +3 modifier, allowing for effective skill checks in arcana. Wisdom is average at 11 with no modifier, while Charisma is average as well, sitting at 10 with no modifier.

In terms of saving throws, the Far Wanderer has a very good +6 modifier for Dexterity saves, reflecting its nimbleness. It possesses skills in Arcana at +5, Stealth at +6, and Perception at +2. It has resistances to cold damage, immunity to exhaustion and poison conditions, and possesses darkvision that allows it to see up to 120 feet in darkness, along with having a passive perception score of 12, which reflects average awareness.

Among its remarkable abilities, the Far Wanderer's "Trader" ability enables it to understand any spoken or written language it encounters literally. Additionally, it can read the surface thoughts of one creature within a 30-foot radius, functioning akin to the spell "detect thoughts" but with a focus on surface-level thoughts, lacking any time constraint, and can be altered at will. This ability opens avenues for manipulation and information gathering during encounters. The "Traveler" ability lets the Far Wanderer teleport up to 30 feet to a visible unoccupied space as a bonus action accompanied by a dazzling starlight effect, granting it exceptional mobility on the battlefield.

In combat, the Far Wanderer can utilize its "Stardust Blade" as a melee weapon attack, wielding a +4 to hit and dealing an average of 11 slashing damage along with 2 cold damage on a successful strike. Its "Stardust Bow" serves as a ranged attack option with a +6 to hit at a range of 150/600 feet, capable of dealing an average of 13 piercing damage plus an additional 2 cold damage, making it very effective from a distance.

Once per day, it can invoke "Call to Yorama," where it channels the power of the god-star Yorama to affect any creature within 60 feet. This ability requires a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, inflicting 7 psychic damage on failure and potentially stunning the target until the end of its turn. Alternatively, this ability can also be used to heal a willing creature nearby, restoring 14 hit points, providing a significant impact in turning the tide of battle or supporting allies.
