The Diplodocus is a gargantuan beast known for its immense size and strength. It serves as a formidable physical presence on the battlefield, capable of dealing significant damage with powerful melee attacks. With an Armor Class of 14 and a robust pool of hit points totaling 139, this creature can absorb a considerable amount of damage, making it difficult to take down. However, it has weaknesses, such as low Dexterity, which means it lacks agility and finesse in combat. The creature’s challenge rating of 7 indicates that it is an appropriate challenge for a party of adventurers, awarding 2,900 experience points upon defeat. Overall, the Diplodocus stands as a solid, tank-like monster, perfect for dealing heavy damage but somewhat limited in terms of maneuverability.

The Diplodocus has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 24 (+7), which results in an exceptional modifier, allowing it to perform physical feats with great power.
- Dexterity: 8 (-1), representing a very bad modifier, making the creature slow and inaccurate in its movements.
- Constitution: 20 (+5), indicating a very good modifier, contributing significantly to its high hit points and resilience.
- Intelligence: 2 (-4), demonstrating an exceptional lack of cognitive ability.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), resulting in an average awareness of its surroundings.
- Charisma: 5 (-3), indicating a very bad presence in social interactions.

The creature possesses passive Perception 11, allowing it a basic awareness of its environment, although its low Dexterity reduces its effectiveness in stealth or finesse-based encounters.

In terms of actions, the Diplodocus can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make a stomp attack and a tail attack against two different targets within the same turn. The Stomp action is a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and, upon a successful hit, deals 21 (4d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage, making it a powerful hit against foes. The Tail attack also has a +10 to hit and reaches out 15 feet. If successful, it deals 17 (3d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage. Notably, if the target of the Tail attack is a Large or smaller creature, they are pushed 10 feet away from the Diplodocus and knocked prone, adding an additional layer of control over the battlefield.

Overall, the Diplodocus is an impressive beast, utilizing its size and strength to dominate in combat through brute force and crowd control.
