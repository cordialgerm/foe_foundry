The Xhkarsh is a formidable Large Aberration with a Neutral Evil alignment, notable for its cunning and insidious abilities that make it a dangerous opponent. With a high Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 171, it presents a tough challenge in combat. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 9, categorizing it as a strong adversary capable of inflicting significant damage while also manipulating the fates of those it targets. The Xhkarsh excels in Dexterity and Constitution, making it both agile and resilient, although its offensive capabilities rely heavily on its ability to corrupt its foes. Its special abilities allow for telepathic communication across planes and a notable disregard for physical needs, granting it exceptional survivability. However, its dependence on specific conditions for its more powerful abilities can be a tactical weakness.

The Xhkarsh has the following attributes: Strength of 17 provides a good melee capability, Dexterity of 19 offers an exceptional boost to its stealth and ranged attacks, Constitution of 18 ensures it can withstand significant harm, Intelligence of 15 reflects its tactical thinking, Wisdom of 16 allows for strong perception and insight, and Charisma of 15 makes it moderately influential. The saving throw proficiency in Charisma (+6) is good, giving it an advantage in situations that require a strong will. Skills in Insight and Perception are both +7, which is very good, while Stealth is exceptional at +8, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting targets effectively. It possesses darkvision and tremorsense that enhance its ability to track foes in various conditions, further solidified by a passive Perception of 17. The creature can communicate with others in Common, Deep Speech, and Undercommon, along with telepathy up to 60 feet.

The Xhkarsh's special abilities include Corruption's Bond, which allows it to communicate telepathically across any distance with creatures it has corrupted, along with sensing their health status. This ability works even if the Xhkarsh is on a different plane, showcasing its manipulative nature. Interdimensional Nature means it does not need traditional sustenance, allowing it to operate in any environment effectively.

In combat, the Xhkarsh can perform a multiattack, making two Claw attacks and one Fate-Altering Stinger attack. Each Claw attack uses a melee weapon attack bonus of +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 damage (2d8 + 4 slashing) plus 9 poison damage (2d8). The Fate-Altering Stinger, also using a +8 melee weapon attack to hit, inflicts 15 piercing damage (2d10 + 4) and forces the target to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in the target's fate being corrupted, which imposes disadvantage on Charisma checks and saving throws, renders them immune to divination magic, and prevents others from sensing their emotions. This magical corruption can only be lifted by spells like dispel evil and good.

The Xhkarsh can also turn invisible, remaining unseen until it launches an attack or uses its Seize Strand ability, making it a tricky opponent. The Seize Strand ability compels a creature with a corrupted fate to succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be subjected to a geas spell for 8 hours. This powerful manipulation requires the target to fulfill a minor task that aligns with the Xhkarsh's long-term goals, showcasing its strategic manipulation even beyond direct combat. It can only use this ability on the same creature once every 24 hours, which adds an element of timing in the Xhkarsh's plans.
