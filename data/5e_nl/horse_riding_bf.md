The horse’s main advantage is its speed, able to move at 60 feet per round, allowing it to cover significant distances in short timeframes. While its physical attacks do provide some measure of damage, Riding Horses are primarily valued for their ability to facilitate travel and support their riders in various scenarios.

Its Dexterity is +0, which is average and suggests it has no particular advantages in agility. The Constitution score of +1 is also average, offering some resilience but not outstanding stamina. The horse's Intelligence is -4, which indicates it lacks in cognitive abilities, making it incapable of understanding complex commands.

Its special ability, Easy Gait, enhances the experience for riders. This ability grants advantage on saving throws against exhaustion caused by a Forced March, which can be incredibly beneficial during prolonged journeys, helping riders endure longer.

In terms of actions, the Riding Horse can perform a melee attack with its Hooves. The attack rolls a +5 to hit, which is considered good, making it likely to connect with its targets.
