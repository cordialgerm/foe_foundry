The Quickstep is a small, fey creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. As a Challenge Rating 5 entity, it possesses a dynamic combination of speed and agility, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With a strong Dexterity score of 19, the Quickstep exhibits exceptional evasion capabilities and can dodge attacks effectively. It combines this agility with decent offensive abilities, utilizing a moonlight rapier and hidden dagger to deliver both piercing and cold damage. Despite its strengths, it can be vulnerable if incapacitated or restrained, as its special abilities heavily rely on mobility. Additionally, its low hit points relative to its Challenge Rating indicate that while it can deal damage efficiently, it is not overly resilient in direct confrontations.

The Quickstep has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 19 (+4, very good), Constitution 15 (+2, good), Intelligence 10 (+0, average), Wisdom 12 (+1, average), and Charisma 14 (+2, good). Its saving throws showcase advantages in Dexterity (+7, exceptional), Constitution (+5, good), and Wisdom (+4, good). In terms of skill proficiencies, it excels in deception (+5, good), intimidation (+5, good), and perception (+4, good). It also has condition immunity to unconsciousness, allowing it to maintain its effectiveness in various situations.

The Quickstep possesses several notable special abilities. Evasion allows it to completely avoid damage from effects requiring a Dexterity saving throw if successful, making its Dexterity defense exceptional. Its Fey Ancestry grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed and protects it from magical sleep, which provides good resilience against magical manipulation. Startling Speed enables it to move rapidly, granting disadvantage to attacks made against it after moving at least 10 feet, which is particularly effective for dodging attacks when it maintains mobility.

In terms of actions, the Quickstep can make a Multiattack consisting of two strikes with its moonlight rapier and one strike with its hidden dagger. The moonlight rapier attack has a +7 to hit, with a range of 5 feet, dealing a total of 15 damage on a hit with both piercing and cold damage components (8 piercing from the rapier itself and 7 cold from the attack's additional effect). The hidden dagger, which also has a +7 to hit, does 9 damage total, comprising 6 piercing and an additional 3 cold damage. Additionally, it can use Freezing Steel, which is a powerful ability that requires a recharge of 6. This attack forces all creatures within 10 feet to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 16 damage (9 piercing and 7 cold) and becomes paralyzed for one round; on a successful save, it takes half damage and is not paralyzed.

The Quickstep's reaction, Quick Dodge, allows it to swiftly evade attacks. If an attack is directed at it, the Quickstep can move up to 5 feet to an unoccupied space without provoking opportunity attacks. If this movement prevents the attack from hitting due to distance, the original attack misses, providing it with excellent defensive capability in response to threats.

Overall, the Quickstep is a highly mobile and intelligent fey creature, capable of both offense and defense through its speed and special abilities. It thrives in combat by utilizing its agility and cunning to outmaneuver foes, making it a tricky adversary for unwary adventurers.
