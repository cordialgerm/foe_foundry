The Living Wick is a small construct creature characterized by its unique ability to operate using a lit wick, which serves as both its power source and its life force. With an armor class of 13 and a total of 28 hit points, it is relatively defensively moderate for its challenge rating of 1/4, making it suitable for lower-level encounters. It possesses an above-average Strength score of 14, enabling it to perform physical attacks, though its Dexterity and Constitution are average, granting it a basic level of durability. It lacks intelligence, wisdom, and charisma, limiting its cognitive and social interactions significantly. This creature is particularly vulnerable to fire damage, but it is immune to poison and psychic effects. It can be a strategic ally due to its ability to lash out with fire through its special abilities but must be used carefully as its health depletes each day that it remains active.

The Living Wick has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 10 (+0), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 5 (-3), and Charisma 5 (-3). Its overall physical strength is good, while its mental stats are very bad, making it ineffective in situations that require intelligence or emotional engagement. The creature is also immune to several conditions and is not beholden to basic needs such as air, food, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously until its wick is snuffed out or its health is depleted.

Regarding its special abilities, the Living Wick has "Construct Nature," allowing it to function without necessitating biological needs. The unique ability "Wick-Powered" determines its operational state: it is dormant when unlit and becomes active upon ignition, following the commands of its creator. While lit, it emits a significant 20-foot radius of bright light and an additional 20 feet of dim light. However, for every 24 hours of being active, its maximum hit points decrease substantially (by 2, rolled as 1d4), and the only way to reverse this damage is through a wish spell. The wick remains crucial to the creature's existence, as it will die when reduced to 0 hit points.

In terms of actions, the Living Wick can perform a "Slam," which is a melee attack that adds a +4 modifier to hit, allowing it to reach a target within 5 feet. If successful, this attack deals an average of 5 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, it can utilize the "Consuming Inferno" ability at its controller's command. This powerful action requires all creatures within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures suffer 7 fire damage (rolled as 2d6), and those that succeed take half damage. Flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried are ignited by this ability. Once executed, the Living Wick sacrifices itself, becoming a lifeless puddle of wax, making it imperative to consider when to deploy this devastating attack.
