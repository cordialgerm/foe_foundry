The Alpha Yek is a medium-sized fiend characterized by its chaotic evil nature. This creature plays a role as a formidable combatant within a group, capitalizing on its special abilities to enhance its effectiveness in battle. The Alpha Yek boasts a solid Armor Class of 16, coupled with 129 hit points, making it quite durable in confrontations. Provided with exceptional mobility, it can climb and walk at a speed of 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver adeptly in various terrains. Its Challenge Rating of 9 indicates that it poses a significant threat to adventurers, able to dish out damage while resisting many common attack types. On the downside, while it has good physical attributes and resistance against many damage types, the Alpha Yek can be vulnerable to magical effects if it fails its saving throws.

The Alpha Yek has several key attributes: a Strength score of 16 gives it a modifier of +3, which is good for physical attacks and grappling. Its Dexterity is also rated at 16, providing another +3 modifier, resulting in good agility and stealth capabilities. The Constitution score of 16 leads to the same +3 modifier, making the creature resilient against adverse conditions. The Intelligence score of 15 grants a +2 modifier, translating into average cognitive abilities for problem-solving or tactical planning. Its Wisdom score of 13 yields a +1 modifier, which is average, and it has a Charisma score of 10, which provides no modifier; this indicates less proficiency in social skills.

For saving throws, the Alpha Yek has a +7 modifier to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, categorizing these as good. It also has a +6 modifier to Intelligence, which is average. Its skills in perception and stealth are +5 and +7 respectively, denoting good capabilities, particularly in sneaky or observant roles. The creature is immune to poison damage and conditions, while it has resistances to cold, fire, and lightning, as well as to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. With darkvision that extends 120 feet and a passive Perception score of 15, the Alpha Yek is formidable in low-light conditions and is capable of noticing hidden foes.

Special abilities enhance the Alpha Yek's combat prowess. Its Magic Resistance allows it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it resistant to many traditional means of offense against fiends. Pack Tactics grants it advantage on attack rolls against a single target if it has an ally nearby, allowing it to synergize effectively with its companions.

In terms of actions, the Alpha Yek can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike with one of its bite attacks and two claw attacks during its turn. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 17 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Claw attack also rolls with a +7 to hit and deals 13 slashing damage. The unique Bone Shard ability can either be a melee or ranged attack, hitting with +7 and dealing 8 piercing damage. This attack also forces the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw; failure results in a bone shard lodging in the wound, causing an additional 5 piercing damage at the start of its turns until it is removed through a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check or magical healing. The Alpha Yek typically carries three bone shards, which can be reused from corpses in proximity.

Overall, the Alpha Yek presents a robust package of capabilities in physical attacks, mobility, and special abilities, making it a threatening opponent in any combat scenario.
