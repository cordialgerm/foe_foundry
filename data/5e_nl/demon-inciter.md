The Inciter is a chaotic evil demon that plays a disruptive role in combat scenarios, harnessing both its malice and psychological influence to create chaos among its enemies. With a moderate armor class and a total of 27 hit points, the Inciter is not particularly resilient but has a range of abilities that allows it to manipulate the actions of its foes. This creature excels at sowing distrust, causing allies to hesitate and potentially turn against each other. However, its physical defenses are quite average, and it relies heavily on its special abilities to weaken opponents rather than to directly confront them. Notably, the Inciter is both mobile and evasive, being able to fly, making it a tricky opponent to pin down in battle.

The Inciter's attributes are as follows: Strength of 10, Dexterity of 15 (+2 modifier, which is good), Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier, average), Intelligence of 11 (+0 modifier, average), Wisdom of 12 (+1 modifier, average), and Charisma of 16 (+3 modifier, very good). The Inciter possesses a skill in perception with a +1 modifier, which is average in effectiveness for noticing hidden creatures or objects and gives it a passive perception score of 11. Its damage immunities to poison and resistances to cold, fire, and lightning give it some resilience against various types of attacks. The creature has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet and can communicate in Abyssal and Common.

The Inciter has several special abilities. It can utilize Amorphous to move through spaces that are only 1 foot wide without squeezing, an ability that grants it exceptional mobility. Its Aura of Distrust is particularly powerful, affecting all non-Fiend creatures within 30 feet. This aura imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks and forces creatures to succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw at the start of their turn or when they first enter the area. Failing this save means they cannot target allies with spells and cannot use the Help action or accept assistance, effectively isolating them during combat.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Inciter can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Claw attacks, each with a +4 to hit. A successful hit deals 5 piercing damage (1d6+2), which is a moderate threat in melee. Additionally, it has a special attack called Inspire Violence, which can be used after a recharge period of 5 to 6. This ability requires whispering to a creature within 5 feet, provoking paranoia and forcing the targeted creature to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. If the target fails, it must use its next action to attack another creature perceived as a threat. This ability is particularly impactful since it can pit allies against each other, creating further chaos.

As a bonus action, the Inciter can become invisible until it attacks or until its concentration is broken. This makes it exceptionally difficult to target effectively during combat, as it can reposition and strike without being seen, enhancing its potential to disrupt enemy plans. 

Overall, the Inciter is designed to manipulate and create disorder on the battlefield, targeting the psychological state of its enemies while remaining elusive itself.
