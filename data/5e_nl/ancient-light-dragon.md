The Ancient Light Dragon is a gargantuan creature characterized by its neutral good alignment, often seen as a guardian of cosmic balance, light, and knowledge. This formidable dragon boasts impressive defenses, with an Armor Class of 22 due to its natural armor and a staggering 407 hit points derived from rolling 22d20 plus an additional 176. Its flight speed of 80 feet allows for rapid mobility, while its walking speed of 40 feet ensures considerable ground maneuverability. With a Challenge Rating of 22, this dragon presents an extraordinary challenge to adventurers, having an experience point value of 41,000. It exhibits several notable strengths, including high damage immunity to radiant attacks and damage from nonmagical sources, as well as robust saving throws and skill proficiencies. However, its weaknesses include susceptibility to fire damage. 

The Ancient Light Dragon possesses extraordinary physical and mental attributes: a Strength score of 26 grants it a +8 modifier, making it exceptionally strong in melee combat; a Constitution score of 27 gives it an outstanding +8 modifier for resilience; and an Intelligence score of 18 provides a good +4 modifier for areas requiring mental acuity. Its Wisdom and Charisma scores are also notable, at 20 (+5) and 19 (+4) respectively, lending it very good capabilities in perception and persuasive interactions. The dragon is immune to the blinded condition and possesses darkvision and blindsight, enhancing its sensory abilities both on the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane.

The dragon has several special abilities: Ethereal Sight allows it to see into the Ethereal Plane, providing significant observational capability during combat. Illumination creates a bright light of 30 feet radius which can influence stealth and visibility. With Incorporeal Movement, it can navigate through objects and other creatures, imposing tactical advantages, although it risks taking damage if it ends its turn inside an object. The Legendary Resistance feature enables it to negate failed saving throws up to three times a day, showcasing its incredible durability. Absolutely unique is the Void Traveler ability, allowing the Ancient Light Dragon to traverse the void of space without needing air, food, or sleep.

In terms of actions, the Ancient Light Dragon can employ a variety of powerful melee attacks. The Bite attack deals 19 piercing damage (2d10 + 8), the Claw attack inflicts 15 slashing damage (2d6 + 8), and the Tail attack causes 17 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 8). The Frightful Presence ability can instill fear in multiple creatures within a 120-foot radius, forcing them to make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. With a successful save, creatures will become immune to this effect for 24 hours. 

The dragon can unleash its Breath Weapon, which it can use every 5-6 turns. The Radiant Breath deals 77 radiant damage (14d10) in a 90-foot cone, posing a significant threat to creatures within its area of effect. Alternatively, the Flaring Breath emits dazzling light, requiring a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, potentially blinding enemies and turning nearby undead, a potent tool against such foes.

Moreover, the Ancient Light Dragon has an array of legendary actions to augment its combat prowess. It can use Detect to make a Perception check, utilize its Tail Attack for additional melee damage, or execute a Wing Attack which requires 2 legendary actions and can knock creatures prone while dealing bludgeoning damage. These characteristics make the Ancient Light Dragon not just a powerful adversary but also a tactical entity capable of reshaping the flow of combat efficiently.
