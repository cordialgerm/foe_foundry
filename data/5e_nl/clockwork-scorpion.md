The Clockwork Scorpion is a large construct creature characterized by its mechanical nature and powerful combat abilities. As an unaligned entity, it undertakes tasks and engages in battles without moral consideration, serving its creator's intentions. This formidable opponent has a notable armor class of 16, granting it good defense against attacks, while its impressive hit points of 95 enable it to withstand considerable damage in combat. With an overall challenge rating of 9, it presents a significant threat in encounters. The scorpion excels in melee combat due to its strong ability scores, particularly in Strength and Constitution, and showcases unique special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in battle. However, its low Intelligence and Charisma scores indicate weaknesses in social interactions and problem-solving, limiting its ability to engage in complex strategies outside of combat scenarios.

The Clockwork Scorpion possesses the following ability scores: Strength 19 (+4), Dexterity 13 (+1), Constitution 19 (+4), Intelligence 3 (-4), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 1 (-5). The high Strength and Constitution scores yield very good modifiers, making it an exceptional melee combatant with the stamina to last in prolonged fights. Its Dexterity is average, providing some agility, but its low Intelligence and Charisma scores indicate very bad to poor effectiveness in mental capabilities.

In terms of skills, the Clockwork Scorpion has a perception score of +1, revealing an average ability to remain aware of its environment. Its damage immunities protect it from poison and psychic damage, while it possesses resistances against fire damage and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attacks that are not made with adamantine weapons. It is immune to several conditions including being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, further enhancing its survivability. Its sensory capabilities include darkvision and tremorsense within 60 feet, complemented by a passive perception score of 15. The scorpion understands the languages of its creator but is unable to speak, limiting its ability to communicate.

The Clockwork Scorpion has several remarkable special abilities. Its Construct Nature allows it to function without air, food, drink, or sleep, and its Immutable Form grants it immunity to any form-altering spells or effects. It also possesses Magic Resistance, giving it advantage on saves against spells and magical effects, which is particularly beneficial in magical combat encounters.

In gameplay, the Clockwork Scorpion can execute multiple simultaneous attacks thanks to its Multiattack ability, allowing it to perform one sting attack and two claw attacks in a single turn. The Claw attack has a +8 to hit and can deal 10 (1d12+4) bludgeoning damage while also grappling the target with an escape DC of 16. Each claw can grapple only one creature, emphasizing its capability to control opponents.

The Sting attack is particularly dangerous, with a +8 to hit and causing 9 (1d10+4) piercing damage along with an additional 22 (4d10) poison damage. After the initial damage, the Clockwork Scorpion can choose from several effects based on the target’s Constitution saving throw. If the target fails the save against the Hallucinatory Elixir, they experience hallucinations and must use their action to make a melee attack against the nearest creature (not the scorpion), moving if necessary. This effect can lead to chaotic combat situations as the target may inadvertently attack allies. If the target is hit by the Sleep Solution, they will fall unconscious for one minute unless they take damage or are awakened by another creature, effectively removing them from combat for a duration. A failed save against the Vocal Paralytic causes the target to be poisoned for one minute, restricting their ability to speak or cast spells requiring verbal components, which can severely hinder spellcasters in the party.

Additionally, the Clockwork Scorpion can unleash Acid Spray (Recharge 5–6), generating a toxic cone of acid that strikes all creatures in a 15-foot area for 42 (12d6) acid damage, with a DC 16 Dexterity save for half damage. This ability can significantly impact gameplay by dealing damage to multiple enemies at once.

As a reaction, the Clockwork Scorpion can activate Gas Nozzles when it takes damage, releasing a poisonous gas that affects all creatures within 5 feet, dealing 5 (1d10) poison damage. If the damage it received was fire damage, the gas ignites and deals an additional 5 (1d10) fire damage, adding another layer of danger to engaging this construct in combat.
