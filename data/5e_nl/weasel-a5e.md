The Weasel is a tiny beast that plays a minor role in the ecosystem of Dungeons & Dragons. Despite its small size, it possesses good dexterity and impressive stealth capabilities, making it adept at avoiding danger and sneaking up on larger creatures. With an Armor Class of 13 and just 1 hit point, the Weasel is fragile and easily susceptible to damage, making it more of a nuisance than a threat in combat. Its challenge rating is 0, indicating that it is not meant to pose a real challenge to adventurers, but it can still provide tactical advantages in certain scenarios, especially with its keen senses.

In terms of attributes, the Weasel has a Strength score of 2, giving it a very bad modifier of -4, which means it is incapable of dealing significant physical damage. Its Dexterity score is quite high at 16, granting it a good modifier of +3, which allows it to be agile and hard to hit. The Constitution score of 8 results in a bad modifier of -1, implying it has low resilience to damage. Additionally, the Weasel's Intelligence score is 2, which is very bad, representing its lack of problem-solving capabilities. The Wisdom score of 12 yields an average modifier of +1, providing a modest awareness of its surroundings. Finally, a Charisma score of 4 gives it a very bad modifier of -3, indicating it is not particularly charming or persuasive.

The Weasel has two notable skills: it has a perception bonus of +3, aided by the keen hearing and smell ability that gives it advantage on Perception checks reliant on those senses. This ability means the Weasel is particularly effective at detecting hidden threats or prey, making it useful in scouting situations. With a stealth bonus of +5, it can move quietly and remain hidden from larger creatures, making it exceptional at avoiding confrontation.

In combat, the Weasel's primary action is its Bite attack. The weasel makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, which is good and allows it to reliably strike targets. If successful, the attack inflicts 1 piercing damage. An interesting mechanical note is that if this damage reduces a Small or larger creature to 0 hit points, that target takes no damage from the attack. This means that while the Weasel can deal minor damage, it also has strategic implications in combat scenarios, particularly against larger foes that may be affected by its unique damage trait. Overall, the Weasel's strengths lie in its agility and stealth rather than its combat prowess, making it a situational creature in the game.
