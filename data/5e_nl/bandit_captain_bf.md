The Bandit Captain is a medium humanoid character that serves as a charismatic leader among a group of bandits. With a challenge rating of 2, it functions effectively in both melee combat and strategic positioning, exhibiting good offensive capabilities alongside supporting abilities for its allies. While it has decent hit points at 51, its armor class is respectable at 16, making it somewhat durable in combat. The Bandit Captain boasts high dexterity which enhances its stealth, making it effective in sneaky ambushes. The creature can be considered a well-rounded opponent for low to mid-level adventurers, possessing a mix of agility, tact, and the ability to influence the battlefield dynamics.

In terms of attributes, the Bandit Captain has the following ability scores: Strength is +2, Dexterity is +4 (which is very good and enhances its ability to evade attacks), Constitution is +2 (average), Intelligence is +2 (average), Wisdom is +0 (bad), and Charisma is +2 (average). Its perception score is 10 (average), while it excels in stealth with a score of 16 (very good).

The Bandit Captain has a special ability called Opportunist, which grants it advantage on opportunity attacks. This means it can effectively exploit openings when opponents leave its reach, increasing the likelihood of dealing damage.

For its actions, the Bandit Captain can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to either make one Dagger attack and two Scimitar attacks or three Dagger attacks. The Dagger attack has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage on a hit. The Scimitar, similarly, has a +6 to hit and deals 7 slashing damage, making both attacks reliable options for inflicting damage.

As bonus actions, the Bandit Captain can use Reposition Forces (recharge 5-6) to allow each friendly bandit and thug under its command to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Additionally, the Steal Item ability allows it to take an object from a target within 5 feet, requiring the target to succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or lose one non-weapon item that is no heavier than 10 pounds.

The Bandit Captain also possesses a reaction called Parry, which allows it to add 2 to its armor class against a melee attack that would hit it, but it must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon. This reaction can effectively reduce the chances of it being hit during combat.
