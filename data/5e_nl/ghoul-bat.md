The Ghoul Bat is a small undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It serves as a low-level threat in its encounters, particularly adept at incapacitating foes with its abilities. With an Armor Class of 13 and 14 hit points, it is moderately resilient for its challenge rating of 1/4, making it a manageable opponent for lower-level adventurers. Its primary strengths rest in its speed and unique abilities, allowing it to engage foes effectively while remaining difficult to target. However, its low Strength and lack of significant melee combat capability identify clear weaknesses, as it relies more on its dexterous movements and special attacks to subdue others. 

The Ghoul Bat has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 6 with a modifier of -2, which is considered very bad.
- Dexterity: 16 with a modifier of +3, which is considered good.
- Constitution: 11 with a modifier of +0, which is average.
- Intelligence: 8 with a modifier of -1, which is considered very bad.
- Wisdom: 12 with a modifier of +1, which is average.
- Charisma: 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average.

In terms of defenses, the Ghoul Bat is immune to poison damage and is unaffected by the conditions of being charmed, exhausted, or poisoned. It possesses blindsight out to 60 feet, allowing it to sense its surroundings without the use of sight, although this ability is compromised if the creature is deafened. Its passive perception score is 11, and it has keen hearing, giving it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sound. The nature of the Ghoul Bat allows it to operate without needing air, food, drink, or sleep, which gives it exceptional endurance in prolonged encounters.

The Ghoul Bat has the following notable actions:
- **Bite:** This is its primary melee attack, where it makes a weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully hits a target, it deals 5 piercing damage (1d4 + 3). If the target is not undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed until the end of its next turn. This paralyzing ability can have a significant impact on combat as it can incapacitate opponents, allowing the Ghoul Bat or its allies to capitalize on their immobility.

Overall, the Ghoul Bat presents a mix of speed and incapacitating abilities, making it an intriguing encounter for adventurers, though it remains relatively weak in terms of raw offensive power.
