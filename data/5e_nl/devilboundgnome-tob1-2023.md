The Devilbound Gnome is a cunning and powerful small humanoid creature that embodies the characteristics of both gnome ingenuity and fiendish malice. This creature operates on the darker edges of morality, leveraging its intellect and magical abilities to manipulate and control both allies and enemies. With a high Armor Class of 17 aided by its unique ability called Infernal Blessing, the gnome becomes a surprisingly resilient opponent. It possesses 104 hit points, making it durable in battle, and its Challenge Rating of 9 indicates a formidable foe that can provide significant challenges. The Devilbound Gnome excels in magical combat, making it particularly dangerous due to its ability to summon devils, inflict potent fire and poison damage, and manipulate others through its spells and abilities. Its strengths lie in its impressive Charisma and spellcasting prowess, while its weaknesses include lower physical strength and vulnerability to silvered weapons.

The Devilbound Gnome has the following statistics: Strength is 10 (modifier +0), Dexterity is 14 (modifier +2), Constitution is 15 (modifier +2), Intelligence is 16 (modifier +3), Wisdom is 12 (modifier +1), and Charisma is 21 (modifier +5). Its saving throw bonuses are Constitution +6, Intelligence +7, and Charisma +9, making it particularly adept at resisting magical influences due to high Charisma. Its skills also reflect its cunning: Arcana +7, Deception +9, History +7, and Persuasion +9. In terms of resistances, the Devilbound Gnome is resistant to cold, fire, poison, and nonmagical damage types except when inflicted by silvered weapons. It is immune to the poisoned condition and possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light up to 60 feet. The languages spoken include Common, Infernal, and Gnomish.

The Devilbound Gnome has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness and versatility in gameplay. The Infernal Blessing allows it to add its exceptional Charisma modifier to its Armor Class and saving throws, which significantly enhances its survivability. The Infernal Bond links it with an imp, granting it command over the imp and the ability to perceive through its senses and communicate telepathically, even across planes. Magic Resistance gives the Devilbound Gnome an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it extremely hard to affect with magical attacks.

In combat, the Devilbound Gnome can utilize several potent actions. With Hellish Blast, it makes a melee or ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit, dealing 12 fire damage alongside 9 poison damage on a hit. The Hell's Servitors ability allows it to call devils to the battlefield, either summoning multiple weaker fiends or a single stronger one, offering strategic reinforcements for the gnome. The To Hell and Back action gives it the power to send a creature hurling through Hell, forcing them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw to avoid significant fire damage or being incapacitated temporarily. Lastly, the gnome's spellcasting ability allows it to cast a variety of spells, including utility and combat spells like detect magic, command, and wall of fire.

In terms of reactions, the Fiendish Sacrifice ability allows the Devilbound Gnome to preserve its life at the cost of its summoned allies when reduced to 0 hit points. It can sacrifice a recently called fiend or its bonded imp to avoid death, which strategically maintains its presence in combat while losing certain advantages associated with the imp. This ability creates a tense situation during battles, as allies are forced to weigh the cost of their sacrifices for the gnome’s continued survival.
