The Chain Devil is a medium fiend that operates within the realm of lawful evil. It is known for its formidable presence in combat, showcasing a combination of physical prowess and magical resistance. With an armor class of 17 and a substantial amount of hit points at 127, this creature is challenging for adventurers to defeat. Its key strengths lie in its high strength and constitution scores, making it both a potent attacker and a resilient foe. This creature's ability to manipulate chains gives it both offensive and defensive capabilities, allowing it to grapple and restrain unsuspecting targets. Additionally, its advantages against magical effects and its unique racial traits make it a dangerous adversary. However, Chain Devils are not invulnerable; their reliance on physical confrontations can be a weakness if faced with ranged or magical combatants who can evade close-quarter grappling.

The Chain Devil has the following attributes: strength at 18 (+4), dexterity at 14 (+2), constitution at 18 (+4), intelligence at 10 (+0), wisdom at 12 (+1), and charisma at 16 (+3). Its saving throw modifiers are exceptional for constitution (+8), good for wisdom (+5), and good for charisma (+7). The devil also possesses a survival skill value of +5, categorizing it as a competent tracker.

In terms of damage immunities and resistances, the Chain Devil is immune to fire and poison damage, while it has resistance to cold damage and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons. It is immune to the poisoned condition, which makes it a tough opponent in battles involving poison-based attacks. The creature has darkvision up to 120 feet, which allows it to see in dark or dim conditions as well as a passive perception of 12, contributing to its ability to navigate its environment efficiently. The Chain Devil communicates in Infernal and has telepathy that extends to 120 feet, which enhances its interaction with minions or allies.

The Chain Devil possesses several special abilities. Its "Devil's Sight" allows it to see through magical darkness, giving it a tactical advantage in shadowy environments. Illumined by "Lawful Evil," it radiates an aura indicative of its nature, potentially influencing nearby creatures. The "Magic Resistance" ability grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it particularly resilient against magical attacks. A notable trait, "Rattling Chains," means that the sound of its moving chains can be heard from up to 300 feet away unless it moves stealthily at half its speed. Its "Relentless Tracker" ability provides the chain devil with an advantage on ability checks to track grappling targets for up to 30 days, emphasizing its capability as a relentless pursuer.

In combat, the Chain Devil's multiattack allows it to make two chain attacks and command up to two animated chains to attack as well. The melee weapon attack to hit is +8, with a reach of 15 feet, and on a hit, the damage inflicted is 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage. If a target falls victim to this attack, they become grappled with an escape DC of 16, and while grappled, they are also restrained, limiting their movement until they can escape.

As a bonus action, the Chain Devil can animate a chain within 60 feet, transforming it into a magically animated weapon under its control for one hour. This animated chain has AC 20 and 20 hit points, as well as immunity to psychic, piercing, poison, and thunder damage. When used in conjunction with the Multiattack action, the devil can command the animated chain to perform an attack.

For its reaction, the Chain Devil can use the "Unnerving Mask" ability when it is damaged by a creature within 30 feet that can see it. The devil momentarily assumes the illusory form of an enemy or a loved one of the attacker. This figure can speak words exclusively heard by the attacker, forcing them to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On failing this save, the attacker takes 9 (2d8) psychic damage and becomes frightened until the end of their next turn, adding a psychological element to encounters with the devil. Importantly, this effect cannot be triggered again on the same attacker for 24 hours should they experience it.
