With a challenge rating of 23, this dragon boasts an impressive array of abilities, making it a significant threat in combat encounters. Its strengths lie in its formidable physical attacks, incredible resilience, and the strategic use of its breath weapon and frightful presence, which can incapacitate foes. On the downside, despite its high constitution, the dragon has only average dexterity and is vulnerable to certain magical effects due to its specific immunities and resistances. Encountering a Sand Ancient Dragon poses a daunting challenge for adventurers, as its combination of raw power, elemental characteristics, and debilitating abilities can swiftly turn the tide of battle.

Special abilities enhance the dragon's combat efficacy and versatility. "Legendary Resistance" allows it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw three times per day, making it incredibly resilient against magical effects. "Sand Camouflage" provides it with advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in sandy environments, facilitating ambush strategies. The "Sandy Nature" ability allows the dragon to survive on only half the necessary food and drink compared to other dragons of its size, showcasing its elemental power. Its "Stinging Sand" ability inflicts disadvantage on targets hit with its melee weapon attacks until the end of the dragon's next turn, challenging the effectiveness of its opponents in battle, with a high difficulty of 25 for the Constitution save.

In terms of actions, the Sand Ancient Dragon has a multiattack option, wherein it can use its "Frightful Presence" ability, causing all creatures within 120 feet to become frightened for one minute unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 20). The ability can create a significant tactical advantage by instilling fear in enemies. In its melee attacks, the dragon can use a "Bite" (with a +16 to hit, dealing 19 piercing damage), "Claw" (also with a +16 to hit, dealing 15 slashing damage), or "Tail" (with a +16 to hit and dealing 17 slashing damage from 20 feet away). Each of these attacks showcases the dragon's physical prowess. The "Breath Weapon" can be used to unleash a powerful and devastating attack (available on a recharge of 5-6), either as "Sand Blast," inflicting significant piercing and fire damage, or "Blinding Sand," which blinds affected creatures for a minute unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 25).

Additionally, the dragon has legendary actions that allow it to act outside of its turn. It can use "Detect" to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, "Tail Attack" to perform a tail strike, or "Wing Attack" (costing 2 actions) to deal bludgeoning damage and potentially knock creatures prone while also allowing it to reposition in the air. These legendary actions provide the dragon with much-needed versatility and aggressiveness in combat, ensuring it remains a constant threat to any challengers.
