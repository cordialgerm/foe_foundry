The Darkmantle is a Small Monstrosity that primarily serves as a lurking predator in its environment. This creature possesses a range of abilities that make it effective at ambushing prey. With a decent Armor Class of 11 and moderate Hit Points totaling 22, the Darkmantle can withstand some damage but is not overly resilient. Its movement capabilities are unique, allowing it to walk at a slow pace of 10 feet while being able to fly swiftly at 30 feet, making it agile and hard to pin down. Its Challenge Rating of 1/2 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, with an experience reward of 100 XP upon defeat. A notable aspect of the Darkmantle is its ability to create areas of magical darkness, which can severely hinder its opponents' visibility, and its grappling power can constrain foes effectively.

The Darkmantle has a Strength score of 16, translating to a +3 modifier that is considered very good. Its Dexterity and Constitution scores are 12, each providing a +1 modifier, rated as average, while its Intelligence (2, -4), Wisdom (10, +0), and Charisma (5, -3) are poor indicators of its cognitive and social skills. The Darkmantle possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, enabling it to detect creatures in total darkness, but this ability is negated if the creature is deafened. 

One of the Darkmantle's unique features is its false appearance; when motionless, it can blend seamlessly with rock, making it difficult for adventurers to notice it until it strikes. 

In combat, the Darkmantle utilizes a Multiattack, allowing it to both activate its Darkness Aura and make a crush attack in a single turn. The Darkness Aura creates a 15-foot radius of magical darkness that is impenetrable to darkvision and natural light. This effect lasts for up to 10 minutes or until the Darkmantle suffers damage, making the battlefield extremely challenging for those reliant on sight. 

The Darkmantle can also perform a Crush attack, making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit (considered good). This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is successfully hit and grapples (escape DC 13), the Darkmantle can gain a tactical advantage. If the attack is made with advantage, it can attach itself to the target's head, causing blindness and preventing the target from breathing. While grappling, the Darkmantle's speed drops to 0, effectively securing its grip while still being able to focus its attacks on the restrained opponent.
