The Horned Serpent is a formidable Large Monstrosity often encountered in aquatic environments, capable of thriving both in water and on land. With a high Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 210, this creature poses a significant challenge for adventurers, holding a Challenge Rating of 12. Its combination of powerful melee attacks and dangerous special abilities makes it a lethal opponent, especially when it utilizes its poisonous aura and the debilitating effects of the Corpse Cough disease. However, its low Intelligence stat and lack of magical capabilities can be viewed as weaknesses, making it susceptible to clever tactics that exploit its limitations.

The Horned Serpent possesses the following attributes: Strength is rated at 22, granting it a very good modifier of +6; Dexterity is at 16 with a good modifier of +3; Constitution is at 20, corresponding to a very good modifier of +5; Intelligence stands at a low 4, resulting in a very bad modifier of -3; Wisdom is 14, yielding a good modifier of +2; and Charisma is at 16, leading to a good modifier of +3. This combination of strengths and weaknesses indicates that while the Horned Serpent excels in physical encounters and durability, it relies on brute strength and powerful actions rather than intellect.

It has proficient saving throws in Dexterity with a modifier of +7 (good) and Wisdom at +6 (good). Its skills in perception at +6 (good) and stealth at +7 (good) make it adept at locating prey and remaining unseen. The Horned Serpent has immunities to necrotic and poison damage, with resistance to fire damage, further enhancing its durability in combat. Additionally, it is immune to being poisoned as well as any attempts to scry its location or detect its emotions.

The Horned Serpent has several noteworthy special abilities that impact gameplay significantly. It is Amphibious, allowing it to breathe in both air and water without any restrictions. The Corpse Cough ability afflicts any creature that fails a saving throw against its bite attack or Gem Gaze, causing a debilitating disease that prevents any short or long rests and inflicts ongoing necrotic damage. The effect can spread to blood relatives upon contact, creating a dangerous battlefield dynamic. The Poisonous Aura triggers at the start of its turn, forcing nearby creatures to make a Constitution saving throw or suffer poison damage, adding an area-of-effect threat to its combat tactics. Finally, the Shielded Mind ability protects it from attempts to peek into its thoughts or emotions, giving it a tactical advantage against mind-affecting spells.

In terms of actions, the Horned Serpent can perform a Multiattack, executing both a gore and a bite attack during its turn. The Gore attack has a +10 to hit and deals 19 piercing damage upon a successful strike. The Bite attack also has a +10 to hit, inflicts 21 piercing damage, and upon failing a Constitution saving throw, the target risks contracting the slab of the experienced Corpse Cough disease. Lastly, the Gem Gaze, which can be unleashed after a recharge of 5 to 6, creates a wide area effect that delivers significant radiant damage while also carrying the risk of infection from the Corpse Cough, making it a potent ability for devastating groups of adventurers.

In summary, the Horned Serpent is a powerful aquatic foe characterized by high damage output, debilitating abilities, and strong defenses, requiring careful strategy and coordinated efforts to overcome. Its presence in an encounter signals a need for preparation against its multiple forms of assault and the hazardous effects it can spread amongst adventuring parties.
