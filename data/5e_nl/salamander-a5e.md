The Salamander is a large elemental creature known for its connection to fire and its formidable physical prowess in combat. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial 90 hit points, it presents a durable opponent. Its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it offers a moderate challenge to groups of adventurers, being able to deal significant damage while also avoiding certain attacks due to its damage immunities and resistances. Notably, the Salamanderâ€™s body is always heated, creating a dangerous environment for those who grapple with it or strike it in melee range. However, it is vulnerable to cold damage, which can temporarily neutralize some of its defensive capabilities.

The Salamander possesses the following attributes: Strength of 18 (+4) which is very good for melee combat; Dexterity of 14 (+2) which is average and supports agility; Constitution of 14 (+2) which is average and contributes to its durability; Intelligence of 10 (+0) which is average and indicates basic reasoning; Wisdom of 10 (+0) which is average and reflects its perception; and Charisma of 12 (+1) which is slightly above average. The Salamander is proficient in Constitution saving throws (+5) and Wisdom saving throws (+3), making it good at resisting many physical and mental effects. It has immunities to fire damage and resistances against nonmagical weapon damage, emphasizing its elemental nature and toughness.

The creature has a special ability called Heated Body. When a creature starts its turn grappled by the Salamander, touches it, or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet, it suffers 7 (2d6) fire damage. A creature can only take this damage once per turn, and this ability is negated if the Salamander has received cold damage since its last turn, potentially making cold attacks very effective against it.

In combat, the Salamander utilizes a Multiattack action, allowing it to make both a tail attack and a pike attack in a single turn. The Tail attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Additionally, upon hitting with its tail, the target is subjected to the Heated Body effect, becomes grappled with an escape DC of 15, and is subsequently restrained. This means that the Salamander can automatically hit the grappled target on subsequent turns with the tail attack, thereby maintaining pressure on that enemy. The Pike attack is also a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage, further increasing the Salamander's damage output. 

Overall, the Salamander is a powerful melee combatant with strong offensive capabilities and damage-dealing traits that can effectively hamper its opponents while maintaining a degree of resilience thanks to its elemental immunities and resistances.
