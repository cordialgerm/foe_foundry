The Imp is a tiny fiend of devilish nature, often serving as a mischievous and cunning servant to more powerful devilish entities. With a good Armor Class of 13 and 31 hit points, it can be a nuisance in combat. Its low strength makes it physically weak, but its dexterity of +3 allows it to be quite nimble, making it harder to hit. The Imp excels in spell resistance and possesses a variety of special abilities that make it tricky to deal with. However, its limited melee damage and relatively low hit points can be seen as weaknesses. Notably, it can turn invisible and shapeshift, allowing it to escape from danger or reposition itself in combat. 

The creature has the following attributes: Strength at -2 (very bad), Dexterity at +3 (good), Constitution at +1 (average), Intelligence at +0 (average), Wisdom at +1 (average), and Charisma at +4 (very good). Its Charisma grants it a strong ability to charm and deceive, making it an effective manipulator in social encounters. The Imp has darkvision up to 120 feet, a perception score of 11, and a stealth score of 15, which is good for evading detection.

The Imp's special abilities enhance its survivability and utility in combat. Devil’s Sight allows it to see in magical darkness, which can significantly hinder opponents who rely on light-based vision. Devilish Resilience grants it resistance to cold damage and immunity to fire and poison damage, allowing it to be more durable against a range of attacks. Magic Resistance gives the Imp an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it difficult to incapacitate with magical effects.

In terms of actions, the Imp has a Slam attack in its Beast form, which has an attack bonus of +5 and deals an average of 10 (2d6 + 3) damage of a chosen type—bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. In its true form, the Sting attack also has an attack bonus of +5, deals 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and forces the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against additional poison damage of 10 (3d6), applying half damage on a successful save. 

Furthermore, the Imp can use Invisibility, allowing it to vanish from sight until it attacks or if its concentration breaks, which can create various tactical advantages during encounters. The Change Shape ability lets it transform into a Medium or smaller beast of lower challenge rating, effectively allowing it to adapt to different situations on the battlefield while retaining most of its abilities. If the Imp dies, it automatically reverts to its true fiend form.
