The Giant Eagle is a large beast that plays a versatile role in both combat and scouting. Boasting a decent Armor Class of 12 and a total of 26 hit points, it can withstand some damage while being agile enough to evade attacks, thanks to its flying speed of 80 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it presents a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, offering 200 experience points upon defeat. Notably, its keen sight allows it to excel in perception checks, making it an excellent scout in various environments. While its mental attributes are relatively low, with an Intelligence of 8 and a Charisma of 10, its physical attributes—particularly its Strength and Dexterity at 14—make it a fierce creature in battle. However, its relatively low Constitution score of 12 indicates it may struggle against sustain damage in prolonged encounters.

For its attributes, the Giant Eagle has the following scores: 

- Strength: 14 (+2, which is good for physical attacks)
- Dexterity: 14 (+2, providing a good boost to its agility and effectiveness in avoiding attacks)
- Constitution: 12 (+1, which is average and helps with its hit points)
- Intelligence: 8 (-1, indicating very poor reasoning ability)
- Wisdom: 14 (+2, allowing for good perception and insight)
- Charisma: 10 (+0, showing average personal magnetism)

The Giant Eagle is skilled in perception, receiving a +4 bonus to its checks. This, combined with its passive perception of 14, allows it to detect hidden creatures or objects effectively. It can communicate in its own language, Giant Eagle, and understands Common and Auran but cannot speak them.

One of its special abilities is Keen Sight, which gives the Giant Eagle advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight. This means it can roll two d20s and take the higher result, significantly increasing the chance of spotting hidden enemies or important details.

In terms of combat actions, the Giant Eagle can execute a Talons attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it inflicts 9 (2d6+2) slashing damage and grapples its target, making it difficult for the target to escape or retaliate; the escape difficulty is DC 13. The eagle cannot attack a different target while grappling one with its talons.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Giant Eagle can use its Beak attack on one creature that it has grappled. This attack also has a +4 to hit and deals 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage. This ability allows the Giant Eagle to maintain pressure on its grappled target, effectively controlling the battlefield while dealing consistent damage.
