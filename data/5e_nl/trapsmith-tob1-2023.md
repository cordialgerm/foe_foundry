The Trapsmith is a small humanoid creature known for its cunning and resourcefulness, embodying the role of a crafty trapmaker and rogue. It has a lawful neutral alignment, suggesting it adheres to its own codes and principles without any strong inclination toward good or evil. The Trapsmith boasts a good level of dexterity with a base score of 16, granting it a +3 modifier, making it effective at dodging attacks and executing delicate maneuvers. In contrast, its strength is quite poor at a score of 7, leading to a -2 modifier, which indicates that the Trapsmith is not suited for physical confrontations. This creature has a total of 54 hit points, indicating moderate durability in battle. Furthermore, its challenge rating of 2 suggests it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. The Trapsmith's unique abilities allow it to set up advantageous situations for itself and its allies, though its vulnerability to sunlight can be a significant weakness in brighter environments.

The Trapsmith's primary ability scores are as follows: Strength is 7 with a very bad modifier of -2; Dexterity is 16 with a good modifier of +3; Constitution is 12 with an average modifier of +1; Intelligence is 16 with a good modifier of +3; Wisdom is 13 with an average modifier of +1; and Charisma is 8 with a very bad modifier of -1. The individual scores provide insight into the Trapsmith's strengths in agility and intelligence while revealing significant weaknesses in physical strength and charisma. In addition, it has proficiency in Stealth, allowing the creature to be rather sneaky with a total skill score of +5 in this area. Its sensory abilities include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 11, making it adept at navigating darkness and aware of its surroundings in low-light conditions.

The Trapsmith has several special abilities that enhance its tactical prowess in gameplay. Improvised Tools allow it to use tiny objects to pick locks or disarm traps as if it were using thieves' tools, giving it proficiency and advantage on those checks. This ability makes the Trapsmith exceptionally skilled at sneaking and disabling security features. The Pack Tactics ability means that it gains an advantage on attack rolls against enemies when an ally is nearby, making it more deadly in group situations. However, Sunlight Sensitivity presents a major downside, as it suffers from disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks when in sunlight, limiting its effectiveness outdoors during the day.

In terms of actions, the Trapsmith can perform a Multiattack by using its Makeshift Trap ability and then making one Dagger or Spare Part attack. The Dagger attack is a close-range or ranged weapon attack with a +5 to hit, dealing 5 piercing damage on a successful hit, which makes it viable for both melee and ranged combat. The Spare Part ability is a ranged attack that also rolls at +5 to hit, dealing 6 damage of either bludgeoning or slashing type, providing versatility in combat scenarios. The Makeshift Trap ability allows the Trapsmith to create and throw a trap within a 30-foot range. The trap's effectiveness relies on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; creatures that fail the throw will experience several effects that the Trapsmith can choose from, making this ability especially strategic in controlling the battlefield and hindering enemies.
