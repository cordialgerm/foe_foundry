The Drake, Vapor is a sizable neutral dragon known for its agility and unique demeanor that reflects its untamed, swampy habitat. It has a sturdy armor class of 15 due to its natural armor, making it relatively resilient in combat, complemented by its considerable hit points totaling 119. While its challenge rating of 6 indicates a moderate threat level, it has notable strengths, such as its high Dexterity, which enhances its agility in battle, and reliable resistance to cold damage. Nevertheless, its lack of intelligence and charisma means it may struggle in social or strategic scenarios requiring negotiation or complex tactics. The drake excels at ambushing foes with its special abilities, particularly in swamp environments where it can leverage its camouflage to gain an advantage.

The drake has the following ability scores: Strength of 14 (+2, which is average), Dexterity of 19 (+4, very good), Constitution of 17 (+3, good), Intelligence of 7 (-2, very bad), Wisdom of 15 (+2, good), and Charisma of 7 (-2, very bad). Its skills in perception give it a passive score of 15, allowing it to be fairly aware of its surroundings. Notably, it possesses damage immunities to poison and resistances to cold, making it a tough adversary against certain creature types and attacks. One significant condition immunity is to being poisoned, reinforcing its resilience against various attacks. It can see in darkness up to 60 feet and understands Draconic, which may facilitate communication with other draconic creatures.

Among the drake's special abilities is the Diving Pounce, which allows it to knock enemies prone if it flies 20 feet straight towards them before attacking. If successful, the drake can make a Bite attack as a bonus action against the prone target. Gaseous Ascension allows the drake to maintain its flight by inhaling swamp gases; without access to these gases, it loses its fly speed. Additionally, every time it uses its Poisonous Breath ability, it also loses its flight until that ability recharges. The drake can communicate with beasts native to swampland thanks to its Speak with Beasts ability. Its Swamp Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when attempting to hide in swampy terrain, further enhancing its stealth capabilities.

In combat, the drake can employ a Multiattack pattern, which consists of one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 13 piercing damage. When biting, it forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being poisoned for one minute, though the creature can retry the saving throw at the end of its turns. Each Claw attack similarly has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 11 slashing damage. Lastly, the drake's Poisonous Breath ability is notably dangerous; it can exhale a poisonous gas in a 30-foot cone, dealing an average of 27 poison damage if enemies fail a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, with half damage on a success. If the drake is airborne when using this ability, it immediately loses its flying privileges, possibly leading to a precarious fall, which could become an exploitable weakness given the terrain. Creatures affected by the breath weapon can also attempt to shake off their poisoning effect at the end of each of their turns.
