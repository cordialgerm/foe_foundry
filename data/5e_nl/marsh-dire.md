The Marsh Dire is a powerful Medium undead creature embodying a neutral evil alignment. This creature excels in both melee and restraining combat, making it a formidable opponent. With an impressive armor class of 15 and a substantial hit point total of 142, it boasts good durability. Its physical attributes favor strength and constitution, with a strength score of 18 (+4) providing it with exceptional melee capabilities. However, its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma are below average, which informs its basic strategic choices and interactions. The Marsh Dire is resistant to fire and necrotic damage while immune to poison damage and several conditions, enhancing its survivability. The unique "Cloying Stench" ability can poison nearby foes, while its multiple attack options enable it to inflict both slashing and necrotic damage with ease.

The Marsh Dire has the following attributes:
- Strength: 18, contributing to an exceptional physical power for melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 13, providing an average ability to act quickly but not significantly enhancing its overall combat effectiveness.
- Constitution: 20, which is remarkable, allowing the creature to soak up a lot of damage due to its high hit points.
- Intelligence: 7, reflecting a very bad capability for complex thought or strategy.
- Wisdom: 11, indicating an average perception or insight regarding situations.
- Charisma: 8, representing a very bad ability to influence or communicate effectively with others.

In terms of skills, the Marsh Dire has a +3 modifier to its perception, which is considered average, allowing it to notice hidden creatures or objects reasonably well. It possesses damage immunities to poison, resistance to fire and necrotic damage, and is immune to conditions such as charm, exhaustion, and poison, providing it substantial advantages in encounters.

The special abilities of the Marsh Dire include:

- Cloying Stench: Any creature that begins its turn within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of their next turn. If successful, that creature gains advantage on subsequent saving throws against the Cloying Stench for the next 24 hours, encouraging tactical positioning in combat.

The Marsh Dire's actions are as follows:

- Multiattack: The Marsh Dire can make three attacks during its turnâ€”two with its claws and one with its strangling vine.
- Claws: This melee attack has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage on a hit.
- Strangling Vine: This attack has a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it becomes grappled with an escape DC of 15. While grappled, the target is unable to breathe, speak, or cast spells that require verbal components. Additionally, the target is restrained and receives 7 (2d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the Marsh Dire's turns. The creature possesses three vines, meaning it can grapple multiple targets simultaneously.

Overall, the Marsh Dire presents a versatile threat that combines physical power, the ability to restrain foes, and poison effects that disturbs enemy tactics, making it a challenging adversary in any encounter.
