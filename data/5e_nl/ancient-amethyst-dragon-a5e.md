The Ancient Amethyst Dragon is a gargantuan creature that embodies the power and majesty of dragons in the world of Dungeons & Dragons. This dragon is not only formidable in combat due to its impressive physical stats but also possesses powerful psionic abilities that can manipulate the minds of foes from great distances. With an armor class of 20 and a substantial pool of hit points totalling 313, the Ancient Amethyst Dragon is designed to withstand significant damage. This dragon is rated as a Challenge Rating of 23, making it an exceptionally high-tier adversary worth 50,000 experience points when defeated. It has a variety of strengths including resistances to force and psychic damage, a wide range of telepathic communication abilities, and formidable spells. However, its reliance on psionic powers may expose it to weaknesses against opponents who are immune or particularly resistant to psychic effects.

The creature's statistics reflect its sheer power, with a Strength score of 22 (+6), Dexterity of 24 (+7), Constitution of 22 (+6), Intelligence of 26 (+8), Wisdom of 16 (+3), and Charisma of 24 (+7). These attributes contribute to its effectiveness in combat; for example, its high Dexterity provides very good initiative bonuses, allowing it to act early in combat. The Ancient Amethyst Dragon's saving throw bonuses are impressive: +13 for Constitution, +15 for Intelligence, +10 for Wisdom, and +14 for Charisma, all of which are very good. With skills such as deception (+14), insight (+10), perception (+10), and persuasion (+14), it can easily manipulate encounters in its favor. It enjoys conditions immunity to fatigue and has a notable darkvision that extends out to 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness.

One key feature of the Ancient Amethyst Dragon is its **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**, which permits it to succeed on failed saving throws, reflecting its resilience in the face of magical assaults. When this ability is used, however, it briefly loses its ability to utilize telepathy or psionic capabilities until the end of its next turn. The **Psionic Powers** of the dragon allow its abilities to be considered both magical and psionic, adding complexity to their interactions.

The dragon can exert its mind over a vast area with the **Far Thoughts** ability, allowing it to detect and observe any creature using psionic powers or telepathic communication within 100 miles. It can maintain this observation indefinitely, making it a formidable strategic foe. In addition to its psionic capabilities, the dragon also features **Innate Spellcasting**, allowing it to execute spells without the need for material components. It can cast spells such as **calm emotions**, **charm person**, **mass suggestion**, and **modify memory** three times per day, while it can use **plane shift** and **project image** once per day. These spells can greatly affect gameplay by altering the dynamics of encounters, influencing opponents, or providing tactical advantages.

In terms of actions, the Ancient Amethyst Dragon can employ a **Multiattack** action to strike once with its bite and twice with its claws. Its **Bite** attack has a +13 to hit, reaching out 15 feet to deal an average of 28 piercing damage (4d10+6) plus an additional 9 force damage (2d8). Its **Claws** attack similarly has a +13 to hit, inflicting an average of 19 slashing damage (3d8). The dragon can also use the **Psionic Wave**, unleashing a wave of intense psychic force that forces all creatures within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, targets suffer an average of 22 psychic damage (4d10), or half as much on a successful save. Those charmed by the dragon take this saving throw with disadvantage, showcasing its manipulative prowess.

The **Concussive Breath** weapon is a devastating area attack that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. The dragon can unleash a 90-foot cone of telekinetic energy, forcing creatures within it to make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or suffer a staggering 82 force damage (15d10), or half damage if they succeed.

Lastly, the dragon has a reactive maneuver called **Assume Control** which it may use while bloodied. If a creature is charmed by the dragon when its turn begins, the dragon can command it to act as per its desires, allowing for significant battlefield manipulation. Should the command cause self-harm, the targeted creature benefits from a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw to potentially end its turn prematurely if successful.

The Ancient Amethyst Dragon also has access to three legendary actions that it can use to further its tactical advantage; it can charm an enemy, end concentration of a spell, cause another Psionic Wave, or use the powerful **Captivating Harmonics** ability, which charms creatures within a significant radius, creating even more challenging dynamics during combat. This dragon represents the epitome of draconic might and manipulation, serving as a potent foe that will require tactical acumen and teamwork to overcome.
