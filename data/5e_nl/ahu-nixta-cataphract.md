The Ahu-Nixta Cataphract is a large aberration that embodies a fusion of mechanical and biological elements, characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It possesses formidable strengths due to its high Armor Class of 17 and impressive Hit Points totaling 135, making it a resilient opponent in combat. The creature's dual capabilities for hovering, walking, and flying allow for great maneuverability on the battlefield. However, its Dexterity is quite low at -1, indicating a weakness in nimble movements. The Cataphract excels in intelligence-based spells, benefiting from a strong Intelligence score of 19 (+4) which enhances its spellcasting abilities and versatility in various encounters. Notably, its innate spellcasting allows it to cast spells at will, providing additional tactical options in battle. The Ahu-Nixta becomes increasingly vulnerable when its clockwork armor is breached, reducing its capabilities significantly.

The Ahu-Nixta Cataphract has the following attributes: its Strength is 20 (+5), which is exceptionally strong, allowing it to engage in powerful melee attacks. Its Constitution score is 14 (+2), which is good and provides a decent buffer to its HP. Wisdom is average at 13 (+1), while its Charisma remains average at 10 (+0). Notably, it has damage immunities to poison and psychic damage, along with complete immunity to numerous conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and prone while within its clockwork armor. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 14, reflecting its acute awareness of its surroundings.

The special abilities of the Ahu-Nixta Cataphract include:

- **Clockwork Encasement:** While encased in its clockwork armor, the Cataphract can attack and manipulate objects with its armor’s varied manipulators. If reduced to 0 HP, it exits the armor, which then becomes damaged. Outside the armor, it has lower statistics—AC 12, 37 HP (5d10 + 10), a significantly reduced Strength of 9 (-1), and a walking speed reduced to 20 feet. It loses combat attack actions but can still cast spells. The Cataphract can exit or enter its armor as a bonus action, granting it flexibility in combat.

- **Immutable Form:** This ability protects the Cataphract’s clockwork armor from any spell or effect that would change its form, as long as the creature remains within the armor, making it immune to transformation effects.

- **Innate Spellcasting:** The creature's primary spellcasting ability is Intelligence, with a spell save DC of 15 and a +7 bonus to hit with spell attacks. The Ahu-Nixta can cast the following spells at will without the need for material components: 
   - **Fear:** A spell that instills fear in its targets, potentially causing them to flee.
   - **Fire Bolt:** A ranged attack that deals 2d10 fire damage on a hit.
   - **Telekinesis:** It allows the Cataphract to manipulate objects or creatures from a distance, which can alter the battlefield dynamics.

For actions available in combat:

- **Multiattack:** The Ahu-Nixta Cataphract can make three melee attacks on its turn. Alternatively, it can replace two of these attacks with a casting of an at-will spell or utilize its Arcane Cannon twice.

- **Whirring Blades:** A melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 12 (3d4 + 5) slashing damage. Additionally, the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take an extra 5 (2d4) slashing damage at the start of its next turn.

- **Pronged Scepter:** This melee weapon attack also has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. It deals 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage upon a successful hit.

- **Bashing Rod:** Another melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, which deals 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

- **Arcane Cannon:** This is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit, a range of 100 feet, and on a hit deals 18 (4d8) force damage. The target must also succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can greatly affect positioning in combat.
