The Thornheart Guardian is a formidable large construct with a lawful evil alignment. Serving as a sentinel or protector, it boasts impressive defensive capabilities, including a high armor class of 18 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 133. This creature excels in physical combat, utilizing its strong strength attribute of 19 to deliver devastating attacks. With its magical enhancements and immunities, it presents a significant threat to adventurers. Notably, it can resist various forms of damage while remaining unaffected by many conditions. However, its intelligence is low, meaning it lacks sophisticated tactical reasoning, which can be exploited by clever players.

The Thornheart Guardian possesses several key attributes that enhance its effectiveness in battle. Its strength of 19 provides a +4 modifier, translating to good melee attack capabilities. A dexterity of 10 gives it an average modifier of +0, meaning it is neither particularly nimble nor clumsy. With a constitution score of 18, it has a +4 modifier, reflecting very good durability. Intelligence at 7 results in a -2 modifier, which is very bad and indicates limited mental capabilities. Its wisdom of 14 grants a +2 modifier, which is considered good for perception checks, while a charisma score of 1 gives it a -5 modifier, classifying it as exceptionally poor.

In terms of defenses, the Thornheart Guardian has several advantages: it is immune to poison and psychic damage, resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing, and completely immune to being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. It has darkvision extending 60 feet and a passive perception of 16, making it highly aware of its surroundings despite its lack of speech. While it understands the languages of its creator, it cannot communicate verbally.

The Thornheart Guardian has some powerful special abilities. **Immutable Form** ensures that it cannot be altered by spells or effects, providing excellent stability in combat. **Magic Resistance** grants it advantage on saving throws against spells, giving it very good resilience against magical attacks. Its **Magic Weapons** quality makes its weapon attacks magical, allowing them to bypass damage resistances that non-magical attacks might encounter. **Woodland Walk** allows it to move unhindered through nonmagical plants, reflecting its connection to natural terrain.

During combat, the Thornheart Guardian can execute a **Multiattack**, performing three attacksâ€”two with its barbed greatsword and one with its thorny whip. The barbed greatsword has a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting an average of 13 slashing damage alongside an additional 7 piercing damage on a hit. Its **Thorny Whip** also has a +8 to hit with a reach of 15 feet, dealing 11 piercing damage, and can grapple Medium or smaller creatures, restraining them unless they succeed on a DC 16 escape check.

The guardian can also employ **Grasp of the Briar** (which recharges on rolls of 5-6). This ability creates a 20-foot area of difficult terrain around it, restricting movement for foes. Creatures that enter or start their turn in this area must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become restrained. Each round they remain restrained, they take 7 necrotic damage. Players can attempt to free restrained allies by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.

Overall, the Thornheart Guardian combines physical prowess with potent magical qualities, making it a substantial adversary that challenges both the combat and tactical capabilities of any adventuring party.
