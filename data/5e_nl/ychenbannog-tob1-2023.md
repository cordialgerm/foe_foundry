The Ychen Bannog is a gargantuan, unaligned beast that serves as a formidable presence in any encounter. With an impressive Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor and a total of 186 hit points, it operates primarily as a tank in battle, capable of absorbing significant damage while dealing out devastating blows. This creature boasts exceptional Strength and Constitution scores, granting it powerful melee attacks and the ability to endure many hits, although its lack of Dexterity may make it somewhat predictable. While it cannot cast spells or communicate, its special abilities and fearsome physical attacks make it a powerful adversary.

The Ychen Bannog has a Strength score of 28, which translates to a +9 modifier, making its attack rolls very good. Its Dexterity is average, sitting at 10 with a +0 modifier, meaning it is neither nimble nor clumsy. The Constitution is 21, resulting in a +5 modifier, which enhances its durability. Intelligence is remarkably low at 3, granting a -4 modifier, and indicating that it is not capable of reasoning or strategic thinking. Wisdom is average with a score of 12 (+1), providing basic awareness. Charisma is also average at 10 (+0), indicating no capability in social interactions.

In terms of combat capabilities, the Ychen Bannog has a special ability called "Siege Monster," allowing it to deal double damage to structures and objects, making it particularly dangerous in environments with buildings or implements that could be destroyed. 

During its turn, the Ychen Bannog can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make one Gore attack and two Stomp attacks in a single action. The Gore attack is a melee weapon attack with a +13 to hit that has a reach of 15 feet. When it hits, it inflicts 25 (3d10 + 9) piercing damage, and if it scores a critical hit, it can roll its damage dice three times, significantly increasing the damage dealt. 

The Stomp attack is another melee weapon attack that also has a +13 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. This attack deals 22 (3d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage to the target, and if it is a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can alter the dynamics of the battlefield.

The Ychen Bannog can unleash a powerful ability known as "Deafening Bellow," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows it to create a thunderous sound in a cone that extends 60 feet. Creatures caught in this cone must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in taking 44 (8d10) thunder damage and being deafened for one hour, while a successful save halves the damage and prevents deafness. Inorganic creatures such as those made of stone or metal have disadvantage on this saving throw, making it particularly effective against such foes.

Another frightening action it can perform is "Overrun," which also recharges on a 6. This action allows the Ychen Bannog to move up to 30 feet in a straight line, passing through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures without provoking opportunity attacks. The first creature it enters must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, that creature takes 54 (12d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone, while a successful save results in half damage and no prone condition.

Overall, the Ychen Bannog is a devastating force in combat, capable of dealing considerable damage while also impacting the battlefield's layout and dynamics with its powerful abilities.
