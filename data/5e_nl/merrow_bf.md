The Merrow is a large monstrosity that embodies a fearsome aquatic predator, adept at both melee combat and moving swiftly through water. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, capable of dealing significant damage with its natural attacks and employing tactical maneuvers with its harpoon. Its strength and constitution scores are above average, allowing it to withstand combat, while its amphibious nature grants it versatility in various environments. However, its intelligence and charisma are notably low, making it less effective in roles that require cunning or charm. The Merrow's primary strength lies in its capacity to engage foes from both melee and ranged positions, and its special abilities offer unique options for control and mobility.

The Merrow has an armor class of 13, which is average for its challenge level, providing a decent level of protection. It possesses 60 hit points, allowing it to endure sustained combat. The Merrow's movement speed is limited to 10 feet on land but increases to a swimming speed of 40 feet, facilitating quick engagements in water. Its strength score of +4 provides it with a good modifier for attack rolls, while its dexterity is average with a +0 modifier, suggesting it is not particularly nimble. The constitution score of +2 enhances its durability, but its intelligence score of -1, wisdom of +0, and charisma of -1 indicate weaknesses in mental prowess and social interactions. The Merrow possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and a perception score of 12, which is average.

The Merrow has two notable special abilities: it is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, and it has resilience against exhaustion and the frightened condition, which makes it more effective in extended combats or situations that would typically hinder its performance.

In combat, the Merrow can utilize its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or replace one Claw with a Harpoon attack during a single turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, capable of inflicting 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage. The Claw attack also has a +6 to hit and deals 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage. The Harpoon attack can be executed as either a melee or ranged attack at a +6 to hit, dealing 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. A significant feature of the Harpoon is that it becomes lodged in the target, restricting the movement of both the Merrow and the target to within 60 feet of each other unless the harpoon is physically removed or severed.

As a bonus action, the Merrow can use Shoving Rush, allowing it to move swiftly while attempting to knock a target prone. The target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw, with failure resulting in being knocked down and not provoking opportunity attacks. Additionally, the Recall Harpoon ability permits the Merrow to retract its harpoon if it is stuck in a creature, forcing that creature to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled toward the Merrow. This ability adds to the tactical options for the Merrow, allowing it to reposition foes strategically in combat.
