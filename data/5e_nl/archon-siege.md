The Archon, Siege, is a formidable Huge Celestial creature with a lawful good alignment. It serves as a powerful combatant in battles, wielding immense physical strength and potent magical abilities. With a high Armor Class of 18 and a significant pool of Hit Points totaling 187, it is well-equipped to withstand considerable damage while dealing devastating hits in return. The Archon has a notable Challenge Rating of 13, reflecting its ability to pose a serious challenge to adventurers. Its resilience is enhanced by its magical resistance, immunities to certain conditions, and an impressive array of abilities that exploit its size and celestial nature. While it excels in dealing damage, especially to structures with its Siege Monster ability, it is important to note that its defense against ranged attacks is less impressive, making tactics against it critical for opponents.

It possesses the skill of perception with a modifier of +5, allowing it to notice hidden creatures or objects effectively.

In terms of resistances, the Archon is resistant to radiant damage as well as non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, making it hard to damage. It is immune to being charmed, exhausted, or frightened, allowing it to maintain composure and control in dire situations. It has truesight up to 120 feet, granting it the ability to see through illusions and invisibility, alongside a passive perception score of 20, which indicates it can notice hidden aspects quite reliably. The Archon can communicate through all languages and possesses telepathy out to a range of 120 feet.

The Archon has several notable special abilities. Its **Celestial Weapons** means all its weapon attacks are considered magical, adding an extra 5d8 force damage each time it successfully strikes with its weapon. The **False Appearance** feature allows it to remain motionless, making it indistinguishable from an inanimate statue, which can create tactical advantages in combat or ambush situations. The **Immortal Nature** ability prevents the Archon from needing food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain vigilant for prolonged periods. Thanks to **Magic Resistance**, it has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, enhancing its survivability in magically intensive environments. The **Siege Monster** ability allows it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it exceptionally dangerous in siege scenarios. Lastly, the **Trampling Charge** ability allows the Archon to potentially knock targets prone if it moves 20 feet in a straight line towards them and successfully hits with its Trunk Maul.

For actions, the Archon can perform a **Multiattack**, which consists of either two attacks with its **Trunk Maul** or four **Trumpeting Blasts**. The **Trunk Maul** attack is a melee weapon attack with a +11 to hit, extending 10 feet away from it, that deals 20 (4d6+6) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (5d8) force damage, making it a strong attack. The **Stomp** attack targets a prone creature, hitting with the same +11 to hit modifier and dealing 22 (3d10+6) bludgeoning damage. The **Trumpeting Blast** attack is a ranged spell attack with a +10 to hit and can target an enemy up to 120 feet away, dealing 19 (4d6+5) thunder damage. Additionally, it has a powerful special attack called **Sundering Quake**, which requires recharge rolls of 5 or 6. When used, it slams its forelegs into the ground, causing an area-of-effect attack that deals 49 (14d6) force damage to all creatures in contact with the ground within 20 feet, allowing them to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw for half damage. Structures in the same area also take damage and may collapse if reduced to 0 hit points, demonstrating its potential destructive capabilities in combat.
