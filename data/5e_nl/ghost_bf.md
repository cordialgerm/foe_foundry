The Ghost is a Medium undead creature that embodies the restless spirits of those who have died with unresolved issues or emotions. As a spectral being, its strengths lie in its ability to move undetected through walls and objects, making it a challenging foe for adventurers. With a Challenge Rating of 4 and Hit Points totaling 68, it presents a moderate threat, especially due to its unique abilities and potent attacks. It possesses an average Armor Class of 12, which makes it somewhat easier to hit compared to tougher foes. The Ghost's combat capabilities include necrotic and telekinetic attacks, and its horrifying presence can instill fear and potentially age its victims. It is particularly elusive, thanks to its incorporeal nature and ethereal sight, allowing it to slip between planes of existence. However, its dependency on its unfinished business for permanent rest can be exploited by characters who uncover its past.

The Ghost has the following ability scores: Strength -2 (very bad), Dexterity +2 (average), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence +0 (average), Wisdom +3 (good), and Charisma +4 (very good). With decent Dexterity, it can be relatively agile, but its Strength is poor, making it ineffective in physical confrontations. The higher Charisma makes it particularly effective in social interactions and spellcasting.

The Ghost enjoys several special abilities that enhance its supernatural capabilities. Ethereal Sight allows it to see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when on the Material Plane and vice versa, granting it an enhanced awareness of its surroundings. Its Incorporeal Movement enables it to pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain; however, it suffers 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. With Undead Nature, the Ghost does not require essentials like air, food, or sleep, making it relentless in pursuit of its goals. It also has Undead Resilience, granting immunity to poison damage and conditions like exhaustion and being poisoned. Its most notable ability, Unfinished Business, allows it to return as a ghost if destroyed until its remaining tasks are accomplished. If it encounters something related to its past and fails a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, it becomes incapacitated until the end of its next turn, making this a powerful mechanic for players to utilize.

During combat, the Ghost can make the following actions. It can perform a Multiattack, utilizing two of either its Withering Touch or Telekinetic Throw attacks. The Withering Touch is a melee spell attack with a +6 to hit and can inflict 18 (4d6 + 4) necrotic damage. This makes it a considerable threat in close quarters. The Telekinetic Throw is a ranged attack with a +4 to hit, capable of dealing 17 (6d4 + 2) damage depending on the object thrown and can target enemies from a distance of up to 60 feet. Both of these attacks allow the Ghost to exert damage in versatile ways.

Additionally, the Ghost may use its special action, Horrify, that has a recharge of 5–6 rounds. This ability allows the Ghost to frighten its enemies in a 30-foot cone with a haunting phrase or manifestation from its past. Creatures in this radius must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, suffering 21 (6d6) psychic damage on a failure and being frightened until the end of their next turn. If they fail the save by 5 or more, they also endure a permanent aging effect of 10 percent of their age, which can be reversed only with powerful magic. 

For mobility on the battlefield, the Ghost can utilize its bonus action to shift between planes with Etherealness, allowing it to escape attacks while remaining visible, creating potential tactical advantages.

Overall, the Ghost is a complex adversary that combines damaging attacks with psychological warfare, utilizing its unique nature to challenge players both physically and mentally.
