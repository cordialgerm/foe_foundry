The Savager is a formidable large beast that embodies primal ferocity and relentless aggression, making it a dangerous adversary in combat. With a neutral evil alignment, it demonstrates ruthless behavior in pursuit of its goals. The Savager has impressive physical attributes, boasting high Strength and Constitution, which contribute to its devastating melee attacks and durability in battle. However, it is limited in Dexterity and Intelligence, which affects its speed and cunning. Noteworthy features include its ability to resist damage from nonmagical attacks, making it a tough opponent for less potent combatants, along with special abilities that enhance its attack potency and defensive measures. Overall, the Savager's power lies in its raw physicality and ability to inflict continuous damage while remaining resilient.

The Savager has an Armor Class of 17, representing a good level of protection thanks to its natural armor. It possesses a robust pool of Hit Points, totaling 105 from rolling 10d10 plus an additional 50 hit points, signifying average durability in prolonged encounters within its challenge rating of 8, roughly equating to 3,900 experience points for defeating it. Its movement speed is relatively slow at just 20 feet, limiting its mobility options in battle.

In terms of abilities, the Savager has strong physical scores: it has a Strength of 22 with a +6 modifier, which is exceptional, making its melee attacks particularly hard-hitting. Its Dexterity score of 14 provides a good +2 modifier, improving its agility and slight defensive capabilities. The Constitution at 21 gives it a very good +5 modifier, enhancing its resilience and ability to withstand damage. Intelligence is very low at 2 with a â€“4 modifier, which is very bad, indicating a lack of mental cognitive skills. It has a Wisdom score of 10, rated average with no modifier, showcasing typical awareness. Lastly, its Charisma of 13 reflects a good +1 modifier, which could influence any interactions but is mostly irrelevant during combat. 

The Savager is proficient in Dexterity saving throws with a modifier of +5, making it good at avoiding effects that require an agile response. It also has a proficiency in Constitution saving throws at +8, proving exceptionally resilient against poison and other harmful effects. In terms of skills, it has a +3 bonus in Perception, allowing it to notice subtle changes in its environment effectively.

Regarding resistances, the creature can withstand bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, which provides it with significant durability against most physical attacks. Furthermore, it is immune to being charmed or frightened, adding to its tenacious nature in various scenarios. With darkvision extending to 60 feet, the Savager can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, though it cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

The Savager has several special abilities that enhance its capabilities in combat. Its "Mighty Swing" ability grants it advantage on its next Claw attack if it remains stationary during its turn, increasing the likelihood of landing a powerful strike. The "Spines" ability inflicts piercing damage on any creature that touches or attacks the Savager from within close range, as well as causing additional damage to creatures grappling or being grappled by it. This ability creates a hazardous environment for those who engage it up close.

In terms of actions, the Savager can make a series of attacks through its "Multiattack" feature, allowing it to perform one Bite attack and two Claw attacks on its turn. This combination increases its potential damage output significantly. The Bite attack is a melee weapon strike with a +9 to hit, reaching a 5-foot distance, capable of inflicting 19 piercing damage. The two Claw attacks also use a +9 to hit and deal 15 slashing damage each. If both Claw attacks strike a single target, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or suffer an additional 9 slashing damage from a ripping maneuver. This combination of attacks makes the Savager a powerful threat that can deal massive damage in a single turn while also inflicting ongoing dangers through its abilities.
