The Boar is a Medium-sized beast that plays the role of a formidable melee combatant in encounters. With an Armor Class of 11 and a modest 11 hit points, it presents a decent challenge for low-level adventurers, represented by a Challenge Rating of 1/4, indicating it is a suitable opponent for groups seeking minor conflicts. The Boar's notable strength lies in its Relentless ability, which allows it to survive near-death experiences, giving it a chance to remain in combat even when it would normally be incapacitated. However, its low Intelligence and Charisma scores reveal significant weaknesses in social interactions and mental challenges. Overall, the Boar focuses primarily on physical damage output and can be quite effective if utilized strategically in combat scenarios.

The Boar has the following ability scores: Strength is 12, providing a good modifier of +1, Dexterity is 10 with a modifier of +0, Constitution is 12 which also gives a +1 modifier, Intelligence is remarkably low at 2 with a modifier of -4, Wisdom is average at 10 contributing a +0 modifier, and Charisma is poor at 4 resulting in a -3 modifier. The Strength and Constitution scores make the Boar a resilient and reasonably powerful adversary, while its Dexterity score means it is average in terms of agility. The low Intelligence and Charisma scores indicate that the Boar will struggle in any situation requiring mental acuity or charm, presenting a bad choice for social dynamics.

In terms of special abilities, the Boar has Relentless, which can be activated once per day. This ability allows the Boar to avoid being reduced to 0 hit points if it takes 5 or less damage, instead dropping down to just 1 hit point. This feature makes the Boar significantly more durable in combat by providing a second chance to continue fighting.

For its actions, the Boar has a melee attack called Tusk. The attack has a +3 to hit, indicating a good chance of successfully striking opponents. It has a reach of 5 feet and targets a single enemy. Upon a successful hit, the Boar inflicts 4 slashing damage through its tusks, which can increase significantly under certain conditions. If the Boar charges at least 20 feet straight towards a target before making the attack, it adds an additional 3 slashing damage to the total, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. This ability encourages the Boar to use hit-and-run tactics, making it both dangerous and dynamic in combat scenarios.
