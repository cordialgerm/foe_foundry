- Thorn Dagger: This attack has a +7 to hit and can be used in melee or ranged scenarios, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 10/30 feet. A successful hit deals 1 piercing damage.
- Faerie Blessing (usable three times per day): The Pixie can target a willing creature within 30 feet, granting one of three benefits that last for one hour: truesight up to 120 feet, the effects of its Magic Resistance, or the ability to speak Sylvan.
- Faerie Curse: This action targets a creature within 30 feet that is not already cursed. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or suffer from a magical curse lasting 1 hour. The Pixie can select the curse's effect upon failure, which could blind the target, charm them, induce sleep if already charmed, or transform its head into that of a beast, making it unable to speak. The curse can be lifted in several ways, including the Pixie's actions, damage taken, or specific spells.

As a bonus action, the Pixie can use:
- Invisibility: This ability renders the Pixie and its equipment invisible until it attacks, casts a spell, becomes incapacitated, or chooses to end the effect with another bonus action, enabling it to ambush or escape with ease.
