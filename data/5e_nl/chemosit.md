The Chemosit is a medium fiend characterized by its neutral evil alignment, serving as a formidable adversary in combat. With a well-rounded offensive capability and notable resistances, the Chemosit can be a significant challenge for adventurers. This creature possesses good armor class and hit points, making it tough to defeat, while its speed allows for mobility in battle. Notably, its ability to charm and manipulate opponents using its Inviting Song can turn the tide of combat. However, the Chemosit is vulnerable to magical piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage from silvered weapons, which can exploit its defenses effectively.

The Chemosit has a strength score of 16, providing a good modifier of +3 on attack rolls and strength checks, making it strong in physical confrontations. Its dexterity is also 17, granting a +3 modifier, offering it a proficient means of avoiding attacks and acting quickly. The constitution of 18 gives it a +4 modifier, resulting in exceptional durability due to the considerable number of hit points—119 in total. The intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores, while lower than its physical stats, provide average mental capabilities for this fiend. Its saving throws are also commendable, with a +6 to strength saves, +7 to constitution saves, +5 to wisdom saves, and +5 to charisma saves, making it good at resisting various effects.

With a passive perception of 15 and darkvision that extends up to 120 feet, which allows it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, the Chemosit has a strong awareness of its surroundings. It can communicate in Abyssal, Common, and Infernal, making it versatile in interactions.

The Chemosit's special ability, Inner Light, allows it to emit a red light from its open mouth, illuminating a radius of 10 feet in bright light and an additional 10 feet in dim light without consuming any action. 

In combat, the Chemosit can employ a Multiattack action, which enables it to strike its foes with one Beak attack and two Crutch attacks. The Beak attack has a +6 to hit and deals 12 piercing damage along with an additional 7 fire damage on a hit. The Crutch attack also has a +6 to hit, inflicting 7 bludgeoning damage, and it imposes a DC 14 constitution saving throw on the target to resist being infected with the cackle fever disease.

One of the Chemosit's most dangerous abilities is its Inviting Song. This action involves the Chemosit singing a captivating melody that can charm all creatures with an intelligence of 5 or higher within 300 feet. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 15 wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. This charming effect forces targets to move toward the Chemosit, trying to get within 5 feet, avoiding any dangerous terrain. If a charmed creature takes damage or at the end of its turn succeeds on a saving throw, the charm effect ends, creating tactical opportunities for both sides.

For additional actions, the Chemosit can use its bonus action to Change Shape, allowing it to magically transform into a Small or Medium humanoid or revert back to its true fiendish form. Regardless of shape, its statistics remain consistent aside from size, but it always retains a single leg; its crutch adapts to fit its transformed state. Upon death, it reverts back to its natural fiendish form, and its crutch becomes nonmagical. This versatility adds another layer of unpredictability in encounters with the Chemosit, making it an engaging opponent for player characters.
