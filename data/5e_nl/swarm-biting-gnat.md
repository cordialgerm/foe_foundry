The Swarm of Biting Gnats is a Medium unaligned beast known for its ability to create chaos on the battlefield through numbers rather than singular strength. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is relatively weak in terms of hit points and combat durability, but its strengths lie in its special abilities and swarm tactics. The gnat swarm can effectively distract and debilitate opponents while inflicting minor piercing damage through bites. Although it has a poor constitution, its dexterity allows it to be nimble, and it can evade many types of damage. However, the swarmâ€™s low strength and reliance on numbers make it vulnerable to area-of-effect attacks and spells that can clear or harm the swarm at once.

The Swarm of Biting Gnats has an Armor Class of 13, which provides average protection against attacks. It has 16 hit points, calculated from rolling three eight-sided dice and adding three, giving it a limited ability to withstand damage. The creature's speed is 10 feet when walking, climbing, and 30 feet when flying, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat or escape when necessary. 

The attributes of the Swarm of Biting Gnats are as follows: Strength is 2 with a modifier of -4, which is very bad for any physical confrontations; Dexterity is 17 with a modifier of +3, which is good, enhancing its ability to dodge attacks; Constitution is 12 with a modifier of +1, providing an average resilience; Intelligence is 1 with a modifier of -5, making it exceptionally unintelligent; Wisdom is 10 with a modifier of +0, indicating average perception skills; and Charisma is 1 with a modifier of -5, reflecting its very bad social capabilities. The swarm has a skill in perception with a modifier of +0, which is average, making its passive perception also 10.

The swarm is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, allowing it to shrug off most forms of physical attacks. It is immune to conditions like charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned, making it exceptionally difficult for many magical or physical debuffs to affect it. 

Notable special abilities of the swarm include:

- **Blood Sense:** This ability allows the swarm to detect warm-blooded creatures within a 20-foot radius purely by scent, giving it an advantage in locating prey. 

- **Distracting Buzz:** When a non-deafened creature starts its turn in the swarm's space, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 10. Failing this save results in the creature becoming distracted by the gnat's noise, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks that use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for one minute. The affected creature can attempt to save at the end of each turn, and if successful, becomes immune to this effect for the next ten minutes. 

- **Swarm:** The swarm is capable of occupying another creature's space and is able to move through openings that can accommodate a Tiny beast. However, unlike other creatures, it cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

In terms of actions, the swarm has a melee attack called **Bites**, where it makes a weapon attack roll with a +5 to hit against a single target within its space. The biting attack deals 5 piercing damage via two four-sided dice or 2 piercing damage if the swarm has half or fewer hit points remaining. Targeted creatures must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 11. Failure results in the target being blinded for one minute. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn, and a successful save ends the effect. Alternatively, the blinded target can use an action to clear their eyes of the gnats, ending the blindness effect immediately. 

Overall, the Swarm of Biting Gnats excels in numbers providing debilitating distractions and minor damage, making it a nuisance on the field rather than a direct threat.
