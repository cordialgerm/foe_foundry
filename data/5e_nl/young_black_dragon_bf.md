With a Challenge Rating of 7, this dragon is designed to provide an engaging and dangerous encounter. While its statistics are impressive, its reliance on natural attacks and environmental factors such as its Acid Breath can leave it vulnerable during certain phases of combat.

The Young Black Dragon has a Strength score of 19 (+5), indicating a good level of physical power for melee attacks.

The Young Black Dragon possesses special abilities that enhance its combat strategy. The Acidic Vapors ability means that after it uses its Acid Breath, acid remains around it, creating a hazardous zone. Creatures within 10 feet must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of their next turn, which can cripple their effectiveness in combat. Its Amphibious trait allows it to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, making it adaptable to different scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Young Black Dragon can use Multiattack to unleash one Bite and two Claw attacks per turn. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit and reaches 10 feet to deal an average of 15 piercing damage, while its Claw attack, with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, deals approximately 11 slashing damage. The highlight of its attacks is the Acid Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability enables the dragon to exhale a potent stream of acid in a 30-foot line, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take significant damage of 49 acid damage, while successful saves result in half damage. This highly damaging area attack can shape the outcome of battles, allowing the Young Black Dragon to control space and inflict serious harm from a distance.
