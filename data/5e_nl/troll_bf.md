The troll is a formidable large giant creature known for its regenerative abilities, making it a threatening presence in any encounter. With an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, it offers decent protection. It boasts 94 hit points, allowing it to endure a significant amount of damage before being defeated. As a Challenge Rating 5 creature, it is suitable for mid-level parties, presenting a balance of risk and reward. The troll’s strengths include its exceptional Constitution modifier of +5 which bolsters its resilience, alongside its frightening regeneration ability that allows it to heal rapidly unless countered by fire or acid damage. However, it has notable weaknesses, being vulnerable to falling prone. The troll also has an average intelligence and low Charisma, which makes it less effective in social interactions. With darkvision and heightened senses, it can detect creatures in darkness effectively, thus enhancing its role as a predator.

The troll has the following ability scores: Strength +4 (very good), Dexterity +1 (average), Constitution +5 (exceptional), Intelligence -2 (very bad), Wisdom -1 (bad), and Charisma -2 (very bad). It can perceive its surroundings with a Perception score of 12, which is average, and has a Stealth score of 13, also average for a creature of its size and type. It understands the Giant language, enabling communication with other giants.

Several special abilities enhance the troll's combat prowess and survivability. Its "Giant Attributes" ability grants it resistance to being stunned, making it challenging to incapacitate during combat, while its vulnerability to the prone condition leaves it susceptible to tactics that can knock it down. The "Heightened Smell" ability boosts its Perception to 17 when detecting scents, allowing it to track foes effectively even in obscured conditions. Most notably, the troll has a "Regeneration" ability which allows it to recover 10 hit points at the start of its turn, providing it with sustainability in prolonged fights—unless it takes fire or acid damage in which case this ability will not function until its next turn. The only way to permanently defeat a troll is to bring its hit points to zero and keep it in that state without allowing it to regenerate.

In terms of actions, the troll can use an ability called "Multiattack" to make a combination of one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, allowing it to unleash a flurry of damage in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit and deals 13 piercing damage on a successful hit, while each Claw attack also has a +7 to hit, inflicting 11 piercing damage. 

Additionally, the troll has a "Ravenous Frenzy" bonus action that it can activate when it has 52 hit points or fewer. In this state, the troll can move up to half its speed towards a visible creature and make a Bite attack, recovering hit points equal to half the damage dealt. This creates a dynamic where the troll becomes increasingly dangerous as it is injured, potentially turning the tide of combat in its favor by regaining health mid-fight.
