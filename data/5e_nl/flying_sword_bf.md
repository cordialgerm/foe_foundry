The Flying Sword is a small construct that embodies a mechanical weapon, designed for both offensive capabilities and strategic combat advantages. With an armor class of 16, it possesses good durability, while its 11 hit points make it relatively fragile in prolonged encounters. This creature has a unique speed characteristic; although it cannot move on the ground, it can fly at a speed of 50 feet and remains capable of hovering. It is classified with a low challenge rating of 1/4, making it a manageable opponent for low-level adventurers. Notably, the Flying Sword has special abilities that reflect its nature as an animated weapon, including immunity to common forms of crowd control and effects that typically hinder living creatures. However, its susceptibility to antimagic means that it can be rendered inert in the presence of magical dampening fields.

The Flying Sword has the following attributes with associated modifiers: Strength +1 (average), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence -5 (very bad), Wisdom -3 (bad), and Charisma -5 (very bad). Its senses include a keen sense within a range of 60 feet, allowing it to detect features or creatures nearby. However, it cannot perceive beyond this radius, and its Perception score of 7 indicates a poor ability to notice details.

One of its special abilities, Antimagic Susceptibility, renders the Flying Sword incapacitated when it is within an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC; failure results in the sword falling unconscious for one minute. The Construct Nature ability signifies that the Flying Sword does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without fatigue. Its Construct Resilience grants it immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is also immune to exhaustion and the conditions of charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it a reliable combatant without the need for rest or recovery.

In terms of stealth, the Flying Sword has a score of 13, enabling it to be effectively hidden when motionless. Its False Appearance ability allows it to blend in as a normal sword while not flying, making it suitable for ambush tactics.

For actions, the Flying Sword can execute a melee weapon attack named Slash, where it has a +3 bonus to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it deals an average of 5 slashing damage (1d8 + 1). When its hit points are reduced to 6 or fewer, it can use its Bonus Action ability called Whirling Blade, allowing it to make a Slash attack against a target within 5 feet that it can sense. This feature helps maintain its threat even in a weakened state, providing it a last chance to defend itself or take down an opponent.
