The Swarm of Bats is a Medium swarm made up of tiny beasts, typically found in dark, cavernous environments. This creature is known for its unique ability to disrupt spellcasting with its cacophonous behavior, making it a nuisance to spellcasters in particular. While it has a relatively low Armor Class of 12 and only 14 hit points, its swarm nature allows it to occupy the same space as other creatures, creating tactical opportunities in combat. The swarm does not regain hit points, meaning it is somewhat vulnerable if sustained damage is dealt to it. Its strengths lie in its special abilities, including resistance to many types of damage and immunity to several debilitating conditions that would affect individual creatures. 

The swarm has the following attributes: Strength is -3 (very bad), Dexterity is +2 (average), Constitution is +0 (average), Intelligence is -4 (very bad), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is -3 (very bad). The effective Perception score is 11, but it can ascend to 16 when using its heightened hearing. In addition, it possesses a notable Stealth score of 14, which is considered good for sneaking up on creatures.

The Swarm of Bats features several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The "Cacophonous Swarm" ability targets spellcasters. If a creature within the swarm attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, they must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 12. If they fail, the spell is unsuccessful, leading to the expenditure of their action to cast it without using a spell slot. "Echolocation" indicates that while the swarm is deafened, it cannot use its keen sense of hearing. Additionally, "Heightened Hearing" improves the swarm's perception capabilities, providing a bonus when sensing through sound. 

The swarm can occupy the same space as other creatures and can move through any openings suitable for a Tiny bat due to its "Swarm" ability. While this allows for strategic positioning, it cannot regain hit points nor gain any temporary hit points during encounters. "Swarm Resilience" grants the bats resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, rendering them less vulnerable than standard creatures. Furthermore, they are immune to a range of conditions that include charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned, showcasing their durability in combat.

For actions, the swarm can make a "Bite" attack as a melee weapon attack, with a +4 to hit. The reach of this attack is 0 feet, meaning it only affects creatures within the swarm’s space. On a successful hit, it deals 7 piercing damage using 2d6, which reduces to 3 piercing damage using 1d6 if the swarm's hit points are at half or below. This adaptability provides the swarm with a dual damage capability based on its current health status, making it a versatile opponent in battle.
