The Crimson Mist is a Medium undead creature characterized by its chaotic evil nature. Hovering in a spectral form, it combines the traits of a vampire with mist-like qualities, making it a formidable opponent to adventurers. With an armor class of 15 and a total of 68 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage. The creature excels in dealing necrotic damage and can threaten the life of characters with blood by reducing their hit point maximum while recovering its own vitality. Although it possesses several strengths, such as immunities to various damage types and conditions, the Crimson Mist is notably vulnerable to sunlight, which can severely handicap its effectiveness in combat. 

The Crimson Mist has the following attributes: Strength 17 (plus 3 modifier, which is good), Dexterity 15 (plus 2 modifier, which is average), Constitution 18 (plus 4 modifier, which is very good), Intelligence 3 (minus 4 modifier, which is very bad), Wisdom 20 (plus 5 modifier, which is exceptional), and Charisma 18 (plus 4 modifier, which is very good). Its saving throws provide good resistance to Dexterity (plus 8), average resistance to Wisdom (plus 4), and bad resistance to Charisma (plus 2). The creature is immune to cold, necrotic, and poison damage but resistant to acid, lightning, and thunder. Additionally, it is also resistant to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, a passive perception of 11, and understands languages known as a vampire, although it cannot speak.

The Crimson Mist has several special abilities. Its "Pseudocorporeal" trait allows it to be weightless, meaning it can occupy the space of a hostile creature freely, without being hindered. The "Sanguine Feast" ability is particularly dangerous; whenever the mist deals necrotic damage to a creature with blood, it not only reduces that creature's hit point maximum by the amount of damage dealt, but also heals itself for half of that damage. This reduction lasts until the affected creature completes a long rest, and if a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to zero, it dies. The Crimson Mist also suffers from weaknesses characteristic of vampires. It cannot enter a residence without an invitation, takes 20 force damage if it ends its turn in running water, and suffers 20 radiant damage when starting its turn in sunlight, along with disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while exposed to sunlight.

In terms of actions, the Crimson Mist can use "Engulf," where it moves up to its speed, entering the space of a Medium or smaller creature. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or it will take 15 (4d6) necrotic damage and become engulfed. An engulfed creature is restrained, unable to breathe, and takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the mist's turns. The engulfed creature can attempt to escape by making a DC 14 Strength check on its turn. Success allows the creature to escape and position itself 5 feet away from the mist. Alternatively, a creature adjacent to the mist can use an action to pull an engulfed friend out, requiring a DC 14 Strength check, which also inflicts 14 (4d6) necrotic damage to the rescuer. Only one creature can be engulfed at a time, adding strategic importance to the battlefield.
