The Water Elemental is a large creature of the elemental type, embodying the essence of water. Its primary role in combat is that of a devastating melee fighter, utilizing its strength and unique abilities to control the battlefield. With a relatively high Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 114, it can withstand considerable damage. Its speed is impressive as well, with a walking speed of 30 feet and a swimming speed of 90 feet, giving it exceptional mobility in aquatic environments. However, despite its formidable presence, it possesses low intelligence and charisma, making it relatively simple-minded and less effective in social interactions. The Water Elemental is known for its damage immunities and resistances, which allow it to shrug off many attacks, but it can be hindered by cold damage.

The Water Elemental's ability scores are as follows: Strength at 18, Dexterity at 14, Constitution at 18, Intelligence at 6, Wisdom at 10, and Charisma at 6. The Strength score of 18 gives it a very good modifier of +4, making its physical attacks potent. Dexterity at 14 provides a good +2 modifier, aiding its reflexes and improving its Armor Class. A Constitution score of 18 allows it to heal and endure physical punishment very well with a +4 modifier. The Intelligence and Charisma scores are particularly low, at -2, denoting that the creature is not clever or persuasive at all, making these attributes average in effectiveness in any role that requires intellect or charm.

The elemental has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Conductive ability allows it to transfer any lightning damage it takes to other creatures sharing its space, creating potential for significant area damage if it is struck by such attacks. Fluid Form enables it to move through cramped spaces without hindrance, making it challenging for opponents to avoid its presence. Lastly, the Freeze ability penalizes its speed by 15 feet if it suffers cold damage, which adds an interesting tactical consideration for both the Water Elemental and its opponents.

In combat, the Water Elemental can make a Multiattack, performing two slam attacks in one turn. A slam attack has a +7 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 4) on a successful hit, showcasing its strong physical prowess. Additionally, the Whelm action is a particularly threatening ability. It targets all creatures within its space (all Large or smaller creatures), forcing them into a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On failure, targets become grappled and restrained, rendering them unable to breathe air until they escape the grapple. This ability can tie up multiple enemies and allows the Water Elemental to maintain its mobility, as it can move at full speed with grappled creatures within its space.
