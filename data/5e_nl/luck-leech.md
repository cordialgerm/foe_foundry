The Luck Leech is a Medium-sized fey creature marked by its neutral evil alignment, embodying a malevolent force that primarily thrives on exploiting the fortune of others. With a challenging rating of 10, this creature has notable strengths in agility, charm, and perception, making it a cunning opponent in combat. It possesses a high Armor Class of 17, allowing it to evade many attacks, and can endure significant damage due to its 150 hit points, which are calculated from 20d8 + 60. The Luck Leech's most dangerous ability is its capacity to absorb luck from nearby creatures, turning their fortuitous moments into advantages for itself. However, its reliance on other creatures' successes can be seen as a weakness, strategically vulnerable when facing opponents who are less capable of rolling high.

The Luck Leech has the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2), Dexterity is 21 (+5), Constitution is 16 (+3), Intelligence is 17 (+3), Wisdom is 14 (+2), and Charisma is 19 (+4). Its Dexterity modifier of +5 is exceptional, providing superior agility in combat. The creature is particularly effective with saving throws, boasting a +9 in Dexterity and a +6 in Wisdom, both of which are very good. For skills, it excels in deception with a +8, stands above average in perception with a +6, and is stealthy with a +9, also noted as very good. The Luck Leech is immune to necrotic damage and is unbothered by the frightened condition. Its darkvision extends to 60 feet, and it possesses a passive perception score of 16, indicating its keen senses. The creature can communicate in Common, Sylvan, and Umbral.

The Luck Leechâ€™s special abilities enhance its potency in battles. The "Leech Luck" ability allows it to gain 1 luck point whenever a creature within 60 feet rolls a 20 on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, although it cannot have more than 4 luck points at once. The "Reserve of Fortune" ability grants it 2 luck points at sunset if it has fewer than 4, and it allows rerolls on a 1 rolled for various checks, without expending luck points. The "Turn Luck" ability can be activated as a bonus action by spending 1 luck point, enabling the Luck Leech to either gain advantage on its next attack or saving throw, cast the spell Misty Step, increase the necrotic damage of its next attack by an additional 9 (2d8), or force creatures concentrating on spells nearby to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to potentially lose their concentration.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Luck Leech can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two biting arm attacks in one turn. Each Biting Arms attack has a +9 to hit and can reach a target within 5 feet, dealing 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage along with 9 (2d8) necrotic damage upon a successful hit. Furthermore, the creature can unleash "Feast of Fortune," a more powerful action that requires a recharge of 6. In this attack, each creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or suffer 27 (6d8) psychic damage, become blinded until the end of their next turn, and be cursed with falling fortunes. Successful saving throw results in reduced damage and no further effects. Notably, the Luck Leech gains 1 luck point for every creature that fails this saving throw, augmenting its already formidable abilities in battle.
