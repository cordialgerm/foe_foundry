The Adult Gold Dragon is a formidable foe in combat, recognized for its immense power and versatility. As a Huge Dragon with a Challenge Rating of 20, it boasts an impressive Armor Class of 19 and a staggering 324 hit points, allowing it to withstand significant damage. This creature excels in both melee and ranged combat, utilizing its high Strength and Charisma to deliver devastating attacks while also providing potent support to allies through spells and abilities. The dragon can fly at remarkable speeds, making it mobile on the battlefield, while its fire immunity gives it an edge against flame-based attacks. However, despite its strengths, the dragon's reliance on Charisma for its spellcasting may leave it vulnerable to certain spells that target its mental fortitude.

The dragon has saving throw proficiencies, including Dexterity at +8, Constitution at +13, Wisdom at +8, and Charisma at +13, indicating very good resilience against many effects. In addition to these traits, it possesses several skills: insight +8, perception +8, persuasion +13, and stealth +8, enhancing its ability to engage in social situations and avoid detection.

The Adult Gold Dragon has fire damage immunity, providing it significant protection from fire-based attacks. It has blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings in complete darkness. With a passive Perception of 21, it can easily detect hidden creatures. The dragon can communicate in Common and Draconic, as well as one additional language of its choice.

Among its special abilities, it has Legendary Resistance available three times per day. This ability allows the dragon to choose success when failing a saving throw, although each use causes some of its scales to melt away, creating pools of molten gold. If it exhausts this ability, its Armor Class drops to 17 until it finishes a long rest. 

Gold Dragons can bestow a bonus called Valor to creatures of their choice within 30 feet, granting a +2 bonus to saving throws and immunity to being charmed or frightened. Their innate spellcasting ability relies on their Charisma with a spell save DC of 21. They can cast spells such as bless and healing word three times per day each, as well as banishment and greater restoration, providing significant support for allies or hindering foes.

In combat, the Adult Gold Dragon uses Multiattack to strike with its bite and claws, maximizing damage output. Its bite attack has a +18 to hit and deals 32 piercing damage plus 9 fire damage. Its claw attacks also require a +18 to hit and inflict 28 slashing damage. The dragon can perform a Tail attack that deals 23 bludgeoning damage while pushing the target 10 feet away. 

While in humanoid form, it can wield a greatsword, dealing 17 slashing damage with a +18 to hit. Additionally, the Molten Spit attack allows the dragon to target a creature within 60 feet, forcing a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 27 fire damage, with the creature also subjected to an area of liquid gold causing extra fire damage if they enter or end their turn within it. 

The dragon has two breath weapon options. The Molten Breath unleashes a cone of molten gold, forcing creatures to make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in a whopping 88 fire damage and potential movement restrictions from being encased in cooling gold. The Weakening Breath forces a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, with failure imposing disadvantage on weapon attacks for a minute and requiring further saving throws to end the effect. 

For mobility and defense, the Gold Dragon can Change Shape, morphing into a humanoid or beast form while maintaining its statistics. In dragon form, it can utilize its full array of attacks, but attacks in new forms are limited to its bite and claws or a greatsword.

As for reactions, when hit by a melee attack, it has the Tail Attack option, allowing it to retaliate before the attack is fully resolved. Through the Vanguard ability, when an ally is attacked, the dragon can deflect the attack, protecting its allies from harm.

Finally, the dragon can execute legendary actions, such as a powerful Roar that forces nearby opponents to make a DC 25 Charisma saving throw to avoid being frightened. It also has a Wing Attack that pushes creatures away and allows the dragon to reposition itself, and the Fiery Reprisal, which lets the dragon use Molten Spit against its most recent assailant, showcasing its ability to respond rapidly in combat.
