The Skeleton Horde is a formidable Large undead creature that plays a versatile role in combat. With a challenge rating of 4, it can pose a significant threat to adventuring parties, particularly due to its ability to deal considerable piercing damage with both melee and ranged attacks. While it possesses an average armor class of 13 and decent hit points totalling 65, its most notable strength lies in its damage immunity to poison and its condition immunities to fatigue and poisoned states, making it resilient in battle. However, its weaknesses include vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, which might serve as a tactical advantage for characters who exploit this weakness. The Skeleton Horde can serve effectively as a frontline soldier, using coordinated attacks to overwhelm enemies.

The Skeleton Horde has the following attributes: Strength of 10, Dexterity of 14, Constitution of 14, Intelligence of 6, Wisdom of 8, and Charisma of 5. The Strength score of 10 results in an average modifier of +0, which is ineffective for directly dealing melee damage or grappling. With a Dexterity of 14, it has a good modifier of +2, enhancing its ranged attack capabilities and its ability to dodge incoming attacks. The Constitution of 14 also provides a good +2 modifier, which contributes positively to its hit points and overall durability. Intelligence at 6 (-2 modifier) indicates very bad cognitive skills, limiting its strategic decision-making. The Wisdom of 8 gives it a bad modifier of -1, reflecting poor perception and insight, while the Charisma of 5 offers a very bad -3 modifier, indicating a lack of influence or persuasiveness.

The Skeleton Horde's special ability, Undead Nature, informs players that this creature does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, making it an unyielding presence on the battlefield.

In terms of actions, the Skeleton Horde is equipped with a Shortsword and a Shortbow. The Shortsword has a melee weapon attack bonus of +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to engage close combat effectively. Upon hitting with the Shortsword, it deals 27 piercing damage (5d6 + 10), which is halved if the horde is bloodied, making the attack quite powerful under normal conditions. The Shortbow, a ranged weapon attack also with a +4 to hit, has a range of 80 feet to 320 feet for long-range shots. It similarly achieves the same damage output of 27 piercing damage (5d6 + 10) or half damage when bloodied. This dual capability of dealing damage both up close and from a distance makes the Skeleton Horde a flexible threat in various combat scenarios.
