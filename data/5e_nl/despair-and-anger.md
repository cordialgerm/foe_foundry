Despair and Anger is a powerful large celestial creature characterized by its dual natures, embodying both overwhelming sorrow and fierce rage. With a challenge rating of 10, it presents a formidable challenge in combat, dealing both radiant and necrotic damage effectively, while also having a number of resistances and immunities that protect it from various conditions. Its ability to fly grants it tactical advantages in battle, enabling it to engage both melee and ranged opponents. Notable strengths include high armor class and hit points, making it a durable adversary, while its ability to switch between two powerful forms grants it dynamic playstyles during encounters. However, its dependency on maintaining these forms may be considered a strategic weakness if not managed properly.

The creature has an armor class of 16, reflecting good defensive capabilities, and possesses 161 hit points derived from rolling 17 ten-sided dice plus an additional 68 hit points, demonstrating its robustness in combat. The creature can walk at a speed of 40 feet and can also fly at the same speed, giving it good mobility on the battlefield. The creature has a very good Strength of 19, granting a +4 modifier, and a good Dexterity of 16, with a +3 modifier, which aids in both attacks and acrobatics. Its Constitution of 18 provides a +4 modifier, contributing to its high hit points and durability. Intelligence is average at 10, presenting no bonuses or penalties. Wisdom is also good at 16 with a +3 modifier, useful for perception checks and saving throws, while Charisma is exceptional at 19, resulting in a +4 modifier critical for spellcasting and influence over others.

Despair and Anger has advantageous saving throws in Wisdom (+7) and Charisma (+8), making it resistant to mind-affecting effects. It is skilled in perception, allowing it to notice hidden threats with a +3 bonus. The creature benefits from damage resistances against necrotic and radiant damage types, as well as being immune to the blinded, charmed, frightened, prone, and stunned conditions. It possesses truesight up to 60 feet, allowing it to see all creatures and objects as they truly are, and it understands all languages with telepathy extending up to 120 feet.

In terms of special abilities, "Consumed by Rage" provides advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks when in the Anger aspect, enhancing its physical prowess. "Magic Resistance" allows it to roll advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it quite difficult to disable through arcane means. Likewise, "Ruled by Sorrow" grants advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened when in the Despair aspect.

For its actions, Despair and Anger can make a "Multiattack," choosing to unleash either three Blazing Fists, three Shadow Tendrils, or three Divine Bolts. The "Blazing Fist" attack, exclusive to the Anger aspect, allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, dealing 8 points of bludgeoning damage alongside 7 points each of fire and radiant damage on a hit. The "Shadow Tendril" is a melee attack from the Despair aspect that can grapple the target, dealing substantial bludgeoning damage plus necrotic damage, while restraining the target. Whenever a creature is grappled, it takes additional necrotic damage each turn, allowing Despair and Anger to regain health equal to half of the necrotic damage dealt.

The "Divine Bolt" is a ranged spell attack with a +8 to hit that inflicts either necrotic or radiant damage, depending on the active aspect being used. "Burning Rage" is a powerful area effect attack available only when in the Anger aspect, dealing significant fire and radiant damage to all creatures within a 30-foot radius, while allowing a Dexterity saving throw for half damage. Conversely, "Despairing Rejection" in the Despair aspect targets up to three creatures, dealing both cold and psychic damage while forcing them to move away from it, providing a strategic retreat that does not provoke opportunity attacks. 

The creature also has a bonus action called "Change Aspect," allowing it to switch between its forms, which can strategically impact its battlefield presence and versatility. When a creature is grappled by Despair, it is immediately released if Anger is activated, allowing for tactical repositioning as needed.
