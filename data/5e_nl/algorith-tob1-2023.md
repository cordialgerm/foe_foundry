The Algorith is a formidable medium-sized construct known for its role as a powerful entity in combat, capable of dealing substantial force damage and manipulating spells. With its exceptional armor class of 18 and robust hit points totaling 153, it stands as a resilient opponent. The Algorith's challenge rating of 10 indicates that it is a significant threat for adventuring parties, offering them 5,900 experience points upon defeat. This construct excels in strategic superiority due to its immunity to several conditions and various damage resistances. However, its reliance on physical power and potential vulnerabilities to certain attacks makes it crucial for players to approach it with a strong tactical focus.

The Algorith has the following ability scores: Strength at 21 (+5), Dexterity at 14 (+2), Constitution at 19 (+4), Intelligence at 13 (+1), Wisdom at 16 (+3), and Charisma at 18 (+4). The high strength and constitution provide it with exceptional physical prowess and durability, while its charisma allows it to effectively utilize its spellcasting abilities. The saving throws are as follows: Dexterity +6 (good), Constitution +8 (very good), Wisdom +7 (good), and Charisma +8 (very good). The Algorith possesses a range of skills including Athletics +9 (very good), Insight +7 (good), Investigation +5 (average), and Perception +7 (good). It is immune to poison damage and resists acid, cold, and lightning damage. Additionally, it cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, making it a challenging opponent in many scenarios. Its sensory capabilities include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 17, allowing it effective spatial awareness.

The Algorith has some notable special abilities. Its Construct Nature enables it to function without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep. The Immutable Form ability grants it immunity to any spell or effect that would alter its physical state.

In terms of actions, the Algorith can perform the Logic Razor, a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, covering a 5-foot reach that causes 21 (3d10 + 5) force damage on a successful hit. The Cone of Negation, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the Algorith to project a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures within this area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, with a failed save resulting in 33 (6d10) force damage and the cancellation of any spells of 4th level or lower affecting them, similar to being targeted by a dispel magic spell. Successful savers take half the damage and maintain their spells.

Moreover, the Algorith can utilize the Reality Bomb ability up to five times a day. By throwing a tiny rune of law within 100 feet, it triggers an explosion upon impact. Creatures within a 30-foot radius must also succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw; failing results in 27 (5d10) force damage and being stunned until the end of their next turn. Successful saves only incur half damage and avoid the stunning effect.

The Algorith also possesses spellcasting capabilities, utilizing Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 16. It can cast the following spells at will: bless, detect magic, dimension door, and dispel magic. In addition, it has access to commune and wall of force, which can each be cast once per day. These spells enhance its tactical options in combat, enabling it to support allies and control the battlefield effectively. The combination of its abilities, spells, and resistances makes the Algorith a challenging and versatile opponent that requires careful planning to defeat.
