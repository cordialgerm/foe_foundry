The Tar Golem is a Medium Construct creature that embodies the raw, sticky nature of tar, serving as a formidable adversary in combat. Its primary strengths lie in its impressive resilience, with an Armor Class of 14 derived from natural armor and robust Hit Points totaling 119, which provides substantial durability. The golem is well-equipped for melee engagements with strong Slam attack capabilities, but its maneuverability is limited by a Dexterity score of 9, making it less effective in dexterous actions. A notable downside is its vulnerability to cold damage, while it boasts immunities to fire, poison, and psychic damage, as well as being impervious to non-magical physical attacks that are not made with adamantine weapons. Its construction allows it to function without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep, enhancing its effectiveness as a relentless combatant.

The Tar Golem has a Strength score of 18 (+4), giving it a good modifier for physical attacks, while its Dexterity score of 9 (-1) results in a bad modifier, hindering its agility. Constitution is exceptional with a score of 18 (+4), making it resilient to effects requiring Constitution saves. However, it has a very bad Intelligence score of 7 (-2), coupled with poor Charisma, indicating a lack of social skills or cognitive ability. Its Wisdom is average at 10 (+0), allowing for basic perception but nothing extraordinary.

In terms of abilities, the Tar Golem has several distinctive traits. The Construct Nature ability allows it to function without basic needs such as air and sleep, which is very advantageous in prolonged confrontations. It possesses a Fire Hazard ability: when it takes fire damage, it ignites and continues to burn until it is cooled or submerged in water, dealing fire damage to those who come into contact with it. The Hardened Tar ability creates an interesting dynamic, as if the golem is brought to 0 hit points by cold damage, it will become paralyzed, but further fire damage can allow it to regain hit points. Its Immutable Form grants it an exceptional resistance to spells that alter its form. With Magic Resistance, the golem enjoys advantage on saving throws against magical effects, enhancing its durability against spellcasters.

Additionally, its weapon attacks are treated as magical, which is important for overcoming resistance that certain creatures may have against non-magical attacks. When burning, the golem emits Noxious Smoke: creatures starting their turn within 5 feet must make a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned, adding a layer of area denial to its combat presence. The Spider Climb ability allows it to traverse difficult surfaces and even ceilings without any checks, giving it greater flexibility in combat and environmental maneuverability.

In combat scenarios, the Tar Golem can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Slam attacks. Each Slam attack has a +7 to hit and deals significant bludgeoning damage, averaging 13 (2d8+4) per hit, making it a threat in direct confrontations. Additionally, the golem can utilize bonus actions such as Quench to extinguish its flames and neutralize its Fire Hazard effect or Draw Flames to absorb nearby non-magical fire, further activating its Fire Hazard mechanic.

Overall, the Tar Golem presents a unique combination of melee threat, area control through its fire-related abilities, and formidable resistances that require strategic thinking from any party looking to engage it in battle.
