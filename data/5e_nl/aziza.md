Aziza is a Tiny chaotic good Fey creature that plays a versatile role in encounters, often blending combat with supportive and confusing abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, the Aziza has an Armor Class of 15 and 21 Hit Points, making it fairly resilient for its size but still vulnerable to focused attacks. Its strengths lie in high Dexterity, allowing for agile movements, and several magical abilities to influence the battlefield. While its physical strength is lacking, the Aziza compensates with agility, intelligence, and spellcasting capabilities. It is notable for its ability to communicate with frogs and toads, which may lend itself to unique role-playing opportunities in appropriate settings.

The Aziza has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 8 (with a modifier of -1, which is considered very bad)
- Dexterity: 18 (with a modifier of +4, which is regarded as exceptional)
- Constitution: 13 (with a modifier of +1, deemed average)
- Intelligence: 10 (modifier of +0, considered average)
- Wisdom: 14 (modifier of +2, defined as good)
- Charisma: 12 (modifier of +1, also average)

The Aziza possesses the skill of Perception with a modifier of +2, allowing it to notice details well, along with passive Perception of 14, which is good for spotting hidden creatures. It can communicate in the Sylvan language.

One of its special abilities is "Speak with Frogs and Toads," enabling the Aziza to converse with these creatures as if they shared a language, potentially leading to advantageous interactions in certain environments.

In terms of actions, the Aziza can use a "Thorn Dagger," which allows for a melee or ranged attack. The attack rolls a +6 to hit and deals 6 piercing damage on a successful hit, influenced by its high Dexterity modifier.

For ranged combat, the Aziza can employ a "Shortbow," also with an attack bonus of +6 to hit. This attack has a longer range and deals 7 piercing damage. Additionally, the target of this attack must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute, which can create significant challenges for affected foes.

The "Befuddle" action allows the Aziza to confuse a creature within 30 feet, compelling it to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12). If the target fails, it experiences effects similar to being confused, which can greatly disrupt an enemy's actions until the end of its next turn.

As a spellcaster, the Aziza casts spells using its Wisdom with a spell save DC of 12. It can cast at will the spells "Druidcraft," which lets it create minor magical effects, and "Guidance," which grants a target an additional d4 to its next ability check. Once per day, it can also cast "Animal Messenger," which allows it to send a small animal with a message, and "Bless," which allows it to bolster allies' attack rolls and saving throws.

For defense, the Aziza has a reaction called "Dazzling Glow." When targeted by a melee attack, its skin glows brightly, causing the attacker to have disadvantage on their attack roll, making it harder for enemies to hit it effectively.
