The Gbahali is a formidable Huge Beast characterized by its impressive physical prowess and adaptability in natural environments. With a solid Armor Class of 15 afforded by its natural armor and substantial Hit Points totaling 126, it can withstand considerable punishment in battle. This creature is agile, with a movement speed of 50 feet, allowing it to close distances quickly. However, it is unaligned, making it primarily driven by instinct rather than moral considerations. As a Challenge Rating 6 creature, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. Though it has a low Intelligence score of 2, indicating very bad cognitive capabilities, its Strength at 19 reflects an exceptionally strong physical presence, while its Dexterity and Constitution scores of 14 and 19 respectively suggest good agility and durability. Notably, the Gbahali excels in stealth, benefiting from its unique ability to camouflage seamlessly into its surroundings.

The Gbahali’s attributes are as follows: its Strength is 19, providing a +4 modifier which reflects exceptional effectiveness in physical attacks. Its Dexterity is 14, giving it a +2 modifier for average agility. The creature has a Constitution of 19, which also translates to a +4 modifier, contributing to its very good resilience. The Intelligence score of 2 results in a -4 modifier, indicating very bad mental capacity. With a Wisdom of 13, it has a +1 modifier, which is average, and its Charisma of 7 leads to a -2 modifier, denoting a bad presence.

In terms of skills, the Gbahali has a Perception score of +4, enabling it to notice details more effectively, and a Stealth score of +8, which allows it to hide remarkably well. With a passive Perception of 14, it can detect hidden threats with good proficiency. The Gbahali does not communicate verbally, lacking any known languages.

The Gbahali possesses a special ability called Shifting Camouflage, which allows its hide to blend into its surroundings effectively. This ability provides the creature with advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made when trying to hide in nonmagical, natural terrain, enhancing its capabilities in ambush scenarios.

In combat, the Gbahali can utilize the Multiattack action, allowing it to strike multiple times in a turn. Specifically, it makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 15 piercing damage on a hit (2d10 + 4). If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled, requiring an escape DC of 15. While grappled, the target is restrained, limiting their movement and actions, and preventing the Gbahali from biting another target. The Claw attack also has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and deals 13 slashing damage on a hit (2d8 + 4), presenting a significant threat in close-range combat.
