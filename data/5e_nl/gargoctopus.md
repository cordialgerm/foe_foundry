The Gargoctopus is a large monstrosity that serves as a formidable opponent in underwater or aquatic combat scenarios. With a natural armor class of 13, it possesses a decent defense, while its substantial hit points of 104, calculated from 16d10 plus 16, indicates that it can withstand significant damage before being taken down. The creature is capable of climbing and swimming effectively, with a speed of 20 feet for climbing, 40 feet for swimming, and 40 feet for walking. The Gargoctopus has a challenge rating of 5, which suggests it would provide a challenging encounter for a party of mid-level adventurers. Notable for its strong strength attribute of 18, the Gargoctopus can deal significant melee damage while also exhibiting remarkable intelligence with a score of 19, enabling it to be cunning in battle. Its weaknesses may lie in its moderate Dexterity, Constitution, and lack of ranged capabilities, which could be exploited by quicker opponents.

The creature possesses six primary attributes, with the following values: Strength at 18 (+4, exceptional), Dexterity at 13 (+1, average), Constitution at 12 (+1, average), Intelligence at 19 (+4, exceptional), Wisdom at 16 (+3, good), and Charisma at 14 (+2, good). It also has several skills that emphasize its capabilities, including history and investigation at +7 (very good), perception at +6 (good), and stealth at +7 (very good). The Gargoctopus can detect light and movement effectively due to its darkvision which allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, combined with a passive Perception score of 16, showcasing its awareness in the environment. It can communicate telepathically within a range of 100 feet.

The Gargoctopus has special abilities that enhance its versatility in combat. Its amphibious nature allows it to breathe both air and water, giving it an advantage in aquatic settings. The shifting camouflage ability grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, making it an adept ambush predator. Additionally, with the spider climb ability, it can traverse difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without difficulty.

In terms of actions, the Gargoctopus can attack multiple times due to its multiattack feature, which lets it make four tentacle attacks or one bite attack followed by three tentacle attacks in a single turn. Its bite attack benefits from a +7 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage on a hit. The tentacle attack, also at +7 to hit with a reach of 15 feet, deals 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it becomes grappled, requiring an escape DC of 15, rendering it restrained. The Gargoctopus can maintain its grip on multiple creatures simultaneously, allowing it to overpower and control opponents.

One of its notable actions is Fling, which allows the Gargoctopus to hurl a grappled creature up to 20 feet in a random direction, knocking it prone. If the target strikes a solid surface, it suffers 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. Should the thrown creature hit another target, the second target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage. Additionally, it has a Tentacle Slam attack that requires recharge on a roll of 5 or 6; this attacks all creatures grappled, requiring them to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and a stun effect until the Gargoctopus' next turn, while success results in half damage without the stun. 

Finally, the Gargoctopus can unleash its Ink Cloud, which creates a heavily obscured area of darkness with a radius of 20 feet, complicating vision for anyone in or passing through it. Until the Gargoctopus' next turn, visibility is severely limited and if the creature is underwater, it can use the Dash action as a bonus action immediately thereafter, enhancing its mobility.
