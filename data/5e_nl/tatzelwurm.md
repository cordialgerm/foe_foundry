The Tatzelwurm is a medium-sized dragon with a neutral evil alignment, known for its cunning and ferocity in combat. With a formidable Armor Class of 15 and 120 hit points, this creature proves to be a resilient foe. It can deal significant damage with its piercing and poison attacks, making it particularly dangerous in melee range. Its climbing ability of 30 feet enhances its mobility, allowing it to maneuver effectively in various terrains. While it has decent physical attributes, notably a Strength score of 17 (+3) and Constitution score of 16 (+3), its intelligence is quite low with a score of 5 (-3), which limits its tactical thinking. The Tatzelwurm excels in creating area denial through its poisonous attacks but lacks versatility in spells or ranged capabilities.

The Tatzelwurm's attributes are as follows: Strength 17 (+3, which is good), Dexterity 14 (+2, which is average), Constitution 16 (+3, which is good), Intelligence 5 (-3, which is very bad), Wisdom 12 (+1, which is average), and Charisma 11 (+0, which is average). It has saving throw bonuses of +5 for Dexterity, +6 for Constitution, and +4 for Wisdom, which indicate good resistance to physical attacks and effects but average resilience to mental ones. It possesses skills in perception with a +1 modifier, which is average. The Tatzelwurm is immune to poison damage, making it exceptionally resilient to poison-based attacks, and it cannot be poisoned or knocked prone. Its senses include blindsight out to 10 feet and darkvision to 60 feet, with a passive Perception of 14, showing that it can perceive its surroundings fairly well in low light conditions.

The Tatzelwurm has several special abilities that add layers of threat in combat. Its Poisonous Blood ability triggers when it takes piercing or slashing damage, forcing nearby creatures to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 5 (2d4) poison damage. Additionally, if a creature consumes the Tatzelwurm's flesh, they must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The Pounce ability allows the Tatzelwurm to knock a target prone if it moves at least 20 feet straight toward it and successfully hits with a claw attack. If a target is knocked prone, the Tatzelwurm can then use its bonus action to make a bite attack.

In terms of actions, the Tatzelwurm can perform a Multiattack, which includes one Bite and two Claw attacks on its turn. Its Bite attack has a +6 to hit and deals 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage, along with 5 (2d4) poison damage, making it a potent single-target attack. The Claw attack also has a +6 to hit but deals 6 (1d4+3) slashing damage, which is less significant but can still contribute to its overall damage output. The Poisonous Breath ability, which requires a recharge of 6, allows the Tatzelwurm to exhale a 15-foot cone of poisonous vapor. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failure and becoming poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can re-save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect on itself.

It also has legendary actions that further enhance its combat prowess. The Move action allows the Tatzelwurm to reposition itself up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. The Angry Hiss ability lets it instill fear in creatures within a 30-foot radius, potentially frightening them until the end of their next turn, on a failed DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. The Tail Slap legendary action allows it to make a sweeping attack that knocks those within 10 feet prone on a failed DC 14 Strength saving throw. With these abilities and actions, the Tatzelwurm poses a formidable challenge to any adventurers crossing its path.
