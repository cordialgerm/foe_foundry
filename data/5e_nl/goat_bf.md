The Goat is a medium-sized beast characterized by its moderate physical attributes and swift movements. With an Armor Class of 10 and 8 Hit Points, it is not particularly resilient, making it vulnerable in combat. The Goat has a movement speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver quickly across the battlefield. This creature is rated with a Challenge Rating of 0, indicating that it poses minimal threat in encounters. While it has a respectable Strength score of +1, its other attributes are significantly lower, with an Intelligence of -4 and a Charisma of -3, rendering it not very clever or charming. The Goat benefits from its charging ability, which can add extra damage and potentially knock down opponents, showcasing its strength as a combatant despite its overall frailty.

The Goat's attributes include: 
- Strength: +1 (good, reflecting its capability to exert force)
- Dexterity: +0 (average, indicating a basic level of agility)
- Constitution: +0 (average, suggesting limited endurance)
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad, meaning it is very simple-minded)
- Wisdom: +0 (average, showing no particular insight)
- Charisma: -3 (bad, indicating a lack of personal magnetism)

The Goat has a Perception score of 10 and a Stealth score of 10, both of which are average. It has no special languages or inherent senses beyond this.

The Goat's special ability, Charge, allows it to deal extra damage when it moves at least 20 feet straight towards a target and successfully hits with its Ram attack in the same turn. In this case, the target will take an additional 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage and, if it is another creature, must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. This ability adds a tactical element to encounters, allowing the Goat to potentially disrupt opponents.

In terms of actions, the Goat can perform a Ram attack, which requires it to make a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit against a target within 5 feet. If the attack is successful, it inflicts 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage. Although the Goat lacks powerful offensive capabilities, its ability to charge and the potential to knock opponents down can make it a useful ally or a surprisingly effective foe in specific situations.
