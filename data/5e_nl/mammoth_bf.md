The mammoth is a huge beast characterized by its formidable physical presence and powerful offensive capabilities. With an Armor Class of 13, it has average defensive capability, but its 133 hit points provide it significant durability in combat, allowing it to absorb a considerable amount of damage before being defeated. The mammoth is primarily a melee attacker, boasting a Challenge Rating of 6 which makes it a challenging foe for lower-level adventurers. It has an exceptional Strength value of +6, giving it powerful attacks, but its Dexterity is poor at -1, making it less agile and prone to difficulty with dexterity-based actions or avoiding area effects. Notable abilities include its capacity to trample foes, a powerful multiattack mechanism, and unique grappling capabilities, which provide it with various tactical options in battle.

The mammoth has the following attributes: 
- Strength: +6 (exceptional)
- Dexterity: -1 (bad)
- Constitution: +5 (very good)
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +0 (average)
- Charisma: -2 (bad)

For senses, the mammoth relies on perception with a score of 13, which is average, and has a stealth score of 9, indicating it is very poor in stealthy situations. The creature does not possess the ability to communicate in any language.

One of the mammoth's special abilities is called Trampling Charge. This ability allows the mammoth to gain a significant advantage in combat. If it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and successfully hits it with a Gore attack in the same turn, the target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 17. Failure results in the target being knocked prone, allowing the mammoth to follow up with a Stomp attack as a bonus action. This ability emphasizes the mammoth's power and can drastically alter the flow of combat by incapacitating opponents.

In terms of actions, the mammoth can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Gore attacks. The Gore attack itself is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. If it successfully hits a target, the attack deals significant damage of 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage. The Stomp attack can only be made against creatures that are prone with a similar +9 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. Both attacks highlight the mammothâ€™s devastating melee prowess.

For bonus actions, the mammoth can utilize Trunk Grab, enabling it to grab one Large or smaller creature within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against a DC of 17 or become grappled, restraining it. The escape DC for this grapple is also 17. Until the grapple ends, the mammoth cannot grab another creature, which allows it to control the battlefield effectively but limits its versatility in grappling multiple foes at once. 

Overall, the mammoth is a powerful beast that excels in direct confrontations, utilizing its massive size and strength to dominate opponents on the battlefield.
