The Yali is a medium-sized construct that serves as a formidable opponent in combat due to its impressive speed and powerful physical attacks. With a solid Armor Class of 15, it is relatively difficult to hit. Its hit points total 51, allowing it to absorb damage effectively. The Yali is characterized by its high Strength score of 20, which grants it exceptional melee capabilities, as well as an above-average Constitution of 18, providing it with a robust endurance in battle. Although it has low Intelligence, limiting its strategic capabilities, its Dexterity of 14 ensures it can avoid some attacks. The Yali is immune to poison and psychic damage and possesses several unique abilities that enhance its combat prowess. Its main weaknesses lie in its lack of versatility and reliance on physical attacks.

The Yali's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 20 (+5), very good modifier for attacking and grappling.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2), good for dexterity saving throws and some basic maneuvers.
- Constitution: 18 (+4), very good, providing excellent resilience and hit points.
- Intelligence: 7 (-2), very bad modifier, limiting tactical options.
- Wisdom: 14 (+2), good, enhancing perception and saving against effects that target this ability.
- Charisma: 12 (+1), average, providing some effectiveness in interactions but not significant.

The Yali has advantages in saving throws with a +4 modifier for Dexterity and Wisdom, which indicates good defenses against effects that require these attributes. It has a passive perception of 16, making it competent at noticing hidden creatures and traps.

The Yali's special abilities include:
- Construct Nature: The Yali does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, giving it exceptional utility in situations where sustenance is a concern.
- False Appearance: While motionless, the Yali resembles an ordinary statue, allowing it to be stealthy and unexpected.
- Flinging Pounce: If the Yali moves 20 feet directly toward a Large or smaller creature and successfully hits with its tusk attack, it can hurl the target up to 15 feet in a random direction, knocking them prone. The target can attempt a Strength saving throw (DC 12) to negate being thrown and knocked prone. If thrown, for every 10 feet they are sent flying, they take 3 points of bludgeoning damage. Additionally, if the thrown target collides with another creature, that creature also takes damage and may attempt to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 12) to avoid being knocked prone.
- Standing Leap: The Yali has a remarkable jumping ability, with long jumps up to 40 feet and high jumps up to 20 feet with or without a running start, which can be utilized both in combat and exploration.

In combat, the Yali uses actions such as:
- Multiattack: The Yali can make one tusk attack and one claw attack in a single turn, enhancing its damage output.
- Tusk: It performs a melee weapon attack with a +7 modifier to hit, dealing an average of 8 piercing damage with each successful hit.
- Claw: Similar to its tusk, the claw attack also has a +7 to hit and deals 7 slashing damage, providing additional options in close combat.
- Trumpeting Blast (Recharge 5-6): This special ability allows the Yali to unleash a thunderous sound in a 15-foot cone, dealing a total of 10 thunder damage (4d4) to all creatures within the area. Creatures can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 12) to halve the damage and avoid becoming deafened for one minute. A deafened creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to end the effect.

Overall, the Yali is a powerful construct that excels in physical combat and mobility while lacking in strategic complexity, making it a straightforward yet dangerous opponent for adventurers.
