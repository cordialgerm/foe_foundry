One of the Giant Boar's notable abilities is called Relentless. This special ability can be used once per day, and it allows the boar to endure a potentially fatal blow. When the Giant Boar takes 10 or fewer points of damage that would otherwise reduce its hit points to 0, it drops to 1 hit point instead, potentially allowing it to continue fighting even after sustaining a critical hit.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Giant Boar primarily uses its Tusk attack. This melee weapon attack is made with a +5 to hit, which is a good modifier, enabling it to successfully strike targets within reach. The attack has a range of 5 feet and inflicts a base of 10 slashing damage (2d6+3) upon a successful hit. If the Giant Boar charges at least 20 feet straight towards its target before attacking, it deals an additional 7 slashing damage (2d6) and forces the target to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. A target that fails the saving throw falls prone, making it easier for the Giant Boar to attack again on subsequent turns.

Overall, the Giant Boar serves as a challenging adversary in combat, leveraging its strong physical abilities and unique resilience to pose a significant threat to parties of adventurers who encounter it.
