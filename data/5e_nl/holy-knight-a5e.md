The Holy Knight has specific special abilities and actions that enhance its combat effectiveness:
- **Aura of Courage**: Allies within 10 feet of the knight are immune to being frightened while the knight is conscious, providing a very good support mechanism to maintain morale in the face of fear.
- **Multiattack**: This knight can attack twice with its greatsword in a single turn, allowing for significant damage output.
- **Greatsword**: With a melee weapon attack bonus of +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, this attack deals 11 slashing damage on a hit, along with an additional 5 radiant damage, which can affect creatures vulnerable to radiant damage.
- **Lance (Mounted Only)**: This attack has a +6 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. If the knight charges at least 20 feet towards the target before the attack, the damage increases to 22 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone. However, its effectiveness is diminished when attacking targets within 5 feet due to disadvantage.
- **Lay On Hands (1/Day)**: The knight can restore 30 hit points to a willing creature or itself as an action, making it a vital healing ability in crucial moments.
- **Knightly Inspiration (1/Day)**: By inspiring allies within 30 feet who can hear and understand it, the knight grants them an expertise die (1d4) on attack rolls and saving throws for one minute. This ability cannot be used on the knight itself and can significantly enhance the performance of allies in combat by providing additional probabilities of success.

Overall, the Holy Knight stands as a powerful ally and a fearsome opponent, combining strong physical abilities with valuable support capabilities, making it a desirable addition to any party or a daunting challenge for adventurers.
