The Ghost is a Medium Undead creature, known for its ethereal presence and haunting abilities. With an Armor Class of 11, it possesses moderate defenses, but its low HP of 58, derived from 13d8, indicates that it can be vulnerable if hit enough times. Ghosts fly at a speed of 40 feet, allowing them to maneuver easily in combat. They are rated with a Challenge Rating of 4, making them moderately challenging opponents for adventurers, worth 1,100 XP upon defeat. Ghosts are primarily characterized by their incorporeal nature, allowing them to phase through physical entities, making them harder to hit, especially with nonmagical attacks.

The Ghost has the following ability scores: Strength is 8, which is very bad for physical combat, Dexterity is 12 (good for avoiding attacks), Constitution is 10 (average), Intelligence is 10 (average), Wisdom is 12 (good for saving throws), and Charisma is 16 (+3), making it exceptional at influencing creatures and using abilities that rely on Charisma. 

In terms of defenses, the Ghost has immunities to cold, necrotic, and poison damage, as well as resistance to acid, fire, lightning, thunder damage, and damage from nonmagical weapons. It is immune to a wide range of conditions, including charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and restrained. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 11, along with the ability to communicate in the languages it knew in life.

Special abilities enhance the Ghost's role in combat and exploration. Ethereal Sight grants it the capacity to see into both the Material and Ethereal Planes. Its Incorporeal trait allows it to pass through creatures and objects but incurs 5 force damage if it ends its turn within an object. The Undead Nature trait means it does not need air or sleep, significantly affecting long-term encounters. The Unquiet Spirit ability ensures that if defeated, the Ghost can return within 24 hours unless specific conditions are met to put it to rest.

In terms of actions, the Ghost can make a Withering Touch melee weapon attack which has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 17 necrotic damage and, if the target is frightened, the victim is magically aged by a number of years determined by rolling 1d4 multiplied by 10; this aging can be reversed with the greater restoration spell. The Ethereal Jaunt allows the Ghost to shift between the Material and Ethereal Planes, providing tactical movement advantages. 

The Horrifying Visage action forces each non-undead creature within 60 feet that can see the Ghost to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is frightened for one minute, with the opportunity to repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn to end the effect. If a creature succeeds or recovers from the frightened condition, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours.

The Ghost can use the Possession ability (with a recharge time of 6) to attempt to possess a humanoid within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, or it will be rendered unconscious as the Ghost takes control of its body. The possessed creature gains immunity to being charmed and frightened, while the Ghost retains its mental abilities but uses the possessed creature’s physical statistics. The possession lasts for 24 hours, until the target drops to 0 hit points, until the Ghost ends the possession with a bonus action, or under certain magical effects. The Ghost reappears nearby when the possession ends. 

As a reaction, if the Ghost takes damage, it can trigger its Horrifying Visage ability to attempt to frighten nearby foes. This adds a level of tactical complexity to its engagement, allowing it to respond to threats while also maintaining control over the battlefield dynamics.
