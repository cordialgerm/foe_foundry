The Stone Giant is a formidable foe characterized by its immense size and strength. With a challenge rating of 7, it serves as a powerful opponent in combat encounters. Stone Giants possess a high Armor Class of 17 and a substantial hit point pool of 156, making them difficult to defeat in battle. Their natural armor and impressive physical attributes enable them to deal significant damage, with their unarmed strikes and rock attacks being particularly devastating. However, they exhibit some vulnerabilities, particularly to being knocked prone, which can hinder their combat effectiveness. Their strong ability scores, especially in Constitution and Strength, showcase their resilience and physical prowess, making them tough adversaries to face.

The Stone Giant has the following attributes: Strength +6 (exceptional), Dexterity +5 (very good), Constitution +8 (exceptional), Intelligence +0 (average), Wisdom +4 (good), and Charisma -1 (bad). Their notable stats contribute to effective melee attacks and high hit points, allowing them to endure prolonged battles.

The Stone Giant possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Giant Attributes provide resistance to the stunned condition, making it difficult to incapacitate, though it is vulnerable to being knocked prone. The Stone Camouflage ability allows it to excel in rocky terrain, increasing its stealth capabilities significantly in such environments.

In combat, the Stone Giant can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two melee attacks either with its Stony Fist or with rocks. The Stony Fist attack has a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 24 damage (4d8 + 6) upon a successful hit. Additionally, if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it can be grappled, posing a significant threat. The Rock attack is a ranged weapon attack with a +9 to hit and a range of 60/240 feet, dealing 28 damage (4d10 + 6). If the rock hits a creature, that target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

The Stone Giant also has a bonus action called Wrestle, which allows it to perform different wrestling maneuvers against a creature it is grappling. Options include Armbar, causing disadvantage on attack and escape rolls; Chinlock, which prevents the target from speaking and casting spells; Takedown, knocking a creature prone and restraining them; and Throw, which can throw the target up to 30 feet, dealing additional damage if they hit a solid surface or another creature.

For defense, the Stone Giant features the Missile Deflection reaction, which lets it add 3 to its Armor Class against ranged attacks. If an attack misses its target, the Giant can catch the missile and retaliate by throwing it back at the attacker, using its normal ranged weapon attack bonus and damage.

Overall, the Stone Giant is a well-rounded melee combatant with the ability to control the battlefield. Its unique abilities and high damage potential make it a threat that players must approach carefully.
