The Bronze Dragon Wyrmling is a young and agile dragon classified as a Medium creature, notable for its combination of aquatic and aerial mobility. With a robust Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor and a total of 51 hit points, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers as reflected by its Challenge Rating of 2. The dragon exhibits good physical abilities with an above-average Strength score of +3 and a very good Constitution score of +4, making it resilient in combat. However, its Intelligence of +1 and Wisdom of +2 indicate that it's not particularly clever or perceptive for a dragon. Overall, the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling excels in combat and mobility but lacks some of the higher intellectual capabilities of older dragons.

In terms of attributes, the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling possesses a Strength of +3 (good), Dexterity of +2 (average), Constitution of +4 (very good), Intelligence of +1 (bad), Wisdom of +2 (average), and Charisma of +4 (very good). Its senses include darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a keen sense of 10 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings effectively, while a Perception score of 14 indicates a good ability to notice details. With Stealth at 12, it has an average capacity for sneaking around. The dragon communicates in Draconic.

The Bronze Dragon Wyrmling has special abilities that enhance its adaptability and offense. The Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, which provides versatility in different environments. Its Pounce ability enables it to perform a powerful attack move; if the dragon moves at least 15 feet directly towards a creature and successfully hits with a Claw attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 13) or be knocked prone. If the target is incapacitated by being prone, the dragon can follow up with a bonus action Claw attack.

For its actions, the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling can make a Multiattack, including one Bite and one Claw attack. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit and deals 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage, while the Claw attack also has a +5 to hit and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage. 

In terms of powerful breath attacks, the dragon has two options. The Lightning Breath can be used upon rolling a recharge of 5 to 6, where it exhales lightning in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 12), taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failure, and half damage on a success. The Repulsion Breath, which recharges on a roll of 6, allows the dragon to exhale a repulsion energy in a 15-foot cone; any creature in that area must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 12) or be pushed up to 5 feet away from the dragon. These breath abilities are useful for controlling the battlefield and dealing significant damage to multiple opponents.
