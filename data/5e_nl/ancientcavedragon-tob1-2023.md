The Ancient Cave Dragon is a formidable and dangerous creature that embodies a sinister presence with its neutral evil alignment. This gargantuan dragon boasts exceptional attributes that make it a prime obstacle for any adventurer. With a robust defense featuring an Armor Class of 20 due to its natural armor, and a staggering pool of 507 hit points, it can withstand a great deal of punishment. Its challenge rating of 25 signifies that it is a significant threat in any campaign, offering 75,000 experience points upon defeat. In combat, the dragon’s strengths lie in its high strength (30), impressive constitution (29), and decent charisma (18). However, it does possess weaknesses, such as its below-average dexterity (12), which means it is not as agile as other entities. Its suite of special abilities grants it significant control over the battlefield, while its multiple powerful attacks make it a devastating opponent.

The Ancient Cave Dragon's attributes are as follows: it has a strength of 30, providing a very good melee attack power; dexterity of 12, which reflects a bad agility; constitution of 29, resulting in an exceptional durability overall; intelligence of 14, which offers average cognitive capabilities; wisdom of 16 for a good perception of the world; and charisma of 18 that indicates it has a very good ability to affect others.

For its saving throws, the dragon excels in constitution (+17) and charisma (+12), both providing exceptional resilience against effects that require saving throws. Its wisdom saving throw of +11 is also good, while its dexterity saving throw of +9 is average.

In terms of skills, the cave dragon has an outstanding perception skill with a +19 bonus, making it very good at noticing hidden creatures or traps, and it has a stealth skill at +9 that is good for remaining hidden.

The Ancient Cave Dragon has immunity to poison damage and is also immune to being blinded or poisoned, allowing it to be exceptionally resilient against particular types of attacks. Additionally, it possesses senses like blindsight within 60 feet and tremorsense up to 120 feet, enabling it to detect threats without needing sight. It communicates in Common, Darakhul, and Draconic languages.

The dragon has several special abilities. Its **Darkness Aura** creates a magical darkness in a 30-foot radius around it, obstructing vision for creatures without darkvision and dispelling weaker light spells, which can drastically alter the battlefield's visibility dynamics. It can choose whether this aura is active at the start of its turn, and it can be suppressed temporarily with a successful **dispell magic** cast on it. The **Legendary Resistance** allows the dragon to automatically succeed on failed saving throws up to three times per day, significantly enhancing its survivability during combat. The **Magical Tunneler** ability enables it to burrow through earth and stone, either leaving the area undisturbed or creating a tunnel, providing incredible mobility and tactical options underground. Its **Spiked Climb** ability allows it to navigate difficult surfaces effortlessly, making it capable of towering over its foes.

In terms of actions, the Ancient Cave Dragon can perform a **Multiattack**, using its *Frightful Presence* to instill fear before executing three physical attacks: one with its **Bite** (with a +18 to hit, delivering substantial damage of 21 piercing and 14 poison damage on a hit), two with its **Claws** (also with a +18 to hit, inflicting 17 slashing damage), and one with its **Tail** (similar accuracy, causing 19 bludgeoning damage).

The **Frightful Presence** ability forces creatures aware of the dragon within 120 feet to make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened, impacting their ability to act effectively in combat for up to a minute, unless they pass their saving throw. The **Poison Breath** attack allows it to exhale a devastating cone of poisonous gas, requiring targets to make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw to avoid or take massive damage and become poisoned, highlighting its capacity to inflict both immediate and ongoing harm to multiple foes.

The dragon also has a reactive ability known as **Ruff Spikes**, which activates when an enemy approaches. It can deal piercing damage to intruders unless they succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, further showcasing its defensive capabilities in close quarters.

Finally, it can use legendary actions to ensure it remains a dominant force on the battlefield. It can **Detect** to enhance its perception, make a **Tail Attack**, or perform a **Limb Sweep** (which costs two legendary actions) to push away and knock prone nearby foes, thereby controlling the flow of combat with its powerful presence.
