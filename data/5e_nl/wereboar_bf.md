The wereboar is a medium humanoid creature that embodies the characteristics of a lycanthrope, capable of transforming between a humanoid form, a boar form, and a hybrid form that combines elements of both. With a challenge rating of 4, wereboars are formidable foes in combat, boasting a strong physical presence with high strength and decent resilience due to their hit point total of 100. They excel in melee combat, with their abilities allowing them to deliver powerful charges and multiple attacks in a single turn, making them a significant threat to adventurers. However, their armor class is relatively low, particularly in humanoid form, making them potentially vulnerable to ranged attacks. 

The wereboar has the following attributes: Strength of +5, which is exceptional and enhances its physical attacks; Dexterity of +0, which is average and provides little benefit in terms of evasion; Constitution of +2, which is good and contributes to its hit points and resilience; Intelligence of +0, which is average and indicates a lack of cunning or tactical awareness; Wisdom of +0, which is also average; and Charisma of -1, indicating a very bad ability to influence or charm others. This creature has a perception score of 12, allowing for average awareness of stimuli around it, and a stealth modifier of +10, enabling it to blend into the environment when necessary. The wereboar can speak Common but loses this ability in its boar form.

The wereboar possesses special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. The Charge ability allows it to deal an additional 7 (2d6) damage if it moves at least 15 feet toward a target before attacking. This ability can knock the target prone if they fail a DC 13 Strength saving throw, greatly incapacitating them for the following round. The Relentless ability ensures that even when taking significant damage, the wereboar can remain in the fight, going down to 1 hit point instead of 0 when receiving 14 or less damage.

In combat, the wereboar can perform multiple attacks, known as the Multiattack action. It can make three melee attacks using either the Maul or Slam abilities or replace one of them with a Tusks attack if in an appropriate form. The Maul and Slam attacks both have a +5 to hit and deal 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a hit, and if two hits land on the same target, it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, further hindering its ability to fight back. The Tusks attack also has the same +5 to hit bonus, dealing the same damage but inflicting a curse of lycanthropy upon humanoid targets that fail a DC 12 Constitution saving throw.

As a bonus action, the wereboar can use its Challenging Snort to frighten an enemy within 30 feet. The target must succeed a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn, along with suffering disadvantage on their next saving throw against being knocked prone by the wereboar. Additionally, the Change Shape ability allows it to switch between its forms seamlessly, maintaining its statistics except for size, speed, and armor class. This versatility in form makes the wereboar adaptable and can significantly influence the dynamics of a combat situation or encounter.

Overall, the wereboar serves as a powerful and strategic opponent in combat, capable of enduring substantial damage and dealing hefty blows while maintaining flexibility in its forms.
