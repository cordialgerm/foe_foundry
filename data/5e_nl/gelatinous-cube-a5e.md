The Gelatinous Cube is a large ooze that serves as a menacing and unique threat in dungeon environments. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers, primarily due to its ability to engulf creatures and deal ongoing acid damage. Its main strengths lie in its ability to surprise unsuspecting adventurers with its transparent form and its unique attack methods that can restrain and damage multiple foes simultaneously. However, its weaknesses include a low Armor Class of 6 and limited mobility on land, as it can only walk and swim at a speed of 15 feet. The cube represents both a physical danger and a tactical puzzle for players looking to outmaneuver or avoid its grasp.

The Gelatinous Cube has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16 (+3), which is considered good for an ooze, allowing it to deal significant physical damage.
- Dexterity: 2 (-4), which is very bad, making it very slow and clumsy.
- Constitution: 18 (+4), an exceptional attribute that contributes to its high hit points of 76, providing durability in combat situations.
- Intelligence: 1 (-5), rated as very bad, which reflects its mindless nature and lack of cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 6 (-2) is bad, indicating poor perception and insight.
- Charisma: 1 (-5), also very bad, illustrating that it largely lacks presence or charm.

The Gelatinous Cube has some notable condition immunities, being unable to be blinded, charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, or knocked prone. It has blindsight out to 60 feet, meaning it can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, although it is blind beyond this range. Its passive Perception is rated at 8, meaning it is unlikely to notice stealthy creatures. Its ooze nature means it doesn’t require air or sleep, giving it an advantage in dungeons where air might be depleted or where alertness and stamina are crucial.

Its special abilities enhance its role in combat:
- **Engulfing Body:** When a creature enters the cube's space, it must make a saving throw to avoid being engulfed, allowing the cube to control the flow of combat by trapping enemies.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** In sunlight, the cube suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, which can be exploited by players who create environmental conditions to weaken it.
- **Transparent:** The cube’s motionlessness makes it hard to spot; creatures unaware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Perception check to detect it, adding an element of surprise.
- **Ooze Nature:** Highlights its adaptability as an ooze, making it resilient in environments where other creatures might struggle.

In terms of actions, the Gelatinous Cube has several formidable options:
- **Pseudopod:** This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit and reaches 5 feet, allowing it to strike nearby foes with 10 (3d6) acid damage.
- **Engulf:** The cube can move and enter the spaces of Large or smaller creatures, forcing them to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being engulfed. If caught unaware, these creatures roll with disadvantage. If a creature fails, they take 10 (3d6) acid damage and are restrained, suffering additional acid damage on each of the cube's turns. Engulfed creatures cannot breathe, complicating their escape efforts.
- An engulfed creature can attempt to escape by using their action to make a DC 13 Strength check. On a success, they move to a space within 5 feet of the cube. Meanwhile, another nearby creature can attempt to free an engulfed ally, but incurs the risk of suffering 10 (3d6) acid damage for their efforts.

Overall, the Gelatinous Cube is a strategic monster that offers unique challenges in combat scenarios, testing the maneuverability and adaptability of adventurers.
