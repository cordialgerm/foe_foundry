The Drainpipe Gargoyle is a Medium Elemental creature that serves as an interesting encounter for adventurers due to its unique abilities and elemental nature. With notable defensive capabilities, such as an Armor Class of 15 and a decent pool of Hit Points amounting to 45, it can withstand a fair amount of damage. The creature's strengths include immunities to poison damage and specific conditions like fatigue and unconsciousness, making it resilient in various combat scenarios. Its main weaknesses lie in its average Dexterity and a vulnerability to magical attacks. This creature can soar through the air at a speed of 60 feet, making it a versatile opponent that can attack from a distance as well as engage in close combat. Additionally, its Special Abilities enhance its stealth and sustainability, allowing it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings and operate without the need for air or sustenance.

The Drainpipe Gargoyle presents the following attributes: a Strength score of 14 (+2, which is good for physical attacks), Dexterity of 10 (+0, which is average), Constitution of 16 (+3, giving it high durability), Intelligence of 8 (-1, very bad for any mental tasks), Wisdom of 14 (+2, which is good for perception checks), and Charisma of 8 (-1, also very bad). It has a good modifier for Strength, allowing it to effectively engage in melee combat, while its high Constitution supports its ability to withstand damage. Additionally, it possesses good saving throws in Strength (+4) and Constitution (+5), which enhance its resilience. The creature has a skill proficiency in perception (+4), indicating it is quite aware of its surroundings. 

In terms of damage immunities, the Drainpipe Gargoyle cannot be harmed by poison, and it is resistant to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical, non-adamantine weapons. Its immunities to fatigue, petrification, poison, and unconsciousness make it a clever adversary in protracted battles. It can see in darkness up to 60 feet due to its darkvision and has a passive Perception score of 14. It communicates in Terran, reflecting its elemental nature.

The Drainpipe Gargoyle's special abilities include False Appearance, which allows it to remain motionless and appear as a normal statue, providing it an advantage in ambush situations. Its Elemental Nature means it does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, further enhancing its utility in strategic encounters.

In combat, the Drainpipe Gargoyle can utilize a Multiattack option, allowing it to strike with both its Bite and Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite has a melee attack bonus of +4 to hit, reaching up to 5 feet, dealing 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2) upon a successful hit. Its Claws also benefit from the same attack bonus, with a base hit yielding 5 slashing damage (1d6 + 2), but if the gargoyle is 20 feet above its target at the start of its turn, it can deal 9 slashing damage (2d6 + 2) instead, making it more lethal if it can navigate to higher ground.

Additionally, the gargoyle can launch a Rock attack, also with a +4 modifier to hit, dealing 9 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 2) with a range of 20 feet for direct hits and up to 60 feet with disadvantage. The unique Spit ability, which has a recharge mechanic of 5-6, allows the creature to expel a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long stream of water. This attack forces each creature in the area to make a DC 12 Strength saving throw, taking 10 bludgeoning damage (3d6) and possibly being pushed up to 15 feet away on a failure. Successful saving throws result in halved damage. This ability can be particularly effective for controlling the battlefield and creating distance between the gargoyle and its foes. 

The Drainpipe Gargoyle is a strategic opponent that combines mobility, stealth, and elemental strength, making it a versatile and dangerous adversary in a variety of encounters.
