The Young Blue Dragon is a formidable creature known for its mix of aerial agility and potent lightning abilities. As a Large dragon with a challenge rating of 9, it boasts an armor class of 18 due to its natural armor and an impressive pool of hit points at 175, making it a tough opponent in combat. This dragon's physical attributes are strong overall, with a good constitution of +8, which enhances its durability. Its dexterity of +4 and strength of +5 allow for both quick maneuvers and strong attacks. The dragon’s charisma of +7 enables it to be a master of intimidation and interaction, while its keen senses contribute to its ability to detect threats. The actions of the Young Blue Dragon include multiattacks combining bites and claws with added lightning damage, making it not only a challenging melee foe but also a significant threat from a distance with its lightning breath. However, while its strengths are notable, it can be overpowered by cunning strategies that exploit its weaknesses in spellcasting and reliance on its breath weapon.

The Young Blue Dragon possesses an impressive stat block: it has 5 for strength (good), 4 for dexterity (good), 8 for constitution (exceptional), 2 for intelligence (average), 5 for wisdom (good), and 7 for charisma (very good). 

In terms of senses, it has darkvision extending 120 feet and keen senses at 30 feet, which enhances its perception to a value of 19, allowing it to detect foes easily even in low light. Its stealth ability stands at 14, indicating a good but not exceptional competency in remaining undetected. The dragon can communicate in both Common and Draconic.

The Young Blue Dragon has a special ability called Charged Hide. This ability allows the dragon to build up an electric charge in its body when it hasn’t used its Lightning Breath. While this breath is available, it creates wild sparks of electricity around it. Any creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of its next turn, creating a substantial threat to nearby enemies.

In terms of actions, the Young Blue Dragon can perform a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 16 piercing damage along with an additional 5 lightning damage on a successful hit. The Claw attack also has a +9 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 12 slashing damage.

Additionally, the dragon has access to its infamous Lightning Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This breath weapon allows it to exhale a line of lightning that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures caught in this line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw; a failed save results in 55 lightning damage (10d10), while a successful save halves the damage. This ability is a game-changer in combat, allowing the Young Blue Dragon to inflict significant damage over a wide area, making positioning crucial for enemies to avoid its devastating attacks.
