The Hawk is a tiny beast that serves as a nimble creature with remarkable senses, making it excellent for scouting and reconnaissance. With an Armor Class of 13, it is relatively difficult to hit, but it only has 1 Hit Point, making it very vulnerable to any damage. It can cover ground quickly with a walking speed of 10 feet and an impressive flying speed of 60 feet, allowing it to escape from danger easily. The creature has a low Challenge Rating of 0, which means it poses little threat to adventurers but can be useful in specific scenarios, such as serving as a familiar or a scout. Its Strength is very weak, while its Dexterity is good, enabling it to dodge attacks effectively.

The Hawk has the following attributes: Strength 4 (modifier -3, very bad), Dexterity 16 (modifier +3, good), Constitution 8 (modifier -1, bad), Intelligence 2 (modifier -4, very bad), Wisdom 14 (modifier +2, good), and Charisma 4 (modifier -3, very bad). The Hawk's skills include a Perception score of +4, which is enhanced by its passive perception of 14. The creature cannot communicate verbally and has no languages.

One notable special ability of the Hawk is Keen Sight, which grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight. This means that when the Hawk makes a perception check to notice something, it rolls two d20 and takes the higher roll, making it more effective at spotting hidden objects or threats.

As for its actions, the Hawk can perform a melee attack using its Talons. This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, which is a good chance of hitting a target within a 5-foot reach. If it successfully hits, it deals 1 point of slashing damage to the target. However, due to the Hawk's low Hit Points and the strength of its attack, it is unlikely to last long in combat. Overall, the Hawk is a fragile creature best suited for tasks that require speed and keen eyesight rather than direct confrontation.
