The Voidclaw Zombie is a small undead creature characterized by its chaotic evil alignment. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it poses a significant threat in combat, drawing on its notably high Dexterity and unique abilities to manipulate engagement. The creature has a robust pool of hit points with 143, making it resilient in battle. Its strengths lie in its mobility, with a walking speed of 40 feet and the ability to climb 20 feet, along with advantageous combat abilities that hinder opponents. However, its weaknesses are apparent in its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, indicating limited mental capacity and poor social interactions.

The Voidclaw Zombie's attributes are as follows: Strength is average at 11, Dexterity is good at 18, Constitution is average at 15, Intelligence is low at 14, Wisdom is very bad at 6, and Charisma is very bad at 5. It has a decent Armor Class of 14 due to natural armor, making it somewhat resistant to physical attacks. The creature possesses a damage immunity to necrotic and poison types and is also immune to the poisoned condition, making it difficult for certain spells or abilities to affect it.

In terms of special abilities, the Voidclaw Zombie has "Erratic Movement," which causes opportunity attacks against it to be made with disadvantage, allowing it to maneuver more freely during combat. Its "Turn Resistance" grants it an advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead creatures, which is useful in battles against clerics or paladins who might try to repel it. With "Undead Fortitude," if the zombie is reduced to 0 hit points, it can make a Constitution saving throw against a DC determined by the amount of damage taken, allowing it the chance to remain standing at 1 hit point unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit, making it exceptionally hard to dispatch. It also has "Undead Nature," meaning it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, enabling it to function in environments where living creatures would struggle.

The Voidclaw Zombie can engage in multiple attacks per turn as part of its "Multiattack," allowing it to make three Void Claw or Void Bolt attacks. The "Void Claw" is a melee attack that has a +7 modifier to hit, dealing slashing damage of 8 (1d8 + 4) and additional necrotic damage of 7 (2d6). If the target is a creature that is not a Construct or Undead, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or incur ongoing necrotic damage at the start of its turns. This necrotic effect can be purged with an action and a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check or by receiving magical healing. The "Void Bolt" allows the zombie to attack from a distance, using a ranged spell attack with a +5 modifier to hit, dealing a significant 16 (4d6 + 2) necrotic damage.

As for its bonus action, "Nimble Fighter" enables the Voidclaw Zombie to take either the Dash or Disengage action, enhancing its mobility during a turn and allowing it to reposition or escape from potential threats effectively. Overall, the Voidclaw Zombie is a formidable opponent, using its unique abilities to create challenges for adventurers while also being able to withstand significant amounts of damage.
