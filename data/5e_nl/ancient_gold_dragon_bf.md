The Ancient Gold Dragon is a gargantuan and majestic creature, known for its incredible power and intelligence. This dragon serves as a formidable guardian and a paragon of virtue, often acting as both a protector and a judge of mortals. With a challenge rating of 21, it is a highly dangerous foe, capable of dealing massive damage and imposing debilitating effects in combat. It possesses a robust armor class of 22, making it difficult to hit, and an impressive pool of 382 hit points, allowing it to endure a substantial amount of damage. However, despite its overwhelming strength, the Ancient Gold Dragon's weaknesses include its reliance on strategic positioning, as it can be outmaneuvered by particularly agile foes.

For its physical attributes, the dragon boasts exceptional strength with a modifier of +10, very good dexterity at +9, and an exceptional constitution modifier of +16, making it extremely resilient. It has an average intelligence score of +5, a very good wisdom modifier of +13, and an exceptional charisma score of +12, enhancing its capabilities in spellcasting and social interactions. The dragon has keen senses, featuring darkvision up to 120 feet and a perception score of 30, allowing it to detect threats and hidden creatures easily. With a stealth score of 19, it can also maneuver quietly when necessary. The dragon can communicate in both Common and Draconic languages.

The Ancient Gold Dragon has several notable special abilities that enhance its combat and survival strategies. It is amphibious, capable of breathing both air and water. Its Golden Splendor ability can charm creatures within a 30-foot radius, requiring them to succeed on a formidable DC 24 save to resist. The dragon's Legendary Resistance allows it to automatically succeed on saving throws three times a day, providing it with an exceptional defense against debilitating effects.

During combat, the Ancient Gold Dragon can utilize a multiattack action. This allows it to use its Frightful Presence ability, which forces all creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 20 wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute, significantly impacting their ability to fight. It can then follow up with a Bite attack, which has a +17 to hit and deals 21 piercing damage on a successful strike. Additionally, it can make two Claw attacks with the same +17 to hit bonus, inflicting 17 slashing damage each. The dragon can also use its Tail attack with the same hit bonus, dealing 19 bludgeoning damage to a single target.

One of its most powerful abilities, the Fire Breath, has a recharge mechanism and allows the dragon to exhale a cone of fire that extends for 90 feet. Creatures within the area must make a DC 24 dexterity saving throw, taking 110 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. The dragon can also use its Weakening Breath, which similarly affects a 90-foot cone and imposes a hefty DC 24 save.

The dragon can perform certain actions as bonus actions. The Change Shape ability enables it to transform into a beast or humanoid of an equivalent challenge rating, while retaining many of its legendary traits. In its transformed state, it retains the ability to speak, maintaining its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores, but gains the statistics and capabilities of the new form.

It also has legendary actions, providing it with additional tactical options at the end of other creatures' turns. With the Detect action, the dragon can pinpoint every creature and trap within 30 feet. It can make Tail attacks as a legendary action or utilize the Elemental Roar, which makes enemies vulnerable to fire damage. The Wing Attack enables it to damage creatures nearby and reposition itself without being subject to opportunity attacks.

Lastly, if the Ancient Gold Dragon meets its end, it can cause regional effects that may last for days, creating an impact on the environment that emphasizes its connection to the realm it inhabits.
