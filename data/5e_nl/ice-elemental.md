The Ice Elemental is a powerful and imposing creature found in cold environments, embodying the essence of ice and frost. As a Large elemental, it has significant hit points totaling 114, making it a resilient foe. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it presents a formidable challenge to adventurers, particularly due to its unique abilities and defenses. The Ice Elemental excels in cold attacks and mobility, boasting skills in burrowing through ice and unaffected movement on icy surfaces. However, it is particularly vulnerable to fire damage, which can bypass its formidable defenses and exploit a significant weakness. While it lacks intelligence and charisma, its strength, constitution, and wisdom are notably high, enhancing its combat effectiveness. 

The Ice Elemental has the following attributes: Strength of 18 grants it a +4 modifier, which is very good for physical attacks. Dexterity is 9, giving it a -1 modifier, which is bad for dodging and agility. With a Constitution of 19, it possesses a +4 modifier that is also very good, enhancing its durability and ability to withstand damage. Intelligence is quite low at 5 (-3 modifier), making it very bad at tasks requiring intellect. Wisdom is 14 (+2 modifier), which is average for perception and insight. Finally, it has a Charisma of 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, characterizing it as very bad in social situations.

In terms of combat capabilities, the Ice Elemental's saving throw bonus for Strength is +7, which is effective against grappling and bounding maneuvers. In terms of skills, the Ice Elemental does not have any specifically noted abilities other than its inherent elemental traits. It is vulnerable to fire damage, meaning that fire-based attacks deal double damage. The elemental is immune to cold and poison damage, making it resistant to most traditional forms of assault from nonmagical attacks, which it only takes half from. It also resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources. It cannot be affected by conditions such as exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, poisoning, or unconsciousness, making it exceptionally resilient against effects that would normally debilitate other creatures. The senses include darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive perception score of 12, allowing it to see in darkness and perceive its surroundings well.

The special abilities of the Ice Elemental include Ice Glide, which allows it to burrow through nonmagical ice without disturbing the material around it, making it an elusive opponent in icy terrains. Ice Walk enables the elemental to traverse icy surfaces with ease, ignoring difficult terrain created by ice or snow, which enhances its movement capabilities in its preferred environment. Another ability is Splinter, which allows the elemental to retaliate against creatures that strike it with bludgeoning melee attacks, dealing 3 (1d6) piercing damage as sharp shards of ice erupt from its form.

When engaging in combat, the Ice Elemental can perform a Multiattack, making two ice claw attacks against its foes. Its Ice Claw attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit and can reach up to 5 feet away, delivering 13 (4d8 + 4) slashing damage upon a successful strike. A notable ability is Encase in Ice, which allows it to make a melee attack with a reach of 10 feet that hits for 14 (4d6) cold damage. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; failure to do so results in the creature being restrained by forming ice around it. The creature can attempt another saving throw on its next turn to break free or, upon failing, be petrified in ice until it spends time in a warm environment or receives 10 fire damage, making it vital for allies to be wary of their positioning in combat against this elemental.
