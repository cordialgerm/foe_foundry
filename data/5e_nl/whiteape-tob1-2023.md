The White Ape is a large monstrosity that serves as a formidable challenge in combat, boasting both physical prowess and dangerous magical abilities. With an Armor Class of 14, it is somewhat resilient but primarily relies on its significant pool of hit points—114, equivalent to 12d10 + 48. This creature thrives on melee combat with its powerful attacks and possesses a unique disease, arcane wasting, which can debilitate spellcasters over time. Its notable strengths include high Strength (18) and Constitution (18), making it exceptionally strong and durable. Its Dexterity (16) also provides good agility in combat. However, its Intelligence (8) and Charisma (8) are low, which is a significant weakness that limits interactions with other creatures and the use of intelligence-based skills. 

In terms of attributes, the White Ape's Strength modifier of +4 is exceptional, allowing it to deal significant damage with its attacks. Its Dexterity modifier of +3 is good and contributes to its agility, while the Constitution modifier of +4 is exceptional, enhancing its hit points and resilience. The creature has a passive Perception of 15, signifying good awareness of its surroundings. It can speak Common, which allows for basic communication.

The White Ape has several special abilities that enhance its danger in battle. 

- Arcane Wasting is a disease that it can inflict through its attacks; those infected suffer from mental deterioration, which may lead to a decrease in Intelligence and Wisdom. Infected characters must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw after each long rest to avoid suffering penalties to their mental stats, with potentially dire consequences if their scores drop to zero.
- Magic Resistance gives the White Ape advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it more challenging for spellcasters to affect it.
- Spellcasting Animosity allows it to focus its fury on spellcasters, granting it advantage on attack rolls against any creature that it sees casting a spell during its next turn.

For its actions, the White Ape employs a Multiattack, enabling it to make one Bite attack and two Fist attacks in a single turn. 

- The Bite attack has a +7 to hit and deals 13 piercing damage (2d8 + 4). Upon a successful hit, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the arcane wasting disease.
- The Fist attack also has +7 to hit and delivers a substantial 15 bludgeoning damage (2d10 + 4).
- Frenzy is a powerful area attack that requires a recharge of 5–6. In this action, the White Ape attacks all creatures within 10 feet, forcing them to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 35 bludgeoning damage, while successful saves lead to half damage and no additional effects. Creatures that succeed also gain advantage on their next attack rolls against the White Ape.

The White Ape is a dangerous adversary with a combination of physical might and debilitating magical abilities, making it a noteworthy opponent for any adventuring party.
