The Ancient Void Dragon has several notable special abilities. The "Chill of the Void" ability means that creatures resistant to cold damage are not shielded from the dragon's cold attacks. Upon death, the dragon triggers "Collapsing Star," which causes a destructive explosion that requires nearby creatures to make a high DC Constitution saving throw to avoid significant bludgeoning and cold damage, with a chance of being ejected across planes. The dragon is an "Expert Void Traveler," allowing it to traverse the void effortlessly without the need for air or sustenance. With "Legendary Resistance," the dragon can choose to succeed on saving throws it might otherwise fail, enhancing its survivability.

In combat, the Ancient Void Dragon can perform multiple attacks in one turn thanks to its "Multiattack" option, using its "Aura of Madness" ability first to potentially cause madness in nearby creatures, followed by its powerful melee attacks. The dragon's attacks include a "Bite" that does piercing and cold damage, "Claws" that deal slashing damage, and a "Tail" attack that inflicts bludgeoning damage.

The Ancient Void Dragon also has potent breath weapons that recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. "Gravitic Breath" creates a gravity-affected area that can cause severe fall damage and restrain creatures that enter it, while "Stellar Breath" unleashes a cone of fire and radiant damage, making it a fearsome area-of-effect attack.

In addition, the dragon can respond to attacks with "Void Twist," which allows it to increase its AC against an incoming attack. If the attack misses by enough, it can transfer that attack to another nearby creature.

The dragon can employ three legendary actions per turn, which can include detecting hidden foes, making extra attacks, or using "Void Slip" to teleport and deal cold damage to nearby creatures, making it an unpredictable and menacing opponent on the battlefield.
