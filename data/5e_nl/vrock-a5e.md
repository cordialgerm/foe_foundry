The Vrock is a powerful Large Fiend that serves as a deadly combatant in any encounter, often characterized by its chaotic evil nature. With an Armor Class of 15 and 104 hit points, it can endure significant damage before being overwhelmed. The Vrock has impressive physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, making it a formidable opponent in melee combat. It is capable of flying, enabling it to maneuver over obstacles and engage in combat effectively. However, despite its strengths, it is vulnerable to radiant damage and can be severely impacted by spells and abilities that target its weaknesses. Its challenge rating of 6 signifies that it can pose a serious threat to adventurers of mid-level experience. 

The Vrock possesses the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4, very good), Dexterity 16 (+3, good), Constitution 18 (+4, very good), Intelligence 8 (-1, bad), Wisdom 14 (+2, average), and Charisma 10 (+0, average). For saving throws, it is particularly adept at Dexterity (+6, good), Wisdom (+5, good), and Charisma (+3, average) due to its advantage from its Chaotic Evil nature and Magic Resistance, allowing it to have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. It is immune to poison damage, resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage, and it takes no damage from non-magical weapons, granting it substantial defensive capabilities.

As for its abilities, the Vrock can use Multiattack to strike with its beak and talons in a single turn. The Beak attack has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, with a chance for an additional 7 (2d6) damage if it has advantage on the attack. The Talons attack also has a +6 to hit and does 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage, making it very dangerous in close quarters.

The Vrock can unleash its Spores ability once per day, which creates a poisonous cloud in a 15-foot radius that requires targets within it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the creature becoming poisoned for one minute, taking ongoing damage of 5 (1d10) during this time, with the saving throw repeated at the end of each of its turns. This ability can weaken and control the battlefield.

Additionally, the Vrock has a powerful Bonus Action called Stunning Screech, which it can use once per day to stun nearby non-demon creatures. Those within 20 feet that can hear it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, and failure results in being stunned until the end of the Vrock's next turn. This ability allows the Vrock to disrupt enemy actions and control engagements effectively. 

Overall, the Vrock combines formidable melee capabilities, defensive advantages, and powerful crowd control abilities, making it a significant threat in combat.
