The Stirge is a tiny beast that serves as a minor threat in the monstrous ecosystem. It is known for its ability to swiftly attack and latch onto its prey to drain blood, effectively dealing damage while remaining hard to hit due to its small size and agility. With a challenge rating of 1/8, it is a weak opponent individually but can be dangerous in swarms. The Stirge has high dexterity, making it good at dodging attacks, but its overall health is very low, making it exceptionally vulnerable to direct damage. Its notable attack mechanism allows it to both injure and sustain itself by feeding, posing a unique challenge for low-level adventurers.

The Stirge's armor class is 13, providing a good defense against attacks for its size. It has hit points totaling only 2, which is very bad, reflecting its fragility in combat. The Stirge has a walking speed of 10 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet, giving it significant mobility in pursuit or evasion tactics.

In terms of ability scores, the Stirge has a Strength of 4, which is very bad, and a Dexterity of 16, which is very good. Its Constitution score is average at 10, while its Intelligence is exceptionally low at 2, making it incapable of higher reasoning. The Wisdom score is 8, which is bad, and its Charisma score is also low at 4, showing that the Stirge lacks any notable social skills.

The Stirge has no specific skills listed, but it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark or dimly lit environments. Its passive perception score is 9, indicating an average ability to perceive hidden dangers.

In terms of actions, the Stirge has two primary abilities. The first is the Proboscis, a melee weapon attack that boasts a +5 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully hits a target, it deals 1 piercing damage and attaches itself to the creature. The target can use an action to detach the Stirge, or it can detach itself as a bonus action, adding strategic elements to how characters might deal with it during combat.

The Stirge's second action is Blood Drain. Once attached to a creature, the Stirge drains blood, dealing 4 (1d8) damage to the unfortunate target. After it has drained a total of 8 hit points, which may span multiple uses, the Stirge detaches itself and cannot use Blood Drain again until it has finished a rest. This ability poses a significant risk to low-hit-point characters, especially if they are attacked by multiple Stirges at once.
