The Storm Lord is a formidable Huge Elemental creature characterized by its mastery over storms and lightning. With its high Armor Class of 17 and substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 161, it serves as a powerful adversary in combat scenarios. Its notable strengths lie in its ability to control the battlefield with storms, which can impede opponents' visibility and movements while providing itself with immunity to the effects of these conditions. The Storm Lord's offensive capabilities include strong melee and ranged attacks, but it can be vulnerable to certain types of damage, particularly magical attacks that bypass its resistances. Its challenge rating of 13 indicates it presents a significant challenge, making it an imposing figure for adventurers.

The Storm Lord boasts the following attributes: 

- Strength: 20 with a modifier of +5, which is exceptional and makes it highly effective in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity: 18 with a modifier of +4, considered very good, allowing it to avoid attacks and act quickly in combat.
- Constitution: 16 with a modifier of +3, a good level of resilience contributing to its high hit points.
- Intelligence: 12 with a modifier of +1, which is average and reflects limited knowledge.
- Wisdom: 14 with a modifier of +2, which is good and enhances its perception and saving throws.
- Charisma: 18 with a modifier of +4, also very good, bolstering its spellcasting capabilities.

In terms of saving throws, the Storm Lord excels, particularly with Strength (+10), Constitution (+8), and Wisdom (+7) modifiers, making it very difficult for opponents to affect its physical and mental resilience. It is skilled in athletics (+10), nature (+6), and perception (+7), showcasing its overall prowess. 

In terms of damage immunities, the Storm Lord is immune to poison, and it has resistances to acid, lightning, thunder, and all nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It is also immune to several conditions such as exhaustion, being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious, which significantly increases its survivability in combat scenarios. Its sense capabilities include darkvision up to 120 feet, with a passive perception of 17, which aids in detecting hidden foes.

The Storm Lord can communicate using the Aquan language, reflecting its elemental nature. 

One of the key special abilities of the Storm Lord is called Tempest. This powerful ability creates a significant storm in a 120-foot radius around it, imposing disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks for creatures within this area. Notably, the storm does not affect the Storm Lord's own senses or attacks. Any open flames are extinguished, and fog is dispersed by the tempest. Notably, flying creatures within the tempest must land or risk falling. Moreover, creatures that start their turn within 30 feet of the Storm Lord must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed back by 15 feet. When approaching the Storm Lord, creatures must expend extra movement, making it even more difficult to close the distance.

When it comes to its attacks and actions, the Storm Lord can make two attacks per turn through a versatile Multiattack option, either choosing between slam attacks or lightning bolts. 

- The Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, inflicting a powerful 29 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, derived from rolling 7d6 plus 5.
  
- The Lightning Bolt is a ranged spell attack, also having a +9 to hit and a range of 60 feet. Upon hitting, it deals 31 lightning damage, resulting from 7d8.

Additionally, the Storm Lord possesses a fearsome attack known as Thunder Clap, which requires recharging on rolls of 5 or 6. This ability creates a deafening thunder noise affecting every creature within 30 feet. Each creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail take significant thunder damage amounting to 54 (12d8) and are deafened, while those who succeed take half damage without the deafening effect. The condition of deafness lasts until cured by a spell such as lesser restoration.

Overall, the Storm Lord represents a significant threat on the battlefield with its devastating area-control abilities and formidable offensive capabilities, combining natural elemental power with tactical advantages that can decisively influence the course of a battle.
