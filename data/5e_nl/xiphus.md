The Xiphus is a small yet formidable fey creature, embodying chaotic evil and capable of swiftly maneuvering through combat while inflicting devastating damage. With a challenge rating of 5, it presents a considerable threat to unprepared adventurers. The Xiphus excels in agility and dexterity, boasting an exceptional Dexterity score of 21, which grants it a high bonus on attack rolls, defensive capabilities, and skills such as acrobatics and stealth. It is resilient against lightning damage, allowing it to regenerate health when hit by such attacks. However, despite its weaknesses, the Xiphus's strategic abilities enable it to manipulate the flow of battle, turning the tide in its favor with various unique abilities and powerful attacks.

The Xiphus has an Armor Class of 15, which is good and provides a reasonable defense against attacks. It has 55 hit points, averaging out to 10d6+20, reflecting its moderate durability. It moves with incredible speed, having a walking speed of 50 feet, which allows it to traverse the battlefield swiftly.

The creature's Strength score is 14 with a +2 modifier, indicating good physical capability. Its Dexterity is high at 21, providing it with a +5 modifier, which is exceptional; this affects both its attack rolls and its ability to avoid attacks. The Constitution score is 15, granting it a +2 modifier—characterized as good—and contributes to its hit points. Its Intelligence score is average at 10, with no modifier, while its Wisdom is slightly above average at 12, with a +1 modifier. Lastly, its Charisma is also a good score of 14, offering a +2 modifier.

In terms of saving throws, the Xiphus is particularly adept at Dexterity saving throws with a +8 modifier, which is exceptional. It possesses proficiency in acrobatics and stealth, both of which give it a +8 modifier, representing its remarkable agility and evasive capabilities. Its perception skills grant it a +4 modifier, allowing it to notice hidden traps or creatures effectively.

The Xiphus has damage immunity to lightning, protecting it from any electrical attacks, and has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet. It has a passive perception of 14, enabling it to be alert to its surroundings, and it can communicate in Common, Elvish, and Umbral.

Among the special abilities, Evasion enables the Xiphus to effectively dodge effects that deal damage via a successful Dexterity saving throw, allowing it to take no damage instead of only half, making this ability highly effective. Lightning Absorption completely negates any lightning damage it takes, converting it into healing for the Xiphus, which allows it to regain hit points without incurring any harm from such attacks.

Siphon Time is a potent ability that lets the Xiphus select a target to give it an advantage on attacks or on saving throws against that creature’s spells until its next turn. This enhances its offensive or defensive capabilities significantly during critical moments in combat. Startling Speed gives the Xiphus the ability to become harder to hit, imposing disadvantage on attacks against it after it moves at least 10 feet, unless it is incapacitated or restrained, leveraging its agility effectively.

When it comes to actions, the Xiphus can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks using its Hidden Dagger. Each Hidden Dagger attack has a +8 to hit and delivers piercing damage augmented by lightning damage, making these attacks very potent. The dagger deals 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) lightning damage, significantly increasing its threat.

For its reactions, the Xiphus can use Borrowed Time when facing lethal damage. This ability allows it to siphon life force from a nearby creature, causing that creature to potentially take damage while enabling the Xiphus to heal itself. This creates a dramatic and strategic interaction, where the Xiphus can escape death momentarily at the expense of another's health, demonstrating its chaotic and self-serving nature. After a short or long rest, the Xiphus can regain the use of this ability, allowing for frequent strategic plays during encounters.
