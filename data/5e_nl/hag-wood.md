The Wood Hag is a medium-sized fey creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This cunning monster is known for its mastery of woodland environments and has a strong affinity for trickery and manipulation. With an impressive armor class of 16 and a considerable pool of hit points totaling 170, this creature can endure significant damage in combat. The Wood Hag's challenge rating of 9 indicates that it is a formidable opponent, capable of providing a significant challenge to adventurers. Its strengths lie in its powerful melee and ranged attacks, magical capabilities, and unique abilities that allow it to blend seamlessly into its natural surroundings. However, despite its resilience and versatile combat tactics, the Wood Hag maintains weaknesses typical of fey creatures, including susceptibility to certain spells and effects outside its sphere of influence.

The Wood Hag possesses robust attributes, including a Strength of 16, which translates to a +3 modifier, making it good in melee combat. Its Dexterity score of 14 grants a +2 modifier, giving it average agility, while its Constitution of 18 results in a +4 modifier, indicating very good durability. With an Intelligence of 12 (+1), it possesses average cognitive skills, while its Wisdom of 21 (+5) suggests exceptional perception and insight. Finally, a Charisma score of 15 (+2) gives it good social skills. The Hag's saving throws reflect its physical and mental resilience, with bonuses of +7 to Strength, +8 to Constitution, and +9 to Wisdom, making it very good at resisting physical attacks and mental influences. The creature has heightened senses with darkvision extending up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 19, indicating strong awareness of its surroundings.

The Wood Hag has several special abilities that enhance its combat and interaction capabilities. The ability "One with the Woods" allows the hag to camouflage itself perfectly as an old log when remaining motionless in forest environments, making it extremely hard to detect. The "Magic Resistance" ability grants the hag advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, significantly improving its defenses against magical attacks. "Speak with Beasts and Plants" enables the hag to communicate with animals and plants, giving it an edge in negotiating or manipulating the environment. Additionally, the "Woodland Walk" ability allows the hag to traverse plant-covered terrain without impediment, which is useful for both movement and strategic positioning in combat.

In terms of action capabilities, the Wood Hag can employ a "Multiattack," allowing it to execute two attacks using either its claws or its "Toxic Splinter" ability. The "Claw" attack has a melee weapon attack bonus of +7, which can deal 10 slashing damage alongside an additional 18 poison damage from a successful hit. The "Toxic Splinter" is a ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit, dealing 7 piercing damage plus 18 poison damage. If the target fails a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, it becomes poisoned for one minute, resulting in paralysis; however, the target may attempt to save at the end of each of its turns to shake off the effect. Allies may also assist in removing the splinter by succeeding on a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check. 

The Wood Hag also possesses spellcasting abilities, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability with a save DC of 17. It can cast spells like "charm person" and "entangle" at will and can use "plant growth" three times a day and "contagion" once per day. Each spell can significantly impact gameplay, from controlling characters through charm effects to manipulating the battlefield with area control spells.

As a bonus action, the Wood Hag can use "Nettling Word," which allows it to provoke an enemy within a 30-foot range. This action can infuriate the target, granting them advantage on melee attacks against others but forcing them to attack the nearest creature instead of the Wood Hag unless they succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. If no nearby target is available, the enraged creature will move in a random direction. This ability can create chaos in combat, disrupting party dynamics and forcing foes into a state of confusion.
