The Ochre Jelly is a Large ooze creature that poses a challenge rating of 2, indicating it is suitable for low-level adventurers. With an armor class of 8 and 71 hit points, the jelly is relatively easy to hit but can endure a fair amount of damage. It has a speed of 15 feet on the ground and can also climb at the same speed, which provides it with versatility in various terrains. The creature's strengths include its ability to move through narrow spaces effortlessly, a unique resilience to many conditions, and a noxious overwhelming stench that can incapacitate foes. While the Ochre Jelly lacks intelligence and other mental attributes, its physical defensive and offensive capabilities make it a notable opponent in combat.

The abilities of the Ochre Jelly reflect its nature as an ooze. It has a Strength score of 16 (+3), a Dexterity score of 8 (-2), a Constitution score of 14 (+2), and low mental ability scores with Intelligence at 3 (-4), Wisdom at 8 (-2), and Charisma at 1 (-5). The jelly's Dexterity modifier is considered bad, reflecting its sluggish movements, while its Strength and Constitution modifiers are good, making it a formidable physical creature. Its keen sense allows it to perceive within a 60-foot range, but it cannot sense beyond that, and its Perception and Stealth values are both average at 8.

The Ochre Jelly has several special abilities that contribute to its effectiveness in combat. It is amorphous, allowing it to move through extremely narrow spaces without difficulty. Its ooze nature means it does not require sleep, enabling it to remain active for longer periods. With ooze resilience, it is immune to several debilitating conditions, including exhaustion and certain status effects like being frightened or prone. One of its most dangerous abilities, overwhelming stench, forces creatures within 10 feet to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 13) or become poisoned, which can significantly hinder their combat effectiveness. If the creature fails by a wide margin, it is forced to spend its turn retching. The jelly also has spider climb, permitting it to move across difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without difficulty.

In terms of actions, the primary attack of the Ochre Jelly is its pseudopod strike, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, the attack deals 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the target is poisoned, it must also make a Constitution saving throw (DC 13) or take an extra 5 (2d4) poison damage, showcasing the jelly's potential to deal significant multi-type damage.

The jelly also has a unique reaction ability known as "Split." If it takes lightning or slashing damage while having 10 or more hit points, it splits into two new jellies, each with half of the original's hit points. This mechanic allows the jelly to effectively exacerbate a fight by multiplying itself, forcing the party to deal with multiple threats if not handled quickly. 

Overall, the Ochre Jelly serves as a challenging and interesting monster filled with unique mechanics and attacks that can test strategy and adaptability in combat scenarios.
