The Wraith Bear is a formidable and terrifying creature, embodying the chaos and malevolence typically associated with undead beings. As a large undead creature, it presents significant threats both in terms of damage and the unique abilities it wields. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it has the potential to be a serious challenge for adventurers, boasting a robust pool of Hit Points at 133 and several powerful attacks and abilities. The Wraith Bear's strengths lie in its ability to regenerate health, deal significant necrotic damage, and incapacitate foes with its supernatural roar. However, it does have weaknesses, as its effectiveness against silvered weapons and magical attacks can be heightened due to its immunities and resistances. Overall, the Wraith Bear is a dangerous foe that can manipulate the battlefield to its advantage while draining life from its enemies.

The Wraith Bear possesses the following attributes: Strength of 18, Dexterity of 16, Constitution of 18, Intelligence of 10, Wisdom of 16, and Charisma of 15. These attributes indicate that the Wraith Bear is exceptionally strong, very good in Dexterity and Constitution, average in Intelligence, and good in both Wisdom and Charisma. It has a proficiency bonus that contributes to its melee attack modifier, making them potentially effective in close combat scenarios.

The creature can utilize the following special abilities:
- **Detect Relatives** allows the Wraith Bear to sense the direction of its nearest living relative on the same plane, providing a unique insight into its connection to the living.
- **Draining Regeneration** is an exceptional ability that enables the Wraith Bear to regain 10 Hit Points at the beginning of its turn as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point and living plants are within 5 feet. However, when it regains this health, all nearby plant life dies, making this ability thematic and strategically impactful.
- **Incorporeal Movement** allows the Wraith Bear to move through creatures and objects, treating them as difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 force damage, which provides both mobility and a risk for the bear.

The Wraith Bear can perform the following actions:
- **Life Drain** is a melee attack with a +8 to hit, reaching out to target enemies up to 5 feet away. On a successful hit, the attack deals 31 necrotic damage (rolled as 6d8 + 4). Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer a maximum Hit Point reduction equal to the damage dealt. This effect persists until the target completes a long rest, potentially leading to lethal outcomes if the target's maximum Hit Points drop to zero.
- **Baleful Roar**, which can be used once every six turns, unleashes a supernatural roar in a 30-foot cone. Creatures that hear this roar must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in instant incapacitation for 1 minute, while a successful save leaves the creature frightened until the end of its next turn. Incapacitated creatures can repeat their saving throws at the end of their turns to recover from this debilitating effect.

In summary, the Wraith Bear is an imposing undead creature marked by its life-draining attacks and strong defensive abilities, capable of controlling the flow of combat and threatening any who oppose it.
