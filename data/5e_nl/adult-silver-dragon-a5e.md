The Adult Silver Dragon is a massive and powerful creature known for its grace and intelligence. As a formidable opponent, it boasts a high Armor Class of 19 and a substantial health pool, having 283 hit points. Its challenge rating of 19 signifies that it poses a significant threat in combat, often requiring a well-coordinated team of adventurers to defeat. This dragon excels in both physical and magical combat, backed by exceptional strength with a strength score of 24, which grants it a +7 modifier on related checks. Its innate spellcasting and unique abilities make it a cunning adversary. Although it has high resilience with damage immunity to cold and abilities allowing it to avoid damage under certain circumstances, its reliance on powerful breath weapons and splendid spells makes it vulnerable if disabled or outmaneuvered.

The Adult Silver Dragon possesses the following attributes: Strength 24 (+7), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 24 (+7), Intelligence 16 (+3), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 20 (+5). Its saving throws are formidable, with bonuses such as: Dexterity +8 (good), Constitution +13 (exceptional), Wisdom +7 (good), and Charisma +11 (exceptional). Its skills add to its competency in arcana +9, history +9, perception +7, and stealth +8, allowing it to navigate both battles and social encounters effectively. Additionally, its incredible senses include blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, giving it a passive perception of 20, making stealthy approaches against it very difficult.

This dragon's special abilities significantly enhance its combat effectiveness. The "Cloud Strider" ability grants the dragon immunity to nonmagical damage and increased fly speed of 300 feet after just one minute of concentration while in cloud form. However, this form restricts it to only using the Hide action. Its "Legendary Resistance" allows it to negate failed saving throws three times a day, a powerful way to avoid being helpless in critical moments. The dragon retains its impressive innate spellcasting capability, relying on Charisma with a saving throw DC of 19 to cast spells such as charm person, faerie fire, awaken, and geas up to three times each day.

For its actions, the Adult Silver Dragon can perform a "Multiattack," which involves a bite attack followed by two claw attacks or using "Spit Frost" in place of the bite. The bite attack has a +13 to hit and deals an average of 23 piercing damage plus 4 cold damage, while both claws deal an average of 20 slashing damage with the same attack modifier. With a tail attack, it can push a target back 10 feet while inflicting 16 bludgeoning damage. In humanoid form, it can utilize a rapier to deal 11 piercing damage, although its True Form is more fearsome.

In terms of breath weapons, the dragon possesses two powerful options. The "Frost Breath" creates a freezing blast in a 60-foot cone, forcing a DC 21 Constitution saving throw that, on failure, results in 72 cold damage and slowing the creature. The "Paralyzing Breath" functions similarly, producing a DC 20 save that can leave opponents paralyzed until the end of their next turn if they fail.

Additionally, the dragon can shapeshift using its "Change Shape" ability, allowing it to transform into a humanoid or beast while retaining its stats, except for size. However, some of its signature attacks are limited while it is in a non-draconic form.

As a reaction, the Adult Silver Dragon can use a "Tail Attack" when it is hit by a melee attack from a visible target within 10 feet, retaliating with a powerful strike.

In combat, the dragon also has access to legendary actions that allow it to act outside of its regular turn. The "Roar" can frighten nearby creatures, requiring them to succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or face dire consequences. It can also use "Wing Attack" to knock targets prone while flying. Lastly, the "Windstorm" creates a 20-foot radius area effect complications for its enemies by increasing the movement cost and dealing cold damage to creatures within the area. Each of these abilities can shift the dynamics of a battle, showcasing the cunning and might of an Adult Silver Dragon.
