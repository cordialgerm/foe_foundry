The Vexxeh is a formidable Huge fiend characterized by its lawful evil nature. This creature serves as a powerful opponent that can pose significant challenges to adventurers due to its high damage output and special abilities. With a robust hit point total of 94, primarily earned through natural armor, the Vexxeh can withstand a fair amount of punishment in combat. It possesses exceptional physical strength (20), allowing it to hit hard in melee battles, while its moderate mobility (speed of 40 feet) enables it to engage or reposition with ease. The Vexxeh has specific immunities and resistances that provide it an edge in combat, making it less vulnerable to certain damage types and conditions. However, the creature has a notable weakness to charm effects due to its disadvantage on saving throws against being charmed.

The Vexxeh's attributes are as follows: Strength is 20 with a +5 modifier, indicating exceptional effectiveness in physical combat; Dexterity is 13 with a +1 modifier, representing average agility; Constitution is 19 with a +4 modifier, showcasing very good endurance; Intelligence is 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average intellect; Wisdom is 10 with a +0 modifier, denoting a baseline awareness; and Charisma is 12 with a +1 modifier, suggesting average influence over others.

In terms of defensive and offensive capabilities, the Vexxeh has a saving throw bonus of +8 to Strength, which is very good, and +3 to Wisdom, which is average. Its skills include intimidation with a +4 modifier, representing good effectiveness at coercing others. The Vexxeh is immune to poison damage and is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. Additionally, it is immune to the poisoned condition and the unconscious condition, enhancing its durability. The creature has truesight with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see through illusions and invisibility, and its passive Perception is 10.

The Vexxeh has unique abilities that enhance its movement and provide tactical advantages in battle. Through its "Four-Legged Lope" ability, the Vexxeh can triple its speed when it dashes, allowing it to close the distance to foes rapidly. However, it suffers from "Weak Willed," meaning it has disadvantage on saving throws against charm effects.

In combat, the Vexxeh can utilize its "Multiattack" action to make three attacks in one turn: one bite attack and two claw attacks. The bite attack has a +8 to hit, and if successful, it deals 9 piercing damage plus an additional 7 poison damage. The claw attacks also have a +8 to hit, dealing 8 slashing damage each. If both claw attacks hit the same target, the target and all creatures within a 5-foot radius must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of their next turn, as the Vexxeh emits an aura of sadistic glee, adding both crowd control and psychological terror to its toolkit.
