The Lycanthrope, specifically the Werecrocodile, is a formidable creature within the realms of Dungeons & Dragons, characterized by its unique blend of humanoid intelligence and the ferocity of a crocodile. This Medium-sized neutral evil humanoid possesses a Challenge Rating of 3, indicating that it presents a moderate challenge for a party of adventurers, earning 700 XP upon defeat. With an Armor Class of 12 and 58 hit points, its defenses are average, but its strengths lie in its resilience and ability to attack with both melee strikes and grappling tactics. The Werecrocodile's dual nature allows it to adapt to combat scenarios, switching between humanoid and crocodilian forms and employing different attacks while being highly effective in its hybrid form. However, it is vulnerable to silvered weapons, which can bypass its damage immunities against nonmagic attacks. 

In terms of attributes, the Werecrocodile has a Strength of 15, which provides a good modifier of +2, and a Dexterity of 13, granting an average modifier of +1. Its Constitution of 14 offers a good +2 modifier, giving it decent durability in battle. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores remain at average levels with 10 for Intelligence, 11 for Wisdom (both with no modifiers), and a Charisma of 14, resulting in a good +2 modifier. It has the Perception skill, but with no proficiency, its effective bonus remains very bad at +0.

One special ability, Hold Breath, allows the Werecrocodile to hold its breath for up to 15 minutes when in croc or hybrid form. This skill is especially useful when submerged or in situations requiring stealth in water.

During combat, the Werecrocodile can unleash multiple attacks. In its humanoid or hybrid forms, it can perform a Multiattack, which consists of either two Tail Swipes or Khopesh attacks, or a combination of one Bite and one Tail Swipe. The Bite attack is particularly dangerous, as it deals 7 piercing damage and can grapple the target, restraining them until they escape. If the target is a humanoid, they must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or risk being cursed with lycanthropy. The Tail Swipe can deal 7 bludgeoning damage while potentially knocking down the target unless they succeed in a DC 12 Strength check. In its humanoid form, it also wields a Khopesh, which deals either 6 slashing damage with one hand or 7 slashing damage with two hands, showcasing its versatility in melee combat.

As a bonus action, the Werecrocodile can Change Shape, transforming into a Large crocodile or a hybrid form, allowing it to maintain the same stat profile while altering its size. This ability emphasizes its adaptability in combat, enabling it to switch strategies based on the situation at hand. Importantly, when it dies, it automatically reverts to its true humanoid form, maintaining continuity within the narrative of its character.
