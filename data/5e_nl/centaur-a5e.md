The centaur is a large fey creature known for its powerful physique and agility. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, boasting a solid mix of melee and ranged abilities. Its defensive capabilities are bolstered by an armor class of 13, and it has a respectable pool of 45 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being defeated. The centaur excels in physical combat, leveraging both its hooves and a pike for melee attacks, as well as a deadly shortbow for ranged engagements. However, being a creature reliant on physical prowess, it may not fare as well in situations demanding strong intelligence or charisma, as its mental attributes are average. Overall, the centaur's blend of speed, melee attacks, and ranged capabilities makes it a versatile combatant in the fray.

The centaur has several key attributes that enhance its effectiveness in combat. It possesses a strength score of 16, which grants it a +3 modifier, making its physical attacks very good. It also has a dexterity score of 16, providing another +3 modifier, contributing to its agility and ranged attack accuracy. The centaur's constitution is at 14, granting it a +2 modifier for added resilience in battle. Its intelligence is average, sitting at 10, with no modifier.

In terms of skills, the centaur is proficient in nature, perception, and survival, each with a +5 modifier, indicating exceptional competency in these areas and showcasing its role as a guardian of the wild. It has a passive perception of 17, enabling it to notice hidden threats and traps efficiently. The centaur can communicate in Common, Elvish, and Sylvan, which allows it to interact with various beings and add depth to its character in role-playing scenarios.

The centaur's main actions include its Multiattack, which allows it to strike twice in one turn with its pike and its hooves. The pike attack offers a +5 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 8 points of piercing damage on a successful hit. The hooves attack also has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 8 points of bludgeoning damage, with a unique benefit: if this attack deals damage, the centaur's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the target for the rest of its turn, allowing it to maneuver safely.

The centaur can also engage opponents from a distance with its shortbow. This ranged weapon attack has a +5 to hit and a standard range of 80 feet, extending to 320 feet for long-range shots. It deals 10 points of piercing damage on a hit, making it a formidable ranged option. Additionally, the centaur possesses a special ability called Deadeye Shot, which it can use once per day to make a shortbow attack with advantage, significantly increasing its chances of landing a hit. This ability makes the centaur particularly dangerous in ranged combat, especially when employing surprise tactics or in situations where it can take full advantage of its surroundings.
