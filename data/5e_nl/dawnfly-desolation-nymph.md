The Dawnfly, also known as the Desolation Nymph, is a large unaligned beast that embodies the cruel and harsh aspects of nature. With its significant armor class of 13, it is moderately resilient in combat, particularly against physical attacks. This creature possesses a healthy pool of hit points at 68, making it capable of enduring several rounds of battle before succumbing. Its movement speed is versatile, featuring a walk speed of 30 feet, and it can burrow, climb, and swim at 15 feet and 30 feet respectively, allowing it to adapt to various environments. The Dawnfly is rated at Challenge Rating 2, which means it can pose a reasonable threat to an adventuring party. However, it has low Intelligence and Charisma scores, which can limit its effectiveness in social situations and strategic planning. It thrives in natural terrain and utilizes its unique camouflage and grappling abilities to outmaneuver opponents.

The Dawnfly has the following attributes: Strength 16, Dexterity 15, Constitution 16, Intelligence 1, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 4. The creature’s Strength and Constitution scores are very good, boosting its physical attack power and resilience respectively. On the other hand, its Intelligence and Charisma are very bad, making it mentally weak and ineffective in any form of social interaction.

Among its special abilities, the Dawnfly has Limited Amphibiousness, which enables it to breathe both air and water; however, it must submerge every four hours to avoid suffocation. Its Shifting Camouflage grants the beast advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in natural terrains, making it adept at hiding from enemies when in its natural surroundings.

In combat, the Dawnfly can utilize its Hinged Maw as a melee attack with a +5 to hit, reaching a distance of 15 feet. This attack inflicts 14 (2d10+3) piercing damage. If it hits a Medium or smaller creature, that target is grappled, which means they cannot move freely until they escape the grapple with a successful DC 13 check. The grappling also restricts the nymph from attacking other targets until the grapple ends.

The creature’s Swallow action allows it to consume a grappling Medium or smaller target if it hits with its Hinged Maw attack. The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, making it difficult for them to escape and deals 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of the nymph's turns. The Dawnfly can only swallow one enemy at a time, but if it dies, the swallowed creature can exit the corpse and regain freedom while standing prone.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Dawnfly can perform a Water Jet attack, which involves taking the Disengage action to avoid provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of the nymph must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded until the end of their next turn. This ability can significantly impact combat by temporarily incapacitating nearby foes, allowing the Dawnfly to control the battlefield.
