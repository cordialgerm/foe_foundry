The Great Mandrake is a Tiny, unaligned plant creature known for its unique abilities and defensive characteristics. It has a notably sturdy constitution with 44 hit points, positioning it as a resilient combatant despite its small size. With an Armor Class of 11, it relies on its natural armor to defend itself. The Great Mandrake has weak dexterity but makes up for this with a very good strength score of 14 and an exceptional constitution score of 16, allowing it to absorb significant damage. One of its standout features is its ability to emit a powerful and damaging shriek, which can stun and potentially incapacitate enemies, making it a potent threat in combat.

In terms of attributes, the Great Mandrake has a strength of 14, which provides a +2 modifier, making its physical attacks effective, categorized as good. Its dexterity is only 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is very bad for defense and agility. The constitution score is strong at 16, yielding a +3 modifier, indicating excellent resilience. Intelligence is low at 4, giving a -3 modifier, which is very bad; wisdom is average at 11, providing no modifier; and its charisma is slightly above average at 12, offering a +1 modifier. 

The Great Mandrake enjoys certain advantages in gameplay through its immunities: it is immune to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, making it particularly sturdy against traditional threats that might debilitate or damage other creatures. It possesses tremorsense up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect movement in that radius, although it becomes blind beyond this range. Its passive Perception score of 11 indicates average awareness of its surroundings.

For its actions in combat, the Great Mandrake can make two attacks with its Multiattack feature. Each bite attack requires a melee weapon attack roll with a +4 to hit, extending a reach of 5 feet toward one target and dealing 7 piercing damage on a successful hit. The mandrake's shriek ability is a significant tactical option, recharging on a roll of 3 to 6. When activated, it emanates a loud sound that requires each creature within 60 feet to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 11 thunder damage and suffers additional effects based on how far the fail was from the target number: a failure by 5 or more leads to stunned status until the end of the creature's next turn, and a failure by 10 or more knocks the creature unconscious. Unconscious creatures may attempt to wake up after each of their turns by repeating the saving throw.

This combination of features makes the Great Mandrake a versatile adversary, capable of both dealing and withstanding damage, while also having a potential for control through its shriek ability.
