Notably, the Efreeti possesses the ability to cast a variety of spells without the need for materials, making it a versatile foe in both offensive and defensive situations. Its strengths lie in its mastery of fire-based attacks, high physical attributes, and ability to manipulate the battlefield. However, it is particularly vulnerable to cold damage and relies heavily on its Dexterity and Charisma for defense and spellcasting.

The Efreeti's attributes are as follows: Strength 22 (+6), which translates to an exceptional modifier for melee attacks. Dexterity 18 (+4) indicates a good capacity for dodging attacks and enhancing its initiative. Constitution 22 (+6) provides a very good resilience to damage, ensuring it can withstand heavy hits.

The Efreeti has several special abilities and actions that make it a challenging adversary in combat. Its innate spellcasting ability relies on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 15. The Efreeti can cast spells at will, including alter self, which allows it to assume either Medium or Large forms, detect magic, and three times a day it can cast creation, gaseous form, major image, and tongues, showcasing its ability to adapt and manipulate situations. Once per day, it can summon a fire elemental using conjure elemental and shift to the Elemental Plane of Fire using plane shift. 

In combat scenarios, the Efreeti can utilize its Multiattack action to make two attacks with its brass sword or hurl flames twice. It may replace one of these attacks with a kick.

As a bonus action, the Efreeti can create a Fiery Wall once per day. This wall is a magical barrier made of flame, extending 6 inches thick, 20 feet high, and 30 feet long. Upon its creation, any creature within the wall must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Additionally, creatures that enter the wall for the first time during a turn or end their turn within it also take damage. This wall provides a strategic advantage, creating zones of denial and control on the battlefield, and remains active until the Efreeti is incapacitated or chooses to dismiss it with an action. Overall, the Efreeti serves as a powerful foe, offering significant tactical challenges to adventurers.
