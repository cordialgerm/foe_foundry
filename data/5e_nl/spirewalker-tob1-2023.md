The Spire Walker is a tiny chaotic neutral fey creature known for its swift movements and magical prowess. It possesses a high armor class of 16 due to its natural armor, combined with a total of 49 hit points, providing it with moderate durability in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it can pose a reasonable threat to adventurers, especially when leveraging its lightning-based abilities and unique mobility options. The Spire Walker excels in dexterity, boasting a +4 modifier, which translates to very good effectiveness in agility and evasive maneuvers; however, its strength is very poor, reflected in a -4 modifier. Its high Charisma of +3 supports its spellcasting capabilities, while its other mental attributes are average, ensuring decent skill versatility.

In terms of defenses, the Spire Walker is immune to lightning and thunder damage, and it has resistance to piercing damage from nonmagical attacks, making it resilient against common physical threats. Its skills include Acrobatics at +6, allowing it to perform agile maneuvers effectively. The creature has a passive perception of 10, which is average, and it can communicate in Common and Sylvan, broadening its interaction range with various beings.

The Spire Walker possesses a special ability called Energized Body. This ability triggers whenever a creature wielding a metal weapon or wearing metal armor comes into contact with the Spire Walker or makes a melee attack within 5 feet of it. In such instances, the attacker takes 3 (1d6) lightning damage, which can discourage physical assaults, particularly from those relying on metallic gear.

One of its primary actions is called Lightning Burst. This action allows the Spire Walker to make a melee or ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit. Upon a successful strike, the target sustains 17 (4d6 + 3) lightning damage, and any creatures within 10 feet of the target must perform a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 13. Failing this save results in an additional 7 (2d6) lightning damage, while success reduces the damage by half. This ability can significantly impact combat dynamics, as it can harm multiple targets at once, particularly in tight spaces.

The Spire Walker can also turn invisible with its Invisibility spell-like ability. This ability allows it to vanish until it attacks or its concentration is broken. Notably, any equipment the Spire Walker is carrying or wearing also becomes invisible, making it a cunning opponent that can attack unexpectedly.

Lastly, the Spire Walker can use its bonus action, Steeple Step, to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, but this movement must terminate on a narrow feature, such as a building's steeple or the mast of a ship. This ability offers tremendous mobility, allowing it to evade attacks or reposition itself strategically during combat. Overall, the Spire Walker's blend of agility, magical prowess, and cunning tactics makes it a formidable opponent in a D&D encounter.
