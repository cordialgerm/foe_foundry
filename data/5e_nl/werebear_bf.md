The Werebear is a formidable medium humanoid character known for its ability to transform into a bear or a bear-humanoid hybrid. It serves as a powerful combatant capable of dealing significant damage while also having the option to grapple opponents, making it an effective choice in both frontline and control roles during encounters. With a challenge rating of 5, the Werebear boasts a solid set of stats, aiding in its resilience and effectiveness in battle. However, its low Armor Class when in humanoid form can make it vulnerable if not positioned correctly. Notably, the Werebear's transformative abilities and the potential to curse its enemies with lycanthropy add layers to its tactics.

The Werebear has an Armor Class of 10 when in humanoid form, which is considered very bad for a creature of its level, and 11 when in bear or hybrid form, which is still bad. With 126 hit points, it has good durability, allowing it to withstand considerable damage in battle. The Werebear's speed is 30 feet in humanoid form, while it gains a speed of 40 feet and a climbing speed of 30 feet when in bear or hybrid form, offering good maneuverability.

Regarding attributes, the Werebear has a Strength score of +5, indicating exceptional physical prowess, making its attacks hit hard and providing a very good advantage in grappling situations. Its Dexterity is +0, which is average, offering no bonus to its agility. Constitution is +3, granting it good resilience. Intelligence stands at +0, providing average capabilities in mental tasks. Wisdom is +4, making it very good at perception checks and other wisdom-related tasks, while Charisma is +1, considered average.

The Werebear has a Perception score of 14, allowing it to notice details quite well. Its stealth score is 10, meaning it is average at sneaking. It can communicate in Common but cannot speak while in bear form. 

One noteworthy special ability is "Heightened Smell," which increases the Werebear's Perception by smell to 19, giving it exceptional tracking capabilities.

In combat, the Werebear can make a "Multiattack," allowing it to deliver three attacks with its Claws or a Greataxe. It can replace one attack with a Bite if in bear or hybrid form. If two Claw attacks hit the same creature, that creature is grappled, with an escape DC of 15. This ability showcases the Werebear's capacity to control opponents by keeping them restrained.

The "Bite" attack is available only in bear or hybrid form, providing a +8 to hit, with a range of 5 feet, dealing 16 piercing damage on a hit. Furthermore, if the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with the werebear lycanthropy.

The Werebearâ€™s "Claw" attack also comes into play in bear or hybrid form with a +8 to hit, and it does 14 slashing damage. The "Greataxe" is used only in humanoid or hybrid form, also featuring a +8 to hit, dealing 11 slashing damage.

For bonus actions, the Werebear has the "Change Shape" ability, allowing it to transform into either a Medium or Large bear, a Large bear-humanoid hybrid, or revert back to its humanoid form. Its statistics remain the same across forms, except for size, speed, and AC, which adds versatility in combat. The "Pin" bonus action allows it to knock a grappled creature prone, restraining them until the grapple ends, further enhancing its control in battle.

Overall, the Werebear is a dynamic combatant with noteworthy transformations and potent attack options, making it a significant presence in any encounter.
