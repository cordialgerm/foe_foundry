The Fetal Savant is a Tiny, humanoid creature whose chaotic evil nature makes it a disturbing presence in any encounter. It possesses a relatively low Armor Class of 11 and moderate hit points totaling 32, which makes it somewhat vulnerable to attacks. However, its unique abilities, such as the Enchanted Cage, grant it significant defensive advantages, particularly immunity to damage while protected. The Fetal Savant thrives on psychological manipulation and disruption of its enemies, evidenced by its high Charisma score of 20, which enables its potent abilities like Maddening Babble. Despite its weaknesses, such as poor physical attributes and hypersensitivity to sunlight, its capacity to control and swap souls with humanoids can turn the tide in encounters, making it a formidable foe.

The Fetal Savant's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 5 (-3), which is very bad and indicates its physical capabilities are lacking.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), which is average and provides some slight agility.
- Constitution: 10 (+0), reflecting an average resilience.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1), indicating below-average mental capability.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), which is average and provides a baseline for perception and situational awareness.
- Charisma: 20 (+5), marking exceptional social and mystical influence.

The Fetal Savant has notable saving throws: 
- Wisdom +3, which is average.
- Charisma +7, an exceptional modifier that enhances its effectiveness in social interactions and magical engagements.

The creature is skilled in perception with a +3 modifier, which is average. It has immunities to psychic damage and advantages against being charmed or frightened due to its unique conditions. Its darkvision grants it the ability to see in the dark up to 60 feet, with a passive perception of 13, which is beneficial for spotting hidden creatures or traps. The Fetal Savant can communicate in Dwarvish and via telepathy up to 60 feet, allowing it to relay thoughts discreetly.

In terms of special abilities, the Fetal Savant can create an Enchanted Cage. While this cage exists, the savant cannot be targeted by spells or damage, offering a protective shield with an AC of 19 and 75 hit points. This cage can move on command at a flying speed of 30 feet and poses a psychological threat by dealing psychic damage and inflicting fear if creatures come into contact with it. The cage can be destroyed, disintegrates in sunlight after an hour, and if it is damaged, attackers risk being frightened unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw.

The Maddening Babble ability allows the Fetal Savant to affect non-derro creatures within a 20-foot radius, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of their next turn. This can create strategic openings in combat, allowing the savant and its allies to capitalize on the incapacitated foes.

As for actions during combat, the Fetal Savant utilizes a Multiattack option, allowing it to make two Psychic Burst attacks. Each Psychic Burst is a spell attack with a +7 to hit, covering either close or ranged combat options (with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 60 feet). On a hit, it deals 14 (2d8 + 5) psychic damage, which can be devastating to characters with low psychic resistance.

Finally, the Soul Exchange ability, which has a recharge of 6, enables the savant to swap its soul with any humanoid within 20 feet. During this exchange, the Fetal Savant becomes paralyzed while taking control of the target's body, retaining its own high Charisma and psychic abilities. This ability can introduce intense complications in battle as it allows the savant to manipulate another character's actions and abilities while remaining protected.
