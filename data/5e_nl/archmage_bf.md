The Archmage is a formidable and highly knowledgeable spellcaster, embodying the pinnacle of magical prowess among humanoid beings. With an Armor Class of 17, bolstered by the unique Magic Ward ability, and a substantial pool of 212 hit points, it stands as a robust opponent in any encounter. The Archmage has a Challenge Rating of 12, indicating its challenge level for adventurers. It possesses strong intelligence with a +9 modifier, making its spellcasting exceptionally effective. However, it is somewhat vulnerable in physical combat due to a Strength modifier of +0. As a highly mobile and versatile character, the Archmage can leverage its spellcasting and special abilities to dominate the battlefield, but it must remain aware of its environmental restrictions to utilize its full capabilities.

The Archmage has a range of attributes that define its capabilities. It has low Strength (+0), average Constitution (+1), good Dexterity (+2), very good Intelligence (+9), good Wisdom (+6), and good Charisma (+3). The Archmage's primary abilities revolve around its spellcasting and magic resistance, allowing it to excel in magical confrontations while being somewhat limited in physical strength.

The Archmage's special abilities include Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it quite resilient against magical attacks. Its Magic Ward increases its Armor Class by adding its Intelligence modifier while it is conscious, and it provides resistance to force damage, further enhancing its durability in combat.

In terms of actions, the Archmage can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Arcane Blast attacks, with the option to use its spellcasting ability in place of one of these attacks. The Arcane Blast is a powerful ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit, dealing an average of 27 (4d10 + 5) force damage. It also has the potential to push the target away and knock it prone if the target fails a DC 17 Strength saving throw. The Burst of Magic ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, unleashes a devastating area attack that deals a total of about 51 damage (half if saved against) in two different damage types—force and a type of the Archmage's choice (acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder)—targeting creatures within a 20-foot radius.

The Archmage is also a highly capable spellcaster, utilizing Intelligence as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 17. It can cast various spells including detect magic, disguise self, mage hand, and prestidigitation at will. It can use charm, dispel magic, fly, invisibility (self only), and mirror image three times per day. Once per day, it can cast powerful spells like dimension door, greater hold, and wall of force, allowing it to manipulate the battlefield strategically.

Additionally, the Archmage has a bonus action called Shimmering Step, allowing it to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, accompanied by a visual representation of arcane energy at the start and end of the movement. This ability enhances its mobility, permitting quick repositioning during combat.

Finally, its Counter Spell reaction is a defensive measure against enemy spellcasters. When an enemy within 30 feet tries to cast a spell, the Archmage can disrupt the casting by making a +5 spellcasting ability check. This ability is particularly enhanced against spells on the Arcane source spell list due to having advantage on the check, making it a significant threat to other magic users.
