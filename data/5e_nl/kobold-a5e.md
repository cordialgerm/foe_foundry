The Kobold is a small humanoid creature known for its cunning and dexterity. With an Armor Class of 12, it can withstand moderate attacks but is quite fragile with a low Hit Points total of 7, which provides it with limited resilience in battle. Its Challenge Rating of 1/8 indicates that it is a less powerful creature, suitable for low-level encounters. The Kobold thrives in packs, utilizing its Pack Tactics ability to gain advantages during combat alongside its companions. However, it suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantages while exposed to sunlight. Overall, the Kobold serves as a skirmisher, making use of its agility and teamwork to overcome stronger foes.

The Kobold's ability scores are as follows: 
- Strength: 6, with a modifier of -2, indicating a very bad physical prowess.
- Dexterity: 14, with a modifier of +2, demonstrating good agility and reflexes that allow for effective ranged attacks and dodging.
- Constitution: 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is bad for its overall durability and resistance to damage.
- Intelligence: 10, providing an average modifier of +0, allowing it limited strategic thinking.
- Wisdom: 8, leading to a -1 modifier, reflecting poor insight and perception abilities.
- Charisma: 10, with a +0 modifier, showing a neutral ability to influence others.

The Kobold possesses several skills and senses: it has darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, and a passive Perception score of 9, which is considered average. The Kobold can communicate in both Common and Draconic languages, providing limited options for interaction.

In terms of special abilities, the Kobold has Pack Tactics, which grants it advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one allied Kobold is within 5 feet. This ability greatly enhances its combat effectiveness in groups. Conversely, its Sunlight Sensitivity makes it at a disadvantage in bright light for attack rolls and perception checks reliant on sight, which can severely hinder its performance if caught outside in the day.

When it comes to actions, the Kobold can make a melee attack with its Shiv, which has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 3 piercing damage on a hit (1d3 + 2). It can also attack at range with a Sling, which also has a +4 to hit, a range of 30 feet (normal) and up to 120 feet (disadvantage), dealing 4 bludgeoning damage on a hit (1d4 + 2). Both attacks are effective within their respective ranges, making the Kobold a versatile threat in combat.
