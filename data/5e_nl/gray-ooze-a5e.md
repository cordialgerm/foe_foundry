The Gray Ooze is a Medium-sized ooze known for its unique and dangerous characteristics. It has a low Armor Class of 8, making it relatively easy to hit, but it compensates with a decent amount of Hit Points totaling 22. The creature is slow in movement with a speed of 15 feet on land, but it can also climb and swim at the same speed. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it poses a moderate threat, primarily due to its corrosive abilities and camouflage capabilities. One of its notable weaknesses is its sensitivity to sunlight, which imposes disadvantage on its attack rolls when exposed. Overall, the Gray Ooze is a formidable opponent in dark or confined environments but struggles in bright light.

The Gray Ooze has the following attributes: Strength is 12 with a modifier of +1 (average), Dexterity is 6 with a modifier of -2 (bad), Constitution is 16 with a modifier of +3 (good), Intelligence is 1 with a modifier of -5 (very bad), Wisdom is 6 with a modifier of -2 (bad), and Charisma is 1 with a modifier of -5 (very bad). Its physical offensive capabilities are decent due to average Strength, but it lacks significant agility with low Dexterity. The high Constitution grants it good survivability.

In terms of skills, the Gray Ooze does not excel at any specific area. However, it does possess damage resistances to acid, cold, and fire, allowing it to withstand various forms of elemental attacks. Condition immunities include being blinded, charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, and prone, making it very difficult to incapacitate or manipulate. It has blindsight up to 60 feet, meaning it can perceive its surroundings without sight, although it cannot perceive anything beyond this range. The ooze does not speak any languages.

The Gray Ooze has several special abilities that make it both resilient and deadly in combat. The Amorphous ability allows it to squeeze through openings as narrow as one inch, making it difficult to contain. Its Corrosive Body ability deals 5 acid damage to any creature or metal object that makes contact with it, and nonmagical metal weapons that hit the ooze suffer corrosion, permanent damage penalties, and potential destruction after multiple hits. While it remains motionless, the ooze can conceal itself using its False Appearance ability, blending in with wet stone to ambush unsuspecting prey. The Sunlight Sensitivity ability makes it less effective in bright light, giving it a disadvantage on attack rolls when exposed to sunlight. Lastly, its Ooze Nature grants it independence from air and sleep, allowing it to persist indefinitely.

In combat, the Gray Ooze can take the Pseudopod action, which involves a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet against a single target. On a successful hit, it inflicts 3 bludgeoning damage along with 5 acid damage. Additionally, if the target wears nonmagical metal armor, that armor suffers corrosion, with a permanent -1 penalty to its Armor Class for each hit. If the penalty reduces the AC protection of the armor to 10, it is destroyed. This attack not only poses a direct threat to characters' health but also to their protective gear, further enhancing the ooze's danger in battle.
