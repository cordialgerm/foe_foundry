The Young Bronze Dragon is a formidable creature within the Dungeons & Dragons realm, often serving as a guardian of coastal regions and an ally to good-aligned adventurers. This large dragon possesses a diverse set of offensive and defensive capabilities, making it a tough opponent in combat scenarios. With exceptional physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, it becomes a force to be reckoned with. The dragon exhibits good mobility with the ability to walk, fly, and swim efficiently. It is highly intelligent and charismatic, able to manipulate and interact with others effectively. This dragon's strongest assets include its powerful breath weapons and innate spellcasting, while its vulnerabilities are limited, as it is immune to lightning damage.

The Young Bronze Dragon has an Armor Class of 17, indicating good protection against attacks. It possesses 152 hit points, providing it with a solid buffer in battle. The creature has a walking speed of 40 feet, a flying speed of 80 feet, and a swimming speed of 60 feet, showcasing its versatility in various environments. Its Challenge Rating of 10 signifies that it is a challenging opponent for a party of adventurers, with an experience point value of 5,900.

In terms of ability scores, the dragon has a Strength of 20 (+5), which is exceptional, making its physical attacks particularly potent. Its Constitution scores 18 (+4), providing it with very good resilience. Intelligence is 14 (+2), giving it average intellect for strategic planning. The dragon has Wisdom of 12 (+1), ensuring average perception in certain situations, and a Charisma score of 18 (+4), making its spellcasting very good. The Dexterity score is 10 (+0), which is mediocre, meaning it is less agile but not significantly hindered.

The Young Bronze Dragon has several special abilities. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water. The "Oracle of the Coast" ability enables it to predict the weather accurately for up to seven days and prevents it from being surprised while conscious. It has innate spellcasting ability with a Charisma save DC of 15, allowing it to cast "fog cloud" and "speak with animals" each three times per day, which provides tactical advantages in both combat and role-playing situations.

In combat, the dragon can execute a multiattack action, choosing to make a bite attack and two claw attacks or to use its "Lightning Pulse" as a substitute for the bite. The bite attack has a +13 to hit and inflicts 23 piercing damage plus an additional 4 lightning damage on a successful hit, while each claw attack also has a +13 to hit and deals 20 slashing damage. The tail attack, with the same attack bonus, deals 20 bludgeoning damage and can push the target away, creating space in combat. 

The "Lightning Pulse" allows the dragon to target a creature within 60 feet, requiring a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target receives 22 lightning damage, while those near a water source who are touching it must also make the save, making this ability highly impactful during encounters near water. 

The dragon possesses two breath weapons: "Lightning Breath," which creates a 90-foot line of lightning, causing 69 damage on a failed DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, or "Ocean Surge," which unleashes a torrent of water in a cone, pushing back and potentially knocking prone those who fail a DC 20 Strength saving throw. 

The "Change Shape" ability allows the dragon to transform into a humanoid or beast form, maintaining its stats but altering its size and attack options. Attacks become restricted based on form, with weaker options available in non-dragon forms.

As a reaction, the dragon can perform a "Tail Attack" against a creature within 10 feet if it is struck by a melee attack, providing an effective defensive mechanism.

Additionally, the Young Bronze Dragon possesses legendary actions that enhance its combat prowess. It can roar to frighten nearby creatures or use "Wing Attack" to create space in battle by knocking foes prone. The "Foresight" legendary action grants it a defensive edge by causing attacks against it to be made with disadvantage until its next turn, greatly increasing its survivability in intense skirmishes.
