Pescavitus is a small celestial creature with a neutral good alignment. It excels in aquatic environments, possessing the ability to swim at a speed of 60 feet, while it cannot move on land. With an Armor Class of 13 and hit points totaling 44, derived from eight six-sided dice plus a constitution modifier of 16, it can withstand a moderate amount of damage before succumbing in battle. It has a Challenge Rating of 1, making it suitable for lower-level adventurers. Pescavitus has a variety of strengths including magical weapon attacks that do additional radiant damage, resistance to radiant damage, and several unique abilities that can either assist allies or curse foes. However, it does not move on land, and its reliance on water could be a major weakness if the battle takes place away from aquatic settings.

The creature's ability scores reflect a good balance of attributes. It has a Strength of 12, which provides a good offensive capacity but is not exceptional. With Dexterity at 17, it has very good agility, contributing to its initiative and armor class. The Constitution of 15 translates to good resilience, enhancing its hit points. Intelligence and Wisdom both sit at 15 and 10 respectively, giving average mental acuity and basic perception abilities. Charisma is high at 16, indicating a capability for spellcasting and influencing others.

Pescavitus features several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and provide utility options. Its Celestial Weapons ability renders its weapon attacks magical, causing them to deal an additional 2d4 radiant damage on a hit. The Immortal Nature feature allows Pescavitus to function without food, drink, or sleep, making it a sexcessful guardian or ally for extended periods. Magic Resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which is very good for its survivability. Its Piscine Curse is particularly menacing; if it is reduced to 0 hit points by a creature, that creature can become cursed, gaining reduced effectiveness from healing and being detectable as a fiend through certain spells, with a chance to avoid the curse through a Charisma saving throw. This curse can also be triggered by consuming its flesh, presenting a risk for those who might be tempted. Lastly, its Water Breathing capability lets it survive solely underwater, emphasizing its need to remain in aquatic environments.

In terms of actions, Pescavitus can make a melee attack called Slam, with a +5 to hit. This attack deals 6 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 5 radiant damage, combining physical and mystical strikes effectively. It can also use the Air Bubble ability, which requires a short or long rest to recharge, to create an air bubble that allows multiple creatures to breathe underwater and swim with a speed of 20 feet for 24 hours, split among the number of creatures affected. This is exceptionally useful in aquatic scenarios. Additionally, Pescavitus can perform a Healing Touch three times a day, allowing it to restore 5 hit points to a wounded creature and remove afflictions such as disease or blindness, thus playing a supportive role in its party.
