The Adult Light Dragon is a formidable and majestic creature that embodies the essence of light and goodness in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. As a Huge-sized dragon, it represents a significant challenge with a Challenge Rating of 16, compelling players to strategize carefully. Its extraordinary abilities, including powerful breath weapons, immense hit points, and resistance to specific types of damage, make it a stellar opponent in combat. This dragon excels in both physical attacks and spell-like effects, allowing it to engage effectively with multiple foes at once. However, its reliance on high damage output may pose weaknesses against magical attacks that bypass its resistances. Notably, its capacity to function within the Ethereal Plane and access to legendary actions further enhance its versatility in battle.

The Adult Light Dragon has an Armor Class of 17, indicating a good level of defense against attacks. It possesses a sizable pool of hit points at 212, derived from rolling 17d12 plus an additional 102, making it exceptionally durable in prolonged encounters. In terms of speed, it can fly at a rate of 80 feet and walk 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver adeptly during combat. 

The dragon's ability scores are impressive: Strength is at 22 with a +6 modifier (very good), Dexterity at 10 with a +0 modifier (average), Constitution at 23 with a +6 modifier (very good), Intelligence at 16 with a +3 modifier (good), Wisdom at 18 with a +4 modifier (good), and Charisma at 17 with a +3 modifier (good). Its saving throws are particularly strong in Constitution (+11), Wisdom (+9), and Charisma (+8), making it resilient against various effects. It is also skilled in several areas, with expertise in Arcana, Nature, Perception, Persuasion, and Religion, all at +8 or +9, showcasing its knowledge and perceptive capabilities.

In terms of resistances and immunities, the Adult Light Dragon is immune to radiant damage, has resistance against fire damage, and is resilient against nonmagical attacks that deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. It is immune to being blinded, which further enhances its effectiveness in combat. Its senses include blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive perception of 19, giving it superior awareness of its surroundings. It can communicate in Celestial and Draconic.

The dragon has several special abilities that add to its intrigue in gameplay. Ethereal Sight allows it to perceive both the Material and Ethereal Planes within a 60-foot range, enhancing exploration and interaction. Illumination produces bright light in a 20-foot radius, complementing its role as a creature of light. Its Incorporeal Movement empowers the dragon to traverse through objects, adding a layer of tactical mobility during encounters. With Legendary Resistance available three times per day, it can choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, effectively circumventing debilitating effects. Its unique traversal ability, Void Traveler, allows it to travel immense distances through space without the need for basic life sustenance.

The dragon's actions in combat are multifaceted. With Multiattack, it can employ its Frightful Presence, making an attempt to intimidate opponents within 120 feet, potentially causing them to become frightened. It can execute three physical attacks: a Bite attack with a +11 to hit, dealing 17 piercing damage; two Claw attacks that also hit with +11, dealing 13 slashing damage each; and a Tail attack similarly striking with +11 for 15 bludgeoning damage.

The Frightful Presence ability requires a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw for affected creatures, whereby a failure results in becoming frightened for one minute. Affected creatures can attempt to save at the end of their turns, making it a strategic disruption in battle. The dragon can also unleash one of two types of breath weapons, which recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. The Radiant Breath inflicts significant radiant damage of 55 (10d10) in a 60-foot cone, demanding a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw for halved damage on a success. The Flaring Breath causes blinding effects to any creature caught within a similar cone, with undead foes facing additional consequences, such as being turned or destroyed if they fail their saves.

Finally, the Adult Light Dragon can utilize legendary actions, allowing it to maintain pressure in combat even when it is not its turn. The options include using Detect to gain perception assistance, executing a Tail Attack, or performing a Wing Attack, which can deal damage and knock opponents prone if they fail a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw.

Overall, the Adult Light Dragon stands out as a powerful ally or adversary for any adventuring party, showcasing a blend of strength, tactical prowess, and thematic significance in its role as a creature of light and goodness.
