The Giant Frog is a Medium-sized beast that serves as a creature commonly found in wetlands and swamps. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is considered a low-level encounter in Dungeons & Dragons. Despite its relatively modest armor class of 11 and hit points totaling 15, the Giant Frog possesses notable mobility, being able to swim at a speed of 40 feet. Its strengths lie in its ability to grapple opponents, swallow smaller creatures, and its exceptional jumping capabilities. However, it struggles with low Constitution, Intelligence, Charisma, and moderate Dexterity, making it more vulnerable in direct confrontations with more intelligent foes.

The Giant Frog has the following attribute values: 
- Strength: +2 (good)
- Dexterity: +1 (average)
- Constitution: +0 (average)
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +0 (average)
- Charisma: -4 (very bad)

In terms of senses, the Giant Frog has darkvision extending 30 feet and a Perception score of 12, allowing it to notice things in low light quite effectively. It also has a Stealth score of 11, indicating that it's moderately adept at hiding. 

Its special abilities include:
- **Amphibious**: This allows the Giant Frog to breathe both air and water, enabling it to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial environments.
- **Standing Leap**: The frog can leap up to 20 feet in a long jump and up to 10 feet in a high jump, making it extraordinarily mobile.

The actions available to the Giant Frog are:
- **Bite**: This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 5 piercing damage (rolled as 1d6 + 2). On a successful hit, the target is grappled, requiring a DC 12 escape to break free. While grappled, the target is restrained, and the frog cannot bite another target until the grapple ends.
- **Swallow**: This action allows the frog to use one bite attack against a Small or smaller creature that it is currently grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, becoming blinded and restrained. The swallowed creature has total cover against attacks from outside and takes 5 acid damage (2d4) at the start of the frog's turns. The frog can swallow only one creature at a time.

Additionally, the Giant Frog has a bonus action:
- **Reeling Tongue**: This allows the frog to extend its tongue toward a Medium or smaller creature within 15 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet closer to the frog.

Overall, the Giant Frog's capabilities allow it to excel in ambush scenarios and grappling tactics while posing a moderate threat to low-level adventurers in suitable environments.
