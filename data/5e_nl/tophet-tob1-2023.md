The Tophet is a formidable Huge Construct with a neutral evil alignment. Designed as a vessel of destruction, it stands out in combat due to its high Armor Class of 16 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 161. This creature excels in both offensive and defensive capabilities, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers. Its most notable strengths are its fire resistance and immunity to numerous conditions such as being charmed or frightened. However, its low Intelligence score of 6 indicates a lack of strategic thinking and adaptability in battles. Players must be cautious when engaging a Tophet, as its devastating fire attacks can quickly turn the tide of combat.

The Tophet has the following attributes: Strength is exceptionally high at 21, granting it a +5 modifier, which translates to a good effectiveness in melee attacks. Dexterity remains average with a score of 10, contributing a +0 modifier, making it neither agile nor clumsy. Constitution is also strong at 20, giving a +5 modifier, which supports its high hit points and resilience. Intelligence is very low at 6 (-2 modifier), reflecting its inability to perform complex thought processes. Wisdom is average at 10 (+0), and Charisma is also average at 10 (+0), indicating no special social skills.

In terms of saving throws, the Tophet excels with a +8 to Strength and Constitution saves, which is very good, and it has a +3 to Dexterity saves, reflecting an average response to physical threats. It possesses a Perception skill of +3, which allows it to notice its surroundings fairly effectively. The creature is immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage, and has resistance to cold damage, providing it with broad protection against various attacks. It is also immune to being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, underscoring its resilience to debilitating effects. With darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 13, it can navigate dark environments effectively, though it can only understand languages without the ability to speak.

The Tophet features several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. Its "Burning Heart" ability allows it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius, providing resistance to cold damage for creatures within this area. This ability can be toggled at the start of its turns. As a construct, it has the "Construct Nature" ability, meaning it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it an ever-present threat. Its "Heated Body" ability inflicts 3 fire damage to any creature that touches it or strikes it with a melee attack while within 5 feet, delivering a continuous warning to nearby foes.

In combat, the Tophet can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two powerful Slam attacks. Each Slam attack has a +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 16 bludgeoning damage along with 7 fire damage on a hit, combined with the ability to grapple smaller creatures upon impact. The "Burning Belly" action enables the Tophet to make a Slam attack on a creature it has grappled, forcing them into its flame-filled belly, thereby restraining them and subjecting them to ongoing fire damage each turn. It requires a Strength check to free oneself, with the rescuer also risking fire damage for their efforts.

It also possesses a "Gout of Flame" ability that can be used every 5 to 6 rounds, where it creates an area of flames up to 100 feet away. Creatures within a 10-foot radius of the eruption must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or incur 35 fire damage; even on a successful save, they take half damage. This powerful area attack can devastate multiple targets at once, illustrating its significant threat on the battlefield. The combination of these traits and abilities makes the Tophet a dangerous opponent that can dominate encounters through sheer physicality and devastating fire attacks.
