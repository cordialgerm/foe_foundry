Oth is a formidable Large Aberration with a lawful neutral alignment. This creature embodies both versatility and strength, making it a multifaceted opponent or ally depending on its chosen path. Oth has a solid armor class of 15 due to its natural armor and boasts a hefty 119 hit points, indicating it can withstand a good deal of damage in combat. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to parties of lower levels. Oth exhibits remarkable resilience with resistances to acid, cold, and fire damage, which gives it an edge in battles against spellcasters and elemental attacks. However, its Dexterity score is average at 10, which may limit its agility in evading attacks. Notably, Oth can choose to adopt the traits of either a Dripping Arcanist or a Paladin of Shoth, allowing it to either wield powerful magic or serve as a beacon of sacred light in battle.

Oth's attributes include a Strength of 16, which yields a good modifier of +3, allowing it to land substantial hits in melee combat. Its Constitution is also strong at 16, providing a good modifier of +3 to hit points. Intelligence sits at a low average of 11, which translates to a modifier of +0, indicating limited intellectual capabilities. Wisdom is decent at 14 with a +2 modifier, suggesting some awareness and insight. Its most impressive score is in Charisma, where it has a high 18, granting an exceptional +4 modifier; this is particularly useful for its spellcasting abilities and influence over others.

Oth's special abilities enhance its capabilities. Its Amorphous trait allows it to effortlessly move through narrow spaces without the need for squeezing, making it difficult for foes to corner or contain it. When selecting the Dripping Arcanist trait, Oth gains potent spellcasting abilities relying solely on verbal components, notably capable of casting spells with good versatility. It can cast the fire bolt cantrip, which deals 2d10 fire damage, and several spells such as command, mage armor, magic missile, augury, and detect thoughts multiple times per day. The fireball spell, which can be used once a day, provides a dramatic area effect that can inflict significant damage to multiple opponents. If Oth chooses the Paladin of Shoth trait, its Armor Class increases by 2, making it more durable. Furthermore, it can blind non-shoth creatures within a close vicinity, disrupting enemy tactics.

In combat, Oth employs its multiattack ability to deliver a combination of attacks, making two oozing slam attacks or a mix of slam and greatsword attacks when utilizing the Paladin trait. The oozing slam has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 14 bludgeoning damage plus additional acid damage, which can disrupt opponents severely. If wielding a greatsword, Oth can deal a higher average of 17 slashing damage with a similar +6 to hit. The Merge ability allows for strategic healing and resource management, enabling a shoth with low health to merge with another and share hit points, potentially surpassing normal maximums. Finally, Oth can unleash a potent acid spray attack that requires targets to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, dealing considerable damage on a failed save, reinforcing Othâ€™s dangerous presence on the battlefield.
