The Wraith Lord is a formidable Medium-sized undead creature, characterized by its chilling presence and potent abilities that instill fear and despair in its foes. It boasts an impressive Armor Class of 15 and a robust pool of 171 hit points, making it difficult to dispatch in battle. The Wraith Lord excels in mobility, capable of flying at a speed of 60 feet and walking at 40 feet, allowing it to position itself strategically during encounters. With a Challenge Rating of 13, it represents a significant threat to adventurers, dealing heavy necrotic damage while reducing enemies' hit points. Its various immunities and resistances make it exceptionally resilient, though it does suffer from light sensitivity. The Wraith Lord possesses a range of special abilities that reinforce its terrorizing capabilities and grant it the power to manipulate the battlefield.

The Wraith Lord’s ability scores reflect its menacing nature. Strength is at 14 (+2), which is above average. Dexterity is exceptional at 20 (+5), granting it good agility and making it hard to hit. Constitution is also very good at 20 (+5), contributing to its substantial hit point pool. Intelligence sits at 16 (+3), allowing for shrewd tactics, while Wisdom is very good at 18 (+4), helping it resist effects targeting mental faculties. Charisma matches Wisdom at very good 18 (+4), which enhances its fear-inducing powers and ability to command other undead.

The Wraith Lord has several notable abilities. The Aura of Fear causes creatures starting their turn within a 30-foot radius to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, or become frightened until the start of their next turn. Creatures that succeed are immune to this effect for 24 hours. The Wraith Lord radiates an Evil aura, enhancing its thematic presence. Its Incorporeal ability allows it to pass through creatures and objects, taking some damage if it ends inside an object. However, it temporarily loses this ability when hit by radiant damage. It is Light Sensitive, suffering disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks in bright light. The Undead Nature trait means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, emphasizing its otherworldly existence.

The Wraith Lord's action options are potent and varied. With Multiattack, it can unleash a combination of abilities, starting with Paralyzing Terror on a frightened target within 60 feet, forcing a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. A failure results in one minute of paralysis, creating an opening for subsequent attacks. Its Life Drain ability allows it to target creatures within 5 feet, compelling a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in significant necrotic damage—17 (5d6) or 24 (7d6) if the target is frightened or surprised—and the further reduction of the target's hit point maximum, which lasts until a long rest. In corporeal form, it can attack with a greatsword, dealing slashing and poison damage, and potentially poisoning the target for 24 hours if they fail a saving throw.

Another fear-inducing ability is Create Wraith, allowing the Wraith Lord to create a new wraith from a humanoid corpse it killed within the last day. Additionally, it can assume a Corporeal Form once per day, gaining physical presence at the cost of certain abilities and protections. If injured, it instantly reverts to incorporeal form, showcasing its ability to adapt to combat conditions. Overall, the Wraith Lord combines mobility, debilitating powers, and the ability to control other undead to become a truly fearsome opponent in any encounter.
