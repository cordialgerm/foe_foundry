The dragon's special abilities include:

- Acidic Vapors: Following the use of its Acid Breath, poisonous vapors surround the dragon. Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn, which can severely hinder the targeted creature's ability to act effectively.
  
- Amphibious: This ability allows the dragon to breathe both air and water, granting it an advantage in aquatic encounters.

- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead, providing an exceptional level of resilience against debilitating effects.

For actions, the dragon utilizes:

- Multiattack: This allows the dragon to use its Frightful Presence ability and then make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in one turn.
  
- Bite: The dragon makes a melee weapon attack with a +12 to hit, reaching 10 feet with a successful hit dealing 18 piercing damage plus an additional 4 acid damage.
  
- Claw: The claw attack also has a +12 to hit and deals 14 slashing damage on a hit.
  
- Tail: The tail attack, reaching 15 feet, also has a +12 to hit and deals 16 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

- Frightful Presence: The dragon can instill fear in its enemies. Any creature within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect. Successful saves or the end of the effect grant immunity to this ability for the next 24 hours.

- Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6): This is the dragon's signature move, exhaling acid in a 60-foot line. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, facing 49 acid damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful one.

As for legendary actions, the Adult Black Dragon can take 3 each turn, choosing one from the following:

- Detect: Automatically identifies all creatures and traps within 30 feet.
  
- Tail Attack: Makes a tail attack.
  
- Elemental Roar (Costs 2 Actions): Targets up to two creatures within 120 feet; they must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be vulnerable to acid damage until the end of their next turn.

- Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions): The dragon beats its wings, dealing bludgeoning damage to creatures within 10 feet and knocking them prone if they fail a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. It can then fly up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

If the dragon is defeated, its regional effects fade within a number of days equal to a roll of 1d10, indicating its profound influence over its territory.
