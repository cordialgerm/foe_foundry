The crocodile is a large beast known for its formidable presence in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. With an Armor Class of 12, it possesses a decent level of natural armor, making it relatively tough for its Challenge Rating of 1/2. With 25 hit points, the crocodile can endure a fair amount of damage before being taken down. It has a good movement speed of 20 feet on land and an impressive swimming speed of 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in water. The crocodile's primary strength lies in its bite attack, which can deal decent damage and allow it to grapple its opponents. However, its limitations include poor mental attributes, particularly a very low Intelligence score, indicating it lacks complex problem-solving capabilities.

The crocodile's attributes display a mix of physical and mental strengths. It has a Strength score of 14, giving it a +2 modifier, which is considered good for performing physical tasks and dealing damage. Its Dexterity is average at +0, while its Constitution is also good at +1, providing a slight increase to its endurance. The creature's mental attributes are notably weak; it has a very low Intelligence score of -4, resulting in a very bad modifier for tasks relying on intellect. Its Wisdom and Charisma scores are both average, with a +0 and -3 modifier, respectively.

In addition to its physical capabilities, the crocodile features special abilities essential for survival. The ability to hold its breath for 15 minutes allows it to navigate underwater effectively without the need for air, making it a formidable ambush predator in aquatic locales. 

In combat, the crocodile primarily uses its bite action as a melee weapon. It has a +4 to hit, allowing it a good chance of successfully piercing its target. When it succeeds, it inflicts 6 piercing damage, calculated as 1d8 plus 2. If the target is hit, it is also grappled, imposing a condition where escape requires a successful DC 12 roll. While grappling, the target is restrained, restricting their actions and making them easier prey for the crocodile, as it cannot bite another target until the grapple is released.

As a bonus action, the crocodile can perform a Death Roll against a creature it has grappled. The affected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw. If it fails, it takes 5 slashing damage calculated as 2d4; if it succeeds, it still receives half the damage, which presents a dangerous situation for any unfortunate target within its grip. This combination of grappling and dealing damage highlights the crocodile's effectiveness as a predator, ensuring it remains a notable threat in its environment.
