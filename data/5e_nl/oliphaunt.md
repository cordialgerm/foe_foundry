The Oliphaunt is a gargantuan beast known for its immense strength and formidable presence on the battlefield. Unaligned and powerful, this creature is often used as a living tank in combat scenarios, leveraging its size to trample foes and grapple enemies with its trunk. With a high challenge rating of 8, the Oliphaunt can deliver significant damage while boasting considerable hit points at 148, making it a durable opponent. Its low Dexterity indicates it is somewhat cumbersome, but its exceptional Strength allows it to execute devastating melee attacks. The creature lacks significant magical abilities or skills, emphasizing its role as a brute force combatant rather than a tactical or stealthy one. 

The Oliphaunt has an Armor Class of 14, which provides it with an average level of defense, and it possesses hit points calculated as 9d20 + 54, resulting in a substantial health pool. In terms of ability scores, its Strength is exceptionally high at 27 (+8), enabling it to hit hard and effectively, while its Constitution is also good at 23 (+6), contributing to its overall durability. Its Dexterity is very low at 9 (-1), leading to bad initiatives and poor evasion against attacks. Intelligence is minimal at 3 (-4), indicating very poor reasoning and problem-solving skills, and Wisdom is average at 11 (+0), suggesting it has no particularly good or bad perception or insight abilities. Charisma is low at 6 (-2), implying it has a very poor presence in social situations. The Oliphaunt has saving throw bonuses of +2 against Dexterity, suggesting that its defenses against more agile attacks are average at best.

The Oliphaunt's special abilities include Trampling Charge and Trunk Slam. The Trampling Charge allows it to charge toward a target to potentially knock them prone if they fail a DC 16 Strength saving throw, enabling the Oliphaunt to make a bonus stomp attack against any creature that becomes prone. This ability enhances its offensive capabilities significantly, allowing for multi-hit potential through careful movement. The Trunk Slam ability allows the Oliphaunt to deal bludgeoning damage to a grappling target, requiring a DC 17 Constitution saving throw to minimize damage. This ability serves to maintain control over enemies while dealing consistent damage.

In combat, the Oliphaunt can execute a Multiattack, using its trunk first, which can grapple and restrain a creature, followed by either a gore or stomp attack. The Gore attack has a +11 to hit and dishes out an impressive 30 (5d8 + 8) piercing damage, while the Stomp attack also has a +11 to hit and inflicts even more damage at 35 (5d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. The Trunk attack also features a +11 to hit and can restrain a Large or smaller creature with a DC 17 escape check, preventing that creature from moving effectively. Lastly, the Tusk Sweep, which has a recharge time of 5-6, allows the Oliphaunt to hit multiple targets at once, requiring those within a 20-foot cube to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage, showcasing its ability to control the battlefield and threaten multiple foes simultaneously. Overall, the Oliphaunt is a powerful combatant that excels in physical confrontations and can easily shift the tide of battle with its massive attacks and special abilities.
