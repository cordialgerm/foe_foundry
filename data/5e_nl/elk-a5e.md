The Elk is a large beast that serves primarily as a physical presence in the wilderness. With its notable speed and the ability to ram into foes, it can be utilized effectively in combat situations, particularly to knock down weaker opponents. While its offense is reasonably strong, its Armor Class of 10 makes it less resilient to attacks, and its intelligence is exceptionally low, limiting its tactical capabilities. The Elk possesses a Challenge Rating of 1/4, making it suitable for lower-level encounters where it can provide a challenge without overwhelming inexperienced players.

The Elk has the following attributes: 

- Strength: 14 (+2), which indicates a good ability to engage in physical attacks and moves with power.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), resulting in an average ability to dodge incoming attacks.
- Constitution: 14 (+2), granting it a good amount of health and resilience.
- Intelligence: 2 (-4), representing a very bad intelligence level, making it unable to strategize or understand complex situations.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), which gives it an average sensitivity to its surroundings.
- Charisma: 4 (-3), reflecting a very bad level of charisma, demonstrating it has little to no social influence.

The Elk has a passive Perception of 10, allowing it to notice typical dangers in its environment but not much beyond that. It does not communicate in any languages, adhering to its nature as a beast.

In terms of actions, the Elk can perform the following:

- **Ram:** This is a melee weapon attack requiring a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet against one target. On a successful hit, it deals 5 (1d6+2) bludgeoning damage. If the Elk has moved at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack, that target must perform a DC 12 Strength saving throw; on failure, the target falls prone. This action can significantly affect combat by both dealing damage and potentially setting up further attacks on a vulnerable opponent.

As a bonus action, the Elk can utilize:

- **Hooves:** This is also a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, but specifically targets one prone creature within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 7 (2d4+2) bludgeoning damage. Targeting prone foes allows the Elk to capitalize on their disadvantage, making this ability particularly effective against immobilized opponents.

Overall, the Elk's combination of speed and high damage potential against vulnerable targets makes it an interesting creature within its environment, suitable for encounters in diverse settings. However, its low Armor Class and intelligence level present limitations that players must navigate when facing it.
