The Worg is a large monstrosity that exhibits qualities typical of both wolves and other predatory animals. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it serves primarily as a strong combatant, capable of dealing significant damage with its bite. It has strengths in perception and adding pressure to foes through its frightening howl. However, its intelligence is notably low, limiting its strategic capabilities beyond its primal instincts. The Worg's resilience against exhaustion and fear makes it a tenacious opponent, particularly in encounters that may test its resolve. Overall, it is effective in combat situations wherein direct confrontation and intimidation are advantageous.

The Worg has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average, providing a reasonable amount of protection. It possesses 25 hit points, which allows it to endure a modest level of damage before falling in battle. The creature has a movement speed of 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver adequately in combat.

The Worg's attribute scores reflect a mixture of abilities: it has a Strength score of +3, which is considered good and allows it to hit hard in melee combat. Its Dexterity of +1 is average, providing a slight bonus to agility-related tasks but not making it particularly fast or evasive. The Constitution score of +1 is also average, contributing modestly to its endurance. Unfortunately, a score of -2 in Intelligence signifies very bad cognitive capabilities, limiting its effectiveness in tactics or problem-solving. The Worg has a Wisdom score of +0, which is neutral and does not provide significant bonuses to perception checks, but its Perception skill is strong, with a score of 14, indicating it can notice details well. The Worg has a Dexterity-based Stealth of 13, allowing it to remain undetected in certain situations, while its Charisma of -1 indicates very bad interpersonal capabilities.

The Worg's heightened senses grant it a Perception score of 19 through hearing or smell, showcasing its exceptional tracking abilities. Additionally, it has a resilience to exhaustion and fear effects, enhancing its durability in prolonged encounters.

In terms of actions, the Worg can make a bite attack with a +5 to hit, which is good, indicating a reliable chance to strike. When it succeeds, it deals 10 piercing damage (2d6 + 3) to a target, and if the target is a creature, that target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 13. If they fail, they are knocked prone, giving the Worg a tactical advantage in combat.

As a bonus action, the Worg can use its Loathsome Howl ability once per day. This ability allows it to unleash an unnatural howl that can be heard up to 300 feet away. Each creature the Worg chooses within 30 feet must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against a DC of 13 or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature has the option to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. The Worg can sense the direction of any creature that was frightened until it completes a long rest, enhancing its stalking capabilities.

Overall, the Worg is a fearsome adversary that utilizes its strengths in physical combat and psychological intimidation to maintain dominance in encounters.
