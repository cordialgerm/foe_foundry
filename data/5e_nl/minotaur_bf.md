The Minotaur is a large and formidable monstrosity known for its brute strength and aggressive combat style. With a challenge rating of 3, it poses a significant threat in battle, capable of dealing substantial damage while also being resistant to certain debilitating conditions like exhaustion and fear. The Minotaur's ability to navigate its environment flawlessly allows it to ambush foes effectively, and its charge ability adds an extra element of surprise by inflicting additional damage and potentially knocking enemies down. However, its reliance on melee tactics means it can be vulnerable to ranged attacks if it cannot close the distance.

The Minotaur has an armor class of 14, which is considered average for a creature of its challenge rating. It boasts 80 hit points, indicating it can withstand a fair amount of damage before being defeated. The Minotaur's movement speed is 40 feet, allowing it to quickly engage adversaries. Its ability scores show exceptional strength (+6) and above-average constitution (+3), making it a formidable opponent in melee combat. Its dexterity (+0) and intelligence (-2) are much weaker, marking it as less agile and less intelligent than many other creatures, resulting in a very bad dexterity modifier and a poor approach to solving complex problems. It possesses a good wisdom score (+3), enhancing its perception, which is notably high at 17, making it adept at spotting hidden threats. Its charisma score of -1 is very bad, indicating it struggles in social interactions.

The Minotaur has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Charge ability allows it to deal an extra 7 piercing damage if it moves at least 10 feet toward a target before using its Gore attack. Additionally, if the target is hit, it must succeed on a DC 14 strength saving throw or be pushed back and knocked prone. Labyrinthine Recall enables the Minotaur to remember any paths it has traveled, making it an exceptional tracker in maze-like environments. Monstrosity Resilience gives the Minotaur a distinct advantage against being exhausted or frightened, which can be tremendously beneficial in a chaotic encounter. The Reckless ability lets the Minotaur make all its melee weapon attacks with advantage on its turn, though it becomes more vulnerable to attacks from enemies during this time, making it a risky but powerful strategy. Lastly, as a Siege Monster, it inflicts double damage to structures, allowing it to break barriers and obstacles with ease.

In combat, the Minotaur makes use of its Multiattack action, which allows it to perform both a Gore attack and a Greataxe attack in the same turn. The Gore attack has a +6 to hit and can deal 11 piercing damage (2d6 + 4). The Greataxe attack also has a +6 to hit but deals significantly more damage, with a potential hit of 17 slashing damage (2d12 + 4). 

As a bonus action, the Minotaur can enter a Bleeding Frenzy when its hit points drop to 44 or fewer. During this frenzy, it increases its damage output by dealing an additional 3 damage (1d6) with each melee weapon hit, while also suffering 3 damage the first time it is struck by a melee attack in that timeframe.

Overall, the Minotaur is a powerful melee combatant with abilities that enhance its offensive capabilities and survivability, making it a threat in direct confrontations and an effective marauder in environments like dungeons or ruins.
