The Adult Blue Dragon is a formidable and imposing creature, often seen as one of the apex predators in its environment. As a huge dragon, it boasts a powerful presence, high durability, and formidable electrical attacks, making it a significant challenge for any adventuring party. With an Armor Class of 19 and a substantial pool of 267 hit points, it is well-equipped to withstand considerable damage. Its challenge rating of 16 indicates that it is intended for high-level encounters. The dragon excels in both melee and ranged combat, leveraging its impressive speed and powerful breath weapon, while its special abilities and legendary actions allow it to control the battlefield and instill fear in its opponents. However, its reliance on lightning damage means that enemies resistant or immune to such damage may have an advantage against it.

The Adult Blue Dragon has the following attributes: Strength of +7 (very good), Dexterity of +5 (good), Constitution of +11 (exceptional), Intelligence of +3 (average), Wisdom of +7 (very good), and Charisma of +9 (exceptional). It has darkvision with a range of 120 feet and keensense vision out to 60 feet, allowing it to detect hidden creatures and environments effectively. Its Perception score is 22 (exceptional), making it highly aware of its surroundings, while a Stealth score of 15 (average) indicates its ability to move quietly despite its size. The dragon can communicate in Common and Draconic.

The Adult Blue Dragon has notable special abilities. Its Charged Hide ability allows it to build up electrical charges when its Lightning Breath is not used, incapacitating any creature that starts its turn within a 20-foot radius unless they succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. It can use Legendary Resistance three times per day to automatically succeed on a saving throw it failed, greatly enhancing its survivability.

During combat, the dragon can perform a Multiattack action, which includes using its Frightful Presence to instill fear in nearby creatures before executing a Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +12 to hit and deals 18 piercing damage plus an additional 5 lightning damage. The Claw attack also has a +12 to hit, dealing 14 slashing damage, while the Tail attack deals 16 bludgeoning damage with the same attack bonus.

Frightful Presence affects all creatures of the dragon’s choice within a 120-foot radius. Affected creatures must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, or be frightened for one minute, with the possibility of repeating the save at the end of subsequent turns. The Lightning Breath is a powerful ranged attack, allowing the dragon to exhale a line of lightning 90 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures within that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 lightning damage on a failure or half that on a success; this ability recharges after a short duration.

The Adult Blue Dragon also has access to legendary actions that allow it to make additional attacks or disrupt opponents. It can automatically detect all creatures and traps within 30 feet (Detect), perform a Tail attack, or use Elemental Roar to make targets vulnerable to lightning damage for a short duration. Furthermore, its Wing Attack can potentially knock creatures prone and allow the dragon to reposition itself without provoking opportunity attacks, adding to its tactical versatility.

Overall, the Adult Blue Dragon is an awe-inspiring foe designed to challenge and intimidate adventurers, requiring strategic planning and resilience to overcome.
