The Merfolk is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies aquatic grace and versatility. With the ability to breathe both air and water, they thrive in aquatic environments and are typically agile swimmers. They possess a modest Armor Class of 12, primarily thanks to their coral armor, and relatively low Hit Points of 9, indicating that they are not particularly durable. Their Speed is 10 feet on land but increases significantly to 40 feet when swimming, highlighting their proficiency in water. The Merfolk has a Challenge Rating of 1/8, making them a minor threat to adventurers. Their stat distribution typically favors Strength and Charisma, with a Strength modifier of +1 which is classified as average, allowing them moderate effectiveness in physical confrontations.

The Merfolk has various senses, including darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing them to see in low-light conditions, and they have a Perception skill score of 12 indicating good awareness. Additionally, they have a Stealth score of 12, allowing them to move quietly and possibly evade detection effectively, as classified as good. They can communicate using Aquan and Common languages, providing them with a basic level of interaction with other creatures.

One of the Merfolk's defining features is its special ability called Amphibious, which allows it to breathe both air and water without any limitations. This ability supports their adaptability in both aquatic and terrestrial environments.

In combat, the Merfolk can perform two types of attacks. The first is the Coral Spear, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +3 to hit, reaching a distance of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 4 piercing damage, which is an average output for a creature of its level. The second attack option is Sharpened Shell, a ranged weapon attack with the same +3 to hit and a range of 20 feet to 60 feet, dealing 3 slashing damage upon a successful hit, which again is average.

The Merfolk also has access to a Bonus Action called Nimble Rush, which allows them to take either the Dash or Disengage action, promoting mobility and the ability to escape tight situations effectively.

Furthermore, the Merfolk has a Reaction called Coral Scrape that can be utilized when a creature they can see successfully hits them with a melee attack while within 5 feet. The Merfolk can force the attacker to make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. If the attack fails, the attacker suffers disadvantage on its next attack roll before the end of its next turn due to the painful abrasion from the rough coral, enhancing the defensive capabilities of the Merfolk in close combat situations.
