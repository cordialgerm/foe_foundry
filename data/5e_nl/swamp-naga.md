The Swamp Naga has several special abilities that enhance its combat and survival potential:

If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half the damage and is not poisoned. The poisoned condition can be shrugged off with repeated saving throws at the end of each turn. The cloud can be dispersed by a strong wind or at the naga's discretion as a bonus action.
