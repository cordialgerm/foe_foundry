The Duelist is a skilled and agile humanoid warrior known for their exceptional finesse in combat. Positioned as a medium creature, they thrive in one-on-one engagements, making them a formidable opponent on the battlefield. With high dexterity and strength, the Duelist can deal significant damage while effectively dodging incoming attacks. Their challenge rating of 5 indicates that they are suitable for a group of characters with an average level of difficulty, presenting a balanced challenge for adventurers. However, the Duelist's defenses, while solid, can be overcome with strategic planning and teamwork from the players.

The Duelist has an Armor Class of 16, which means they have good protection against physical attacks, making it relatively challenging for opponents to hit them. With 90 hit points, derived from rolling 12d8 plus a constitution modifier of 36, their durability in battle can be classified as good, allowing them to sustain a fair amount of damage before being incapacitated.

The Duelist's core attributes are impressive. Their Strength is 18, giving them a +4 modifier, allowing them to be exceptionally effective in physical confrontations. Their Dexterity is also 18, providing the same +4 modifier, which contributes to their agility, attack effectiveness, and a high stealth skill. With a Constitution of 16, the Duelist benefits from a +3 modifier, enhancing their hit points and resilience. Their Intelligence sits at an average level of 10, while their Wisdom of 12 gives them a +1 modifier. Finally, their Charisma is 14, contributing a +2 modifier that aids in social interactions and intimidation attempts.

When it comes to saving throws, the Duelist excels in Strength (+7), Dexterity (+7), and Constitution (+6), reflecting their capability to resist physical effects and conditions. They also possess decent saving throws for Wisdom (+4) which can help in resisting mental effects. Their skill proficiencies are quite strong as they have +7 in Athletics and Stealth, a +5 in Intimidation, and a +4 in both Perception and Survival. Their passive perception is 14, allowing them to notice hidden creatures and objects effectively.

In terms of actions, the Duelist is capable of performing a Multiattack, allowing them to attack twice during their turn, making them significantly more dangerous. Their primary weapon is the Rapier, which they wield with a +7 to hit, giving them an above-average chance to land their blows on targets within a 5-foot reach. When they hit with the rapier, they deal 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, which can significantly harm foes.

One of the Duelist's notable abilities is the Riposte reaction. When the Duelist is missed by a melee attack from an attacker they can see within 5 feet, they can respond by making a rapier attack against that attacker with advantage. This means they roll two d20s for the attack, significantly increasing their chances of successfully hitting back and potentially punishing foes who aim poorly.

Overall, the Duelist is a combat-savvy character with strong offensive capabilities, defensive qualities, and reactive strategies that make them a potent adversary for any adventuring party.
