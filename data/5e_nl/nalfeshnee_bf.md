The Nalfeshnee is a formidable Large fiend, specifically a demon, known for its terrifying presence and cunning predatory skills. With an armor class of 18 and hit points totaling 196, it poses a significant threat in combat situations, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers. The creature has impressive defensive and offensive capabilities, including flight and an extensive array of attacks. It is capable of both damaging foes and maintaining its own durability. However, despite its strengths, the Nalfeshnee is relatively slow when it comes to movement speed, and its dexterity is moderate, which presents some weaknesses that can potentially be exploited by agile foes.

The creature's attributes are as follows: Strength is +5, Dexterity is +0 (average), Constitution is +11 (exceptional), Intelligence is +8 (very good), Wisdom is +6 (good), and Charisma is +7 (very good). The Constitution modifier contributes to its impressive hit points, while its Wisdom and Charisma modifiers enhance its special abilities, allowing it to both intimidate foes and resist magical effects. The Nalfeshnee’s power is further augmented by its Demonic Resilience, which grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, alongside immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. 

In terms of senses, the Nalfeshnee possesses truesight out to 120 feet, granting it a tactical advantage in discerning hidden or invisible creatures. Its Perception score of 16 allows it to be aware of its surroundings, and its Stealth score is 10, which is fairly average. It communicates in Abyssal and can use telepathy within a range of 120 feet.

The Nalfeshnee has several notable special abilities. It can emit a Horrific Nimbus that creates a disorienting and frightening effect on mortals within 15 feet of it. Creatures that begin their turn within this radius must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of their next turn. If they fail the saving throw by 5 or more, they must Dash away from the Nalfeshnee, effectively limiting their actions. Additionally, it has Magic Resistance, which provides it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it hard to incapacitate through magical means.

During its turn, the Nalfeshnee can make multiple attacks. Its Multiattack allows it to perform one Bite attack, one Gore attack, and two Claw attacks in one action. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit, and if it strikes a frightened creature, it deals 28 piercing damage, while also allowing the Nalfeshnee to regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt. The Claw attack also has a +10 to hit and deals 19 slashing damage. The Gore attack, also with a +10 to hit, inflicts 21 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

For its mobility, the Nalfeshnee has the ability to Teleport as a bonus action, allowing it to relocate up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, enabling it to maintain advantageous positioning in battle. 

The Nalfeshnee also has a notable reaction called Sudden Feast. When a creature it can see within 20 feet is reduced to 0 hit points or dies, the Nalfeshnee can move toward that creature without provoking opportunity attacks. If it reaches within 5 feet, it can feast on the creature, regaining hit points equal to twice the defeated creature’s challenge rating or class level. This ability not only provides immediate healing but can also impose disadvantage on the creature's next death saving throw, preventing it from easily recovering from its death state. 

Overall, the Nalfeshnee presents a mix of deception, fear, and brutal strength, making it a unique and dangerous adversary for any adventuring party. Its combination of physical attacks, special abilities, and mobility make it a versatile threat on the battlefield.
