The ghoul is a medium-sized undead creature often prowling graveyards and dark places, drawn to the scent of the living. Its primary role in combat is that of a stealthy ambusher capable of incapacitating enemies with its paralyzing claw attack. With a decent agility score, the ghoul is good at dodging attacks but is relatively fragile with an armor class of only 12 and a modest pool of 22 hit points. The ghoul is immune to poison damage and resistant to necrotic damage, making it resilient against certain types of attacks. Its unique abilities include a weakness to radiant damage, which hampers its offensive capabilities, and its undead nature allows it to operate without the need for air or sleep.

The ghoul has the following attributes: Strength of 12 (+1), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 10 (+0), Intelligence of 6 (-2), Wisdom of 10 (+0), and Charisma of 6 (-2). Its physical and mental abilities reflect its nature as an undead predator rather than a sophisticated being. The Dexterity score is good, making it capable of dodging attacks effectively, while the low Intelligence and Charisma scores are very bad, indicating poor mental acuity and the inability to influence through personality. 

Regarding skills, the ghoul has darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light within a 60-foot radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, although it cannot discern color in darkness. It has a passive Perception score of 10, which is average for detecting hidden enemies or objects. Ghouls cannot be charmed or paralyzed, they are immune to fatigue and poison conditions.

The ghoul possesses a special ability known as Radiant Sensitivity. When this creature suffers radiant damage, it suffers from disadvantage on attack rolls and Perception checks that rely on sight until the end of its next turn. This makes it cautious when facing opponents who wield radiant magic or weapons.

In terms of attacks, the ghoul has two primary actions: the Paralyzing Claw and the Bite. The Paralyzing Claw attack has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 5 slashing damage. If this attack hits a living creature that is not an elf, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the target becoming paralyzed for one minute, which can be devastating in combat as it renders the target unable to act. While paralyzed, the creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, but success makes it immune to this effect for 24 hours. The Bite attack similarly has a +4 to hit and also has a reach of 5 feet, targeting incapacitated creatures. It deals more damage than the claw, averaging 6 piercing damage. 

Overall, while the ghoul has the potential for stealth and incapacitation, its weaknesses to radiant damage and relatively low survivability mean that it often relies on surprise and ambush tactics to overwhelm its foes.
