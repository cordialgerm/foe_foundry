Its senses include darkvision up to 30 feet, enabling it to see in dark or dim conditions, and a passive Perception score of 13, which can provide an automatic evaluation of its surroundings without actively searching.

Special abilities include:  
- Keen Smell: This ability grants the Cat advantage on Perception checks that depend on smell. This means that when attempting to detect creatures or items by scent, it has a higher chance of succeeding due to rolling two d20 dice and taking the higher result.  
- Safe Landing: The Cat can fall up to 10 feet without taking any falling damage, allowing it to maneuver effectively in vertical scenarios and escape dangerous situations.

In terms of actions, the Cat has:  
- Claws: This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit, which benefits from its Dexterity modifier. The claws have a reach of 5 feet and cause 1 point of slashing damage. Importantly, if this damage reduces a Small or larger target to 0 hit points, that target takes no damage from this attack, effectively preventing the Cat from delivering a potentially lethal blow.

Overall, the Cat excels in stealth and perception while remaining a non-threatening creature well-suited for unique roles within a campaign.
