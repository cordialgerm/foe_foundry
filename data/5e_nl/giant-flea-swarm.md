The Giant Flea Swarm is a medium-sized beast that poses a notable threat in combat due to its sheer numbers and unique abilities. With an armor class of 14, it is moderately difficult to hit, while its 58 hit points give it reasonable durability for a creature of its challenge rating of 2. This swarm operates effectively by overwhelming its foes with multiple attacks, leveraging its ability to inflict continuous damage through its ravaging bites and blood-sensing capabilities. While the Giant Flea Swarm's intelligence is very low, rendering it unskilled in non-combat situations, it compensates with exceptional mobility and resistance to various damage types, making it difficult to control or restrain. However, despite its strengths, the swarm cannot regain hit points, which means it must be cautious in prolonged engagements.

The Giant Flea Swarm's ability scores are as follows: Strength 13 (+1, considered average), Dexterity 14 (+2, considered good), Constitution 14 (+2, considered good), Intelligence 2 (-4, considered very bad), Wisdom 10 (+0, considered average), and Charisma 2 (-4, considered very bad). The swarm has the following skills: it has a perception modifier of +0, which is average, indicating it does not excel in noticing nuanced details. The swarm is resistant to damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing, providing it with good survivability against many attacks. It is immune to conditions such as charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned, which makes it very difficult to incapacitate.

The Giant Flea Swarm has a keen sense of smell; its special abilities include Blood Sense, which allows it to detect the location of any blood-containing creature within 60 feet, giving it an exceptional advantage in tracking prey. The Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, enhancing its awareness and hunting capabilities. Its Ravenous ability creates additional danger for creatures with less than full health: when such a creature starts its turn inside the swarm's space, it must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 5 points of damage, representing blood loss from the swarm's relentless attacks. The swarm's mobility is enhanced by the Standing Leap ability, allowing it to jump long distances effectively. Lastly, the Swarm feature enables the Giant Flea Swarm to occupy the same space as creatures, making it a significant tactical threat in combat scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Giant Flea Swarm can use its Bite attack as a melee weapon. It has a +4 to hit, and if successful, it deals 14 piercing damage (rolling 4d6) to a creature within its space. If the swarm is reduced to half or fewer hit points, the damage decreases to 7 (rolling 2d6). This allows the swarm to remain a persistent threat throughout its engagement, taking advantage of its numbers to inflict significant damage.
