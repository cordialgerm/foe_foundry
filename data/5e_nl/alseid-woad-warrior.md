The Alseid, a Woad Warrior, is a medium-sized chaotic neutral monstrosity known for its affinity with nature and combat capabilities. With an armor class of 14 and a solid hit point total of 55, the Alseid presents a formidable challenge to adventurers, boasting a good balance of defense and offense. Its ability to move quickly, with a speed of 40 feet, allows it to reposition itself effectively in combat. The Challenge Rating of 2 suggests it is suitable for a party of low-level adventurers, providing a moderate threat. Notable strengths of the Alseid include its advantage on intimidation checks and saving throws against fear, along with its capabilities in forested environments, allowing it to navigate without leaving tracks. However, its lower intelligence makes it less effective at strategic thinking and problem-solving in scenarios requiring intellect.

The Alseid possesses the following attributes: Strength of 14, Dexterity of 17, Constitution of 12, Intelligence of 8, Wisdom of 16, and Charisma of 10. Its Dexterity is very good, enabling effective ranged attacks and enhancing its defense, while its Wisdom is also good, making it perceptive. The other attributes are average or lower, with its Intelligence being particularly bad, indicating weakness in mental acuity.

Special abilities of the Alseid include "Painted for War," which grants it and nearby allies an advantage on Charisma saves related to intimidation and saves against being frightened. This provides both offensive and defensive benefits, fostering a fearsome presence on the battlefield. The "Woodfriend" ability allows it to leave no tracks in forested areas and always know true north, enhancing its survival during adventures in natural settings.

In combat, the Alseid can utilize a multiattack, making two weapon strikes per turn. For melee combat, it wields a Greatsword, with a +5 to hit, dealing 9 points of slashing damage on a successful hit. For ranged combat, it uses a Shortbow that has a +6 to hit and can deal 6 points of piercing damage. These attacks enable it to engage effectively with enemies at both close and long ranges.

Additionally, the Alseid can use its "Dye Bomb" ability three times per day, lobbing a sphere of concentrated dye that bursts on impact. Creatures within a 10-foot radius must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be marked for 8 hours, resulting in advantage on any attacks against them if visible. This effect allows other creatures to more easily track and target the marked creature, making the Alseid a tactical asset in combat. The marking can be removed if the creature spends 1 minute bathing or through spells like prestidigitation, granting some counterplay against this ability.
