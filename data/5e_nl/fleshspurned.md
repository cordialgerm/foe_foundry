The Fleshspurned is a Medium undead creature with chaotic evil alignment, serving primarily as a combatant that thrives on causing confusion and disrupting its opponents. Its strengths lie in its ability to deal significant necrotic damage, particularly against other undead creatures, thanks to its unique Ghost Eater ability. While it has a respectable Armor Class of 14 and substantial Hit Points totaling 75, it possesses very low Strength, making it quite weak in direct melee confrontations. Its speed is notable, being able to fly at 40 feet while having no walking speed, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat. The Fleshspurned excels in stealth and has strong defenses, with immunities to necrotic and poison damage, and resistant to multiple types of damage due to its undead nature.

The Fleshspurned's attributes are as follows: Strength 1 (very bad), Dexterity 18 (very good), Constitution 16 (good), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 14 (good), and Charisma 16 (good). It has a saving throw bonus for Wisdom of +4, alongside skills in perception (+4) and stealth (+6), reflecting its capabilities as a stealthy and perceptive foe. Its passive perception is 14, allowing it to react effectively to threats. The Fleshspurned is immune to various conditions, including being charmed, frightened, or poisoned, making it resilient in combat scenarios.

The special abilities of the Fleshspurned enhance its effectiveness in battle. With the Ghost Eater ability, it gains advantage on attacks against incorporeal creatures and receives temporary hit points equal to double the challenge rating of any undead it defeats. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through objects, though it risks taking force damage if it ends its turn inside one. 

In terms of actions, the Fleshspurned has the Phantasmal Bite attack, which uses a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and deals an average of 18 necrotic damage. Additionally, if the target fails a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, it becomes ghostly for a minute, giving it the Incorporeal Movement trait while making it vulnerable to the Fleshspurned’s attacks. 

Another unique action is Chatter, where the Fleshspurned rattles its oversized teeth to unleash a cacophony that requires creatures within 30 feet to pass a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become confused for a minute. The confusion renders the affected creatures unable to act rationally, which can significantly hinder a party's effectiveness in combat. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to end the confusion, but if they succeed, they become immune to this effect for 24 hours. 

Overall, the Fleshspurned is a formidable enemy that utilizes its undead nature and unique abilities to create chaos and weaken its opponents through tactics that blend direct assaults with debilitating effects.
