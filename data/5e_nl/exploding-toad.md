The Exploding Toad is a tiny monstrosity characterized by its chaotic evil alignment. It poses an unexpected and dangerous threat to adventurers due to its explosive demise when defeated. Despite its minuscule size and meager hit points, it compensates with unique abilities and a knack for causing area damage, making it a surprisingly potent adversary. Its strengths include a higher Dexterity score which enhances its agility and stealth, while its low Strength and Intelligence stats render it ineffective in physical confrontations outside of its bite attack. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is suitable for low-level encounters but can be lethal if not approached with caution.

The Exploding Toad has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for creatures of its challenge rating. It possesses 2 hit points, represented by rolling a d4, meaning it can be easily defeated with just a single successful attack or spell. It moves at a speed of 20 feet on land and can swim at the same rate, giving it versatility in aquatic environments.

In terms of attributes, the toad's Strength is 1, which gives it a very bad modifier of -5, making it incapable of performing physical tasks effectively. Its Dexterity is 13, providing a good modifier of +1, allowing it to evade attacks reasonably well. It has an average Constitution of 11, with a modifier of +0, meaning it has no particular resilience. The Intelligence score is low at 4, resulting in an exceptional modifier of -3, indicating a lack of cognitive abilities. With Wisdom at 8, it has a bad modifier of -1, and its Charisma of 3 leads to a very bad modifier of -4.

The Exploding Toad has stealth skills with a bonus of +5, enabling it to remain hidden from intruders effectively. It also possesses immunity to fire damage, making it resilient against such attacks. The creature has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 30 feet away and a passive Perception score of 9, indicating its limited awareness. It understands Goblin but cannot communicate verbally.

The toad has several notable special abilities. It is amphibious, capable of breathing both air and water, allowing it to thrive in diverse environments. Its “Final Croak” ability is particularly dangerous: upon reaching 0 hit points, the toad explodes, filling a 10-foot-radius area. Creatures in this area must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 10 (3d6) fire damage, half damage if they succeed. The ability has the potential to catch adventurers off-guard, causing chaos in their ranks.

Additionally, the toad's “Mad Hopping” ability grants disadvantage on ranged attacks directed at it, making it harder for attackers to strike from distance. With “Selective Immunity,” the toad can opt to take fire damage without its immunity affecting it, allowing for strategic play. The "Standing Leap" ability enhances its mobility, allowing a long jump of up to 10 feet and a high jump of up to 5 feet without needing a running start.

In terms of actions, the toad can perform a bite attack which involves a melee weapon attack roll of +3 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully bites a target, it deals 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage, a minor but effective ability in close combat scenarios.

Finally, the toad's reaction, “Death Leap,” allows it to turn a missed attack into a successful hit or convert a successful saving throw by an attacker into a failure. This adds an additional layer of unpredictability, making encounters with the Exploding Toad more exciting and treacherous. Overall, the Exploding Toad serves as a reminder that even low-level creatures can wield deadly power if underestimated.
