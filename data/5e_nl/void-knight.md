The Void Knight is a formidable Medium Construct that embodies malevolence and an array of potent abilities designed to manipulate its foes and exert control on the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 10, this creature presents a significant threat, boasting an Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor and an impressive pool of 153 hit points. Its primary strengths lie in its high Strength score of 22, enabling powerful melee attacks, and its ability to deal both slashing and force damage, making it versatile in combat. However, the Void Knight's Dexterity is relatively low at 7, reflecting a slower movement speed, which may hinder its maneuverability in certain scenarios. Its abilities and actions create a dangerous combination that can greatly influence the flow of combat, while its immunities and resistances make it a challenging adversary to defeat.

The Void Knight has the following attributes: Strength of 22 (+6 modifier, which is very good), Dexterity of 7 (-2 modifier, which is very bad), Constitution of 18 (+4 modifier, which is good), Intelligence of 12 (+1 modifier, which is average), Wisdom of 16 (+3 modifier, which is good), and Charisma of 10 (+0 modifier, which is average). It is capable of succeeding in Strength saving throws (with a +1 modifier, which is bad), Constitution saving throws (with a +8 modifier due to its high Constitution score, which is very good), and Wisdom saving throws (with a +7 modifier, which is good), lending it notable resilience against various effects. The creature has a passive Perception of 17 and can communicate using Void Speech or telepathy within a 120-foot range.

The Void Knight possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. "Call of the Void" imposes a DC 13 Strength saving throw on creatures attempting to move away from it, potentially immobilizing them if they fail. Magical movements, such as "misty step," allow foes to bypass this restriction automatically, showcasing a unique interaction with spellcasters. The "Construct Nature" ability eliminates the need for air, food, drink, or sleep, granting the knight an edge in prolonged encounters. Its "Immoveable" nature means it can't be forcibly moved against its will, aside from magical means, yet it suffers from disadvantage on Dexterity checks involving Acrobatics and Stealth, making it less discreet despite its formidable presence. Lastly, upon its death, the Void Knight unleashes "Implosive End," causing 18 (4d8) force damage in a 5-foot radius as it collapses, requiring a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw for half damage.

In terms of actions, the Void Knight can execute a multiattack, making either two melee "Void Gauntlet" attacks or three ranged "Void Bolt" attacks in one turn. Its "Void Gauntlet" is a melee weapon attack that has a +10 to hit, delivering 13 (2d6+6) slashing damage combined with 18 (4d8) force damage. Additionally, if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, they must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The "Void Bolt," a ranged spell attack at +7 to hit, targets an enemy up to 120 feet away, dealing 21 (4d8+3) force damage. The "Pull of the Void" ability, which has a recharge requirement of 5-6, allows the knight to send tendrils towards up to three visible creatures within 60 feet that are not in total cover. Each target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pulled 30 feet closer to the knight, followed by taking 36 (8d8) force damage if they end up within 5 feet of it. This ability effectively pulls enemies into harm's way, creating opportunities for additional attacks.
