The Ichneumon is a formidable Large Monstrosity characterized by its impressive physical attributes and a set of advantageous abilities that make it a challenging foe in combat. With an armor class of 16, which can increase to 18 with its Mud Armor, and a substantial hit point total of 123, it displays good resilience in battle. The creature moves swiftly with a walking speed of 50 feet, allowing it to engage or retreat strategically during encounters. Its Challenge Rating of 11 signifies that it poses a significant threat, offering 7,200 experience points upon defeat. Notable strengths include its high Strength and Dexterity scores, granting it powerful melee attacks and good evasiveness. However, its low Intelligence indicates that it may struggle with tasks requiring reasoning or complex thought.

The Ichneumon has Strength of 22, which provides a very good modifier of +6, making its physical attacks particularly potent. Its Dexterity and Constitution scores, both at 18 with a good modifier of +4, enhance its ability to avoid attacks and maintain its hit points. The creature possesses average Wisdom (14, +2 modifier), allowing it to be reasonably perceptive, complemented by its Keen Hearing and Smell special ability, which gives it an advantage on Perception checks relying on these senses. Intelligence is low at 6 (-2 modifier), reflecting very bad mental acuity, while its Charisma score of 12 (+1 modifier) is average, indicating some ability to interact socially but not particularly compelling.

The Ichneumon is skilled in several areas, including Acrobatics (with a +8 modifier), Athletics (+10), Stealth (+8), and Survival (+6), showing strong physical competence that makes it adept at moving and navigating various environments. It also possesses damage resistances against multiple damage types including acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison, as well as nonmagical slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. This makes it more durable against a wide range of attacks.

The special abilities of the Ichneumon enhance its effectiveness in battle. Its Draconic Predator ability grants it immunity to the frightful presence of dragons and advantage on saving throws against their breath weapons, making it particularly dangerous when confronting these powerful foes. Evasion allows the creature to avoid damage entirely if it passes a Dexterity saving throw against area effects, demonstrating exceptional agility and toughness. Additionally, its Keen Hearing and Smell ability ensures that it excels in detecting threats or prey. The Mud Armor ability increases its armor class by 2 when applied, reflecting its adaptability and resourcefulness in combat situations.

In terms of actions, the Ichneumon uses its Multiattack to make a total of three attacks in a single turn. It can deliver two powerful bite attacks and one claw attack. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit and reaches 10 feet, inflicting an average of 20 piercing damage (4d6 + 6) upon a successful hit. If it successfully grapples a target, it restrains that target until the grapple ends, severely limiting the target's ability to act. It also has an effective Claw attack that also hits with a +10 and deals an average of 16 slashing damage (3d6 + 6), further showcasing its combat prowess. Overall, the Ichneumon stands out as a dangerous opponent, capable of inflicting significant damage while being resilient against a variety of threats.
