The Snow Giant is a huge and formidable creature, classified as a neutral giant. It possesses considerable physical strength, exceptional constitution, and notable resilience, making it a powerful opponent in battle. With an Armor Class of 11, it is relatively easy to hit, but its substantial Hit Points of 138 grant it substantial durability â€“ translating to a good amount of damage before it is incapacitated. The Snow Giant is particularly effective in snowy environments, where it can take advantage of its camouflage and special regenerative abilities. However, it has vulnerabilities to fire damage, which can be a significant weakness to exploit in combat. Overall, this creature serves as a strong melee attack option while posing environmental challenges to adventurers.

The Snow Giant has the following ability scores: Strength 19, Dexterity 12, Constitution 20, Intelligence 9, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 6. Its strength of 19 provides a very good melee attack strength, allowing it to hit hard in combat, while the constitution of 20 is exceptional, enhancing its hit point pool and making it very resilient. Its dexterity score of 12 yields an average modifier for initiative and ranged attacks, while its wisdom of 15 gives it a good perception ability. However, with a low intelligence of 9, the Snow Giant lacks in problem-solving, and its charisma of 6 indicates that interactions requiring charisma are bad for it. 

In terms of saving throws, it has bonuses of +8 for Constitution and +5 for Wisdom, which are both very good, enhancing its resistance to many effects like poison or spells that target those metrics. In addition, Snow Giants excel in athletics with a +7 modifier, allowing them to perform physical feats effectively, while a +4 in stealth is decent, and a +5 in survival suggests that they can navigate and survive in harsh terrains adequately.

The Snow Giant's vulnerabilities to fire damage mean that it takes double damage from fire-based attacks, while it is immune to cold damage, thus creating a defensive strategy against opponents that rely on cold spells or attacks. Furthermore, it is immune to being grappled or restrained, making it difficult for opponents to control its movement.

The Snow Giant has notable special abilities. The ability "Snow Camouflage" grants the Snow Giant advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in snowy terrain, making it significantly better at avoiding detection in the right environments. Meanwhile, "Snow Regeneration" allows it to regain 5 hit points at the start of its turn as long as it has at least 1 hit point and is situated in snowy terrain, giving it a sustainable edge in prolonged encounters.

When it comes to attacks, the Snow Giant can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two attacks with its club each turn. The club attack has a +7 to hit within a reach of 10 feet, dealing 11 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, which is good damage output. The Giant Snowball is a ranged attack that requires a +7 to hit, with a range of 60/240 feet. This attack inflicts 14 bludgeoning damage, augmented by an additional 4 cold damage. Moreover, the target of the snowball must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded until the end of their next turn, presenting a significant tactical challenge. 

Overall, the Snow Giant is a powerful combatant that thrives in snowy environments, making it a unique foe that adventurers must prepare for carefully to mitigate its advantages while exploiting its vulnerabilities.
