The Ziphius is a gargantuan aberration that embodies the mysteries of the deep sea. Known for its powerful aquatic abilities and formidable physical presence, the Ziphius serves as a potent threat in aquatic environments. Its high mobility in water, coupled with notable resilience against non-magical attacks, makes it a challenging opponent for adventurers. However, while its physical attacks are strong, the creature has lower mental acuity and charm, making it less effective in social interactions. Possessing unique abilities to charge at foes and create mental bonds, the Ziphius can manipulate battle dynamics to its advantage. Yet, it has limitations, such as its sole reliance on underwater breathing and a relatively slow speed on land.

The Ziphius has an Armor Class of 16, achieved through its natural armor, providing it with good defensive capabilities. It has a substantial pool of 135 hit points, calculated from 10d20+30, indicating exceptional durability in combat. Its swimming speed of 60 feet allows it to maneuver effectively in aquatic settings, whereas its walking speed of only 10 feet is considered very bad for land movement. It has a Challenge Rating of 8, rewarding players with 3,900 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of its ability scores, the Ziphius has a Strength of 19, giving it a +4 modifier, which is very good for physical attacks. Its Dexterity is average at 13, translating to a +1 modifier, while its Constitution is 16 (+3), providing good durability and resilience. The creature is not very clever, with an Intelligence of 9 (-1), and has a Wisdom of 13 (+1), meaning it is perceptive to an extent but lacks strong mental capabilities. Its Charisma is notably low at 4 (-3), making it very bad at social interactions.

The Ziphius excels in saving throws with a +7 modifier to Strength saves, making it very good at resisting grapples or physical restraints. Its skills include perception at +4, which is also considered good, allowing it to notice changes in its surroundings effectively. Furthermore, it has resistances to cold damage as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, making it durable in combat. It is immune to being prone and possesses blindsight out to 120 feet, alongside a passive perception score of 14, enhancing its awareness in dark or murky environments. It understands Aquan and can communicate telepathically within 120 feet.

The Ziphius has several notable special abilities. Its Charge allows it to deal an additional 27 (5d10) slashing damage if it moves at least 20 feet straight towards a target and successfully lands a dorsal fin attack. This ability can significantly increase its damage output in a single turn. Additionally, the Ziphius is categorized as a Siege Monster, which means it deals double damage to objects and structures, making it dangerous when it comes to destroying fortifications. 

With its Telepathic Foresight, the Ziphius can use a bonus action to connect mentally with a creature within 120 feet that it can see. If the target fails a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, the Ziphius can read its surface thoughts, granting it advantage on attacks against that creature or imposing disadvantage on attacks that creature makes against the Ziphius until the start of its next turn.

In combat, the Ziphius can perform a Multiattack, executing one Claw attack and one Beak attack. The Claw attack has a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. The Beak attack also has a +7 to hit with the same reach but deals 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the Ziphius. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, taking ongoing damage from acid at the start of each turn. The Ziphius can only swallow one target at a time. If it takes 20 damage or more while a creature is swallowed, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid regurgitating the creature, which falls prone nearby upon exit. The Dorsal Fin attack, with a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, deals a hefty 20 (3d10 + 4) slashing damage to a target. 

Overall, the Ziphius is a fearsome adversary that thrives in its aquatic domain, capable of dealing significant damage while employing its unique abilities to dominate the battlefield.
