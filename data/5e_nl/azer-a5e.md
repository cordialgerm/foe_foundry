The Azer is a Medium elemental creature known for its connection to fire and its role as a powerful combatant. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it presents an adequate challenge for a party of adventurers. The Azer boasts a solid Armor Class of 16 and a total of 39 Hit Points, which makes it somewhat durable in battle. Its main strengths lie in its fiery abilities and resistance to various damage types, including complete immunity to fire and poison, making it a formidable opponent. However, it is vulnerable to cold damage, which adventurers can exploit. The Azer’s presence on the battlefield is enhanced by its fiery aura, which can inflict damage on nearby foes, and its ability to manipulate metal through magic, allowing it to deal significant ranged damage.

The Azer has the following attributes: a Strength score of 16 (+3), making it good in physical confrontations; a Dexterity score of 12 (+1), which is average and does not provide significant benefits to agility or reflexes; a Constitution score of 14 (+2), providing good durability; an Intelligence of 10 (+0), indicating average mental capabilities; a Wisdom of 12 (+1), also average; and a Charisma of 10 (+0), reflecting no exceptional magnetic personality traits. 

In terms of skills, the Azer's passive Perception is 11, which is average for noticing hidden threats. It exclusively speaks the Ignan language, limiting its interaction with creatures that do not understand this fiery tongue. 

The Azer possesses unique special abilities, most notably the Fiery Aura. Any creature that finishes its turn within 5 feet of the Azer suffers 5 (1d10) fire damage. Additionally, the Azer emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an extra 10 feet, making it a potentially illuminating presence in dark environments.

For its actions, the Azer can perform a melee attack with its Hammer. This attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and can inflict 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, supplemented by an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage. This makes its melee attacks quite effective, allowing it to deal a combination of damage types that can exploit weaknesses in its foes. 

The Azer can also cast the Heat Metal spell, which targets a creature wielding or holding a metal item within a 60-foot range. This ranged spell attack has a +4 to hit and deals 9 (2d8) fire damage upon a successful hit. If the creature is holding the targeted metal object, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or drop the item, which can severely impair its ability to fight effectively, especially if the item is a weapon or important piece of equipment.

As a bonus action, the Azer can use Fire Step, allowing it to teleport up to 90 feet to another location that is on fire. This ability provides exceptional mobility and can be strategically used to escape danger or reposition for a more favorable attack.
