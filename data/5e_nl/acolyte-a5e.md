The Acolyte is a Medium humanoid creature often found in religious settings, acting as a novice priest or an assistant to more experienced clergy members. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it presents a moderate level of threat in combat primarily due to its spellcasting abilities rather than physical prowess. Its strengths lie in its access to supportive spells, such as healing and blessings, and its ability to deal radiant damage from a distance. However, with low armor class (10) and limited hit points (11), the Acolyte is vulnerable if engaged directly, making it reliant on allies and careful positioning during encounters.

The Acolyte has the following basic attributes: Strength is 10, Dexterity is 10, Constitution is 12 (resulting in an average modifier of +1), Intelligence is 10, Wisdom is 14 (giving a good modifier of +2), and Charisma is 10. Its defensive capabilities are not strong, and with an Armor Class of 10, it is very susceptible to physical attacks. The Acolyte has 11 hit points, which means it can withstand a small number of attacks before falling in battle.

In terms of skills, the Acolyte is proficient in medicine, providing a +4 modifier, which indicates a very good ability to treat wounds, and in religion, offering a +2 modifier for related checks, which is average. The Acolyte has a passive perception of 12, allowing it to notice hidden creatures fairly well. Additionally, it can understand and communicate in one chosen language, providing flexibility in conversations.

The Acolyte's special abilities include spellcasting, functioning as a 2nd level spellcaster with a Wisdom-based spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12, while its spell attack bonus is +4, which is an average effectiveness for hitting targets. The Acolyte has the following spells prepared: 

- Cantrips (which can be cast an unlimited number of times): 
  - **Light**: This creates a luminous orb that can illuminate dark areas.
  - **Sacred Flame**: A damage-dealing cantrip that forces a creature within 60 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw; failure results in 4 radiant damage that bypasses cover.
  - **Thaumaturgy**: This cantrip allows the Acolyte to create minor magical effects to impress or distract.

- 1st-level spells (with three available slots): 
  - **Bless**: This spell enhances the skill of up to three allies by allowing them to add a d4 to their attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute, significantly increasing their chances of success in combat.
  - **Cure Wounds**: Through touch, the Acolyte can restore a significant 6 hit points to a willing creature, which can be crucial during battle.
  - **Sanctuary**: This spell grants a target protection from being targeted by attacks until they make an offensive move or the spell ends.

In physical combat, the Acolyte can attack with a club, making a melee weapon attack with a +2 modifier for reach 5 feet, dealing 2 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Although modest in offensive capabilities, the Acolyte's potential for healing and support spells makes it a valuable asset in party dynamics, especially in settings rich with combat or conflict.
