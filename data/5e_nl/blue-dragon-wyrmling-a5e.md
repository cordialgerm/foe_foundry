The Blue Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon renowned for its affinity with deserts and lightning. With a relatively high Armor Class of 17 and 58 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, making it a formidable opponent in combat. The wyrmling possesses a solid Strength score of 16, allowing it to deliver significant bite attacks, while its Dexterity and Constitution scores contribute to its agility and durability, respectively. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are average, limiting its magical capabilities and social effectiveness. The creature's abilities, such as its unique movement capabilities and the powerful Lightning Breath, enable it to maneuver effectively through its environment and deal substantial damage in combat. While it has immunities to lightning damage, its lower resistances to other elemental attacks make it somewhat vulnerable to varied forms of assault.

The Blue Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16 with a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee combat.
- Dexterity: 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average for its agility.
- Constitution: 14 with a +2 modifier, representing good toughness.
- Intelligence: 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average mental acuity.
- Wisdom: 10 with a +0 modifier, showing an average perceptive skill.
- Charisma: 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good for any social interactions or charisma-based checks.

In terms of skills, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is proficient in perception (+2), stealth (+3), and survival (+2), allowing it to be quite competent in navigating and hunting in its environment. It has damage immunity to lightning, meaning it takes no damage from lightning-based attacks, and its senses include blindsight (10 feet), tremorsense (30 feet), darkvision (120 feet), and a passive perception score of 12, making it very adept at detecting threats in various conditions. It can communicate in Common and Draconic languages, enhancing its ability to interact with both non-dragons and other dragonkin.

The Blue Dragon Wyrmling has two special abilities that further enhance its capabilities during encounters: 
- **Desert Farer:** This ability allows the dragon to ignore difficult terrain caused by sand or gravel, granting it enhanced movement options in desert environments. It can also ignore the effects of extreme heat, making it resilient against environmental challenges.
- **Dune Splitter:** The wyrmling can remain hidden under sand and gravel for up to 4 hours, gaining advantage on Stealth checks while doing so. This ability makes it exceptionally effective for ambush tactics.

For actions, the wyrmling can perform the following:
- **Bite:** This melee attack has a +5 to hit and can reach one target within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 19 points (3d10 + 3) of piercing damage, which is significant and can pose a serious threat to low-to-mid level adventurers. 
- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6):** As a powerful area attack, the dragon exhales a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and is 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. The ability can substantially impact the battlefield, especially in tightly packed engagements, and is especially dangerous for groups of characters.

Overall, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling embodies the cunning and might typical of dragonkind, with potent abilities that can turn the tide of battle in its favor.
