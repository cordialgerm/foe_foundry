The Chained Angel is a formidable celestial being of medium size, embodying a neutral evil alignment. Despite its celestial nature, it is bound by chains that limit its freedom, granting it a unique combination of divine powers and dark inclinations. With an Armor Class of 16 and 121 hit points, the Chained Angel is quite durable in combat. It is highly mobile, boasting a walking speed of 60 feet and flying ability of 30 feet. Its challenge rating of 8 indicates that it poses a significant threat, potentially resulting in 3,900 experience points for defeating it. Notably, the Chained Angel has exceptional attributes in Strength and Charisma, making it a dangerous opponent both in melee and through its spells and abilities. However, it has weaknesses, including some damage resistances, particularly to piercing damage. 

The Chained Angel has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 18 (+4), and Charisma 20 (+5). This translates to very good physical capabilities due to its high Strength and decent Dexterity. Its Wisdom and Charisma are exceptional, enhancing its effectiveness in spells and interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Chained Angel has +6 for Dexterity, +7 for Wisdom, and +8 for Charisma, demonstrating good resilience against various effects. Its skills are also proficient in Perception, providing a passive score of 17, which is advantageous for detecting threats.

The Chained Angel enjoys certain immunities and resistances that make it even tougher to defeat. It is immune to fire and radiant damage, representative of its celestial nature, and resistant to piercing damage. As for conditions, it is immune to being charmed and exhaustion, providing it an edge in long engagements. With darkvision extending 200 feet and the ability to communicate in Celestial, Common, Infernal, and through telepathy up to 120 feet, it can engage in complex strategies during encounters.

The Chained Angel possesses several special abilities. Its Immortal Nature means it does not require food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain vigilant indefinitely. Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which is a significant asset in combat. The ability called Redemption allows the Chained Angel to react explosively to attempts to free it. If a creature tries to cast the knock spell on the chains binding it, a blast of unholy flame is unleashed, requiring a Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in both fire and radiant damage, while a successful save halves the damage. If the spellcaster survives, the Chained Angel must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to break free from its chains; otherwise, it remains trapped for a week, unable to escape through further attempts to cast the spell.

In combat, the Chained Angel can take multiple actions. It has a Multiattack option that allows it to make two attacks with its Fiery Greatsword. This melee attack has a +7 to hit and deals slashing damage with additional fire damage, making each strike extraordinarily damaging. The Fiery Greatsword attack deals an average of 11 slashing damage plus 16 fire damage, which can quickly diminish an opponent's hit points. 

Another powerful action is Fallen Glory, which can be used again after a recharge of 5 to 6. This ability affects all creatures within 50 feet, requiring them to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they take significant radiant damage and are knocked prone, while a success results in half damage with no additional effects.

For reactions, the Chained Angel has Fiendish Cunning, which allows it to respond to spellcasting within its line of sight. If a creature casts a spell on the cleric or paladin spell list, the Chained Angel can attempt to counter it with a +5 spellcasting ability check. This ability acts like the counterspell mechanic but requires an ability check regardless of the spell's level, further showcasing the Chained Angel’s cunning and strategic prowess in combat.
