The Adult Earth Dragon is a formidable Huge Dragon known for its power as a guardian of the earth and stone. With high armor class and substantial hit points, it presents a significant threat to adventurers. Its abilities allow it to manipulate the battlefield through terrain alterations, while its innate spellcasting affords tactical advantages. The dragon benefits from substantial physical attributes, particularly in strength and constitution, making it a powerful melee combatant. However, its reliance on its linked essence means that when separated from its territory, it becomes less effective. Players must strategize when engaging this creature, considering its strengths in combat alongside its unique terrain-based abilities.

The Adult Earth Dragon has an Armor Class of 19, indicating a good level of defense that makes it challenging to hit. It possesses 287 hit points, calculated as 23d12 plus 138, affording it great durability, signifying it can endure considerable damage before being defeated. Its ground speed is 40 feet, and it can fly at 40 feet, with an exceptional burrow speed of 60 feet, allowing it to traverse different terrains effectively. The dragon has a Challenge Rating of 18, which translates to a potential experience point reward of 20,000 XP, marking it as a high-tier adversary.

The dragon's abilities are reflected in its strong physical and mental characteristics, with a Strength score of 22 (+6 modifier), which is exceptional, leading to a +12 bonus on Strength saving throws and athletics checks. Its Constitution is also 22 (+6), contributing to the same strong modifier for saving throws and giving it high resilience. The dragon’s Intelligence is 22 (+6), allowing for effective use of nature-based skills and spells, with an +8 modifier for related checks. Dexterity is at 14 (+2), yielding an average modifier that impacts its initiative and certain saving throws. Wisdom and Charisma are both at 14 (+2) and 20 (+5), respectively, enabling it to engage well in insight and other Charisma-based interactions.

The dragon is resistant to damage from nonmagical weapons, which makes it less vulnerable to most mundane physical attacks. It is immune to conditions that cause petrification. The creature has superior sensory capabilities, including darkvision with a range of 120 feet and tremorsense of 90 feet, allowing it to perceive its environment exceptionally well. It also possesses a passive perception of 21. The dragon can communicate in Common, Draconic, and Terran languages.

The dragon's special abilities enhance its role in combat and interaction significantly. "Earth Glide" allows it to burrow seamlessly through nonmagical earth and stone, avoiding detection. Its "False Appearance" ability allows the dragon to camouflage itself as a rock formation when unmoving, making it hard for players to notice its true nature until they are close. With "Legendary Resistance," the dragon can opt to succeed on a failed saving throw three times a day, but doing so halves its movement until the end of its next turn, showing a tactical drawback to its powerful resilience. The "Essence Link" connects the dragon spiritually to its territory, limiting its effectiveness in combat when away from that area and affecting creatures that venture into the region that loses its essence.

In terms of spellcasting, the Adult Earth Dragon can cast "locate animals or plants," "spike growth," "stone shape," and "wall of stone," each three times per day without requiring materials. The spells allow the dragon to manipulate terrain, hinder foes, and scout effectively, contributing to its tactical nature during engagements.

For actions, the dragon can perform a "Multiattack," which consists of one bite attack and two slam attacks or a bite followed by "Rock Spire." Its "Bite" attack has a +12 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 28 piercing damage or the option to grapple and restrain a target. The "Slam" attack also boasts a +12 to hit and can deal 19 bludgeoning damage. The "Scouring Breath" allows the dragon to unleash a cone of sandy debris, forcing targeted creatures to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or suffer significant slashing damage and possible blindness. Lastly, "Rock Spire" lets the dragon create a towering spire of rock that can damage and potentially incapacitate enemies if they fail their saving throw against it.

The dragon can also perform legendary actions. "Shake the Foundation" creates difficult terrain and could knock creatures prone if the dragon is bloodied. The "Slam Attack" allows for another assault action, while "Entomb" forces a creature within 60 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw, potentially burying them and rendering them helpless. In all, the Adult Earth Dragon is a multi-faceted threat with the ability to control the battlefield, withstand damage, and assert significant pressure on adventurers who challenge it.
