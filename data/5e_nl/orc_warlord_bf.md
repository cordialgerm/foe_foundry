The Orc Warlord is a formidable medium humanoid that embodies strength and leadership on the battlefield. With a challenge rating of 4, this creature is designed for melee combat, boasting impressive armor and hit points that make it a resilient opponent. The warlord excels in dealing significant damage with its weapon attacks and possesses abilities that not only enhance its own performance but also provide strategic advantages to its allies. It is vulnerable to ranged attacks, particularly because its Dexterity score is merely average, but its martial prowess and rallying capabilities make it a valuable asset in combat scenarios.

The Orc Warlord has an armor class of 17, indicating good defense against most attacks, and it possesses 90 hit points, which grants it a high level of survivability. Its speed is 30 feet, allowing for average movement on the battlefield. The attributes are notable, with a Strength of +4, which is exceptional and allows for powerful melee attacks, a Constitution of +4 that contributes to its hit points and resilience, and a Dexterity of +2, which provides an average modifier for ranged attacks and initiative rolls. The Intelligence of -1 is very bad, limiting the warlord’s capabilities in knowledge-based skills, while a Wisdom and Charisma of +1 are average, offering slight advantages in perception and social interactions.

The Orc Warlord’s special abilities include "Martial Adept," which means that when it deals damage with a melee or ranged weapon, it adds an extra die of damage. This significantly increases the effectiveness of its attacks, making them more lethal. The "Stalwart" ability, although not detailed, suggests the warlord has robust defenses or mitigates negative effects, enhancing its durability further.

In terms of actions, the Orc Warlord can perform a multiattack, which allows it to make two Longsword attacks and one Skull Club attack, or it can make three attacks with a Longbow. The Longsword attack rolls with a +6 to hit and deals 13 slashing damage on a hit, while the Skull Club inflicts 9 piercing damage with the same to-hit bonus. The Longbow, which has a +4 to hit and can attack targets at ranges up to 600 feet, deals 11 piercing damage on a successful hit, demonstrating its versatility in combat situations.

For bonus actions, the Orc Warlord can use "Warrior’s Advance," potentially enabling tactical repositioning or combat advantages, and it also has "Warlord’s Rally," which can be used on a recharge of 4 to 6. This ability lets the warlord issue a rallying cry, granting advantage on the next attack roll for each friendly creature within 30 feet that can hear it before the start of the warlord’s next turn, bolstering team effectiveness in combat.
