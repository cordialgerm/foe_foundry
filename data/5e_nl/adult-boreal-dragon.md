With its exceptionally high Strength score of 25 (+7), it can deal significant physical damage, while its good Constitution (23, +6) boosts its durability in battle. The dragon has average Dexterity (10, +0), making it relatively slow to dodge attacks. It possesses strong mental capabilities with a decent Intelligence score (15, +2), a good Wisdom score (17, +3), and a high Charisma score (16, +3), allowing it to engage effectively in social situations or manipulate opponents.

In combat, the dragon can utilize a Multiattack option, which allows it to initiate its Frightful Presence first, instilling fear in its enemies. Each enemy within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute. This fear effect can heavily disrupt opponents' strategies, forcing them to either flee or miss their actions. Additionally, the dragon makes three attacks in one turn: a bite attack, which has a +13 to hit and inflicts an average of 19 piercing damage (2d10 + 8) on a successful hit; two claw attacks, also at +13 to hit, inflicting an average of 15 slashing damage (2d6 + 8) each; and a tail attack, dealing an average of 17 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 8) at a reach of 15 feet.

The dragon has a powerful area attack called Cinder Breath that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. It unleashes a 60-foot cone of superheated air, dealing an average of 44 fire damage (8d10) to all creatures caught in the area, who must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw to take half damage. 

In addition to its regular actions, the dragon can take three legendary actions. These include a Detect action, allowing it to make a Perception check; a Tail Attack, which is a melee tail attack; or a Wing Attack, which costs two legendary actions. The Wing Attack requires each creature within 10 feet of the dragon to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 7) and be knocked prone, following which the dragon can augment its position by flying up to half its flying speed. 

Overall, the Adult Boreal Dragon is a well-rounded and fearsome adversary, combining powerful physical attacks, magical breath weapon, and disruptive presence on the battlefield.
