The Pit Fiend is a formidable and imposing demon from the depths of the infernal realms, embodying both power and cunning. As a Large fiend with a challenge rating of 20, it serves as a potent adversary in any campaign, capable of both melee and magical attacks. The Pit Fiend has a high armor class of 19 and possesses a significant pool of hit points—300 total—making it a tough creature to defeat. Its strengths lie in its high strength and charisma scores, with a strength of 26 and a charisma of 24, enabling potent attacks and intimidating presence. However, despite its impressive power, it has weaknesses such as the vulnerability to effects that exploit its lower dexterity, which, while good, does not compare to its exceptional physical abilities. The Pit Fiend employs fear, fire, and deception in battle, making it a multifaceted threat.

The Pit Fiend has the following attributes: strength 26 (+8, exceptional), dexterity 16 (+3, good), constitution 24 (+7, very good), intelligence 22 (+6, very good), wisdom 18 (+4, good), and charisma 24 (+7, exceptional). Its saving throw modifiers are dexterity +9, constitution +13, intelligence +12, wisdom +10, and charisma +13, all of which are very good to exceptional. It is skilled in athletics (+14), insight (+10), and perception (+10). The Pit Fiend has damage immunities to fire and poison, damage resistances to cold and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, and is immune to poisoned conditions. It has truesight up to 120 feet, providing it with exceptional awareness of its surroundings, and can communicate in Infernal and through telepathy within 120 feet.

The Pit Fiend possesses several special abilities that enhance its threat level. The Fear Aura forces any creature hostile to it that starts its turn within 20 feet to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the creature becoming frightened until the start of its next turn, adding a significant psychological element to encounters. The innate spellcasting allows it to use Wisdom as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 18. The Pit Fiend can cast "detect magic" and "fireball" at will, and has three uses per day of "hold monster" and "sending," giving it tactical options and battlefield control.

In combat, the Pit Fiend can perform a multiattack action, striking with both its bite and mace. The bite attack has a +14 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing 22 piercing damage on a hit. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute, unable to regain hit points and suffering ongoing poison damage. The mace, on the other hand, also has a +14 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, deals 22 bludgeoning damage, and inflicts an additional 21 fire damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away and knocked prone.

The Pit Fiend has a unique ability called Circle of Fire, which can be used once per day while it is bloodied. A ring of fire appears around the Pit Fiend, causing damage to any creature that enters it or remains there at the end of their turn. This creates a dangerous area of effect that can hinder opponents significantly. The fireball spell can also be cast, which projects an explosion of fire at a distance, forcing creatures in the area to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid fire damage. Additionally, it can use hold monster to paralyze an opponent, providing an opportunity for the Pit Fiend to incapacitate key threats.

For bonus actions, the Pit Fiend can use its claw to deal slashing damage and grapple a target, making it hard for the target to escape while still being a threat. Alternatively, its tail can be used for an additional attack, dealing significant bludgeoning damage. Overall, the Pit Fiend is a highly dangerous opponent in any combat scenario, capable of both direct damage and battlefield control through its abilities and spells.
