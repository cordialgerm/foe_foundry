The Greyfur is a small humanoid creature known for its agility and magical abilities. With a neutral alignment, it stands out in encounters due to its unique glide ability, which allows it to control its descent when falling, making it adept at navigating vertical spaces. Its notable strengths lie in its dexterity, intelligence, and a selection of spells that can manipulate the battlefield to its advantage. However, its physical strength is lacking, making it vulnerable in direct melee combat. The Greyfur's considerable skills in Acrobatics and Stealth enhance its capability to ambush or evade attackers, while its moderate hit points allow it to withstand a reasonable amount of damage.

The Greyfur's armor class is 13, which provides a bad defense against many attack rolls. It has 67 hit points, calculated as 15d6 + 15, giving it an average amount of resilience in combat. Its movement speed is limited to just 20 feet per round, which is a very bad factor for mobility in engagements. It has a challenge rating of 3, indicating that it is suitable for encounters with characters around level 3, rewarding 700 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of ability scores, the Greyfur has a strength of 9, which results in a very bad -1 modifier; this shows its weakness in physical confrontations. Its dexterity is 16, granting a good +3 modifier, making it nimble and quick. With a constitution of 12, it has a +1 modifier, which is average for sustaining damage. The Greyfur’s intelligence is also 16, providing a good +3 modifier, making it clever and perceptive, especially useful for a spellcaster. Its wisdom score is 12, resulting in an average +1 modifier, while its charisma is a neutral 10, granting a +0 modifier.

The Greyfur possesses two primary special abilities. The first, Glide, allows it to slow its descent when falling, landing safely and gracefully without damage, and offers the capability to move horizontally during a fall, potentially gaining tactical advantages in vertical environments. This glide ability is especially useful in combat situations where height can be leveraged for surprise or retreat. The second ability focuses on being able to use updrafts, granting a more extended range of movement when subjected to environmental effects like strong winds.

In terms of actions, the Greyfur wields a staff as a melee weapon, with an attack bonus of +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully strikes a target, it deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 5 (2d4) force damage, making this a solid option for both physical and magical harm in a close combat scenario. 

The Greyfur can also launch an Arcane Bolt, making a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit within a 60-foot range. If it hits, the bolt inflicts 10 (2d6 + 3) force damage on the target, which can be particularly impactful at a distance.

Furthermore, the Greyfur has access to spellcasting abilities. It can cast spells using intelligence as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 13. It can cast certain spells at will, including Light, which illuminates areas; Mage Hand, which enables the manipulation of objects at a distance; and Prestidigitation, which allows for minor magical tricks. Additionally, it can cast Color Spray and Sleep three times a day each, allowing for crowd control and tactical positioning, as Color Spray can temporarily blind opponents, while Sleep can incapacitate weaker foes, providing the Greyfur with valuable options in a variety of encounters.
