The Will-o-Wisp is a small undead creature known for its ethereal and mischievous nature. Floating through the air, it is often encountered in dark, eerie locations and can create a sense of dread among adventurers. It possesses a high Armor Class of 17, making it relatively difficult to hit, and it has 28 hit points, allowing it to survive several rounds of combat. With its ability to fly at a speed of 50 feet, it can evade attacks effectively and control the battlefield. The Will-o-Wisp's Challenge Rating of 2 indicates it's suitable for parties of adventurers with moderate experience. It has significant strengths, including strong dexterity and various immunities, but it is physically weak, with a strength score of just 2, contributing a very bad modifier. Notably, it has abilities that deal damage to those who come too close, encouraging a tactical engagement when faced by players.

In terms of attributes and abilities, the Will-o-Wisp has the following scores: Strength 2 (very bad), Dexterity 24 (exceptional), Constitution 10 (average), Intelligence 12 (average), Wisdom 14 (good), and Charisma 12 (average). The creature is exceptionally nimble, which allows it to evade most physical threats. Its resistance to damage from a variety of elemental types and non-magical weapons increases its survivability, while its immunities to several conditions mean it cannot be affected by fatigue, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, or unconscious status effects. The Will-o-Wispâ€™s senses include darkvision up to 120 feet, and it has a passive perception of 12, enabling it to navigate dark environments effectively. It retains the ability to understand the languages it knew in life, although it cannot speak.

The Will-o-Wisp features several special abilities enhancing its ghostly nature. Its "Conductive" ability causes any creature that touches it or strikes it with a metal melee weapon to take 7 (2d6) lightning damage, encouraging players to consider their choice of weapon. The "Insubstantial" ability prevents the creature from manipulating physical objects or beings, though it can pass through them, sustaining 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn trapped within an object. "Treasure Sense" allows it to sense coins, gems, and similar non-magical wealth within a considerable range of 500 feet, providing strategic advantages. Lastly, its "Undead Nature" means the Will-o-Wisp requires neither air, sustenance, nor sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without the need for rest.

In combat, the Will-o-Wisp can use the "Shock" action to make a melee spell attack with a +4 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 10 (3d6) lightning damage on a successful hit. However, it cannot launch this attack while its glow is extinguished, which adds another layer of strategy in encounters. As a bonus action, the Will-o-Wisp can use "Illumination" to control its glow, altering the radius of bright and dim light it emits from 5 to 20 feet, changing the hue, or extinguishing its light to evade detection. This ability creates an interesting dynamic as it can make the creature virtually invisible, challenging adventurers trying to engage it.
