The Mage is a Medium humanoid creature that excels in spellcasting, possessing a wide array of potent magical abilities. With an Armor Class of 12 and 67 hit points, it can withstand moderate damage but remains vulnerable to physical attacks due to its relatively low AC. As a 9th level spellcaster, the Mage's strength lies in its intelligence, providing them with a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 modifier on spell attack rolls, marking this as a very good level of efficacy. The Mage can prepare a variety of spells across multiple levels, which allows it to control the battlefield and deal significant damage from a distance. While its physical attributes are average, it compensates with strong intelligence and dexterity scores, allowing it to dodge attacks effectively. However, it has limited melee capabilities with a dagger, which gives it a very bad output for physical damage compared to its magical prowess.

The Mage's attributes are as follows: Strength 10 (+0, average), Dexterity 14 (+2, good), Constitution 16 (+3, good), Intelligence 16 (+3, good), Wisdom 12 (+1, average), and Charisma 10 (+0, average). It has proficiency in saving throws for Intelligence (+6) and Wisdom (+4), both considered very good for resisting spells and effects in combat. The Mage is skilled in various areas, boasting proficiency in skills like Arcana (+6), History (+6), Investigation (+6), and Perception (+4), making it effective at gathering information and spotting hidden threats.

The Mage's spellcasting ability includes several powerful spells, with cantrips like Fire Bolt and Mage Hand that can be used at will. Fire Bolt allows the Mage to make a ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 11 (2d10) fire damage on a hit, which is considerable damage for a cantrip. Other prepared spells include:

- **Fireball (3rd-Level):** This is a high-damage area of effect spell that necessitates a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw from its targets. On a failure, creatures take 21 (6d6) fire damage, making it one of the Mage's most devastating offensive tools.
- **Dimension Door (4th-Level):** This spell enables the Mage to teleport up to 500 feet to a location they can see and bring along another creature, allowing for strategic repositioning in battle.
- **Greater Invisibility (4th-Level):** When cast, either the Mage or a creature they touch becomes invisible for 1 minute, providing exceptional evasion capabilities and the element of surprise.
- **Cone of Cold (5th-Level):** This powerful cold damage spell creates a 60-foot cone, dealing 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failed DC 17 Constitution saving throw, effectively debilitating multiple foes in one action.

For actions, the Mage can attack with a dagger, receiving a +5 bonus to hit and inflicting 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. However, this pales in comparison to its spell attacks. In terms of bonus actions, the Mage has access to Misty Step, allowing instant teleportation to an unoccupied space within 30 feet, very useful for avoiding dangerous situations.

The Mage's reactions include Counterspell, which can effectively thwart an opponent's spellcasting if the Mage is able to succeed on a check against a certain DC. This can dictate the flow of combat significantly when facing other spellcasters. Additionally, the Shield spell provides a +5 bonus to AC and immunity to magic missile, making it a solid defensive option against incoming attacks.

Overall, the Mage is a strategic powerhouse on the battlefield, with the ability to alter combat dynamics through powerful spells and evasive techniques, while also having moderate physical capabilities.
