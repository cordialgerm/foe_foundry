The Ancient Mithral Dragon is a gargantuan and neutral dragon that showcases extraordinary power and versatility in combat. With an impressive Armor Class of 20, its natural defenses combined with an astounding 490 hit points make it a formidable opponent. It boasts a Challenge Rating of 22, indicative of its capabilities to challenge high-level adventurers effectively. Known for its maneuverability, it can walk at 80 feet and fly at 40 feet, allowing it to control the battlefield with ease. This dragon possesses a mixture of magical and physical abilities, including traits that protect it from damage and magic, making it exceptionally resilient. Its strengths lie in its high Dexterity and Constitution, providing it with agility and durability, while its only weaknesses are limited to slashing damage, as it is immune to it. Noteworthy special abilities include legendary resistance and magic resistance, which allow it to resist spells and magically-inflicted adverse effects, reinforcing its role as a strategic and challenging foe for adventurers.

The Ancient Mithral Dragon has the following ability scores: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 26 (+8), Constitution 25 (+7), Intelligence 20 (+5), Wisdom 21 (+5), and Charisma 20 (+5). Dexterity is exceptionally strong, contributing a +15 modifier to saving throws, making it very good at avoiding attacks and spells. Constitution grants it a +14 modifier, reflecting its exceptional resilience, while Wisdom and Charisma also bolster its capabilities with +12 modifiers. The dragon has an average Strength score, indicating it is not particularly strong for physical attacks, but its intelligence is solid at +5, enabling it to understand and utilize tactics effectively. The passive Perception of 29 highlights its exceptional perception ability, making it hard to sneak by unnoticed.

In combat, the Ancient Mithral Dragon can perform a multiattack, which includes using its Frightful Presence followed by one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +15 to hit, with a reach of 15 feet, dealing 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage. Moreover, instead of inflicting damage, the dragon can end one magical effect of 7th level or lower on its target, offering significant tactical advantage. Each Claw attack also has a +15 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet. It deals 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage but carries an additional mechanic; if it hits a non-construct or non-undead target, that target must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or lose 10 (3d6) hit points at the start of its turns until the claw is removed. The Tail attack further allows the dragon to deal 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage with a reach of 20 feet.

The dragon's Frightful Presence ability affects all creatures within 120 feet that are aware of it, requiring them to succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. This fear effect can dramatically alter the dynamics of combat, forcing opponents to either defend or flee. 

The Shard Breath ability allows the dragon to exhale metallic shards in a cone, necessitating a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw for those caught within its reach. On a failed save, the target takes 73 (21d6) slashing damage, or half as much on a successful one, while also turning the area into difficult terrain for one minute, creating strategic obstacles for foes.

Additionally, the Ancient Mithral Dragon possesses three legendary actions, which can be used at the end of other creatures’ turns. The options include making a Detect action to improve its perception, a Tail attack, or a Wing Attack. The Wing Attack costs two actions and can severely impact opponents by forcing them to make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take damage and be knocked prone, creating an opportunity for the dragon to reposition itself.

Overall, the Ancient Mithral Dragon is a well-rounded and dangerous foe, combining high defensive capabilities with potent offensive strategies, making it a memorable and challenging encounter for any adventurer.
