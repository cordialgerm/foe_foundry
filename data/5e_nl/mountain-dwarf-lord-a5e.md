It possesses several unique abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat.

In terms of actions, the Mountain Dwarf Lord can perform multiple attacks:
- Multiattack allows it to strike four times with its battleaxe during a single turn, capable of inflicting substantial damage.
- The Battleaxe melee weapon attack features a +10 to hit and deals 11 (1d8 + 7) slashing damage on a successful hit.
- With the Composite Longbow, it can make ranged weapon attacks with a +10 to hit, capable of dealing 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage at ranges of 150 to 600 feet.

Additionally, it possesses unique command abilities:
- Command the Attack, usable once per day, allows the Mountain Dwarf Lord to inspire all nonhostile creatures within 30 feet to make a single weapon attack with advantage as a reaction. This ability can alter the dynamics of a battle significantly by allowing allies to strike more effectively.
- Knightly Inspiration, also once per day, provides a 1d4 expertise die on attack rolls and saving throws to creatures of the Mountain Dwarf Lord's choice within 30 feet that can understand it for one minute. This can further enhance the performance of allies in crucial moments.

For reaction capabilities, the Mountain Dwarf Lord has Shield Block, which can impose disadvantage on an attack targeting itself or a nearby ally within 5 feet, provided it can see the attacker and is using a shield. This allows it to play a protective role in combat, enhancing allies' survivability by reducing the chance of successful hits against them.
