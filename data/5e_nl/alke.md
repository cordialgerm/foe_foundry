The Alke is a large monstrosity that presents a formidable challenge in combat, rated at a Challenge Rating of 5. It possesses a solid Armor Class of 14, bolstered by its natural armor, and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 114, derived from a combination of twelve ten-sided dice plus an additional 48 points on average. With a high Strength score of 18 and excellent Constitution of 18, the Alke is both strong and durable. Its Dexterity of 15 allows for agility in movement, enhancing its offensive capabilities. However, its Intelligence is low at 4, indicating that it is not particularly insightful in tactics or strategy. Notable for its swift movement, it has a walking speed of 50 feet and can climb at a rate of 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver easily across various terrains. The Alke features several abilities that make it a dangerous foe, while suffering from low intelligence which might limit its strategic interactions in social situations.

The Alke has a Strength score of 18, granting it a +4 modifier which is very good; its Dexterity of 15 provides a +2 modifier, classified as good. The Constitution score of 18 also gives it a +4 modifier, contributing to its exceptional durability in combat. Its Intelligence is a lowly 4, resulting in a –3 modifier, which is very bad. It has a Wisdom of 13, offering a +1 modifier which is average, and a Charisma of 12, yielding a +1 modifier that is also average. The creature benefits from saving throw bonuses of +5 in Dexterity and +4 in Charisma, indicating a good level of proficiency against those types of challenges. It has a perception skill bonus of +1, allowing it to detect trouble adequately, and is immune to the petrified condition.

The Alke’s senses include darkvision out to 60 feet, granting it the ability to see in dim light as if it were bright light. Its passive perception score is notably high at 16, representing a good vigilance in its surroundings.

One of its special abilities is Back Spikes, which inflicts 14 piercing damage (rolled as 4d6) to any creature of Small size or larger that rides the Alke against its will, with a Dexterity saving throw of DC 15 to halve the damage. The Keen Sight ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, enhancing its awareness significantly. The Pounce ability allows the Alke to gain a tactical advantage; if it moves a distance of 30 feet directly toward a target and then strikes with its Claws, the target must make a Strength saving throw (DC 15). On a failure, the target is knocked prone, allowing the Alke to take a bonus action to make a Beak attack against it.

In terms of actions during combat, the Alke can perform a Multiattack, executing one Beak attack and two Claws attacks in a single turn. The Beak attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 8 piercing damage (1d8 + 4), while the Claws attacks also have a +7 to hit, dealing a more significant average of 11 slashing damage (2d6 + 4). It has a unique ability called Piercing Roll, which it can use after a recharge period of rolling a 4 to 6. This ability allows it to tuck down its head and propel itself forward spikes first, moving up to 25 feet in a straight line. As it moves, it can pass through the spaces of Medium or smaller creatures, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage (4d6) and 14 piercing damage to the first creature whose space it enters, knocking them prone on a failed Strength saving throw (DC 15).

In response to incoming attacks, the Alke can use its reaction ability, Repelling Spikes, which allows it to add 3 to its AC against a single melee or ranged attack that would otherwise hit it, providing it with an additional layer of defense as long as it can see the attacker and is not prone.
