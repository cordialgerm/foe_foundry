The Satarre is a medium humanoid creature designed as a versatile combatant. It possesses a reasonable Armor Class of 12, complemented by 40 hit points, making it fairly resilient in battle for its challenge rating of 1. The Satarre has decent physical abilities with a strength modifier of +2, dexterity modifier of +1, and constitution modifier of +1, resulting in overall good effectiveness in melee combat, particularly with its attack options. However, its intelligence and wisdom scores are average, which may limit its utility in encounters that rely on knowledge or perception checks. Notably, the Satarre is resistant to certain debilitating conditions due to its special abilities, allowing it to maintain its effectiveness in combat.

The Satarre's attributes are as follows: Strength is +2 (good), Dexterity is +1 (average), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is +0 (average), Wisdom is +0 (average), and Charisma is +1 (average). This distribution indicates that the Satarre excels in physical confrontations but does not possess significant spellcasting or mental capabilities.

In terms of special abilities, the Satarre has "Void Strength," which grants it resistance to being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and unconscious. This ability significantly enhances its durability and ability to remain active during combat scenarios. Additionally, the Satarre wields "Void Weapons," making its weapon attacks magical. This feature adds an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to every successful strike, increasing its damage output substantially.

For its actions, the Satarre can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two attacks using either its "Claw" or "Spear" options. The Claw attack uses a melee weapon with a +4 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2) combined with 3 necrotic damage (1d6). The Spear can be used either in melee or at range (with a range of 20/60 feet) and similarly affords a +4 to hit, dealing the same damage output of 5 piercing and 3 necrotic damage. This versatility makes the Satarre effective at various ranges in combat, allowing it to adapt to the situation as needed.
