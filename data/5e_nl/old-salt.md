The Old Salt is a Medium Undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This monster possesses a challenging blend of physical resilience and debilitating attacks, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 15 and 117 hit points, it demonstrates a good level of durability. The Old Salt has strong dexterity, allowing for quick movements and effective attacks. However, its intelligence is average, which may limit its tactical versatility. As an undead creature, it boasts unique abilities that enhance its role as a relentless foe, particularly against those who wronged it in life. While it is immune to poison and resistant to necrotic damage, its weaknesses mainly lie in its inability to recover from certain conditions and the reliance on its unique mechanics for rejuvenation.

The Old Salt's attributes are as follows: Strength is 13, which provides a good modifier of +1; Dexterity is 16, resulting in a very good modifier of +3, allowing it to perform dexterous actions effectively; Constitution is 15, contributing a good +2 modifier to resilience; Intelligence is 10, considered average and providing no modifier; Wisdom stands at 14, giving it a good +2 modifier that aids in perception; and finally, its Charisma is 10, leaving it with no modifier.

The Old Salt has a saving throw for Wisdom with a bonus of +3, which is considered good, enhancing its ability to resist effects targeting its mind. It also has proficiency in the perception skill, adding a +2 modifier, ensuring that it can detect hidden threats with average effectiveness. Notably, it is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and it has resistance to necrotic damage, which makes it quite resilient against common damage types in combat.

With a speed of 30 feet on land and the ability to swim at the same speed, the Old Salt has flexibility in terms of movement in aquatic environments. Its darkvision enables it to see in dim light as if it were bright light within a range of 60 feet, with a passive perception of 12.

The Old Salt possesses several special abilities that add depth to its character. It has "Experienced Sailor," granting it advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to climb aboard ships and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to maintain balance on a ship, making it agile in naval settings. The "Seaside Rejuvenation" ability allows the Old Salt to regain its strength and return to life within 13 days if its name is not cleared or if any accusers remain alive, which creates a time-related challenge for players during their encounters. Finally, its "Undead Nature" means that it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate tirelessly.

In combat, the Old Salt can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to perform two Desiccating Slam melee attacks. Each Desiccating Slam attack has a +6 to hit and deals an impressive 12 bludgeoning damage, along with an additional 7 necrotic damage. This necrotic damage not only affects the target's health but also lowers their maximum hit points by the amount of necrotic damage inflicted, unless they succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. This reduction persists until the target finishes a long rest, and if their maximum hit points are reduced to zero, they die.

Additionally, the Old Salt can unleash a "Wave of Seawater" attack that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. It creates a 30-foot cone of seawater, dealing 21 bludgeoning damage on a failed DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Targets caught in this attack begin to choke, with the option to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of their turns to expel the seawater. Those who successfully breathe water are not affected by this choking effect.

Finally, as a bonus action, the Old Salt can use "Cunning Action" to take a Dash, Disengage, or Hide action, allowing it to move rapidly or remain hidden while navigating the battlefield. This adds to its tactical prowess, making it a dynamic opponent in combat scenarios.
