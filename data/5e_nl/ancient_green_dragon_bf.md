The Ancient Green Dragon is a formidable creature from the Dungeons & Dragons multiverse, classified as a Gargantuan dragon with a Challenge Rating of 19, indicating its power level and threat to adventurers. With a high Armor Class of 21 and a staggering 333 hit points, this dragon is known for its resilience and capability to endure intense combat. The dragon boasts exceptional physical attributes, with a Strength score of +8, Dexterity of +7, Constitution of +13 (which provides a good level of resilience), Intelligence of +7 (above average for a creature of its kind), Wisdom of +9 (very good), and Charisma of +10 (very good). Notably, it can move on land at 40 feet, fly at 80 feet, and swim at 40 feet, making it highly mobile in various environments. Not only does it have excellent vision in darkness and enhanced perception, but it also has stealth capabilities that allow it to remain undetected until it chooses to strike.

One of the dragon's standout features is its Amphibious ability, allowing it to breathe both air and water seamlessly. It can unleash a terrifying Hallucinogenic Gas after using its Poison Breath, creating an area around it where creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 21) or be overcome with frightful hallucinations, leaving them terrified with a speed reduction to zero. This ability can significantly impact a party's ability to engage effectively in combat. The dragon also possesses Legendary Resistance, allowing it to choose to succeed on a saving throw when it fails, which can be crucial in its survival during battles.

The Ancient Green Dragon's Multiattack option allows it to take the initiative in combat by utilizing its Frightful Presence, potentially frightening off foes, and then attacking with a Bite, which has a +15 to hit and inflicts 19 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage. It can also make two claw attacks, dealing 22 slashing damage each. Its Tail attack has a similar attack modifier and deals 17 bludgeoning damage. The Frightful Presence forces creatures within 120 feet to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) or become frightened for 1 minute, although they can attempt to save again at the end of their turns. The Poison Breath attack can unleash a toxic cloud in a 90-foot cone, dealing a devastating 84 poison damage on a failed Constitution saving throw (DC 21), or half as much on a success.

In addition to its regular actions, the dragon can utilize Legendary Actions. It can spend one action to detect all creatures and traps within 30 feet automatically. It can also make a Tail Attack, deal additional damage, or use its Elemental Roar—a powerful roar that imposes vulnerability to poison damage on target creatures within 120 feet unless they succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 18). This dragon can also perform a Wing Attack, dealing bludgeoning damage to nearby creatures and allowing it to reposition without incurring opportunity attacks. The dragon's regional effects can manifest if it is slain, impacting the surrounding area based on the specifics of its domain.

Overall, the Ancient Green Dragon poses a formidable challenge to any party, capable of inflicting both physical and psychological damage while employing legendary maneuvers to control the battlefield.
