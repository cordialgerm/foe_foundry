The Barbed Devil is a Medium fiend with a formidable presence and a challenge rating of 5, making it a noteworthy adversary for adventurers. With an armor class of 15 and hit points totaling 102, it can withstand significant damage in combat. The devil excels in both melee and ranged combat, utilizing its high Strength score of 18 and Dexterity score of 16 to deliver punishing attacks. Its abilities allow it to grapple foes effectively, inflicting additional damage while protecting itself from many magical effects. Despite these strengths, the Barbed Devil has a few weaknesses, including vulnerabilities to radiant damage and the need for continuous engagement to maintain its control over grappled opponents.

The Barbed Devil has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4) giving it a very good attack bonus, Dexterity 16 (+3) enabling good agility, Constitution 18 (+4) contributing to its resilience, Intelligence 12 (+1) which is average, Wisdom 14 (+2) also considered good, and Charisma 14 (+2) seen as good. It possesses saving throw bonuses in Strength +7, Constitution +7, Wisdom +5, and Charisma +5, reflecting very good effectiveness against physical and mental challenges. Furthermore, the devil is skilled in Athletics (+7), Deception (+5), Insight (+5), and Perception (+5), showcasing its versatility in both combat and social interactions.

In terms of damage resistances, the Barbed Devil is immune to fire and poison damage and resistant to cold damage and attacks made with nonmagical, non-silvered weapons. It is also immune to the poisoned condition, making it durable against many debuffs. With darkvision that extends 120 feet and a passive Perception of 17, it can navigate darkness with ease, while its ability to speak Infernal and telepathically communicate within a range of 120 feet allows it to coordinate with its allies or intimidate foes effectively.

The Barbed Devil's special abilities further enhance its combat prowess. The "Barbed Hide" ability inflicts 5 (1d10) piercing damage on creatures grappling or grappled by the devil at the start of its turn, making close combat particularly dangerous for its opponents. The "Devil's Sight" ability enables it to see through magical darkness, giving it an advantage in many combat scenarios. Stated as "Lawful Evil," the devil's aura reaffirms its nature and allegiance. "Magic Resistance" grants the devil an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, allowing it to better withstand magical attacks.

In combat, the Barbed Devil can utilize its "Multiattack" option to make two claw attacks and one tail attack, or alternatively cast "Hurl Flame" twice. Each claw attack is resolved as a melee weapon attack with a +7 bonus to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage on a hit. If both claw attacks strike a Medium or smaller target, that target becomes grappled with a DC of 15 to escape, at which point the devil has advantage on attacks targeting the grappled creature. Its tail attack also carries a +7 to hit, dealing 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

"Hurl Flame" is a ranged spell attack option that allows the Barbed Devil to strike a target within 150 feet, rolling a +6 to hit and dealing 10 (3d6) fire damage on a hit. If the target is a creature, it not only takes damage but also catches fire, suffering from 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage until the flames are extinguished. If a flammable object is targeted, it ignites immediately. A creature can use an action to put out the fire.

In summary, the Barbed Devil is a cunning and powerful adversary, combining tough defenses, effective grappling tactics, and fiery ranged attacks to challenge adventurers effectively.
