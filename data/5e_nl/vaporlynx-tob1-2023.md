Among its special abilities, the Vapor Lynx has "Fog Flow," enabling it to pass through spaces as narrow as one inch while in fog or mist without penalty. "Hazesight" allows it to see through fog and mist as if unobscured, giving it a significant edge in combat situations shrouded in mist. Additionally, "Swamp Walk" ensures that difficult terrain from mud or water does not hinder its movement, allowing it to traverse various landscapes more effectively.

Notably, it can unleash its "Poison Breath" attack, which has a recharge mechanic requiring it to roll a 5 or 6 to use. This ability allows it to exhale a cloud of poisonous fog in a 20-foot radius, creating heavily obscured terrain. Creatures caught in this area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, facing 28 poison damage on a failure, alongside the poisoned condition, or half damage on success. The fog lingers for one minute, presenting ongoing danger to those within its radius.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Vapor Lynx can perform a "Fog Step," teleporting up to 30 feet to another unoccupied space containing fog, allowing for quick repositioning during battles and enhancing its elusive nature.
