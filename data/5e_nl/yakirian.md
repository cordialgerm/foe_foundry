The Yakirian is a medium humanoid creature known for its lawful neutral alignment. It exhibits notable physical strength and resilience, making it a formidable opponent in combat. It possesses moderate armor class and a significant pool of hit points, indicating durability. The Yakirian is particularly effective at resisting various psychological effects due to its special ability, Resilient Soul, which enhances its mental fortitude. While it has decent melee combat capabilities, its true strength lies in its ability to assimilate knowledge and enhance its capabilities through its unique action, Consume Heart. The creature can thrive in combat, but its low charisma suggests that it may struggle in social scenarios.

The Yakirian has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average for its challenge rating of 2. With 67 hit points, derived from rolling nine eight-sided dice plus an additional twenty-seven, it is notably robust, indicating a good level of resilience in battle. Its speed of 40 feet allows it to maneuver effectively on the battlefield. The challenge rating of 2 signifies it can provide a moderate level of difficulty for adventurers, offering 450 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Yakirian has a Strength score of 17, reflecting a modifier of +3, which is considered very good. This grants it a strong advantage in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity stands at 11, which results in a modifier of +0, deemed average, revealing that its agility is not particularly exceptional. The Constitution score of 16, with a +3 modifier, again indicates a very good level of endurance. The Intelligence score is 10, resulting in an average modifier of +0, while its Wisdom score is 12 with a +1 modifier, also considered average. Lastly, its Charisma score is 8, which results in a modifier of -1, indicating a very bad aptitude for social interactions.

The Yakirian has saving throw bonuses involving Wisdom, with a modifier of +3, which is good. It also possesses skills in arcana, where it has a +4 modifier, representing a good proficiency in magical knowledge. It has resistance to cold damage, making it effectively resilient against such elemental attacks. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light within a 60-foot range, while its passive perception of 11 is average. The Yakirian communicates in Common and its own language, Yakirian, and has the ability to understand Void Speech, although it chooses not to speak it.

The Yakirianâ€™s special ability, Resilient Soul, grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or confused, enhancing its effectiveness against manipulation in combat. This ability also provides strong resistance against effects that cause corruption or madness.

In terms of actions, the Yakirian can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two melee attacks in one turn: one with its gore and another with its ritual knife. The Gore attack has a +5 to hit and can deal 7 piercing damage (1d8 + 3), while the Ritual Knife similarly has a +5 to hit and inflicts 6 piercing damage (1d6 + 3). 

The Consume Heart ability allows the Yakirian to absorb the heart of a dead humanoid or giant within close proximity. If the target died within the last minute, the Yakirian gains substantial benefits: it can ask two questions and instantly learn the answers if the deceased knew them. Furthermore, its maximum and current hit points increase by 10 for one hour, and it gains advantage on all Strength-based attack rolls and ability checks, alongside all saving throws for the same duration. This ability can significantly shift the course of a battle, allowing the Yakirian to become a more potent threat after defeating an enemy.
