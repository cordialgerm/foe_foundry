The Imperial Ghoul possesses two special abilities. "Hungry Dead Nature" indicates that it does not require air or sleep, granting it exceptional endurance during extended campaigns or encounters. "Turning Defiance" provides advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead, offering it and nearby ghouls an exceptional defense against certain divine threats.

In combat, the Imperial Ghoul can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make one Bite attack and one Claw attack during its turn. The "Bite" attack has a +5 to hit and reaches 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals an average of 12 piercing damage and can potentially infect humanoid targets with darakhul fever disease if they fail a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. The "Claw" attack also has a +5 to hit. If it hits, it inflicts an average of 17 slashing damage and may paralyze non-elf and non-undead targets on a failed DC 11 Constitution saving throw. The target can attempt to break free from this paralysis at the end of each of their turns. Additionally, it has a ranged option with a "Light Crossbow," allowing it to attack from a distance with a +4 to hit, delivering an average of 6 piercing damage.

Overall, the Imperial Ghoul serves as a formidable opponent with strategic capabilities, strong melee attacks, and the ability to hinder or harm its enemies effectively while remaining resilient against various forms of attack.
