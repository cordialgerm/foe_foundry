The Koralk is a formidable Large fiend classified as Lawful Evil, serving as a potentially challenging adversary for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 15, it possesses decent defensive capabilities, complemented by a significant pool of hit points totaling 136. The creature's capabilities are further enhanced by its impressive Strength score of 20, which grants it exceptional melee attack power. However, it has average Dexterity and Wisdom, indicating some vulnerabilities in those areas. The Koralk boasts potent offensive capabilities through a variety of attacks and special abilities, while also exhibiting strong resistances, particularly to poison and fire, making it a tricky foe to combat. Importantly, its immunity to certain conditions and advantages against magic solidify its role as a challenging opponent in combat scenarios.

The Koralk's attributes comprise Strength at 20 (+5), Dexterity at 13 (+1), Constitution at 17 (+3), Intelligence at 10 (+0), Wisdom at 11 (+0), and Charisma at 13 (+1). Its Constitution modifier yields a good saving throw bonus of +7, which helps it withstand physical effects. The Wisdom modifier of +0 allows for average resilience against effects that require that saving throw. Additionally, it has a Charisma modifier of +1, providing a somewhat effective +5 to Charisma saving throws.

For skills, the Koralk has immunities to fire and poison damage, and it resists cold damage and nonmagical attacks that are not silvered. It also has the condition immunity to poisoned status. The creature has darkvision extended up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light, and it can communicate telepathically within the same range.

In gameplay, the Koralk’s special abilities are noteworthy and impactful. "Devil’s Sight" allows the Koralk to see through magical darkness, making it a potent combatant in areas of obscured visibility. With the "Harvester Venom," the Koralk’s attacks can inflict serious ongoing poison damage that also reduces a creature's maximum hit points if they fail a high DC Constitution saving throw. The Koralk’s "Magic Resistance" grants it advantage on saving throws against magic, making it harder for spellcasters to effectively target it. Additionally, the "Steadfast" ability allows the Koralk to remain unfrightened when allies are nearby, giving it a strategic edge in coordinated attacks.

The Koralk can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike with one Bite attack, one Scythe attack, and three Stinger attacks, or replace a Scythe attack with a Vestigial Arms attack. The Bite attack has a +9 to hit and does 14 points of piercing damage on a successful hit. The Scythe, with the same +9 to hit, deals 16 points of slashing damage, making it a potent weapon. The Stinger also has a +9 to hit and does 7 points of piercing damage along with 7 points of poison damage, with the addition of its Harvester Venom effect if the target fails their saving throw against the poison. Finally, the Vestigial Arms allow the Koralk to grapple a Medium or smaller creature, restraining them until they successfully escape, which can stall opponents for potential follow-up attacks or actions.
