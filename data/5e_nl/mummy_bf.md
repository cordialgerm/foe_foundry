The mummy is a Medium undead creature that serves as both a formidable opponent and a lingering threat, particularly in campaign settings steeped in ancient tombs and curses. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it poses a moderate risk for adventurers. The mummy possesses a robust set of hit points at 80 and has an Armor Class of 13, making it somewhat resilient in combat, though less agile due to its low Dexterity. Its special abilities grant it immunity to poison and the poisoned condition, while its undead nature means it does not require sustenance, allowing it to function effectively in any environment. However, it is worth noting that the mummy's speed is relatively slow at 20 feet, which can hinder its ability to close gaps in battle. 

The mummy's statistics are as follows: Strength is +3, providing a good boost to physical attacks; Dexterity is -1, which is bad and affects its ability to dodge or avoid attacks; Constitution is +3, granting it good resilience to effects that require saving throws; Intelligence is -2, making it quite poor in mental tasks; Wisdom is +2, giving it a good level of perceptiveness; and Charisma is +1, indicating average capabilities in social interactions or effects related to its presence.

In terms of abilities, the mummy has Undead Nature, which denotes that it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep. This allows it to function continuously without hindrance. The Undead Resilience ability makes it immune to poison damage and exhausted conditions, enhancing its survivability.

In combat, the mummy can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to perform two Rotting Fist attacks. When both attacks hit a target that is not a Construct or Undead, the affected creature must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 13. Failure results in being cursed with mummy rot, which has detrimental effects on the victim's health. The Rotting Fist attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit, and it can deal significant damage by inflicting 7 bludgeoning damage as well as an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. 

As a bonus action, the mummy can use Dreadful Glare, targeting one creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 13 or become frightened until the end of its next turn. If the target fails by 5 or more, they are also paralyzed for the same duration, significantly impacting their ability to participate in combat.

Overall, the mummy combines defensive resilience with offensive capabilities, making it a noteworthy adversary that can inflict lasting curses while taking advantage of its undead nature in the heat of battle.
