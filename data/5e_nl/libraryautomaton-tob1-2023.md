The Library Automaton is a small construct known for its role as a guardian and organizer of knowledge. It possesses a its own inherent understanding of written languages and is capable of performing a variety of tasks involving books and written records. Despite its limited physical capabilities, it compensates with clever abilities, including the manipulation of objects from a distance and the storage of valuable written works in its extradimensional space. With a challenge rating of 1/2, the Library Automaton is not particularly formidable in combat, but its utility in managing and safeguarding information makes it an interesting resource in many scenarios. Its armor class of 13 provides average protection, while its hit points totaling 24 indicate that it can withstand a moderate amount of punishment before being incapacitated.

The Library Automaton has the following attributes: Strength of 8, which translates to a very bad modifier of -1; Dexterity of 13, yielding a good modifier of +1; Constitution of 10, resulting in an average modifier of +0; Intelligence of 16, giving it an exceptional modifier of +3; Wisdom of 12, leading to a good modifier of +1; and Charisma of 8, which again gives it a very bad modifier of -1. This array demonstrates that the automaton is particularly intelligent but physically weak, capable of excelling in skills that require knowledge and investigation with a +5 bonus to both History and Investigation checks.

The Library Automaton has several special abilities that enhance its functionality. The Bibliophile ability allows it to understand any written language it comes into contact with, which is advantageous for gathering information or deciphering texts. The Bibliotelekinesis ability grants the automaton a magical force that can manipulate objects within 15 feet of it, enabling it to perform simple tasks without physical handling, thus helping maintain order and accessibility in a library setting. The Book Safekeeper ability features a small, extradimensional space within the automaton that can hold up to 100 pounds of written works, making it an effective custodian for libraries or archives. Important to note is that only the automaton can retrieve items from this space, ensuring security for the important materials it guards. Furthermore, the Construct Nature trait means the Library Automaton is unaffected by many physical needs like air, food, or sleep, allowing it to function continuously.

In combat, the Library Automaton can perform the Piston-Powered Kick action, which is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit. When it successfully connects with a target, it inflicts 6 (2d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage, a relatively modest output. Additionally, the Unnerving Gaze is a ranged spell attack that also carries a +5 to hit and a range of 60 feet. Upon hitting, it deals 6 (1d6 + 3) psychic damage. Furthermore, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on its next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw before the start of the automatonâ€™s next turn. This mechanic can significantly hinder opponents, making the unassuming Library Automaton a strategic participant in encounters by diminishing its foes' effectiveness.
