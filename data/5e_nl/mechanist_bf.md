The Mechanist is a medium humanoid creature characterized by its proficiency with mechanical devices and tools. Serving often as a skilled artisan or engineer in combat, the Mechanist can manipulate constructs and technical gadgets to gain advantages in battle. Its strengths lie in its intelligence, allowing it to double its proficiency with tinkering tools, and its ability to produce constructs that can aid in combat or provide support. While it has moderate armor class and hit points, making it reasonably durable, it is not particularly strong or charismatic. In gameplay, the Mechanist can engage with both melee and ranged attacks, provide repair support to constructs, and create small constructs that follow its commands, making it a versatile character that can adapt to various situations.

The Mechanist has the following abilities and attributes: 

- **Armor Class:** 15, which is considered good, providing a solid defense against attacks.

The Mechanist features several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in and out of combat:

- **Tools of the Trade:** This ability grants the Mechanist proficiency with tinker tools, enabling them to effectively use these tools and gain double their proficiency bonus on related checks. This is particularly useful for crafting and repairing constructs.
  
In combat, the Mechanist can take several actions:

- **Multiattack:** The Mechanist can make two attacks during its turn, utilizing either a Warhammer or a Light Crossbow.
- **Warhammer Attack:** This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit and can deal 7 bludgeoning damage with one hand or 8 damage if wielded with two hands, making it a solid choice for close-range encounters.
- **Light Crossbow Attack:** With a +3 to hit and a range of 80/320 feet, this ranged weapon can deal 5 piercing damage, allowing for effective long-distance engagement.

Additionally, the Mechanist has notable abilities:

- **Repair (Recharge 4–6):** This ability allows the Mechanist to touch a friendly construct and restore 5 hit points, making it invaluable for keeping mechanical allies operational in battle.
  
- **Quick Creation (Recharge 4–6):** This bonus action lets the Mechanist create a Tiny Construct from parts it carries. The Construct follows verbal commands, acts on the Mechanist's behalf, and lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed. The Mechanist can maintain up to two of these Constructs at a time, providing additional tactical options in combat.

- **Magnetic Pulse:** As a reaction, the Mechanist can release a magnetic pulse to disorient attackers that use metal weapons within 5 feet. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or attack at disadvantage, which can turn the tide of encounters by impairing incoming assaults.

Overall, the Mechanist brings a unique blend of combat capabilities and mechanical ingenuity to the battlefield, allowing for strategic play and support of allies while also being able to hold its own in a fight.
