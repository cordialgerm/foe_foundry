The Bloatblossom is a Medium plant creature known for its unique abilities and its role in combat. It has a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating it is a moderately difficult foe for adventurers. The Bloatblossom has a solid Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, and with 60 hit points, it can sustain some damage before being defeated. Its movement speed is relatively slow at 20 feet, which may limit its positioning in battle. The creature is particularly potent with its poisonous attacks and has several actions that can inflict significant damage and debilitating effects on its enemies. One notable aspect of the Bloatblossom is its resistance to certain conditions, making it resilient against various forms of incapacitation. 

The statistical attributes of the Bloatblossom show a Strength of +3 (good) and a Constitution of +3 (good), but it has exceptionally low mental attributes, with Intelligence -4 (very bad), Wisdom -1 (bad), and Charisma -3 (very bad). This means the Bloatblossom is a physical powerhouse but lacks any real cognitive or social capabilities. Its Dexterity is neutral at +0 (average), meaning it won’t excel in stealth or evasion but is not particularly hampered by these aspects either. The creature has keensense within a 60-foot radius, which limits its awareness but enhances its auditory perception through its Heightened Hearing ability, allowing it a Perception score of 16 when relying on hearing.

Bloatblossom's special abilities include Plant Resilience, providing resistance to exhaustion, and immunity to the paralyzed, petrified, and unconscious conditions. This makes it a tough opponent as it can continue fighting even when faced with debilitating conditions that could hinder other creatures.

In terms of actions during combat, the Bloatblossom can perform multiple attacks in one turn. It can either make one Bite and one Slam attack or two Toxic Nodule attacks. Its Bite and Slam attacks both utilize a +5 to hit, meaning it is likely to strike its targets successfully. The Bite deals 6 piercing damage plus an additional 4 poison damage, while the Slam attack inflicts 6 bludgeoning damage with the same 4 poison damage and has the potential to grapple Medium or smaller targets, requiring an escape check at DC 13. 

The Toxic Nodule attack is ranged, also using a +5 to hit, and can deal 12 poison damage on a successful strike. Targets hit by this attack must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being poisoned until the end of their next turn, which can severely limit an opponent's effectiveness in combat.

Furthermore, the Bloatblossom has a Bonus Action called Instinct to Pursue, which allows it to Dash towards any uninfected humanoid in its line of sight. This ability highlights its predatory nature and its intent on infecting its victims with apocalyptic fungus through its attacks. Overall, the Bloatblossom is a formidable foe that combines physical might with toxic abilities, capable of disrupting the plans of any adventuring party unprepared for its unique threats.
