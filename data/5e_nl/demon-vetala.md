The Vetala is a medium-sized fiend embodying chaotic evil, known for its sinister connection to death and undeath. This demon possesses exceptional agility and resilience with a high Dexterity and Constitution, along with a robust ability to resist magical effects due to its Magic Resistance feature. The Vetala serves as an efficient summoner of undead, able to raise corpses to do its bidding and bolster its forces. Weak against radiant damage, the Vetala thrives in darkness and graveyards, moving effortlessly through such terrain and controlling undead minions with deadly efficiency. It challenges adventurers with its ability to deal both slashing and necrotic damage, making it a formidable foe in combat.

The Vetala has an Armor Class of 15, providing a good level of defense, and it has a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 114, calculated by rolling 12d8 and adding 60. This gives it a high resilience in battle, allowing it to withstand significant punishment. With a walk speed of 40 feet, it can navigate the battlefield effectively. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 8, meaning it is a threat suitable for a party of adventurers with a combined level around 8, providing 3,900 experience points when defeated.

The Vetala's attributes are as follows: Strength 10 (average), Dexterity 20 (+5, very good), Constitution 20 (+5, very good), Intelligence 14 (+2, average), Wisdom 16 (+3, good), and Charisma 17 (+3, good). It has advantageous saving throws in Dexterity (+8, very good) and Wisdom (+6, good). The creature's skills include a perception score of +3, which is effective for noticing hidden enemies. The Vetala has vulnerabilities to radiant damage but is immune to necrotic and poison damage. It also cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, or poisoned, making it resilient against a variety of debilitating effects. With darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 16, it can perceive threats well in dim lighting. The Vetala communicates in Abyssal, Common, and possesses telepathy up to 120 feet.

The Vetala's special abilities enhance its undead mastery. With Corpse Stride, it can transport itself into a nearby corpse or undead creature and emerge from another within range, allowing for strategic movement. The Graveyard Walker ability allows it to traverse difficult terrain found in graveyards without penalty, although it does take force damage if it ends its turn within a solid object. The creature's Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, increasing its survivability against spellcasters. As the Master of Undeath, any humanoid it kills or undead it controls rises as a skeleton or zombie a minute later unless specific conditions negate this effect. Lastly, Shepherd of Death enhances its undead minions, allowing them to deal extra necrotic damage on attacks.

In combat, the Vetala can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two claw attacks against a target. Its Claws attack rolls have a +8 to hit and deal 12 slashing damage plus an additional 9 necrotic damage upon a successful hit. The Raise Corpse action permits the Vetala to animate a humanoid corpse within 30 feet as a skeleton or zombie under its control.

For bonus actions, the Vetala can use Command Corpse to instruct an undead under its control to make a weapon attack as a reaction, which benefits from having advantage, thus increasing the likelihood of a successful hit. 

Finally, the Vetala possesses a devastating reaction called Corpse Detonation. When one of its undead companions is reduced to 0 hit points, it can detonate the creature, dealing 10 bludgeoning damage if it was a zombie or slashing damage if it was a skeleton to all creatures within 5 feet. Additionally, those creatures take 5 poison damage, which requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to resist half damage from the blast.
