The Felid Dragon is a formidable and neutral creature with incredible speed and agility, suited for both aerial and terrestrial combat. As a Huge Dragon, it boasts a high Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 275, making it difficult to defeat. With a Challenge Rating of 19, it presents a significant challenge to adventurers, having a total experience point reward of 22,000 upon defeat. The dragon's remarkable Dexterity score of 26 grants it exceptional reflexes, and its magical resistance makes it difficult to affect with spells. However, while it possesses numerous strengths such as powerful melee attacks and various debilitating abilities, it may need to rely on strategic positioning to maintain the upper hand in combat.

The Felid Dragon has the following attributes: Strength of 18 (+4), Dexterity of 26 (+8), Constitution of 23 (+6), Intelligence of 16 (+3), Wisdom of 17 (+3), and Charisma of 19 (+4). The dragon’s Dexterity and Constitution modifiers are exceptional, providing it with heightened agility and durability in battle. The associated saving throw bonuses for Strength, Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma are +10, +12, +9, and +10 respectively, which are very good and greatly increase its chances of resistance against physical and magical attacks. The dragon also boasts skills in Acrobatics (+14), Perception (+9), and Stealth (+16), with Stealth at a very good level, making it a masterful ambush predator. Its immunities to poison damage and conditions such as being poisoned or prone, alongside superior senses like blindsight at 60 feet and darkvision at 120 feet, further enhance its combat prowess.

The Felid Dragon benefits from several special abilities: it has the Flyby ability, allowing it to maneuver without provoking opportunity attacks from enemies. Its Keen Smell grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks based on scent, assisting in tracking or detecting foes. Magic Resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, reflecting its formidable nature against magical opponents. The Pounce ability allows the dragon to knock a target prone if it charges toward them, then immediately follow up with a bite attack as a bonus action, which can turn the tides of combat dramatically.

In terms of actions, the Felid Dragon can execute a Multiattack, which includes using its Deafening Roar followed by three physical attacks: a bite and two claw strikes. The Bite attack has a +14 to hit and deals 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage. Each Claw attack also has a +14 to hit and deals 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage with an additional effect where the target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw; failure results in ongoing damage each turn due to pieces of the dragon's claw remaining in the wound, increasing in severity if the dragon strikes again. 

The Deafening Roar affects all creatures within 60 feet who can hear it, requiring them to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for one minute. Successful saving throws or the end of the effect grants immunity to further instances of the roar for 24 hours. Lastly, the Sickening Bile ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the dragon to unleash a 90-foot cone of bile causing 70 (20d6) poison damage to affected creatures, along with the poisoned condition. Creatures can remove the bile by taking their action, which adds a layer of strategic complexity to encounters with the Felid Dragon.
