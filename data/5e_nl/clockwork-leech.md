The Clockwork Leech is a medium-sized construct that embodies a blend of mechanical precision and predatory instincts. Designed with a solid armor class of 13, it can endure a fair amount of damage thanks to its 45 hit points, which it gains from rolling 6d8 plus an additional 18. With a challenge rating of 1, it presents a notable but manageable threat, particularly for low to mid-level adventurers. This creature excels in stealth with a good dexterity bonus and is immune to poison and psychic damage, making it a sturdy opponent in battles that do not revolve around mental attacks. Its unique abilities allow it to inflict debilitating effects on its targets while remaining resilient to many forms of magical disruption.

The Clockwork Leech has a Strength score of 14, providing it with a good modifier of +2, suitable for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score of 12 results in an average modifier of +1, which contributes to its stealth skills that are beneficial for ambush tactics. The Constitution score of 17 is exceptional with a +3 modifier, tipping the balance in its favor for resisting damage and maintaining health. With an Intelligence score of 3, it has a very bad modifier of -4, indicating that it cannot think or strategize like smarter creatures. Its Wisdom and Charisma scores are mediocre at 10 (+0) and 7 (-2) respectively, allowing it to perceive its environment and interact minimally, but it is mostly ineffective in social contexts.

Notable skills include a +2 modifier in Perception, enhancing its ability to detect foes, and a +3 modifier in Stealth, making it quite capable of remaining hidden. Its abilities grant it total immunity to several conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, making it a hard target to affect with many status ailments. The leech can see in the dark up to 60 feet and has a passive perception score of 12.

In terms of special abilities, the Clockwork Leech possesses the Anesthetizing Bite, which allows it to attach to a creature when it successfully bites. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom check to even notice the bite, bringing a stealthy aspect to its attacks. If the leech remains attached, the target continually must succeed on this check at the beginning of its turns. The Immutable Form ability ensures that the leech cannot be magically altered, providing a natural resilience to spells aiming to transform it. With Magic Resistance, it also gains advantage on saving throws against spells and effects, adding to its defensive capabilities.

When it comes to actions, the Clockwork Leech can execute a Bite attack, which has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2) and attaches itself to the target. While attached, the leech does not directly attack but instead drains 5 hit points (1d6 + 2) from the target at the beginning of each of its turns. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the leech’s next turn. This draining ability can significantly weaken opponents over time and adds a layer of urgency to detaching the leech, which requires an action and a successful DC 10 Strength check. Moreover, it can use its movement to detach itself after it drains down a total of 10 hit points from its host or if the host dies. 

Lastly, the Clockwork Leech has a Tail attack that also bears a +4 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, capable of inflicting 7 bludgeoning damage (1d10 + 2) to a target. This tail attack provides another method of dealing damage while maintaining its predatory presence on the battlefield.
