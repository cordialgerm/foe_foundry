The Bronze Dragon Wyrmling is a Medium-sized dragon that embodies the traits of its kind with characteristics typical of bronze dragons, including a penchant for cleverness and respect for honor. This creature plays the role of a formidable combatant, possessing significant mobility and the ability to inflict elemental damage through its breath weapon. With a challenge rating of 3, it presents a moderate challenge for adventurers, boasting a decent armor class of 16 and 39 hit points. Its strengths lie in its mobility, both on land and in water, combined with the ability to deliver potent area damage. However, the wyrmling's weaknesses are its relatively low Dexterity score, which is average, and its reliance on saving throws, which may be circumvented through careful strategy by players.

The attributes of the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling are as follows: it has a Strength of 16, granting it a good modifier of +3, which makes it quite effective in melee combat; a Dexterity of 10 with a modifier of +0, indicating average nimbleness; a Constitution of 14 providing a good +2 modifier that aids in both hit points and saving throws; an Intelligence of 12 yielding a +1 modifier which is average; a Wisdom of 10 also with a modifier of +0, and a Charisma of 14, providing a good +2 modifier which supports its social interactions and spellcasting. With skills in perception and stealth, it adds +2 to its rolls in these areas, which can be useful in both combat and exploration.

The Bronze Dragon Wyrmling has damage immunity to lightning, making it completely unaffected by lightning damage, which can be critical in battles against certain spellcasters or opponents that rely on electric attacks. It has blindsight up to 10 feet, allowing it to sense creatures without relying on sight, darkvision out to 60 feet for enhanced visibility in low light, and a passive Perception score of 12, suggesting that it will notice nearby threats without actively searching. This wyrmling understands Draconic, enabling it to communicate with other dragons and those familiar with this ancient language.

As for special abilities, the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling is Amphibious, allowing it to survive and function efficiently in both water and air. This ability further reflects its adaptable nature and enhances its role in aquatic encounters.

In terms of actions during combat, the wyrmling can use its Bite attack as a melee weapon. It has a +5 to hit, and with a reach of 5 feet, it can target creatures nearby. On a successful hit, it deals 14 piercing damage, calculated from rolling 2d10 and adding its Strength modifier. Additionally, the wyrmling possesses two breath weapon options that it can employ after a recharge period.

The first breath weapon is Lightning Breath, which is an area effect attack that projects lightning damage in a 30-foot-long and 5-foot-wide line. Any creature caught within this line must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw; on a failure, the target takes 16 lightning damage, whereas success halves the damage taken. This ability is particularly useful for hitting multiple foes in a line during combat.

The second breath weapon is Ocean Surge, which unleashes a torrent of seawater in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the wyrmling. This can create space or separate foes, altering the battlefield dynamics significantly if used strategically. 

Overall, the Bronze Dragon Wyrmling combines effective combat prowess with utility in its breath weapons, making it a valuable encounter for adventurers navigating both land and aquatic terrains.
