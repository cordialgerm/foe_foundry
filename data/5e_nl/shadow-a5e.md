The Shadow is a Medium Undead creature known for its stealth and ability to instill fear in its foes. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers and relies on its agility and the element of surprise to inflict damage. The Shadow has a moderate Armor Class of 12, making it reasonably difficult to hit, and it possesses a modest pool of Hit Points totaling 18. Its primary strength lies in its agility, as indicated by a Dexterity score of 14, giving it a good modifier of +2 that enhances its stealth capabilities. The creature is vulnerable to radiant damage but is immune to necrotic and poison damage, offering a solid defense against many types of attacks. While the Shadow can be effective in combat, it has a significant downside in the presence of sunlight, which hampers its abilities considerably.

The Shadow has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 6 (modifier -2, which is very bad for physical attacks)
- Dexterity: 14 (modifier +2, which is good, aiding in stealth and dexterity-based checks)
- Constitution: 10 (modifier +0, considered average for health)
- Intelligence: 8 (modifier -1, which is very bad for intelligence checks)
- Wisdom: 10 (modifier +0, average in wisdom-related situations)
- Charisma: 14 (modifier +2, which is good for its interactions)

The creature has a skill in Stealth with a +4 modifier, enabling it to hide effectively in dim light or darkness. Its damage vulnerabilities include radiant damage, while it is immune to necrotic and poison damage, as well as possessing resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage. Additionally, the Shadow is immune to several conditions including being charmed, fatigued, frightened, and poisoned, which makes it resilient against many forms of debilitation. Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet, which allows it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and a passive perception of 10.

The Shadow possesses notable special abilities:
- Amorphous: This ability allows the Shadow to pass through tight spaces as narrow as 1 inch wide without the need to squeeze, facilitating unexpected movement and positioning in combat.
- Sunlight Weakness: In sunlight, the Shadow suffers from disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, which severely limits its effectiveness in bright conditions.
- Undead Nature: Shadows do not require air, food, or sleep, making them relentless in pursuit and ambush tactics.

In combat, the Shadow can perform the following actions:
- Claw: This melee weapon attack allows the Shadow to strike a target using a +4 to hit. It has a reach of 5 feet and upon a successful hit, it deals 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must then succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed until the end of a short or long rest. While cursed, the target suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws. If the cursed target dies, it becomes a new Shadow within 1d4 hours, complicating matters for the party as they lose the opportunity for resurrection until the new Shadow is eliminated.

Additionally, the Shadow can use its Bonus Action to perform:
- Shadow Sneak: This ability allows the Shadow to take the Hide action, even when only obscured by dim light or darkness, making it difficult for opponents to detect its presence and allowing it to effectively set up ambushes or escape when needed. 

Overall, Shadows are cunning adversaries that utilize their stealth and unique abilities to debilitate foes and create new threats from the remains of the fallen. They excel in darkness and can turn the tide of battle through effective ambushes and curses.
