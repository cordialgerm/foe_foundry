The War Horse is a large beast known for its robust build and trained combat capabilities. It serves primarily as a mount for riders in battle. With a strong constitution and notable speed, the War Horse excels in mobility and can deal significant damage with its hoof attacks. It has a challenge rating of 1/2, making it suitable for mid-level encounters. However, its intelligence is notably low, indicating it is not capable of complex maneuvers or strategic thinking. The creature's primary strengths lie in its physical abilities and its special ability to trample enemies, while its main weaknesses stem from its lack of magical abilities and limited senses.

The attributes of the War Horse are as follows: 
- Strength is +4, which is considered very good, indicating powerful physical attacks. 
- Dexterity is +1, which is average, allowing it to perform basic maneuvers effectively. 
- Constitution is +1, also average, reflecting a moderate resilience. 
- Intelligence is -4, which is very bad, suggesting the creature has little reasoning capability. 
- Wisdom is +1, considered average, giving it moderate awareness. 
- Charisma is -2, which is bad, indicating a lack of presence or influence.

The War Horse has a base Armor Class of 15, thanks to the scale mail barding, providing it good protection against attacks. With 22 hit points, it can withstand a moderate amount of damage before falling in combat. Its movement speed is 60 feet, allowing it to traverse the battlefield quickly, which is particularly beneficial in combat scenarios.

The special ability of Trampling Charge allows the War Horse to knock a creature prone if it successfully moves 20 feet straight toward it and hits with a Hooves attack. This ability requires the target to make a saving throw against a DC of 14 using Strength; failure results in the target being knocked prone. A knocked-down enemy can be attacked again as a bonus action, providing the War Horse with extra offensive opportunities during its turn.

In terms of actions, the War Horse has access to a Hooves melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, which is considered good, with a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, making it a formidable combatant against enemy targets.

The War Horse also has a reaction called Trained Shift. If the rider is faced with a situation that would knock them prone or dismount them, the horse can shift its body to assist. This grants the rider advantage on any checks or saves to avoid being compromised, indicating a high level of training and coordination between the rider and the horse.

Overall, the War Horse is a valuable companion in battle, offering both significant mobility and combat support capabilities, allowing it to effectively assist its rider and participate in confrontations.
