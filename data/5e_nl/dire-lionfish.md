The Dire Lionfish is a formidable aquatic creature that serves as both a predator and a guardian of its underwater territory. With a large physique and impressive swimming speed, it is adept at ambushing foes who venture too close. Its combination of natural armor and significant hit points makes it a robust opponent capable of withstanding damage, while its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it poses a serious threat to adventurers. Notably, the Dire Lionfish relies on its poisonous defenses and ambush tactics to gain the upper hand in combat, but it is limited by its inability to move on land.

The Dire Lionfish has the following attributes: Strength 17 (+3; exceptional), Dexterity 15 (+2; good), Constitution 17 (+3; exceptional), Intelligence 3 (-4; very bad), Wisdom 12 (+1; average), and Charisma 10 (+0; average). Its skills include a +1 bonus to perception, which allows it to detect threats in its surroundings, resulting in a passive perception score of 14. The Dire Lionfish lacks any languages, emphasizing its non-intelligent beast nature.

Its special abilities enhance its combat prowess and evasion tactics. The **Charge** ability allows it to deal an additional 9 (2d8) piercing damage to a target if it moves 30 feet straight towards them and hits with its Headbutt attack on the same turn. **Coral Camouflage** grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while hiding in underwater environments filled with plant life or coral, making it difficult for opponents to detect it. The **Envenomed Spines** ability inflicts 7 (2d6) poison damage to any creature that makes melee contact with the lionfish or strikes it while within 5 feet, providing a strong deterrent for close-range attackers. The **Poison Affinity** ability gives it an advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, enhancing its resilience. Finally, **Water Breathing** allows the Dire Lionfish to breathe only underwater.

In combat, the Dire Lionfish can perform a **Multiattack**, making one Bite attack and one Headbutt attack during its turn. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit and deals 14 (2d10+3) piercing damage, while the Headbutt attack, also with a +6 to hit, deals 12 (2d8+3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. Its **Forceful Spit (Recharge 4–6)** action allows it to shoot a stream of pressurized water in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide, dealing 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage. Creatures within the line must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to take half damage and are pushed up to 10 feet away from the lionfish, while those who fail are pushed up to 20 feet and knocked prone. This ability not only inflicts damage but also disrupts positioning, allowing the Dire Lionfish to control the battlefield effectively.
