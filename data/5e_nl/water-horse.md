The Water Horse is a Medium-sized fey creature characterized by its neutral evil demeanor. It possesses a unique ability to shapeshift, allowing it to transition between a humanoid form, a horse, or a hybrid form combining features of both. This versatility makes it a formidable opponent and a cunning manipulator in both combat and social interactions. With a challenge rating of 4, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly with its Charming Gaze ability which can incapacitate foes. The Water Horse boasts a reasonable Armor Class of 12 in humanoid form and 14 in horse or hybrid form, making it somewhat durable in encounters. However, its lack of immense hit points, totaling 77, means that it can be brought down if faced with concentrated attacks. 

The Water Horse has the following attributes: Strength of 16, Dexterity of 14, Constitution of 13, Intelligence of 10, Wisdom of 12, and Charisma of 15. Its Strength (+3) is very good, making it physically formidable in melee combat. The Dexterity bonus (+2) is good, aiding its defense and initiative. With a Constitution of +1 (average) and a Wisdom of +1 (average), the creature has decent resilience but lacks extraordinary traits in these areas. Charisma (+2) is also good, enhancing its ability to deceive or persuade, supported by its skills in deception and persuasion, both at +4, which is impressive. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, which can be an advantage in low-light conditions, and it understands Common and Sylvan languages.

The Water Horse has several defined special abilities. Its Amphibious feature allows it to breathe in both air and water, granting it the ability to operate in various environments. The Shapechanger ability permits the Water Horse to polymorph into different forms, maintaining its statistics aside from size, speed, and armor class, creating tactical flexibility during encounters.

In terms of actions, the Water Horse can perform a Multiattack where it utilizes its Charming Gaze followed by attacks based on its form. The Charming Gaze ability targets a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw, failing which it becomes charmed for 1 minute and can only move toward the Water Horse, rendering it incapacitated. This effect can significantly disrupt combat dynamics, as charmed creatures cannot engage in combat effectively. The target can attempt to break free by rerolling the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and has advantage on the throw if it has taken damage since the last round.

In its hybrid or horse forms, the Water Horse has a Bite attack that deals an average of 10 piercing damage and a Longsword attack that deals either 7 or 8 slashing damage, depending on whether it is wielded with one or two hands, respectively. The Longbow option available in humanoid or hybrid form allows for ranged attacks at a distance of 150 feet (up to 600 feet at disadvantage), dealing 6 piercing damage on a hit.

Overall, the Water Horse is a versatile combatant that excels in strategic deception and manipulation, making it a tricky adversary for adventurers who may underestimate its capabilities.
