In terms of offensive actions, the Behir Magus has a Multiattack feature where it can deliver a devastating bite and then a constricting attack. The bite attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 24 piercing damage on a hit. If a Medium or smaller creature is bitten and grappled, the Behir can swallow it, incapacitating that creature and causing it to take 21 acid damage at the start of the Behir's turns. If the swallowed creature inflicts 30 or more damage to the Behir in one turn, or if the Behir is defeated, it will regurgitate the swallowed creature. The constrict attack also has a +10 to hit with a 5-foot reach, inflicting 21 bludgeoning damage. A target hit by this attack is grappled with an escape DC of 17 and restrained, and the Behir can hold two creatures in this manner simultaneously.

One of its most powerful abilities is the Lightning Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This powerful breath attack creates a line of lightning that is 5 feet wide and 20 feet long. Creatures caught in this line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 56 lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success.

Additionally, the Behir Magus has various reactive abilities. Vengeful Breath can be used once a day; if the creature is hit by a melee attack, it can unleash its Lightning Breath in retaliation, including the attacker in the effect area. The Blindness reaction, also usable once a day, targets a ranged or area attack made against it, forcing the attacker to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid being blinded for a minute. The creature can also use Invisibility once a day in response to being damaged, becoming unseen for a minute or until it attacks. Lastly, the Drain Charge ability allows the Behir to absorb lightning damage once a day, preventing any harm to itself while dealing necrotic damage equal to the lightning damage that was aimed at it back to the attacker or caster, making it particularly hazardous to those relying on electrical attacks.
