The Shroud Ray is a Large Aberration known for its unique blend of stealth and melee combat capabilities. It has a solid Armor Class of 13 and a robust pool of hit points totaling 97, making it a formidable opponent in battle. Its primary strengths lie in its aquatic nature and impressive grappling ability, allowing it to control encounters efficiently while inflicting both physical and psychological damage on its foes. However, its main weaknesses stem from its sensitivity to light, as it suffers disadvantages in bright conditions. This creature is especially dangerous when it can strike unsuspecting players, utilizing its camouflage to avoid detection and launch devastating attacks.

The Shroud Ray possesses attributes that enhance its combat effectiveness: it has a Strength score of 18, translating to a +4 modifier, which is exceptional for melee attacks. Its Dexterity of 16 grants it a good +3 modifier, contributing to its effective stealth and finesse in dodging attacks. Its Constitution at 14 gives it an average +2 modifier, providing a decent boost to its hit points. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all set at 12, leading to average +1 modifiers in those areas. Notably, it has a +4 modifier on Wisdom saving throws, which is good, reflecting its capability to resist certain magical effects. It also has a stealth skill bonus of +6, making it very good at sneaking and ambushing its targets. The Shroud Ray resists bludgeoning damage, making it somewhat resilient against certain types of attacks, while also being immune to being charmed or frightened due to its aberration nature. 

The Shroud Ray has several notable special abilities. Its False Appearance allows it to remain undetectable when motionless, blending in with its environment like a patch of sand. It suffers from Light Sensitivity, which means it faces disadvantages on attack rolls and Perception checks while in bright light, making it less effective in well-lit conditions. Additionally, being Aquatic means that the Shroud Ray can only breathe underwater.

In terms of combat actions, the Shroud Ray has multiple offensive options. Its bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit; on a successful hit, it deals 11 piercing damage and grapples the target. If it has advantage on the attack, it can attach itself to the target's head, causing blindness and suffocation, while also transferring damage between itself and the grappled creature. It can only grapple one creature at a time. The tail attack is another melee option, also with a +7 to hit. It deals 7 slashing damage plus an additional 3 poison damage. The target must then make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned until the end of the Shroud Rayâ€™s next turn.

The Shroud Ray can use its moan ability to instill fear in non-aberration creatures within a 60-foot radius, forcing them to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the creature being frightened until the end of the Shroud Ray's next turn, while success grants them immunity to this effect for 24 hours. This ability can effectively control the battlefield, making opponents hesitant to engage.

Once per day, the Shroud Ray can employ its Phantasms ability, creating flickering illusions of itself in its space, which grant disadvantage on attacks against it for one minute unless the cloaker enters bright light or grapples a creature successfully.

In terms of reactions, it possesses two unique options. The Reactive Tail allows it to make a tail attack against any attacker that hits or misses it with a melee attack. The Angry Moan enables the Shroud Ray to use its moan ability whenever it takes damage, further dissuading opponents from targeting it directly.

Overall, the Shroud Ray is a cunning and dangerous creature, thriving in aquatic environments and relying on deception and fear to dominate its adversaries.
