The Giant Crocodile is a huge beast that excels in aquatic environments, featuring a formidable presence both in and out of the water. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who venture too close. It boasts impressive combat capabilities, backed by its high strength, allowing it to deliver devastating bite and tail attacks. The crocodile's natural armor provides it with a good level of protection, while its ability to swim at high speed enhances its versatility as a predator. However, its low dexterity and intelligence mean it is not particularly nimble or cunning outside of combat scenarios. 

The Giant Crocodile has an armor class of 14, indicating good defensive traits due to its natural armor. It has a total of 120 hit points, representing a substantial amount of health before succumbing in combat, a value that can be considered very good. In terms of attributes, the creature has a strength score of +8, making it exceptionally powerful when it comes to physical confrontations. Its dexterity is at -1, which is categorized as bad, reflecting its sluggishness in movement. The constitution of +3 is good, implying resilience in battle. Intelligence is significantly low at -4, which leads to very bad effectiveness for problem-solving or interaction-based encounters. Wisdom is average at +0, indicating regular perception and insight. Lastly, the charisma of -2 suggests a very bad ability for social interactions or intimidation. The Giant Crocodile has a perception score of 10, which is average for noticing surroundings, and it has a stealth score of 12, giving it a slightly above-average ability to remain undetected.

This creature possesses the special ability to hold its breath for up to 30 minutes, allowing it to remain submerged while hunting or evading threats. 

In terms of actions, the Giant Crocodile can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to execute one Bite attack and one Tail attack during its turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, which is exceptional, enabling it to easily strike its target. Upon a successful hit, the bite inflicts 21 piercing damage, calculated as 3d10 plus an additional 5 from its strength modifier. Furthermore, any creature hit by this attack becomes grappled, with a high escape DC of 16, indicating the formidable grip of the crocodile. While the target is grappled, it is also restrained, limiting its movement options. Notably, as long as the crocodile maintains the grapple, it cannot bite another target.

The Tail attack is another melee weapon attack, also with a +8 to hit, but it has a longer reach of 10 feet. If successful, it inflicts 14 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 2d8 plus 5. Additionally, if the target is another creature, it must succeed in a Strength saving throw against DC 16 to avoid being knocked prone, which can greatly hinder the target's combat effectiveness.

As a bonus action, the Giant Crocodile can perform a Death Roll against a creature it has grappled. The grappled creature must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 7 slashing damage, which is rolled using 2d6; on a successful save, the damage is halved. This ability accentuates the crocodile's ferocious nature and ensures that opponents struggling to escape will suffer even more damage while caught in its grip.
