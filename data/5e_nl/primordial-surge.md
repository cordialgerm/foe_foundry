The creature has blindsight up to 120 feet and a passive perception score of 12, enabling it to effectively navigate its surroundings without relying on sight.

The special abilities of the Primordial Surge include:
- Elemental Nature: This ability means the creature does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to act endlessly without the limitations that affect most living beings.
- Life From Death: Upon its death, the Primordial Surge explodes, creating a 50-foot radius of returning life and nutrition. Creatures that died within the last day can be resurrected with 4 hit points, and the area becomes fertile, providing sustenance for a brief period.
- Primordial Form: This allows it to move through narrow spaces without squeezing and inflicts damage (7 points of acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder) on those who contact it or come too close, while also blinding and deafening enemies that start their turn in its space.

The creatureâ€™s actions include:
- Multiattack: The Primordial Surge can make three Elemental Strike attacks in a single turn.
- Elemental Strike: With a +11 to hit, this melee or ranged attack can target an enemy up to 60 feet away, dealing 28 (4d10+6) of various elemental damage options based on what the surge chooses.
- Primordial Storm (Recharge 6): This powerful ability can unleash a rain of energies, either healing allies (Restorative Rain) with 27 hit points within a 30-foot radius or dealing substantial acid and fire damage (Ruinous Rain) to enemies in the same area. The targets hit also suffer ongoing damage from being coated in burning acid until they take action to remove it.

Overall, the Primordial Surge is a complex and dangerous foe that serves both as a devastating elemental force in combat and a transformative element in the realm it occupies.
