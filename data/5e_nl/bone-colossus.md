The Bone Colossus is a gargantuan undead creature embodying chaotic evil. It serves as a formidable opponent for adventurers, leveraging its massive size and unique abilities to create a significant threat in combat. With an Armor Class of 16 and 181 hit points, it can withstand considerable damage while delivering its own through powerful attacks. Its capabilities are enhanced by a high Strength score of 24, which provides a +7 modifier, and a good Constitution score of 22 that grants an additional +6 modifier to saving throws. The creature's challenge rating of 13 categorizes it as a highly dangerous foe, particularly for lower-level parties.

The attributes of the Bone Colossus highlight its strengths and weaknesses. Its Strength score enables it to hit hard in melee combat, while its Dexterity of 11 gives it an average agility, affecting its ability to evade attacks. The monster's Constitution is exceptional, making it very resilient to damage, and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores at 14 (+2), 16 (+3), and 16 (+3), respectively, allow for moderate mental capabilities and effectiveness in certain interactions. Saving throws against Constitution and Wisdom are particularly strong, at +11 and +8 respectively, indicating a good resilience against various effects. The creature is immune to necrotic and poison damage, as well as several disabling conditions, while being resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

The Bone Colossus possesses several special abilities that significantly impact gameplay. Its Collective Mind allows for telepathic communication with up to 50 miles, removing the element of surprise against it. Siege Monster grants it double damage against structures, making it a dangerous presence in siege situations. The most notable ability, Swarm Form, enables the Bone Colossus to split into four smaller bone swarms. Each swarm maintains a portion of its hit points and can move independently, creating a chaotic battlefield. These swarms can also combine back into the original form if they remain close together. Turn Resistance provides advantage on saving throws against effects designed to turn undead, enhancing its resilience against clerics and similar opponents.

In terms of actions, the Bone Colossus can engage in two separate attacks during its turn due to its Multiattack ability. One of its primary attacks is called Thunderous Slam, which allows it to make a melee weapon attack that benefits from a +12 attack bonus and can reach targets 15 feet away. This attack is devastating, causing 29 points of bludgeoning damage plus an additional 10 points of thunder damage. Furthermore, targets hit must succeed in a DC 18 Strength saving throw or fall prone, severely limiting their combat effectiveness. In Swarm Form, the Bone Colossus can use Razor Teeth as a melee attack that targets creatures within its swarm space, inflicting 21 points of piercing damage or 10 points if it has taken significant damage.

Overall, the Bone Colossus presents a complex challenge for adventurers, capable of both enduring damage and delivering potent strikes while utilizing its unique swarm dynamics to create tactical advantages in combat situations.
