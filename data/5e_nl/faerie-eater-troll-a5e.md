The Faerie Eater Troll is a large and formidable giant known for its unique abilities and resilience in combat. Possessing a high Armor Class of 15 and robust Hit Points totaling 84, this creature is tough to take down. It is particularly dangerous due to its strong regeneration ability, which allows it to heal itself steadily unless it takes acid or fire damage. The troll has a solid Strength score of 18, which makes it a powerful melee combatant with effective attacks, augmented by its average Dexterity of 12 and exceptional Constitution of 20, giving it good stamina and survivability. However, its Intelligence and Charisma are notably low, making it less effective in social interactions or using complex tactics. The Faerie Eater Troll poses a challenge due to its ability to charm opponents, and it can maintain combat engagement even when injured by controlling its severed limbs.

The Faerie Eater Troll has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 18 (+4), which is very good, allowing it to deal significant damage.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), considered average, providing a modest boost to its initiative and ability to evade attacks.
- Constitution: 20 (+5), exceptional, granting it high survivability with plenty of hit points.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1), which is bad, indicating poor problem-solving and tactics.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), average, reflecting decent perception and insight.
- Charisma: 8 (-1), also bad, suggesting difficulty in social situations or charm-based effects. 

The troll is skilled in stealth, receiving a +4 modifier, which is good for navigating undetected, further enhanced by its darkvision that allows it to see in low-light conditions. 

Special abilities enhance the Faerie Eater Troll’s combat effectiveness. Its Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Perception checks based on smell, enabling it to pick up scents and detect hidden creatures more easily. Magic Resistance is another notable trait, giving the troll advantage on saving throws against spells, making it less vulnerable to magical effects. The Regeneration ability allows the troll to regain 10 hit points at the start of its turn, so it can quickly recover unless it has been damaged by acid or fire—this makes it exceptionally difficult to defeat outright unless these damage types are considered. The Severed Limbs ability provides the troll with unique combat mechanics; when it suffers a critical hit from a slashing weapon, it can lose a limb but still control it as a separate entity, making it dangerous even when damaged. 

During combat, the Faerie Eater Troll can perform a Multiattack action, allowing it to use its bite and claw attacks. The bite attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 11 piercing damage, while the claw attack also has a +7 to hit and delivers 9 slashing damage. In addition to these attacks, the troll has the Charming Murmur ability, which allows it to charm one creature of its choice within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw; failure results in the creature becoming charmed for one minute and unable to move. This can severely limit the actions of key opponents during combat, showcasing the tactical potential of the troll beyond physical confrontation. The ability to charm can alter the dynamics of battle significantly, especially when combined with the troll's formidable melee attacks.
