Its Constitution score of 16 provides a good +3 modifier, aiding in saving throws, while its Intelligence score is only 3, resulting in a very bad -4 modifier, making it susceptible to mental attacks. Wisdom sits at 12, granting a slight +1 modifier which is average, and a Charisma score of 8 results in a bad -1 modifier to interactions involving social skills.

Its skills include a good +6 for Stealth, allowing it to effectively hide in its natural environment, and a +5 for Perception, enhancing its awareness of surroundings. The creature is immune to poison damage and is resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, which provides it with exceptional durability in combat. Its condition immunity to being poisoned further enhances its survivability.

The Oasis Keeper possesses several special abilities that shape its behavior in combat. It can hold its breath for up to 30 minutes, allowing it to remain submerged in water without needing air, which is advantageous for sneaky approaches. Its Oasis Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in sandy terrain or while submerged in water, helping it to remain undetected by enemies. The Pacifying Secretions ability can transform any water it contaminates into poison after an hour. If a creature drinks this poisoned water, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become calmed for a full day, feeling compelled to remain near the oasis and suffering disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. This adds a layer of control over opponents, as repeated exposure further complicates their ability to resist the calming effect.

During combat, the Oasis Keeper utilizes its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make two attacks in one turn: one with its stinger and one with its bite. The Bite attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 21 piercing damage on a successful hit, showcasing its strong melee capabilities. The Stinger attack also has a +9 to hit, inflicting 14 piercing damage and imposing a crucial DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the victim fails this save, they take additional poison damage and become incapacitated for one minute. Successful saves reduce the damage to half and negate the incapacitation effect, but the target can attempt to save again at the end of their turns, providing a recurring threat within the combat environment. Overall, the Oasis Keeper is a potent adversary, capable of controlling the battlefield and incapacitating foes through a mix of physical attacks and deadly poison mechanics.
