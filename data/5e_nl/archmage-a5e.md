With a Challenge Rating of 11, the Archmage is equipped to pose a significant threat to adventurers, boasting an impressive pool of hit points at 117, along with strong spellcasting abilities and a variety of powerful spells. Their ability to influence the battlefield with spells like Lightning Bolt and Confusion demonstrates their potency in offensive and control tactics. However, despite their strengths, the Archmage has an Armor Class of only 12, indicating that they can be vulnerable to strong attacks if not adequately protected. They thrive in strategic situations, relying heavily on spells and special abilities, and their high Intelligence score of 20 ensures that they are not easily outwitted.

They possess strong saving throws in Intelligence (+9) and Wisdom (+7), demonstrating their resilience against mental attacks. Additionally, the Archmage excels in skills such as Arcana (+9), History (+9), Insight (+7), and Perception (+7), showing proficiency in both knowledge and awareness-related tasks. They are immune to psychic damage and the charmed condition while benefiting from the Mind Blank spell, providing a layer of protection against mind-influencing effects and direct damage.

The Archmage is capable of casting spells as an 18th-level spellcaster, with a spell save DC of 17 and a +9 bonus to hit with spell attacks. They can cast shield at 1st level and alter self at 2nd level without using spell slots, allowing for increased defensive capabilities. The Archmage has access to a wide variety of spells prepared, including cantrips like fire bolt, which deals fire damage, and various leveled spells that cater to offense, defense, and utility.

Their special abilities greatly enhance their combat effectiveness. The Foresight ability provides the Archmage with advantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, while opponents face disadvantage on attacks against them. Mind Blank offers complete immunity to any psychic damage and safeguards against mind-reading or charm effects. In terms of actions available to the Archmage:
