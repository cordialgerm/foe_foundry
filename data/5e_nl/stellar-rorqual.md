The Stellar Rorqual is a gargantuan aberration known for its cosmic theme and extraordinary abilities. With an armor class of 14, it can withstand a significant amount of damage due to its natural armor, and its impressive hit point total of 165 allows it to endure prolonged encounters. This creature is particularly strong in melee combat, boasting a Strength score of 26, which contributes to extremely powerful physical attacks. However, its Dexterity is relatively poor, scoring only -1, which makes it less effective at evading attacks. The Stellar Rorqual flies gracefully, able to soar at 80 feet per turn and swim at 40 feet, which gives it considerable maneuverability in combat. This creature is vulnerable to force damage but is immune to cold, fire, and radiant damage, making it resilient against many sources of harm. The Stellar Rorqual communicates through telepathy but cannot speak, and it has a unique ability called Mouth Compartment that creates a secure space in its mouth for other creatures, giving them total cover from attacks outside. 

The Stellar Rorqual has several notable attributes and abilities. Its Strength score of 26 gives it a very good modifier of +8, allowing for formidable melee attacks. Its Constitution score of 22 grants it a good modifier of +6, contributing to its survivability with high hit points. With a Wisdom score of 18, it has an exceptional bonus of +4, enabling it to excel in perception checks, while its Intelligence is very low at -2. The Stellar Rorqual has saving throw bonuses of +2 to Dexterity and +6 to Wisdom, translating into average and good effectiveness respectively in those areas. It also has blindsight extending to 360 feet, making it highly aware of its surroundings even without vision.

The Stellar Rorqual's actions include a Multiattack, allowing it to make two separate attacks in one turn. It can use a Head Smash or Tail Slap, both of which deal substantial bludgeoning damage. The Head Smash attack has a +12 to hit and inflicts 30 damage on a successful strike, while the Tail Slap similarly has a +12 to hit and does 26 damage. Additionally, it can unleash an Energy Burst that deals 24 force damage with a +8 to hit, targeting enemies at a range of up to 120 feet.

Two special abilities further enhance the Stellar Rorqual's combat prowess. The Mouth Compartment allows creatures inside its mouth to remain safe from external threats and enables them to enhance their perception by connecting to the rorqualâ€™s senses through the crystalline growths. The Stellar Burst ability triggers an explosive release of solar energy upon the creature's demise, dealing devastating damage in a wide radius that can incapacitate nearby foes. Finally, the Planar Dive ability grants the Stellar Rorqual the power to transport itself and willing companions to different planes of existence, akin to the plane shift spell, offering intriguing opportunities for tactical retreats or strategic movements. Overall, the Stellar Rorqual is a formidable creature that excels in physical combat while also providing unique advantages in maneuverability and environment control.
