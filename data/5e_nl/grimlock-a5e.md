The Grimlock is a medium humanoid creature that serves as a stealthy combatant adept at ambush tactics. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is considered a low-level threat, making it suitable for early encounters for adventurers. Its notable strengths include decent physical attributes, particularly its strength, dexterity, and constitution, all set at 14, which provides it a good modifier of +2 in relevant checks. While it has vulnerabilities due to its poor charisma and average wisdom, its ability to remain hidden in rocky terrains through camouflage and its keen senses gives it a tactical edge in combat situations. Despite its low hit points at 13, making it somewhat fragile, its melee and ranged capabilities allow it to inflict decent damage on adversaries.

The Grimlock has the following attributes: strength 14 (+2), dexterity 14 (+2), constitution 14 (+2), intelligence 14 (+2), wisdom 10 (+0), and charisma 8 (-1). Its armor class is relatively low at 12, signifying it is not very good at avoiding attacks, placing it at a disadvantage in defensive situations. For its skills, the Grimlock excels in athletics with a +4 modifier, stealth with a +4 modifier, and engineering with a +4 modifier, making it very good in physical endeavors. It has a passive perception of 14, relying heavily on its keen hearing and smell to detect hidden threats, allowing it to be very effective in scouting and ambush scenarios while being immune to blindness.

In terms of actions, the Grimlock can attack with a spiked club, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and deals a total of 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 2 (1d4) piercing damage on a successful hit. For grappling, it employs a move called Throttle, which allows it to inflict the same amount of damage while also grappling the target with an escape DC of 12, preventing the victim from breathing. Additionally, it can attack at a distance using a sling, with the same +4 to hit and similar damage output of 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

The Grimlock also possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. With Camouflage, it receives advantage on Stealth checks made to hide in rocky terrain, effectively allowing it to blend in with the environment and ambush unsuspecting foes. Moreover, it boasts Keen Hearing and Smell, granting it advantage on Perception checks that rely on these senses, making it a formidable opponent for any adventurer trying to sneak past or deceive it. Overall, the Grimlock's blend of physical prowess and stealth capabilities makes it a versatile enemy in the subterranean realms it inhabits.
