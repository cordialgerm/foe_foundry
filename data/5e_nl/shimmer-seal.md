The Shimmer Seal is a unique and agile creature categorized as a Medium Beast, notable for its excellent swimming capabilities and its ability to blend into icy environments. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. This creature boasts a solid hit point pool of 105, derived from 14d8+42, making it quite resilient in combat. Its key strengths lie in its high Strength and good Dexterity, allowing it to deal significant damage and evade attacks effectively. However, its Intelligence and Charisma are low, making it less effective in social interactions and certain puzzle scenarios. The Shimmer Seal is particularly dangerous when near icy surfaces, leveraging its special abilities for stealth and mobility.

The Shimmer Seal has the following ability scores: a Strength of 18, which provides a modifier of +4, giving it a very good ability to inflict damage and engage in melee combat. Its Dexterity is 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is good for agility and evasion. The Constitution is 17, offering a +3 modifier, thus providing it with a good resilience to damage. The creature has a low Intelligence score of 5, giving it a -3 modifier, which is very bad for mental tasks. Its Wisdom is average at 12, with a +1 modifier, useful for perception and insight checks, while its Charisma is 9, translating to a -1 modifier, making it ineffective in social encounters.

The Shimmer Seal has advantageous saving throws with a +4 to Wisdom and +2 to Charisma, which helps it resist effects that target these attributes. It possesses notable skills in acrobatics (+8), performance (+5), and stealth (+5), indicating its capability to move gracefully and remain unnoticed in appropriate environments. The creature also has damage resistance to cold, allowing it to mitigate some damage from ice-related attacks. With darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 11, it can navigate and spot threats effectively in low-light environments.

One of the standout features of the Shimmer Seal is its limited invisibility when on icy surfaces or underwater, allowing it to remain unseen by most creatures, except for seals and beings of its choice. It possesses the ability known as Sureflippered, which lets it traverse and climb icy terrains without difficulty, ensuring that it can maneuver freely during combat or exploration. Additionally, the Underwater Propulsion ability allows the Shimmer Seal to take the Dash action as a bonus action while submerged, significantly increasing its mobility and making it a challenging opponent in aquatic encounters.

In combat, the Shimmer Seal employs a Multiattack strategy, which allows it to make two tusk attacks in a single turn, enhancing its damage output. Each tusk attack has a +7 to hit, indicating a very good chance of landing a successful strike, and with a reach of 5 feet, it can engage foes directly in melee range. Each successful tusk hit inflicts 14 slashing damage, calculated as 3d6 + 4, demonstrating its potential to deal substantial damage in combat situations.
