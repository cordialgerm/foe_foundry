The Ala is a medium-sized Fey creature classified as chaotic evil, presenting a formidable threat in combat encounters. With a high Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of 127 hit points, it is well-equipped to endure assaults from adventurers. The Ala's exceptional Strength of 20 allows it to deliver powerful melee attacks, complemented by its ability to fly and evade attacks with its Flyby ability, adding to its strategic mobility in battle. Notably, the creature is immune to lightning, poison, and thunder damage, making it particularly resilient against certain types of magical and physical attacks. However, its low Charisma score of 8 indicates it may struggle with social interactions and certain charm effects. 

The Ala has several notable attributes: its Strength is rated at +5, which translates to exceptional effectiveness in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity rating of +3 provides good agility, contributing to both its Stealth capability and its Armor Class. Constitution is rated at +4, which supports the creature's ability to absorb damage more effectively, and it has a Wisdom rating of +3, granting it very good perception skills. However, with an Intelligence score of 0 and a Charisma score of -1, it excels in physical prowess yet falters in mental and social contexts.

In combat, the Ala utilizes a Multiattack action, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks on its turn. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet; if it connects, it inflicts 9 piercing damage and an additional 7 poison damage, which stems from its Poisonous Flesh ability. Similarly, its Claw attacks also have a +8 to hit, deal 8 slashing damage, and add the same 7 poison damage as well. 

The Lightning’s Kiss attack is particularly powerful, with a recharge mechanic that allows it to be used again on a roll of 5 or 6. It can target up to three victims within a 30-foot range, requiring those targets to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in a devastating 28 lightning damage, while a successful save halves that damage, making it a significant threat, particularly if the Ala can manipulate its surroundings to maximize its offensive capabilities.

Overall, the Ala is a dangerous opponent that combines mobility, poison damage, and elemental attacks to threaten adventurers, particularly in environments with electrical storms, as its Storm's Strength ability enhances the effectiveness of its attacks in such conditions.
