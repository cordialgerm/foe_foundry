The Mastiff is a medium-sized beast commonly encountered as a domesticated animal, often serving as a guard or companion. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, it is not particularly powerful compared to many foes adventurers might face, but it benefits from speed and perceptive abilities that make it an excellent scout and protector. The Mastiffâ€™s strengths lie in its agility and heightened senses, giving it an edge in detecting threats. However, it is vulnerable with only 9 hit points and low overall armor class, making it susceptible to damaging attacks. In combat, the Mastiff showcases its effectiveness through a bite attack that can knock enemies prone, and its ability to protect allies enhances its role as a guardian in encounters.

The Mastiff has the following attributes: Strength is +1 (average), Dexterity is +2 (good), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is -4 (very bad), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is -2 (bad). 

It possesses the heightened hearing and smell special ability, which increases its Perception score to 16 when using these senses. This heightened sense makes the Mastiff better suited for tracking and detecting hidden creatures.

In terms of actions, the Mastiff can execute a Bite attack with a +4 to hit, which signifies good attacking proficiency. The reach of this melee weapon attack is 5 feet, allowing it to engage targets in close quarters. Upon a successful hit, it deals 4 piercing damage (calculated as 1d4 + 2), and if the target is another creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, effectively giving the Mastiff a tactical advantage in combat.

As a reaction, the Mastiff can utilize the Protect Friend ability. This ability allows the Mastiff, upon witnessing a friendly humanoid being attacked by a creature within 5 feet, to immediately make a Bite attack against the attacker. This reaction not only adds to its defensive capabilities but also allows for strategic play to shield allies in critical moments.
