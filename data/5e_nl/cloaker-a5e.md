The Cloaker is a large aberration that serves as both a stealthy combatant and a cunning deceiver in encounters. It possesses a challenging combination of durability, mobility, and diverse attacks, making it a formidable foe. With an Armor Class of 13 and 97 hit points, it showcases good resilience. The Cloaker can walk at 10 feet and fly at 50 feet, allowing it to effectively engage or evade opponents depending on the situation. It has a Challenge Rating of 8, equating it to a level 8 encounter and yielding 3,900 experience points upon defeat. However, it exhibits weaknesses in bright light, since it suffers disadvantages on attack rolls and Perception checks in such conditions.

The Cloaker's attributes demonstrate strong physical capabilities, particularly in Strength (18, which is exceptional) and Dexterity (16, which is very good). Its Constitution score (14) lends it good resilience, while its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are all average (12). Its only saving throw, Wisdom, has a modifier of +4, which is considered good. The Cloaker is proficient in stealth with a +6 modifier, making it very capable in sneaking or ambushing scenarios. It also has damage resistance to bludgeoning and is immune to being charmed or frightened.

The Cloaker has several special abilities that enhance its cunning nature. The False Appearance ability allows it to blend perfectly into its surroundings when motionless, mimicking a black cloak and potentially surprising unsuspecting characters. However, its Light Sensitivity presents a significant challenge in bright environments, affecting its effectiveness in combat.

In terms of actions, the Cloaker has a Bite attack, which performs a melee weapon attack with a +7 modifier to hit and reaches 5 feet. If successful, it deals an average of 11 piercing damage while also grappling the target, forcing them to make a DC 15 escape check. The grappling feature enhances the damage for subsequent turns and can blind and suffocate the target if the Cloaker has advantage on the attack. It can only grapple one creature at a time. The Tail attack, with the same +7 to hit modifier, has a reach of 10 feet and deals 7 slashing damage and 3 poison damage, requiring a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in the target being poisoned until the end of the Cloaker's next turn.

The Cloaker also has a terrifying Moan ability, affecting all non-aberration creatures within 60 feet. Those who fail a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw become frightened until the end of the Cloaker's next turn, while success affords immunity to this effect for 24 hours. The Phantasms ability, usable once per day, creates illusory duplicates, granting attackers disadvantage when targeting the Cloaker. This distraction lasts for one minute unless disrupted by bright light or if the Cloaker successfully grapples a creature.

In reaction, the Cloaker employs the Reactive Tail ability, allowing it to counter-attack with a tail strike when hit or missed by a melee attack. Additionally, when the Cloaker takes damage, it can use the Angry Moan ability to instill fear in its opponents once again. This combination of abilities and attacks makes the Cloaker a challenging adversary, requiring teams to think tactically and be cautious in their approach.
