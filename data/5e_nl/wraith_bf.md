The Wraith is a Medium undead creature known for its ethereal form and ability to drain the life from the living. With an Armor Class of 14 and 85 hit points, it is relatively resilient, especially considering its mobility. Its speed is unique, as the Wraith cannot move on the ground but can fly at a speed of 60 feet while hovering. The Wraith is a Challenge Rating 5 creature, making it a formidable opponent for low to mid-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its mobility, ability to drain life, and its capacity to create minions from the fallen. However, the Wraith suffers in sunlight, where it has disadvantage on attack rolls and reduced perception capabilities. 

The Wraith has a Strength score of -2, which signifies very bad physical strength, a Dexterity score of +4 (good), a Constitution score of +3 (good), an Intelligence score of +1 (average), a Wisdom score of +2 (average), and a Charisma score of +2 (average). Its Stealth skill is exceptional with a value of 17, allowing it to remain undetected easily. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Additionally, the Wraith speaks the languages it knew in life.

The Wraith has several special abilities that contribute to its unique combat style. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, although it takes damage if it ends its turn inside an object. Sunlight Sensitivity makes it weaker in bright light, impacting its ability to hit targets and its perception. Undead Nature indicates that the Wraith does not require basic needs like air, food, drink, or sleep, while Undead Resilience grants it immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition.

In terms of actions, the Wraith can perform a Multiattack, making two Life Drain attacks. The Life Drain move is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 18 points of necrotic damage (4d6 + 4), and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by the damage dealt until it finishes a long rest. This effect can lead to death if the target's maximum hit points drop to zero. The Wraith can also create a specter from a humanoid it can see that has died violently within the last minute, allowing it to control up to seven specters at once.

As a bonus action, the Wraith can use its Trail of Death ability, which allows it to move up to 30 feet in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. During this movement, if it enters a creature's space, that creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in the creature being afflicted with wasting doom, which deals 3 necrotic damage every turn until the creature starts in sunlight or regains hit points.

Finally, as a reaction, the Wraith can use Unravel Life when it sees a creature within 30 feet regaining hit points. This ability allows the Wraith to halve the amount of healing the creature receives, making it a potent foe for healing-focused parties. Overall, the Wraith is a cunning and dangerous undead creature that utilizes its abilities to weaken and control its enemies.
