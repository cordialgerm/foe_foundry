The Void Fungus is a peculiar and eerie creature of medium size classified under the plant type with a chaotic neutral alignment. This unique fungus blends into its environment with the ability to remain motionless, making it difficult for adventurers to detect until it is too late. With a respectable armor class of 14 and 65 hit points, it can endure moderate combat situations. Its challenge rating of 3 suggests that it presents a solid challenge to a well-prepared party, providing 700 XP upon defeat. Notably, the Void Fungus possesses high wisdom, granting it a good perception skill, but it lacks in charisma, which may limit its interactions with other creatures. 

In terms of stats, the Void Fungus has the following attributes: Strength is 15 with a modifier of +2, which is considered good for straightforward physical attacks. Dexterity is 14, also with a +2 modifier, enabling it to dodge some attacks adequately. Constitution is 14, yielding an average +2, providing decent resilience. Intelligence sits at a base of 10 with no modifier, making it average in terms of cognitive abilities. Wisdom, crucial for perception, sits at 16 with a +3 modifier, which is very good, enhancing its ability to notice threats. Charisma, however, is very low at 4, resulting in a modifier of -3, which is very bad for social interactions.

The Void Fungus has some distinct advantages and weaknesses. It is vulnerable to radiant damage, meaning attacks dealing this type will be more effective against it. On the other hand, it has resistance to cold and fire damage, reducing the effectiveness of those types of attacks. Importantly, it is immune to a variety of conditions including being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, and poisoned, making it a challenging foe in many combat situations. Its blindsight extends to 120 feet, allowing it to perceive nearby creatures despite its blindness, while it communicates through telepathy up to 60 feet but cannot speak.

The Void Fungus's special abilities include False Appearance, allowing it to blend in seamlessly with its environment as a patch of glowing fungus when motionless, making stealth tactics effective against unsuspecting foes. It also emits dim light in a 10-foot radius, illuminating its surrounding area.

In combat, the Void Fungus can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make two attacks during its turn, either using Poisonous Mycelium or Psychic Blasts. If it strikes a creature with both Psychic Blasts, the target becomes charmed for one minute unless they succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themselves upon a success.

The Poisonous Mycelium attack consists of a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, capable of dealing a total of 6 piercing damage plus an additional 7 poison damage (2d6) if the target fails a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The poisoned condition lasts until the end of the foe's next turn if they fail this save.

The Psychic Blast is a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, allowing it to strike targets from a distance of 60 feet for 12 psychic damage (2d8+3). 

Lastly, the Consume Energy ability allows the Void Fungus to draw psychic energy from any creature within 30 feet that it can see. This attack deals 18 psychic damage (4d8) with a DC 13 Charisma save for half damage. Importantly, for each psychic damage dealt, the Void Fungus regains an equal amount of hit points, making it a durable foe that can sustain itself during prolonged encounters.
