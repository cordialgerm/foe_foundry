The Sewer Weird is a formidable large elemental creature, embodying the essence of stagnant waters and toxic environments. It is neutral evil in nature, making it a potential adversary filled with cunning and malice. With a solid armor class of 15 due to its natural armor, an impressive hit point total of 136 derived from 16d10+48, and a movement speed that allows it to walk 30 feet and swim 60 feet, the Sewer Weird is versatile in combat. Its challenge rating of 8 signifies that it poses a significant threat to adventurers. Notably, it boasts a high Dexterity score of 19, granting a good modifier of +4, and a Constitution score of 17, allowing it a good +3 modifier which contributes to its overall durability. However, the creature is particularly weak in Intelligence and Charisma, with modifiers of -3 and -4 respectively, making it less effective in social situations and strategic planning. Its immunities to poison damage and various conditions provide it with strong defensive capabilities.

The Sewer Weird has a variety of special abilities that enhance its battlefield presence. It possesses Elemental Nature, which means it doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. This ability allows the Sewer Weird to operate in hostile environments without being impeded. Its Flammable Fumes ability triggers a violent reaction when it takes fire damage, causing it to erupt in a gout of flame. Upon taking fire damage, the creature suffers 5 thunder damage and all creatures within a 10-foot radius must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in an additional 3 thunder damage and 7 fire damage. The Water Form ability allows it to occupy spaces as narrow as 1 inch wide, enabling it to move through enemy lines with ease and making it a tricky foe to corner.

In combat, the Sewer Weird can launch a fierce multiattack, making three Slam attacks. Each Slam is executed as a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit. It deals 13 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit and forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; failure results in the target being poisoned until the end of its next turn. The Sewer Overflow is a powerful ability that can be used only when it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This attack emits a wave of filth and water in a 15-foot cube, dealing 18 bludgeoning damage and 18 poison damage to all creatures within the area. Targets can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to halve the damage and avoid being infected with sewer plague.

Overall, the Sewer Weird showcases a blend of resilience, mobility, and damaging abilities that makes it a dangerous encounter for adventurers. Its elemental nature allows it to manipulate its surroundings, while its strengths in resisting damage and applying debilitating effects make it a force to be reckoned with in any combat scenario.
