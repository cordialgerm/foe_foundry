The Stone-Eater Slime is a small, unaligned ooze that poses a significant threat due to its formidable combat abilities and its unique interaction with stone and crystal structures. With an Armor Class of 12, it possesses a decent defense bolstered by its natural armor, making it somewhat resilient in battle. It boasts 90 hit points (12d6 + 48), which gives it a solid presence on the battlefield, allowing it to endure a fair amount of damage before succumbing. The slime moves at a speed of 20 feet on land and can climb at a speed of 10 feet, making it versatile in navigating different terrains. Although it has a weak challenge rating of 4, its strengths lie in its ability to petrify foes and dissolve stone, which can turn the tide in combat. 

The Stone-Eater Slime has a strong Constitution score of 19 (+4), which provides it with a very good level of durability. Its Strength is also quite high at 16 (+3), enabling it to deal meaningful melee damage. However, its Intelligence (1, -5) and Charisma (3, -4) scores reflect low mental capabilities, making it incapable of complex thought or social interaction. It is immune to acid damage and a wide range of conditions, including being blinded, charmed, or petrified, making it remarkably resilient to typical forms of control. 

In terms of special abilities, the Stone-Eater Slime has an Amorphous trait, allowing it to squeeze through spaces that are at least 1 foot wide without any difficulty. Its Ooze Nature means that it does not require sleep, enabling it to remain active indefinitely. Additionally, its Spider Climb ability grants it the capacity to traverse difficult surfaces and ceilings without needing to make ability checks, enhancing its mobility.

In combat, the Stone-Eater Slime can execute a Multiattack, making two Slam attacks against its targets. Each Slam attack has a +5 to hit and can inflict 10 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 3) along with an additional 3 acid damage (1d6). A successful hit may also petrify the target for 1 minute if they fail a Constitution saving throw (DC 14), with the possibility of repeating the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect on themselves.

One of its notable abilities is Dissolve Stone, which allows the slime to touch a petrified creature or a nonmagical stone or crystal object within 5 feet. If the object is not being worn or carried, it can destroy a 6-inch cube of it, restoring 10 hit points (3d6) to the slime. If the object is worn or carried, the creature can attempt a Dexterity saving throw (DC 14) to avoid the slime's touch. If the target is a petrified creature, it suffers 21 acid damage (6d6) with no resistance due to its state of petrification, with the slime regaining hit points equal to half the damage dealt. Additionally, if the slime touches stone armor or a stone shield, those objects receive a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to their Armor Class, potentially rendering them useless over time. If a stone weapon is affected, it receives a similar permanent penalty to its damage rolls, reflecting the slime's destructive capabilities.
