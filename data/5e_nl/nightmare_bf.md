The Nightmare is a formidable Large fiend that serves as both a mount and a menacing creature in combat scenarios. With an Armor Class of 13 derived from its natural armor and a solid pool of 76 hit points, it presents a decent level of durability for a creature of its Challenge Rating (CR 3). Its speed is impressive, allowing it to move 60 feet on the ground and 90 feet while flying. The Nightmare’s high Strength (+4) and decent Dexterity (+2) make it a solid attacker, while its Charisma (+2) provides some minor social advantages. However, it has a low Intelligence and its situational resistance to fire damage through its special abilities and effects demonstrate its prowess in fire theme-based encounters. Overall, the Nightmare excels in creating chaotic conditions in battle, punishing intruders who venture too close with fire and evasive movements but suffers from its inability to communicate verbally.

The Nightmare has the following attributes: Strength is +4 (very good), Dexterity is +2 (average), Constitution is +3 (good), Intelligence is +0 (very bad), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is +2 (average). These attributes dictate its combat effectiveness, resilience to damage, and performance in social situations or skill checks. 

Among its special abilities, the Nightmare emits Illumination, casting bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, which can influence stealth and visibility during encounters. It also possesses the Riding Flames ability; any creature riding the Nightmare with its consent gains resistance to fire damage, while those who attempt to ride without permission take fire damage each turn. 

In terms of actions, the Nightmare can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to deliver two Flaming Hoof attacks in one turn. The Flaming Hoof attack has a +6 to hit and deals 7 points (1d6 + 4) of bludgeoning damage alongside an additional 7 points (2d6) of fire damage, making this attack particularly dangerous against enemies weak to fire. Additionally, the Ethereal Stride ability enables the Nightmare and up to three adjacent willing creatures to transition between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, providing unique tactical options for evasion or positioning.

As a bonus action, the Nightmare can activate its Burning Hoofprints feature. By intensifying the heat of its hooves, it leaves a trail of burning tracks behind it. Any creature entering or starting its turn on these burning hoofprints must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 3 points (1d6) of fire damage. The hoofprints disappear at the beginning of the Nightmare’s next turn, adding an element of environmental hazard to its movements in battle. 

In summary, the Nightmare combines strong physical capabilities with fire-themed abilities, offering both offensive and tactical maneuvering options that can shift the dynamics of a combat encounter considerably.
