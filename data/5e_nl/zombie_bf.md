The Zombie is a Medium undead creature often encountered in darker, horror-themed campaigns. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it serves as an entry-level foe for novice adventurers. This creature has a notably low Armor Class of 8 and only 16 Hit Points, making it relatively easy to harm; however, its true resilience lies in its special abilities. Zombies are not only slow, with a movement speed of 20 feet, but also possess remarkable fortitude against dying, thanks to their Undead Fortitude ability. They are immune to various conditions, including poison, which adds to their survivability. However, they lack intelligence and communication skills, making them predictable foes. They thrive on grappling their opponents and can turn slain foes into new zombies, posing a continuous threat to unwary adventurers.

The Zombie has the following attributes: Strength of +2 (which is considered average), Dexterity of -2 (very bad), Constitution of +3 (good), Intelligence of -4 (very bad), Wisdom of +0 (average), and Charisma of -3 (bad). These modifiers indicate that the Zombie is physically strong and durable, but severely lacking in speed, intelligence, and social interaction capabilities. 

The Zombie has darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and it possesses a Perception score of 10 (average), which reflects a basic awareness of its surroundings. With a Stealth skill of 8 (very bad), it has difficulty sneaking up on enemies. Although it understands languages it knew in life, it cannot communicate verbally.

Among its special abilities, the notable Undead Fortitude allows the Zombie to potentially avoid being knocked unconscious. When the Zombie takes damage that would drop it to 0 Hit Points, it must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 5 plus the damage taken, except when the damage is from a radiant source or a critical hit. Success means the Zombie remains standing at 1 Hit Point. This ability makes Zombies much harder to eliminate as they can effectively shrug off lethal blows if their foes do not deal radiant damage.

The Undead Nature ability grants the Zombie self-sufficiency, as it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep. Additionally, through Undead Resilience, the Zombie becomes immune to poison damage and conditions like exhaustion and being poisoned, enhancing its enduring nature in prolonged encounters.

In terms of actions, the Zombie can perform a Slam attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 5 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Furthermore, if the target is Medium or smaller and is hit, it becomes grappled with an escape DC of 12, which can hinder the target and limit its movements.

As a bonus action, the Zombie can use Rotten Hold, allowing it to gnaw on a grappling target. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2 poison damage. More sinisterly, if a Humanoid dies from this effect, it will rise again as a Zombie after 24 hours unless it is restored to life or its body is destroyed, ensuring a continual cycle of undead foes.

Overall, the Zombie is a straightforward yet troublesome adversary that can overwhelm players when encountered in numbers and exploit its unique abilities to sustain itself against defeated foes.
