The Wrackwraith is a medium-sized undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It serves as an antagonist in combat scenarios due to its unique abilities to manipulate its environment and combat various foes. With a decent Armor Class of 13 and a total of 45 hit points, the Wrackwraith can be challenging for parties of lower levels. Its mobility is noteworthy, as it can walk 30 feet and fly the same distance, giving it an edge in both positioning and evasion. The creature operates at a challenge rating of 3, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers seeking to test their skills. One of its most interesting aspects is its ability to animate piles of debris, allowing it to protect itself while engaging its foes with necrotic attacks, making it both a powerful offensive and defensive entity.

The Wrackwraith has several attributes that contribute to its effectiveness in combat: it possesses a Strength score of 14, granting it a good modifier of +2; a Dexterity score of 16 with a very good +3 modifier; a Constitution score of 16, also yielding a very good +3 modifier; an Intelligence score of 10 with an average +0 modifier; a Wisdom score of 12 with an average +1 modifier; and a Charisma score of 11 with an average +0 modifier. In terms of skills, the Wrackwraith has a perception score of +1, which is also considered average. Its damage immunities include necrotic and poison damage, affording it considerable resilience against certain types of attacks. Additionally, the creature resists a variety of damage types including acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder, as well as non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, making it an exceptionally durable opponent. The Wrackwraith is immune to several conditions—a significant advantage in combat situations—as it cannot be charmed, exhausted, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, or restrained. It has a passive perception of 13 and can communicate in any languages it knew in life.

The Wrackwraith's special abilities enhance its tactical capabilities. The **Incorporeal Movement** allows it to move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, which can enable it to bypass defenders. However, if it ends its turn inside an object, it takes force damage of 5 (1d10). The **Wrack Form** enables it to animate piles of debris, increasing its Armor Class to 18 while it is in this state. While animated, it gains access to the **Slam** and **Deluge** actions but loses its immunity to being grappled or restrained and cannot fly. This state can be ended by voluntarily stopping or if it takes 15 or more damage in one turn, requiring it to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 13.

In terms of actions, the **Ghostly Touch** is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a range of 5 feet, dealing 7 (1d8+3) necrotic damage. The **Slam** action, available only in its wrack form, also has a +5 to hit and deals significant damage of 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning as well as an additional 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. This attack can grapple a target of Large size or smaller, rendering them restrained and unable to breathe or speak until the grapple ends. The **Animate Wrack** action allows the Wrackwraith to pull debris into a protective covering, enhancing its defenses. The **Deluge** action also works against grappled opponents, filling their lungs with seawater, algae, and debris, dealing 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, while simultaneously choking them unless they succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to take half damage without choking. A creature affected by choking can attempt to save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.

As a bonus action, the Wrackwraith can perform **Wrack Jump**, which has a recharge mechanic requiring a roll of 4 to 6. This ability allows it to magically teleport to a different pile of debris within 60 feet and immediately use the **Animate Wrack** action, making it a clever and evasive adversary in encounters.
