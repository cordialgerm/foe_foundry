The Mi-Go is a formidable entity classified as a Medium Plant with a neutral evil alignment. It features exceptional attributes, particularly in its Intelligence at +7, which is very good, and Constitution at +5, indicating high durability in combat. Its Dexterity of +4 grants it good agility, making it a threat both in melee and ranged situations. The Mi-Go has a solid Armor Class of 17 thanks to its natural armor, coupled with a substantial hit points pool of 95, making it quite durable during encounters. It can navigate terrain by walking 60 feet and has the ability to fly at a speed of 30 feet, providing it with tactical options in battle. As a Challenge Rating 5 creature, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, earning 1,800 experience points upon defeat. 

In terms of defensive capabilities, the Mi-Go benefits from damage resistances against cold and radiant damage, giving it good resilience against specific types of attacks. Its senses are impressive, with blindsight extending to 30 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, complementing its passive Perception score of 15, which allows it to spot hidden creatures effectively. The Mi-Go can communicate in both Common and Void Speech, potentially making it an intriguing encounter in both combat and roleplay scenarios.

The Mi-Go possesses special abilities that enhance its already significant threat level. Upon its death, it releases "Deathly Spores," a cloud of spores that inflicts 14 (4d6) poison damage on creatures within a 10-foot radius if they fail a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, and they suffer from the poisoned condition until the end of their next turn. This ability can affect the dynamics of combat significantly by hindering multiple characters in close proximity to the creature. Additionally, the Mi-Go's "Void Traveler" ability allows it to exist without air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure, requiring only minimal starlight exposure a few times a year to survive. This means it is not restricted by typical environmental conditions, making it a versatile adversary in various settings.

The Mi-Go's actions in combat include a "Multiattack" option, allowing it to perform two attacks using either claws or psychic bolts. Its "Claw" attack features a +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 17 (3d8 + 4) slashing damage to a target. If the attacked foe is a Large or smaller creature, it gets grappled, requiring an escape DC of 15, which can be very impactful for controlling the battlefield. The "Psychic Bolt" is a ranged spell attack with a +10 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing 17 (3d6 + 7) psychic damage, posing a significant threat at a distance. Finally, it can unleash a "Spore Burst" (which requires a recharge on a roll of 5 or 6) in a 30-foot cone that forces creatures within to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that fail the save take 21 (6d6) poison damage and become incapacitated until the end of their next turn, while successful saves yield half damage, and they become unaffected by incapacitation. This ability combines both damage and crowd control, making the Mi-Go a significant force in any encounter.
