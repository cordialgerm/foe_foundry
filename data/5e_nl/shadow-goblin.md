The Shadow Goblin is a small and cunning humanoid characterized by its neutral evil alignment. Its typical habitat is darkness, where it excels in stealth and evasion, making it a tricky opponent for adventurers. With a decent Armor Class of 13 and 13 hit points, this creature is not particularly durable but compensates with agility and clever abilities. The Shadow Goblin's strengths lie in its high Dexterity, allowing it to perform stealthy maneuvers and attack with precision. Its mobility and ability to escape or hide enhance its survivability. However, it suffers from sunlight sensitivity, which significantly weakens it in well-lit environments. 

The Shadow Goblin has a challenge rating of 1/2, meaning it is considered a low-to-average threat, earning it 100 experience points upon defeat. It has the following attribute scores: Strength of 10, Dexterity of 16 (very good), Constitution of 12 (average), Intelligence of 13 (average), Wisdom of 12 (average), and a Charisma of 8 (bad). The Shadow Goblin is skilled in stealth with a +5 modifier, which is very good, and it possesses darkvision to see up to 60 feet in darkness, granting it an edge in low-light conditions.

The Shadow Goblin's special abilities enhance its tactical advantages. "Nimble Escape" allows it to use either the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on its turn, offering it excellent repositioning capabilities. "Shadow Camouflage" gives it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in dim light or darkness, making it even harder to detect. However, its "Sunlight Sensitivity" imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight while exposed to sunlight, which is a significant drawback. "Traveler in Darkness" provides advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to shadow roads and shadow magic, reflecting its innate knowledge of its shadowed domain. The "Unseelie Blessing" grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed and immunity to magical sleep, reinforcing its resilience against magical manipulation.

In terms of actions, the Shadow Goblin utilizes "Multiattack" to make two attacks with its kitchen knife, though the second attack is made at a disadvantage due to the creature's rapid movements. The kitchen knife itself is a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +5 to hit, which is good, and it has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet, dealing 5 piercing damage on a hit. 

For reactions, the Shadow Goblin can employ "Vengeful Jinx," a strategic move that allows it to curse an attacker who hits it. This curse imposes disadvantage on the attacker's rolls until the end of their next turn, potentially turning the tide of combat in the Shadow Goblin's favor by weakening its opponentâ€™s effectiveness.
