The Ancient Black Dragon possesses several remarkable special abilities. "Ambusher" allows it to have advantage on stealth when submerged and to deal damage while grappling an unseen target. Its "Amphibious" trait grants it the ability to breathe in both air and water. With "Legendary Resistance" (three times per day), the dragon can choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, shedding scales that turn to mud, resulting in a temporary decrease in armor class when uses are depleted. The "Ruthless" ability enables it to make a claw attack after scoring a critical hit, increasing its offensive capabilities significantly. Its "Innate Spellcasting" allows for casting spells without needing material components; its spell save DC is 19, and it can cast powerful spells like fog cloud and insect plague, which can alter the battlefield and affect enemy visibility and movement.

In combat, the Ancient Black Dragon’s "Multiattack" allows it to make one bite attack and two claw attacks, or to use its "Acid Spit" in place of one of its melee attacks. The "Bite" attack, with a +15 to hit and a damage output of 30 piercing plus 9 acid damage, can also grapple (escape DC 23) an opponent, placing them in a vulnerable position. The "Claw" and "Tail" attacks each do 21 damage (both having a +15 to hit), with the tail attack also capable of pushing targets away. "Acid Spit" forces a creature to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, potentially dealing severe damage and inflicting ongoing acid damage on failure. The "Acid Breath," with a recharge of 5-6, unleashes a significant line of acid damage over a wide area, blinding targets that fail their saves.

Additionally, the dragon has a "Tail Attack" reaction, which it can use when targeted by opponents, allowing it to make a retaliatory tail strike. For legendary actions, it can create magical darkness with "Darkness," frighten foes with "Roar," and perform a "Wing Attack," pushing enemies back and knocking them prone, while allowing the dragon to reposition in combat. Overall, the Ancient Black Dragon is a master of both offense and defense with numerous options that can turn the tide of battle in its favor.
