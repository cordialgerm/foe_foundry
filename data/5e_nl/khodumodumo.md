The Khodumodumo is a gargantuan monstrosity that serves as a formidable foe in any encounter. This creature is characterized by its impressive stature, possessing an Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, and a substantial pool of Hit Points amounting to 186, calculated from 12d20+60. With a Challenge Rating of 14, it poses a significant threat, as it can dish out high damage while having good resistance to many forms of attacks. Its physical attributes are notably strong, with a Strength of 23 (+6), a Dexterity of 20 (+5), and a Constitution of 21 (+5), which translates to exceptional combat effectiveness. However, its Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom scores are quite low, hindering its capabilities in social or strategic interactions.

The Khodumodumo has a notable array of abilities and actions, including saving throws of +11 for Strength and +10 for Constitution, making it very good at resists physical challenges. It also has good Stealth and exceptional Perception skills, showcasing its ability to hide effectively and detect its surroundings. The creature has damage resistances against fire, poison, and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, further enhancing its durability in battle while relying heavily on physical strength and ferocity rather than cunning.

One of its unique abilities is False Appearance, which allows the Khodumodumo to appear as an ordinary earthen hill when motionless, granting it an element of surprise against unsuspecting enemies. The Khodumodumo can deploy its Impaling Tongues, maintaining up to six at once. Each tongue can be attacked independently, having an Armor Class of 20 and 15 hit points, with immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying a tongue does not harm the Khodumodumo, and they can regrow after a long rest, making this creature challenging to disable permanently.

In combat, the Khodumodumo can utilize a Multiattack, making three attacks with its tongues, using the Reel ability, and making one attack with its bite. Its Bite attack has a +11 to hit with a reach of 10 feet and inflicts an impressive 33 (6d8 + 6) piercing damage. Notably, if the target is a Large or smaller creature that has been grappled by the Khodumodumo, it can be swallowed, resulting in the target being blinded and restrained while taking ongoing acid damage of 21 (6d6) at the start of each of the Khodumodumo's turns. If the Khodumodumo is dealt 30 damage or more in a single turn from a swallowed creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw to avoid regurgitating its meal, dropping the remaining creatures in a space nearby.

The Tongue attack has similar mechanics, also featuring a +11 to hit and a reach of 50 feet. On a successful hit, the target is grappled with an escape DC of 18, becoming restrained and subject to 8 (1d4 + 6) piercing damage at the start of its turns. The ability to Reel allows the Khodumodumo to pull grappled creatures up to 25 feet closer, further increasing its advantage in controlling the battlefield.

Overall, the Khodumodumo excels in both offense and defense, utilizing its physical prowess and unique abilities to dominate encounters while possessing certain vulnerabilities to strategic play.
