The Accursed Spirit Naga is a large and formidable monstrosity that thrives in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, possessing a challenge rating of 8. This creature boasts strong defensive capabilities, including a good armor class of 16 and significant hit points totaling 85, making it resilient in battle. Its strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, and charisma are all at a good level of 16, while its wisdom is slightly lower at 14, allowing it to perform well in combat and magical scenarios. The Accursed Spirit Naga is equipped with a variety of powerful attacks and spells, making it a versatile opponent on the battlefield. However, it has vulnerabilities because it can be affected by certain saving throw mechanics, especially for wisdom and constitution.

The Accursed Spirit Naga has the following attributes: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, which is good; Dexterity is 16 with a modifier of +3, also good; Constitution is 16, giving a +3 modifier that is good; Intelligence is 16, with a +3 modifier that is good; Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier, which is average; and Charisma is 16, providing a +3 modifier that is good. It has saving throws with the following values: Dexterity +6, Constitution +6, Wisdom +5, and Charisma +6, all providing good protection against various effects. The Naga is immune to poison damage and cannot be charmed or poisoned, which is an exceptional defensive ability. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and it understands Abyssal, Celestial, and Common languages.

The Accursed Spirit Naga has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe in both air and water, which gives it excellent versatility in different environments. Its magic resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, significantly improving its survivability against magical attacks.

In terms of actions during combat, the Naga can use a melee bite attack that has a +6 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, causing 10 piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails, it takes an additional 28 poison damage; if successful, it takes only half damage. 

Among the Naga's spellcasting abilities, it can cast **Hypnotic Pattern**, which creates a mesmerizing pattern of light. All creatures within 10 feet that can see it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed and incapacitated for one minute. This spell can effectively control the battlefield by disabling multiple foes at once. It can also unleash a **Lightning Bolt**, a powerful strike that creates a 5-foot-wide line of lightning extending 100 feet. Creatures in this line must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 lightning damage, reinforcing the Naga's offensive threat. 

The **Blight** spell allows the Naga to target a creature or plant within 30 feet, forcing it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On failure, the target suffers 36 necrotic damage; plant creatures take maximum damage and face disadvantage on their saving throw. This spell is particularly deadly against plant life and can eliminate nonmagical plants completely.

The Naga has the ability to execute a **Multiattack**, allowing it to cast a spell and follow up with its vampiric bite. The **Vampiric Bite** attack not only deals damage, but also grants the Naga temporary hit points equal to the poison damage dealt if the target fails their saving throw against poison.

As for reactions, the Naga can cast **Shield**, a first-level spell that grants it a +5 bonus to its AC when hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, including protection against the triggering attack. This effect lasts until the beginning of its next turn, providing crucial defensive measures in combat situations.
