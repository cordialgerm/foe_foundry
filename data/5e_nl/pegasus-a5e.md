The Pegasus is a celestial creature known for its majestic appearance, characterized by its large, horse-like frame and magnificent wings. As a creature of good alignment, the Pegasus serves as both a noble mount and a protector of the realms. With a respectable challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat in combat while also offering significant utility to those fortunate enough to bond with it. The creature's strengths lie in its high mobility, both on the ground and in the air, due to its walking speed of 60 feet and flying speed of 80 feet. Additionally, it boasts strong physical attributes with high Strength and Constitution scores, making it durable and effective in melee combat. However, it has a relatively average intelligence score, limiting its tactical abilities. The Pegasus excels in providing support to its rider, reflecting its nature as a divine being.

The Pegasus has an Armor Class of 13, which is average, and a total of 57 hit points, derived from rolling six ten-sided dice plus a Constitution modifier of 24, indicating good durability in battle. Its Strength score is 18, providing a modifier of +4, making its attacks quite powerful. The Dexterity score is 16, resulting in a +3 modifier which contributes to its excellent flying capabilities. The Constitution score reinforces its resilience with a +4 modifier, while its Intelligence at 10 offers a very bad modifier of +0, limiting its use of problem-solving strategies. The Wisdom score of 14 provides a good +2 modifier for perception checks and other wisdom-related abilities. Lastly, a Charisma score of 12 gives it an average +1 modifier, enhancing its presence in interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Pegasus has a +5 modifier in Dexterity, a +4 in Wisdom, and a +3 in Charisma. These modifiers indicate that it will perform well in avoiding magical effects or traps, as well as resisting charms or mental effects. With a passive perception of 17, thanks to its +4 proficiency in perception, it can reliably detect hidden foes or ambushes.

The Pegasus has two notable special abilities. The first is its "Good" aura, which signifies its alignment and may have effects on other creatures' behavior towards it. The second ability, "Divine Mount," allows a willing Pegasus to bond with a rider during a short rest. This bond is advantageous as it nullifies penalties typically associated with riding without a saddle. Moreover, if both the Pegasus and its rider are forced to make saving throws, the Pegasus automatically succeeds if the rider's roll is successful, reflecting the synergy of their partnership. If the Pegasus forms a new bond with a different rider, the previous one will no longer benefit from this ability.

In terms of actions, the Pegasus can perform a melee attack using its "Hooves." This attack has a +6 to hit, making it effective against most foes. The reach of this attack is 5 feet, and on a hit, it deals an impressive 11 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 2d6 plus its Strength modifier of +4. Additionally, if the Pegasus moves at least 20 feet toward a target before the attack and successfully strikes a Large or smaller creature, that creature must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. Failure results in the target falling prone, potentially giving the Pegasus and its allies a tactical advantage in combat.
