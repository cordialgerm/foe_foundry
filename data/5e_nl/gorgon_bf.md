The gorgon is a formidable large monstrosity that poses a significant threat in combat due to its strong physical attacks and the ability to petrify foes with its breath weapon. With an Armor Class of 18 and 96 hit points, it is quite durable, translating to a very good level of defense. Its average speed of 40 feet allows it to traverse the battlefield efficiently. As a Challenge Rating 5 creature, it is well-suited for mid-level adventurers, but its combination of high damage output and debilitating breath weapon can easily turn the tide of battle. It has weaknesses, such as a low Dexterity modifier of +0, making it somewhat less agile, and it does not possess any magical abilities or spells, which could limit its versatility in certain situations.

The gorgon has the following attributes: 
- Strength: +5 (very good), providing a high level of physical power in melee combat.
- Dexterity: +0 (average), indicating a lack of finesse and agility in movements and actions.
- Constitution: +4 (good), granting it substantial resilience and hit points to endure more damage during encounters.
- Intelligence: -4 (bad), showing that the gorgon is not particularly smart or strategic.
- Wisdom: +2 (average), allowing for decent perception and insight but with little capability for insight.
- Charisma: -2 (bad), indicating that the gorgon lacks any significant charm or presence that could influence others.

The gorgon has several special abilities:
- Monstrosity Resilience: This ability gives the gorgon resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, enhancing its ability to stay in combat longer without significant drawbacks.
- Trampling Charge: If it moves at least 20 feet in a straight line toward an enemy and successfully lands a Gore attack, it can potentially knock the opponent prone, making it an effective tactic to gain an advantage in battle.

In terms of actions, the gorgon can execute the following:
- Multiattack: The gorgon makes one Gore attack and one Hooves attack, allowing it to deal significant damage in a single turn.
- Gore: This melee weapon attack has a +8 to hit and deals 18 piercing damage on a successful strike, making it a powerful option for dealing damage.
- Hooves: Likewise, this attack also has a +8 to hit and inflicts 16 bludgeoning damage, emphasizing its ability to deliver heavy blows to enemies.
- Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6): The gorgon can exhale a 30-foot cone of poisonous, petrifying gas. Creatures in this area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 21 poison damage and become restrained, beginning the petrification process. If successful, they take half damage and are not restrained. The restrained creature must save again at the end of its turn to avoid being petrified, which is a notable threat that can incapacitate opponents, with the only means of escape being the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

The gorgon also has a reaction called Poisonous Retort: When attacked by a creature it can see within 10 feet, it can release poisonous gas in retaliation. The attacker must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, or be poisoned until the end of their next turn, adding a layer of danger to engaging the gorgon in close proximity. 

Overall, the gorgon is a tough adversary that combines brute strength with a potentially devastating breath weapon, making it a memorable encounter for adventurers who face it.
