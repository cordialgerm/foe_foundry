The Psychopomp Angel is a celestial creature that embodies the concepts of guidance and protection in the realms of the afterlife. Standing as a guardian for souls transitioning between worlds, this medium-sized entity exhibits a lawful neutral alignment, prioritizing order and balance above all. With a strong focus on radiant damage, it is capable of both offense and defense, able to resist various forms of harm due to its damage resistances and condition immunities. The Psychopomp Angel excels in scenarios requiring the support of allies or the disruption of enemies’ plans, especially through its powerful abilities to manipulate Will saving throw effects, granting it both strategic and tactical advantages in combat. However, its reliance on certain spells and abilities makes it vulnerable to effects that can bypass its defenses or disrupt its actions.

The Psychopomp Angel has an Armor Class of 14, which is considered average, allowing it some protection against attacks. It possesses 68 hit points, calculated from rolling eight eight-sided dice and adding 32, providing it with good overall durability. The creature's speed is quite versatile, with a walking speed of 40 feet and a flying speed of 60 feet, making it exceptional in mobility on the battlefield. It has a Challenge Rating of 4, indicating that it can be a suitable challenge for a party of adventurers.

In terms of attributes, the Psychopomp Angel displays the following scores: 17 in Strength (+3 modifier, considered good), 14 in Dexterity (+2 modifier, average), 18 in Constitution (+4 modifier, very good), 14 in Intelligence (+2 modifier, average), 16 in Wisdom (+3 modifier, good), and 18 in Charisma (+4 modifier, very good). Its saving throws are as follows: Con +6, Wis +5, and Cha +6, all of which reflect a very good capability to resist effects targeting those attributes. The skills it possesses, particularly perception at +3, allow for average detection abilities. 

Its damage resistances include necrotic and radiant damage, as well as resistance against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attacks, making it notably hard to harm with physical attacks. It is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, or poisoned, showcasing a strong resilience to psychological effects. The Psychopomp Angel has darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in the dark clearly and a passive perception score of 15 for detecting hidden foes. It communicates in all languages and can use telepathy to reach out to others within 60 feet.

Among its special abilities, the Psychopomp Angel can utilize "Death’s Accomplice," allowing it to deal necrotic damage instead of radiant when it prefers, making it flexible in its offensive options. The "Fiendish Countenance" ability enables it to blend into environments where fiends are common, avoiding immediate detection until it chooses to reveal its true celestial nature. Its "Immortal Nature" signifies its independence from the need for food, drink, or sleep, allowing for constant activity. Through "Magic Resistance," it gains advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, suggesting an exceptional capability to resist magical attacks.

In combat, the Psychopomp Angel can take advantage of its multiattack feature, allowing it to make two attacks with its Lantern Flail, which has a +5 to hit and inflicts 8 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 4 radiant damage. If it strikes a fiend or undead, it deals an extra 10 radiant damage. The "Divine Dictum" ability, usable after a recharge of 5 to 6, deals 22 radiant damage (with a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw for half damage) to creatures within a 30-foot radius and gives a chance for charmed, frightened, or possessed creatures to recover from those conditions within 60 feet. The "Unmake Contract," usable once per day, projects the power of its patron deity to free a creature of all liens on its soul, showcasing its capacity for powerful support.

As a bonus action, the Psychopomp Angel can use "Spirit Usher" three times per day, bestowing divine protection on a creature for one hour. While warded, the chosen entity gains 11 temporary hit points and protection from Celestials, Fiends, and Undead attackers, who have disadvantage against the warded creature. Furthermore, if the warded creature dies, it cannot be raised as an Undead for one year, adding a layer of strategic protection for allies in battle.
