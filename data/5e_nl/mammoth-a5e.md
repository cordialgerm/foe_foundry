The Mammoth is a massive creature representing a powerful and persistent force on the battlefield. As a Huge Beast with significant hit points and a formidable challenge rating, it excels in melee combat, capable of dealing heavy damage through its physical attacks. With a strong Strength score of 24, it has exceptional modifiers for its attack rolls and damage, making it a reliable frontline fighter. However, its low Dexterity score indicates that it may struggle with agility and evasive maneuvers. Despite its strengths in raw power, the Mammoth's limited intelligence and charisma scores suggest that it may not be particularly adept in social interactions or complex strategies.

The Mammoth has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average; this means it can be hit relatively easily by attackers. It possesses 115 hit points, calculated as 10d12 plus 50, allowing it to endure considerable punishment before falling in battle. The Mammoth's walk speed is 40 feet, enabling it to traverse the battlefield effectively and engage enemies quickly.

In combat, the Mammoth has two primary melee attack options: Gore and Stomp. The Gore attack is a melee weapon attack that allows the Mammoth to hit with a +10 bonus, reaching out to 10 feet to target a foe. This attack deals 23 piercing damage, derived from rolling 3d10 and adding 7, and has an additional effect—if the Mammoth moves at least 20 feet towards the target before the attack, the target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. Failure results in the target falling prone, which can significantly disadvantage them in the ensuing combat. The Stomp attack operates similarly, with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, resulting in the same damage output of 23 bludgeoning damage.

The Mammoth can also utilize its bonus actions to increase its combat effectiveness. The Trample ability allows it to make a Stomp attack against any creature that is already prone, adding to its offensive capability against immobilized foes. Additionally, the Trunk Fling is another melee attack with a +8 bonus that allows the Mammoth to strike at a target within 5 feet. This attack deals 10 bludgeoning damage, derived from a 1d6 roll plus 7, and has the unique effect of pushing a Large or smaller creature 10 feet away from the Mammoth, knocking them prone, which can further control the battlefield dynamics.

Overall, the Mammoth’s combination of high damage output and ability to control opponents makes it a fearsome opponent in any encounter, particularly in environments that allow it to leverage its massive size and strength effectively.
