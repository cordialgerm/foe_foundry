The Soldier Squad is a large humanoid creature that functions as a collective of soldiers working together as a cohesive unit. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers due to its durability and combat capabilities. The squad's armor class is 16, and it has a total of 97 hit points, which are calculated using 15d8 plus an additional 30 hit points. In terms of physical attributes, the squad's Strength and Constitution are above average, providing it with a good capacity to withstand damage and engage effectively in melee combat. However, its Dexterity is only average, making its agility less than optimal. The squad demonstrates notable weaknesses, particularly in its vulnerability to area effects, which deal double damage to it. Overall, it operates effectively as a frontline unit, but its special abilities and tactical movement options allow it to adapt and survive against overwhelming odds.

The Soldier Squad has the following attributes: Strength of 14, which grants a +2 modifier that is classified as good for melee attacks; Dexterity of 12 with a +1 modifier, deemed average for agility; a Constitution score of 14, reflecting a good ability to endure damage with a +2 modifier. It possesses an Intelligence of 10, yielding an average modifier of +0, suggesting a lack of strategic cunning. Wisdom and Charisma values are both also 10, leading to average modifiers that do not significantly impact perception or social interactions.

It has proficiency in perception and survival skills, both providing a +3 bonus. The squad has a passive perception score of 13, allowing it to be aware of its surroundings effectively. The squad can communicate using one language of the player's choice.

In terms of special abilities, the Soldier Squad has an "Area Vulnerability" characteristic, which means that any area-of-effect damage it receives is doubled. This can be an exploitable weakness for characters who can cast area spells or use explosive abilities. The "Squad Dispersal" ability is notable in that when the squad is brought to 0 hit points, it splits into 2 additional soldiers, each starting with 9 hit points. This creates a challenging scenario for opponents as they must defeat multiple targets quickly. The "Squad" trait indicates that it can endure damage from single-target spells or attacks but ignores other effects, which can be strategic when facing spells designed to debuff or control.

For its actions, the Soldier Squad can perform melee or ranged attacks with spears, which rely on a +4 to hit modifier, considered good for accuracy due to its Strength and proficiency bonus. The reach for the melee attack is 5 feet, while the ranged capability allows striking targets from 20 feet up to 60 feet away. When the squad successfully hits a target, it inflicts a substantial 31 piercing damage, calculated using 6d6 plus an additional 10. If the squad has been reduced to bloodied status, meaning it has less than half of its hit points, it deals only half damage on a hit, showcasing a tactical adjustment for wounded soldiers.

As a bonus action, the Soldier Squad can execute "Tactical Movement," which decreases its movement speed by half until the end of its turn. While using this ability, any movement made does not provoke opportunity attacks, allowing for safer repositioning during combat without the risk of extra damage from foes.
