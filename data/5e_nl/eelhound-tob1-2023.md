The Eel Hound is a medium-sized fey creature that embodies the characteristics of both land and aquatic life. With a neutral alignment, it can often be found in regions where water meets land, making it an adept hunter in both environments. The creature boasts a solid Armor Class of 14, enhanced by natural armor, and possesses 77 hit points, derived from a robust constitution. A Challenge Rating of 2 indicates that the Eel Hound is a formidable opponent for lower-level adventurers, rewarding a successful encounter with 450 experience points. It exhibits impressive physical attributes, particularly its Strength of 19, which gives it a good modifier of +4, and a Dexterity of 16, granting a modifier of +3, allowing it to be both powerful and agile in combat. Its key strengths include the ability to attack effectively with Pack Tactics, which gives it a great advantage when working alongside allies, and its versatile actions that can hinder opponents.

The Eel Hound has a Strength score of 19 (+4), which yields a good modifier for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score of 16 (+3) is similarly strong, enhancing its acrobatic abilities and improving its Stealth skill, where it has a good modifier of +5. With a Constitution score of 13 (+1), its hit points are bolstered, providing a decent level of durability. The Intelligence score of 6 (-2) represents a very bad capacity for intelligence-based tasks, while a Wisdom score of 13 (+1) offers an average perception, augmented by a Perception skill modifier of +3. Lastly, its Charisma score of 16 (+3) allows it to express itself in understanding Sylvan, though it cannot speak.

One of its key special abilities is Amphibious, enabling the Eel Hound to breathe both air and water, making it versatile and effective in aquatic environments. The Pack Tactics ability is particularly notable as it allows the Eel Hound to gain an advantage on attack rolls against enemies if at least one ally is within close proximity, significantly increasing its combat effectiveness.

The Eel Hound can perform a Bite attack, which utilizes a melee weapon attack roll with a bonus of +6, giving it a good chance to hit. On a successful attack, it deals 11 piercing damage (2d6 + 4) and grapples the target, imposing an escape DC of 14. While grappled, the target is restrained, and the Eel Hound is unable to Bite another creature until the grapple ends.

In addition, the Eel Hound can use its Slick Spittle ability to cover a 5-foot square area with a slippery substance. Any creature caught in this area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. This ability can significantly impact combat maneuvering, hindering enemy movement and creating advantageous conditions for the Eel Hound and its allies. The spittle remains for 1 minute, continually posing a hazard to movement through the area.

As a bonus action, the Eel Hound can perform Water Step, allowing it to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, provided there is enough water to partially submerge it at both the origin and destination. This unique ability enhances its mobility, enabling it to escape dangerous situations or reposition in combat effectively. Overall, the Eel Hound is a clever and adaptable creature that presents a mix of offensive and defensive challenges in any encounter.
