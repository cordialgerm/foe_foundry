The Ice Devil is a formidable large fiend known for its menacing combination of physical strength and magical capabilities. With an armor class of 18 and a whopping 180 hit points, it demonstrates considerable resilience in battle, making it a challenging adversary with a challenge rating of 12. This creature is particularly effective in combat due to its high strength and constitution scores, reflecting an exceptional physical presence as well as robust durability. It possesses resistance to nonmagical and non-silvered weaponry and is immune to cold, fire, and poison damage, enhancing its survivability in various encounters. Notably, its magic resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells, allowing it to withstand magical attacks more effectively. However, it could be vulnerable to keen strategic thinking from opponents who can exploit its limited weaknesses.

The Ice Devil has the following ability scores: Strength 20 (+5), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 18 (+4), Wisdom 16 (+3), and Charisma 18 (+4). This distribution of attributes gives the Ice Devil very good melee capabilities and solid spellcasting abilities. Its saving throws provide bonuses: Dexterity +6 (good), Constitution +8 (very good), Wisdom +7 (good), and Charisma +8 (very good). It is also very perceptive with a passive perception of 13. The creature can understand Infernal and communicate telepathically up to 120 feet.

The Ice Devil has several notable special abilities. Its "Devils Sight" allows it to see in magical darkness, making it exceptionally difficult to hinder its vision with spells or abilities that obscure sight. Its inherent magic resistance enhances its durability against magical effects. Being classified as Lawful Evil, it emits an aura that reflects its alignment, influencing interactions with other creatures.

In combat, the Ice Devil can utilize its "Multiattack" feature to strike twice, once with its bite and once with its claws. The bite attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 19 damage, comprised of 12 piercing damage and 7 cold damage. The claws attack also hits with a +9 to hit and inflicts 17 damage, consisting of 10 slashing damage and 7 cold damage. Additionally, it has a spear attack which inflicts an average of 24 piercing damage and 10 cold damage, and can potentially slow the target if they fail a Constitution saving throw.

One of its unique abilities is "Ice Wall," which can be used once per day. This ability allows the Ice Devil to create a large wall of ice that can restrict movement and provide cover. The wall has 30 hit points, an armor class of 12, and can be up to 50 feet long and 15 feet high. If a creature happens to be in the wall's space when it appears, they must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take significant cold damage.

As a bonus action, the Ice Devil can use its "Tail" attack, which deals a solid 11 bludgeoning damage plus 7 cold damage. 

Lastly, the Ice Devil has a reaction called "Freezing Blood," usable once per day. When a ranged attack hits it or a spell affects it, the attacker must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take cold damage and are slowed, limiting their effectiveness in subsequent turns.

Overall, the Ice Devil is a powerful and strategic creature, capable of both dealing and absorbing significant damage while also having control over its environment through its abilities.
