The Worg is a large monstrosity that serves as a cunning and predatory creature in the realms of Dungeons & Dragons. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it poses a moderate threat to low-level adventurers and is often found lurking in forests or mountainous areas. The Worg is characterized by its robust physical strength and agility, complemented by a keen sense of hearing and smell, making it an effective hunter. However, its relatively low intelligence and charisma may limit its social interactions and strategic planning. Its combat effectiveness is marked by strong attack capabilities, particularly through its bite, which can knock opponents prone. Though it possesses decent armor class and hit points, it can be taken down by more experienced players if they exploit its weaknesses.

The Worg has the following attributes: Strength at 14 (+2), Dexterity at 12 (+1), Constitution at 10 (+0), Intelligence at 6 (-2), Wisdom at 10 (+0), and Charisma at 8 (-1). The Strength score indicates a good level of physical prowess, making it a strong melee attacker. The Dexterity score reflects average agility, while the Constitution score is average, providing it with standard resilience. Intelligence is exceptionally low, and as such, the Worg would not be effective in tasks requiring logic or reasoning. Wisdom is average, allowing it to rely on its instinct but not much more. Its low Charisma indicates poor social capabilities.

In terms of skills, the Worg has a perception score of +2, which is good, allowing it to detect threats and hidden creatures effectively. It also possesses a stealth score of +3, marking it as a fairly stealthy hunter, capable of ambushing its prey. The Worg has darkvision that extends to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Additionally, it has a passive perception of 12 and can communicate in the Goblin language, as well as its own guttural Worg language.

One notable special ability of the Worg is its Keen Hearing and Smell, which grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on these senses. This makes the Worg highly effective at locating prey and avoiding ambushes itself.

In combat, the Worg can take the action of making a melee weapon attack with its Bite ability. This attack has a +4 to hit, demonstrating a good chance to successfully strike its target within a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it can deal 9 piercing damage, which is quite significant for a creature of its challenge rating. Moreover, if the bite attack hits a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or fall prone. This ability to knock opponents down can be strategically advantageous, as it may leave foes vulnerable to follow-up attacks or reduce their mobility in combat.
