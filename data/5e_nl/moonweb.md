The Moonweb is a daunting aberration that operates without alignment, marking its existence as a creature from the realms beyond normal understanding. With a challenge rating of 6, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, boasting a high armor class of 16 due to its natural armor, along with a total of 97 hit points. Its primary strengths include a powerful flying ability, advantageous stealth capabilities, and an array of damaging and debilitating attacks. However, its intelligence is notably low, which may hinder its strategic capabilities. The Moonweb has exceptional dexterity, enabling it to evade attacks effectively, and it is immune to numerous conditions, making it a resilient opponent in combat.

The Moonweb possesses a Strength score of 10, which is average, allowing it to deal some melee damage but not being particularly strong. Its Dexterity is rated at 18, which is very good and grants it a +4 modifier, enhancing its ability to dodge attacks, making it very effective in stealthy approaches. The Constitution score is 16, giving it a +3 modifier, which is good for maintaining its hit points and resisting effects that might weaken it. Intelligence is a minimal 1, signifying very bad cognitive abilities, thus it lacks the capacity for complex thought. Wisdom is a solid 16, providing a +3 modifier that supports its perception checks related to awareness of its surroundings, also rated as good. Finally, its Charisma score is very low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, indicating a lack of social prowess.

The Moonweb is equipped with several abilities that enhance its overall effectiveness. Its special ability, Alien Nature, allows it to operate without air or sleep, making it a unique opponent in prolonged encounters. The Transparent ability grants the Moonweb advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while it remains motionless or in dim light, enabling it to hide effectively from adventurers.

In terms of actions, the Moonweb can perform a Multiattack, executing one Dissolving Bite and one Tendrils attack in a single turn. The Dissolving Bite is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, made within 5 feet of its target. On a successful hit, it inflicts 13 (2d8+4) piercing damage and an additional 9 (2d8) acid damage, which also allows the Moonweb to regain hit points equal to the acid damage inflicted. This makes it a dangerous adversary, not only due to the damage it deals but also for its ability to heal.

The Tendrils attack also incorporates a +7 to hit and targets creatures up to 10 feet away. It deals 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage and can paralyze the target for 1 minute unless they succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The target can attempt to save at the end of each of its turns to end the paralysis, which adds a significant threat level to any melee encounter.

Additionally, the Moonweb can unleash an Etheric Pulse that recharges on a roll of 6. This ability sends out a burst of ethereal energy affecting each creature within a 30-foot radius. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become partially ethereal. While partially ethereal, a creature's attacks do normal damage to the Moonweb but deal only magical damage to other targets, providing them with resistance against nonmagical damage. Furthermore, the Moonweb gains advantage on attack rolls against those partially ethereal creatures, making this a potent area control ability.

As a bonus action, the Moonweb can use Ethereal Jaunt to shift between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, allowing it to strategically reposition itself during combat and evade attacks. This mobility makes it a challenging target, and its abilities keep adventurers on their toes. Overall, the Moonweb is a complex and formidable creature in combat, combining high mobility, effective attack patterns, and powerful disruption abilities that can turn the tide of any encounter.
