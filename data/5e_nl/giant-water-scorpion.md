The Giant Water Scorpion is a formidable Large beast that thrives in aquatic environments. It possesses a natural armor rating of 14, providing it with good defensive capabilities. With 93 hit points, it can withstand a moderate amount of damage in combat. The scorpion capitalizes on its environment, boasting a swimming speed of 30 feet and a walking speed of 20 feet, displaying good mobility both in water and on land. The challenge rating of 4 indicates that it is a threat to a party of moderate-level adventurers, capable of dealing significant damage through its unique abilities. Particularly notable are its poisonous attacks and stealthy nature, making it a dangerous ambush predator. However, its intelligence is very low, which affects its tactical abilities and interactions with foes.

The Giant Water Scorpion has the following ability scores: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 3 (-4). Its Strength is very good, allowing it to deal substantial physical damage and grapple enemies effectively. The Dexterity is average, which provides a slight boost to its agility, while its Constitution is good, contributing to its hit points. However, it has exceptionally low scores in Intelligence and Charisma, indicating that it is not capable of complex reasoning and has poor interaction skills.

The scorpion has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Its Hold Breath ability allows it to remain submerged for up to one hour, and it can use its tail as a breathing tube when near the surface, enabling it to maintain stealth while in water. The Poison Injection ability inflicts an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage when it successfully hits a creature that is grappled, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned, which can significantly turn the tide of battle against incapacitated foes. Underwater Camouflage gives the scorpion advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made underwater, reinforcing its role as a stealthy ambusher within its aquatic habitat.

In terms of actions, the Giant Water Scorpion can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two claw attacks. If it successfully grapples a creature, it can also use its proboscis attack once per turn against that creature. The Proboscis attack has a +5 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage. A key effect of this attack is that it can reduce the target’s Strength score by 1d4, and if this reduction brings the Strength score to 0, the target dies. If not, the reduction lasts until the victim completes a short or long rest. The Claws attack also has a +5 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled with an escape DC of 13, which can hinder opponents and create opportunities for the scorpion to deal more damage.
