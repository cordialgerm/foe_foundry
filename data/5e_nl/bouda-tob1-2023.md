The creature possesses damage immunities to fire and poison, providing it with significant protection against those types of attacks. It has damage resistances to acid and lightning, along with bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks unless made with silvered weapons, making its durability exceptional. Bouda is immune to being charmed, feeling exhaustion, and being poisoned, granting it resilience against various effects. Its darkvision extends up to 120 feet, giving it an edge in low-light conditions, with a passive perception score of 14. The Bouda can communicate in Common, Celestial, and Infernal, and also possesses telepathy within 100 feet.

The Bouda has two notable special abilities: 
- **Sense Consecrated:** This ability allows the Bouda to detect celestials, consecrated areas, or divine-wielding creatures within a 60-foot range by scent. 
- **Sense Magic:** At will, it can sense magic up to 30 feet away, functioning similarly to the detect magic spell without being magical itself.

In battle, the Bouda can perform multiple attacks through its **Multiattack** ability, allowing it to make one Bite and one Mephitic Claw attack in a single turn. 
- The **Bite** attack has a +7 attack bonus, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage. 
- The **Mephitic Claw** attack also has a +7 attack bonus and deals 11 slashing damage. Additionally, the target must pass a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer from poisoning until the end of its next turn.

One of its unique actions is **Ravenous Gorge**, where it can consume the organs of a corpse less than 7 days old within 5 feet, gaining temporary hit points equal to twice the creature’s challenge rating for one hour. Importantly, a Bouda cannot use this ability on a corpse that has already been consumed by it or another Bouda.

For its bonus actions:
- The **Change Shape** ability allows the Bouda to transform into a human, a hyena, or back to its hybrid form, retaining its statistics except for speed. In this state, it retains its equipment unless it reverts back to dust upon death.
- The **Defiling Smear** ability can be used once per day, allowing the Bouda to apply a viscous substance that forces nearby unwilling creatures to attempt a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid its effects. If they fail, creatures that start their turn within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute, with a lingering stench of the smear persisting for 7 days unless removed by magic. Success on the saving throw grants immunity to the smear effects for 24 hours.

Overall, the Bouda presents a multifaceted challenge with its physical prowess, cunning abilities, and insidious tactics, making it a formidable opponent in any campaign.
