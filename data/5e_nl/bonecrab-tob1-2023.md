The Bone Crab is a small, unaligned beast with a unique ability set that makes it an interesting encounter in any setting. With an Armor Class of 13, it possesses decent defense courtesy of its natural armor. It has 33 hit points, derived from rolling 6d6 and adding 12, which provides it with a moderate buffer against damage. This creature is characterized by its speed of 10 feet, limiting its mobility but allowing it to effectively utilize its abilities in the right environment. The Bone Crab has a Challenge Rating of 1/2, making it a suitable opponent for low-level adventurers, providing 100 experience points upon defeat.

The Bone Crab's attributes showcase a balanced distribution; it has a Strength score of 10, which is average, giving it a modifier of +0, making its physical damage output relatively low. Its Dexterity is 14, with a +2 modifier, marking it as a good value, allowing it to excel in agile maneuvers such as stealth and initiative rolls. The Constitution score of 14 translates to good resilience with a +2 modifier, boosting its hit points and overall survivability. The intelligence score is considerably low at 3 (-4), causing it to have very bad problem-solving abilities. Wisdom at 12 (+1) offers it an average perception of its environment, while its Charisma of 4 (-3) represents its poor ability to influence others.

In terms of special abilities, the Bone Crab has various traits. Being amphibious allows it to thrive both in water and on land. Its bone camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide among bones, enhancing its potential for ambush tactics. The bone crab's limited telepathy enables simple communication with others of its kind within 100 feet, allowing for coordinated attacks and surprise. With pack tactics, it gains an advantage on attack rolls when fighting alongside allies, making encounters with multiple Bone Crabs more challenging. The standing leap ability contributes to its agility, allowing it to jump long distances effectively. The white ghost shivers ability introduces a disease mechanic; creatures that consume it or are bitten may become infected, facing debilitating symptoms unless they can succeed on Constitution saving throws.

In terms of actions, its main attack is the claw, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and targets creatures within a 5-foot reach. When it successfully strikes, it deals 7 slashing damage, calculated from rolling 2d4 and adding 2. This weapon attack, complemented by its special abilities, positions the Bone Crab as a strategic threat in combat against unwary adventurers.
