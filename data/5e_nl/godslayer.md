The Godslayer is a formidable creature, categorized as a huge construct. Its high challenge rating of 30 highlights its significant power, making it an incredibly dangerous opponent for any adventuring party. With an Armor Class of 24, the Godslayer is highly resistant to attacks, and its extensive hit points of 580 ensure that it can withstand a great deal of damage. Notably, it has the unique ability to target and affect immortal beings like gods, making it a special adversary in campaigns involving celestial or divine elements. However, despite its strengths in combat, it has no intelligence or capability to communicate, posing a challenge in character interactions. 

The Godslayer possesses exceptional physical attributes, with a Strength score of 30, allowing it to make highly effective melee and ranged attacks. Its Dexterity of 14 is average and does not add much to its mobility, but with a Constitution of 27, it is good at enduring physical hardships. The Wisdom score of 30 is exceptionally high, granting it an outstanding ability to resist various effects and sense the presence of others. With Intelligence and Charisma scores of 16 and 15, respectively, it is capable of understanding but not expressing complex thoughts or emotions.

When it comes to saving throws, the Godslayer shows exceptional capabilities with Constitution (+17), Wisdom (+19), and Intelligence (+12), indicating it will resist man effects very well. Its immunity to a wide range of conditions, including being charmed, frightened, or poisoned, makes it exceptionally resilient to control effects in combat. The creature has truesight for 120 feet, enabling it to see through illusions and darkness, complemented by a passive perception of 29, which is very good for detecting hidden threats.

The Godslayer's special abilities further enhance its combat effectiveness. As a construct, it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, which allows it to function continuously without any need for rest. It can utilize Divine Sense to locate divine beings within 120 feet, giving it a tactical advantage against opponents. Its Divine Slayer ability allows its attacks to ignore resistances of celestials and deities, and it can prevent their resurrection if it reduces them to zero hit points. Additionally, it has the Immutable Form trait, rendering it immune to transformation and mind-reading attempts, as well as responses to its emotions.

Combat capabilities are bolstered by its Magic Resistance, giving it an advantage on saving throws against magical effects, and its Siege Monster ability allows it to deal double damage against objects and structures. The Arcane Lexicon ability enables it to cast debilitating effects on enemies, marking them with various glyphs that can incapacitate, cause pain, or even teleport them. The effects of these glyphs have high DCs, making it challenging for foes to resist them.

In terms of attack actions, the Godslayer can make a multiattack utilizing the Arcane Lexicon ability followed by three Energy Glaive or Rune Discus attacks. The Energy Glaive is a melee weapon attack with a +19 to hit and deals significant damage, while the Rune Discus serves as a ranged attack with similar accuracy and damage mechanics, also having additional suppression effects against magic spells.

As a bonus action, the Godslayer can perform a Hunting Step, allowing it to teleport in proximity to celestial targets it senses. This grants it advantage on its next attack roll, emphasizing its tactical prowess in combat. For reactions, the Parry Spell ability can negate spells targeting only the Godslayer, and if it succeeds by a large margin, it can reflect spells back at their casters.

Finally, the Godslayer has legendary actions it can use, including marking targets with Arcane Word glyphs, making additional attacks, moving strategically without provoking attacks, or healing itself through Rejuvenating Repair, which restores a considerable amount of hit points. Overall, the Godslayer is not only powerful but also strategically versatile, posing a significant threat to any adventurers who dare to face it.
