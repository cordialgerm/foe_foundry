The Goblin Captain is a small humanoid creature that serves as a leader among goblins in combat scenarios. It has a relatively high Armor Class of 17, thanks to its chain shirt and shield, making it difficult for most attacks to penetrate its defenses. With 32 hit points, the Goblin Captain is moderately resilient, allowing it to withstand some damage in battle. As a Challenge Rating 1 creature, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, but it excels mainly through its ability to coordinate attacks with its fellow goblins. The Goblin Captain’s strengths lie in its decent Dexterity modifier of +4, allowing it to be nimble and evade attacks. However, its Strength and Constitution are average, which affects its melee prowess and overall durability negatively, making it not particularly strong or robust.

In terms of attributes, the Goblin Captain has the following statistics: Strength is +0 (average), Dexterity is +4 (very good), Constitution is +0 (average), Intelligence is +1 (average), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is +0 (average). Its Dexterity makes it particularly skilled at Stealth, where it has a total modifier of +6, enabling it to remain undetected easily. The Goblin Captain also possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and can understand and speak Common and Goblin.

The primary combat actions of the Goblin Captain include its Multiattack ability, which allows it to make two attacks using either its Scimitar or Shortbow. If both attacks connect with a single target, it can unleash an additional attack, mimicking a flurry of strikes. The Scimitar attack has a +4 to hit and deals 5 slashing damage on a successful hit, while the Shortbow attack also has a +4 to hit, dealing 5 piercing damage at a range of 80 to 320 feet. 

The Goblin Captain also has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. One such ability is "Get That One!", a bonus action that allows it to point out an enemy, enabling a nearby goblin ally to use its reaction to move and make a melee attack against that specified target. Additionally, “Nimble Escape” provides the Goblin Captain with the option to take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action, allowing for tactical repositioning.

For defensive strategies, the Goblin Captain can use its reaction ability, "Protect Me!" When targeted by an attack, it can quickly move behind an adjacent ally within 5 feet, making the ally the new target of the attack instead. This ability demonstrates the Goblin Captain's role as a tactical leader, prioritizing its own survival while still being in the thick of combat. Overall, the Goblin Captain is an agile and cunning adversary, especially when supported by its goblin comrades, making them a potent threat in battles against unprepared adventurers.
