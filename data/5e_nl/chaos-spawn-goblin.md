The Chaos-Spawn Goblin is a small, humanoid creature that embodies the chaotic essence of evil. This goblin's cunning and agility make it a formidable foe, especially given its ability to sneak and evade attacks. With an average armor class of 13, it possesses a decent hit point pool of 22, providing it with some resilience in combat. Its strengths lie in its dexterity and skills in stealth, allowing it to execute ambushes effectively and avoid detection. However, its combat abilities are comparatively limited due to low strength and intelligence, making it less effective in direct confrontations. This creature can be quite annoying for adventurers, as its ability to disengage and hide offers it opportunities to escape or reposition during battle.

In terms of attributes, the Chaos-Spawn Goblin has the following values: Strength is 10 with a modifier of 0 (average), Dexterity is 14 with a modifier of +2 (good), Constitution is 12 with a modifier of +1 (average), Intelligence is 10 with a modifier of 0 (average), Wisdom is 10 with a modifier of 0 (average), and Charisma is 6 with a modifier of -2 (very bad). Its skills include stealth with a modifier of +6, making it particularly adept at sneaking around undetected. The goblin has damage resistance to psychic damage, allowing it to mitigate some forms of harm, and is immune to the frightened condition, granting it a degree of stability in the face of fear effects. It can perceive in darkness with darkvision up to 60 feet and communicates telepathically within 120 feet.

One of its notable special abilities is Nimble Escape, which allows the chaos-spawn goblin to take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns. This ability enhances its mobility, enabling it to evade attacks and avoid retaliation while also setting up ambushes.

In combat, the goblin can utilize a Multiattack action to make two attacks with its scimitar, which has a +4 modifier to hit and deals 5 slashing damage on a hit (1d6 + 2). This attack is effective against unarmored or lightly armored foes, though its damage output is relatively low.

The goblin also possesses a unique action called Psychic Stab, which has a recharge mechanic. It can target one creature within 30 feet and forces it to make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7 psychic damage (2d6), and on a successful save, it takes half damage. This ability allows the goblin to deal significant damage from a distance, emphasizing its chaotic nature and providing a tactical advantage in skirmishes. Overall, the Chaos-Spawn Goblin is a sly and dangerous adversary that relies on its agility and psychic powers to outmaneuver foes.
