The Drop Bear is a formidable large beast, designed to ambush unsuspecting adventurers from above. With a robust set of physical attributes, including a high Strength score of 20, this creature is adept at dealing significant damage in melee combat, particularly with its bite and claws. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it offers a moderate challenge, presenting an opportunity for tactical play in forested environments where it can utilize its climbing speed and stealth advantages. Notably, its unique ability to fall from heights without suffering damage allows it to engage from above, delivering added impact to its attacks. While its Intelligence and Charisma are poor, the creature excels in physical confrontations, making it especially dangerous in its preferred habitats.

The Drop Bear has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average, making it somewhat vulnerable to attacks. It possesses 42 hit points, resulting in a solid endurance for sustained encounters. The creature's movement speed is 40 feet on the ground and 40 feet while climbing, allowing for enhanced mobility in wooded areas.

With regards to its attributes, the Drop Bear has the following stats: Strength at 20 (+5, very good), Dexterity at 10 (+0, average), Constitution at 16 (+3, good), Intelligence at 2 (-4, very bad), Wisdom at 12 (+1, average), and Charisma at 4 (-3, very bad). The high Strength score allows the Drop Bear to deal substantial damage, while its decent Constitution contributes to its overall durability.

The Drop Bear has proficiency in Perception, granting it a bonus of +3 to perception checks and a passive perception score of 13. This allows it to sense nearby creatures fairly well within its environment.

The creature has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in ambush situations. Keen Smell grants the Drop Bear advantage on Perception checks based on smell, which can help it locate hidden foes. Its Stealthy trait gives it advantage on stealth checks while in forested areas, allowing it to ambush targets effectively. The Drop ability allows the bear to fall up to 40 feet unharmed and, if it attacks after falling at least 20 feet, it deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage. This extra damage also knocks the target prone, potentially giving the Drop Bear a tactical advantage in combat.

In terms of actions, the Drop Bear can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two melee attacks in one turn. Its Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 9 (1d8+5) piercing damage. The Claws attack also uses a +7 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 7 (1d4+5) slashing damage. Additionally, if a target is Medium-sized or smaller, it can be grappled with a successful hit (escape DC 15), meaning the Drop Bear can maintain control over the situation and focus its ferocity on a single foe until the grapple is broken.
