The Dire Wolf is a formidable large beast that serves as a terrifying predator within its environment. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who underestimate its capabilities. The Dire Wolf has a good armor class of 14 thanks to its natural armor, and it possesses 40 hit points, making it relatively durable in combat. Its speed is exceptional at 50 feet, allowing it to quickly close the distance to its enemies. The wolf's strengths lie in its pack tactics that allow it to gain advantage on attack rolls when its allies are nearby, and its heightened senses make it a skilled hunter. However, it has weaknesses such as low intelligence and charisma scores, reflecting its limited problem-solving abilities and social interactions. 

The Dire Wolf has a strength score of +3, which is categorized as good, meaning it can inflict considerable damage in melee combat. Its dexterity is rated at +2, which is average, providing decent agility. With a constitution score of +2 (average), it can endure some punishment but isn't overly resilient. Intelligence is marked at -4, which is very bad, reflecting the beast's basic instincts over complex thought. It has a wisdom score of +1 (average), granting it reasonable perception, while its charisma score of -2 (bad) highlights its lack of social skills.

The Dire Wolf has a perception score of 13, but its heightened hearing and smell ability enhances its perceptual capabilities, allowing it to reach an effective perception score of 18 when utilizing these senses for detecting creatures. It possesses a stealth score of 14, permitting it to approach prey quietly. This creature does not have any spoken language but navigates its surroundings using instincts and sensory skills.

One of its key abilities is Pack Tactics, which grants the wolf an advantage on attack rolls against any creature that is within 5 feet of an ally that isnâ€™t incapacitated. This crucial ability encourages strategic positioning in combat, often allowing the Dire Wolf to land devastating attacks.

The primary action the Dire Wolf can perform is the Bite. This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, meaning it is good at landing hits against its targets. The reach of the bite is 5 feet, and when it successfully bites a creature, it deals 12 piercing damage, calculated as 2d8 plus 3. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, potentially setting it up for follow-up attacks.

For a bonus action, the Dire Wolf can use Hungry Growl. By staring down a creature within 30 feet, the wolf forces the target to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, it becomes frightened until the end of its next turn, which can severely hinder the target's ability to act. Furthermore, this ability gives the wolf advantage on its next attack against the frightened creature, enabling a powerful combination of tactics in combat scenarios.
