The Tuberkith is a small plant creature that possesses unique abilities making it adept at navigating and surviving in its environment. Its challenge rating of 1/4 designates it as a relatively low-power creature, suited for role-playing encounters or as a minor combatant. The Tuberkith has a decent armor class of 13 due to its natural armor, while its hit points of 22, generated from rolling 4d6 and adding 8, grant it an average degree of durability. This creature moves swiftly on land with a speed of 30 feet and can burrow at 20 feet, making it adept for both escape and ambush tactics. 

The Tuberkith has the following attributes: Strength at 8, which is very bad for physical attacks, Dexterity at 14, which is good for avoiding attacks and acting quickly, Constitution at 15, relating to endurance, which is also good for resisting damage, Intelligence at 10, which is average for a creature of its nature, Wisdom at 12, indicating an average perception, and Charisma at 9, which is very bad for social interactions. Its only skill, perception, has a modifier of +1, suggesting an average proficiency in noticing details in its surroundings. The Tuberkith has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. It also understands Common and Sylvan languages. 

The Tuberkith has special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. With its Deep Roots ability, it gains advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws against effects that seek to move it against its will. This makes it particularly tough to displace during combat, providing a good strategic advantage. Its Dozens of Eyes ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on saving throws against being blinded. Additionally, when not blinded, the Tuberkith prevents attacking creatures from benefiting from teamwork strategies, like Pack Tactics or Sneak Attack, enhancing its defensive capabilities in skirmishes.

In terms of actions, the Tuberkith has two melee weapon attacks. The Peeler attack has a +4 to hit and delivers 5 slashing damage with a roll of 1d6+2. The Masher attack also has a +4 to hit and inflicts 6 bludgeoning damage on a target, rolling 1d8+2. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can be strategically devastating as it allows the Tuberkith to gain a significant advantage over its prone opponent in combat.
