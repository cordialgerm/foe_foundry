The Animated Instrument is a tiny construct that serves the unique role of a support character in combat. This creature has an unaligned nature, providing versatility without alignment constraints. With an Armor Class of 12 and 17 hit points, it is not particularly durable but possesses certain resistances and immunities that make it difficult for most attacks to be effective. Its primary strength lies in its ability to influence creature behavior through music, making it a tactical companion on the battlefield. However, it has major drawbacks, such as its low strength and intelligence, rendering it ineffective in direct confrontation and strategy. Notably, its effectiveness is hampered in the presence of antimagic fields, making it vulnerable to spells that could nullify its powers.

The Animated Instrument has the following attributes: Strength of 1 (-5 modifier, very bad), Dexterity of 12 (+1 modifier, average), Constitution of 11 (+0 modifier, average), Intelligence of 1 (-5 modifier, very bad), Wisdom of 5 (-3 modifier, bad), and Charisma of 15 (+2 modifier, good). It is skilled in perception with a +3 modifier, which is considered good. This creature is immune to poison and psychic damage and has condition immunities to being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. It possesses blindsight within 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures without relying on sight, though it is blind beyond that range. The Animated Instrument does not speak any languages, as it operates primarily through musical abilities.

The special abilities of the Animated Instrument enhance its unique function in gameplay. Its Antimagic Susceptibility means it becomes incapacitated in an antimagic field. Additionally, if it is targeted by dispel magic, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or fall unconscious for one minute. It benefits from Construct Nature, meaning it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously. Its False Appearance ability allows it to appear as a normal musical instrument when it is motionless and not flying.

In terms of actions, the Animated Instrument can perform several attacks. The Trouble Clef enables it to make a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and inflict 4 (1d4+1) bludgeoning damage to a target within 5 feet. The Orchestra Hit allows it to make a ranged spell attack with a +4 to hit over a distance of 60 feet, dealing 5 (1d6+2) thunder damage. Its most compelling ability, Spirited Solo, charges a tune that captivates listeners. Creatures within a 30-foot range that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated until the end of their next turn; those who succeed may benefit from an epiphany, granting them advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks for one day. 

Finally, the Courageous Anthem can be played once per day, granting a +1 bonus to attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for each friendly creature within 30 feet that can hear the song. The Animated Instrument must use a bonus action on subsequent turns to continue the performance, which can be ended at any time; however, the song terminates if the instrument becomes incapacitated. A creature can only benefit from one Courageous Anthem at a time, which emphasizes the strategic coordination that can be achieved when employing this animated entity in gameplay.
