The Breathstealer is a Medium-sized humanoid creature of any non-good alignment, known for its cunning and psychic abilities. With an armor class of 15, it is relatively well-protected, and its substantial hit points total of 99 makes it durable in combat. The Breathstealer possesses a high Dexterity score of 18, granting it a good modifier of +4, which enhances its agility and evasiveness. It can deliver powerful psychic damage, making it a notable threat, especially with its ability to manipulate opponents' perceptions of suffocation. While it has average physical attributes like Strength and Constitution, its primary strength lies in its psychic abilities and high Dexterity. However, it lacks exceptional mental capabilities, as seen in its average Intelligence. 

The Breathstealer has a challenge rating of 7, which indicates that it can be a formidable opponent for a party of adventurers, providing an experience worth 2,900 XP upon defeat. It can speak any two languages, facilitating potential interactions.

The saving throws for this creature are Dexterity +7 and Intelligence +3, which are considered good, allowing it to avoid many physical attacks and resist some mental effects. Its skills include a perception score of +1 leading to an average passive perception of 13, meaning it can detect enemies in its vicinity but is not exceptionally perceptive.

The Breathstealer's primary special ability is its Phrenic Weapons, which designates its weapon attacks as magical, allowing it to deal an additional 3d6 psychic damage whenever it strikes. This ability emphasizes its focus on psychic manipulation in combat.

In terms of actions, the Breathstealer can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to either strike with two shortsword attacks and one dagger attack or unleash three psychic blasts on targets. While using melee weapons, it executes shortsword attacks with a +7 to hit, inflicting 7 slashing damage in addition to 10 psychic damage. When utilizing a dagger, it similarly has a +7 to hit, causing either 6 piercing damage plus 10 psychic damage whether used in melee or at range. Its Psychic Blast delivers a ranged spell attack with +5 to hit, dealing 16 psychic damage at a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, if a target is already affected by the Breathstealerâ€™s Gasp to Survive, it can opt to deal only 1 psychic damage instead.

The Gasp to Survive ability, which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6, is particularly potent. It targets a creature that the Breathstealer has previously dealt psychic damage to within the last minute. This ability inflicts 14 psychic damage while creating the illusion of suffocation, causing the victim to feel unable to breathe or speak. The creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to reduce the damage and potentially realize that it is not actually suffocating. The targeted creature must also make this saving throw at the beginning of its turns, facing disadvantage if it has taken psychic damage since the start of its prior turn. Failure to succeed on three saves leads to the creature becoming unconscious for an hour, while success on three allows the effect to end.

Lastly, as a bonus action, the Breathstealer can execute a Cunning Action, granting it strategic options to Dash, Disengage, or Hide. This level of agility allows it to maneuver effectively in combat, further enhancing its ability to control engagements with its abilities and attacks.
