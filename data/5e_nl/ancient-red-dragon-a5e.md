The Ancient Red Dragon is a gargantuan creature known for its immense power and ferocity. This apex predator dominates its surroundings, exhibiting both physical and magical prowess that makes it a formidable opponent. With a Challenge Rating of 26, it presents an exceptional challenge to even the most experienced adventurers, boasting high offensive and defensive capabilities. The dragon has an extraordinary Armor Class of 22, making it very hard to hit, paired with a massive pool of 448 hit points, which allows it to soak up substantial damage. Its strengths lie in its overwhelming damage potential, particularly through its powerful bite, claws, and fire breath attacks. One notable ability, Legendary Resistance, grants it the opportunity to succeed on saving throws an impressive three times per day, enhancing its survivability. However, the Ancient Red Dragon possesses weaknesses, such as vulnerabilities to spells that target its lesser ability scores, notably its below-average Dexterity. Its innate magical abilities and fear-inducing presence make it not only a deadly combatant but also a strategic contender.

The Ancient Red Dragon has the following attributes:
- Strength: 30 (+10) which provides an exceptional modifier for physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0) resulting in a very bad modifier, indicating that it is not agile and can be outmaneuvered.
- Constitution: 28 (+9) offering an exceptional modifier for endurance and health.
- Intelligence: 18 (+4) giving it a good modifier that reflects its cunning.
- Wisdom: 16 (+3) indicating a good connection to perception and insight.
- Charisma: 22 (+6), which provides a very good modifier, aiding in its spellcasting and intimidation.

The dragon's saving throw modifiers are: Dexterity +8 (bad), Constitution +17 (very good), Wisdom +11 (good), and Charisma +14 (very good). It also possesses skills like intimidation +14 (very good), perception +11 (good), and stealth +8 (average). Notably, it is immune to fire damage, showcasing its resilience against fire-based attacks, and has blindsight out to 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive Perception score of 24.

In terms of special abilities:
- Legendary Resistance (3/Day) allows the dragon to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, shedding scales that turn to charcoal in the process. After expending all uses, its Armor Class drops to 20 until it completes a long rest.
- Searing Heat inflicts 14 (4d6) fire damage to any creature that touches the dragon or attacks it in melee for the first time on a turn.
- Volcanic Tyrant provides immunity to poisonous gases from volcanic sources and negates any difficult terrain caused by lava.
- Innate Spellcasting, with a DC of 22, allows it to cast spells without needing material components, with notable spells including command, hold person, glyph of warding, and wall of fire available three times a day, while antimagic field and dominate monster can be used once per day.

The dragon's actions are as follows:
- Multiattack enables it to bite once and claw twice per turn, or take an alternative action by Spitting Fire instead of biting.
- The Bite attack has +18 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, deals 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage, and adds 9 (2d8) fire damage on a hit.
- Claws have +18 to hit, reach of 10 feet, and do 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.
- The Tail attack has +18 to hit, a reach of 20 feet, delivering 23 (3d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage and pushing the target 10 feet away.
- Cruel Tyranny allows it to intimidate a single creature it can see to make an immediate weapon attack with advantage. If bloodied, it can target three minions instead.
- Spit Fire targets one creature within 60 feet, forcing a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw for 22 (4d10) fire damage, halved on success. Failure also incurs an additional 11 (2d10) ongoing fire damage, which can be ended by the target using an action.
- Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6) unleashes a devastating blast in a 90-foot cone, forcing a DC 25 Dexterity save. Failures take 98 (28d6) fire damage and ongoing fire damage as well as being frightened until the ongoing effect ends, which can be mitigated by using an action.

The Ancient Red Dragon also has potent reactions:
- Tail Attack allows it to retaliate with a tail swipe whenever it is hit by a melee attack from a creature within 10 feet.
- Taskmaster lets it boost the odds for a creature failing an ability check or saving throw within 60 feet, potentially turning a failure into a success by adding a roll of a d10.

Lastly, the dragon has legendary actions that can be utilized at the end of another creature's turn. It can take the following actions:
- Use Cruel Tyranny as previously described.
- Roar creates fear in every creature of its choice within 120 feet, who must make a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute, with chances to save at the end of each turn.
- Wing Attack pushes and knocks prone creatures within 15 feet after making a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, potentially allowing the dragon to reposition itself by flying up to half of its distance.
