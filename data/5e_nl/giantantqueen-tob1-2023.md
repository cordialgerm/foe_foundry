The Giant Ant Queen is a large beast that plays a crucial role in its ecosystem, representing the apex of ant colonies. With an Armor Class of 15, it boasts decent protection from physical attacks due to its natural armor. Its formidable Hit Points of 119 allow it to endure substantial damage in combat, making it a resilient opponent. The queen has a movement speed of 40 feet, enabling her to maneuver effectively during encounters. As a Challenge Rating 5 creature, facing the Giant Ant Queen presents a moderate challenge, yielding 1,800 experience points upon defeat. 

In terms of attributes, the Giant Ant Queen has a Strength score of 17, which gives her a good modifier of +3, making her physically powerful. Her Dexterity is average at 13 (+1), which allows for decent agility but may not make her particularly evasive. With a Constitution score of 16 (+3), she has very good resilience, further contributing to her high hit points. The queen has very low Intelligence at 2 (-4), indicating her lack of cognitive abilities, and her Wisdom and Charisma scores are 11 (+0) and 4 (-3) respectively, suggesting average perception but poor social interaction skills. The queen possesses blindsight out to 60 feet, allowing her to detect creatures without needing sight, and has a passive Perception score of 10.

The Giant Ant Queen has two notable special abilities. "Keen Smell" grants her advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on her sense of smell, enhancing her hunting capabilities. "Queen’s Scent" allows giant ants within 30 feet of the queen to have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that attacked the queen within the last minute, thereby bolstering her minions' effectiveness in battle.

In combat, the Giant Ant Queen can execute a "Multiattack," allowing her to make two Bite attacks and one Sting attack in a single turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet and dealing an average of 7 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, if the Bite attack hits, the target is grappled, which requires an escape DC of 13 to break free. While the target is grappled, it is restrained, preventing movement and limiting its options in combat, and the queen cannot Bite a different target until the grapple ends.

The Sting is another powerful melee weapon attack with the same +6 hit bonus and 5-foot reach. It also deals 7 piercing damage on a hit, but more critically, it forces the target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in significant poison damage, averaging 22 (4d10), while a successful save halves that damage, making it a potentially devastating attack if the target fails to resist the poison.
