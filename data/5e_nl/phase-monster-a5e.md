The Phase Monster is a large monstrosity that combines formidable physical abilities with a range of magical traits, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers. It has an Armor Class of 13, which is generally considered average for creatures of its challenge rating, and it boasts 85 hit points, giving it considerable durability in combat. The monsterâ€™s speed allows it to walk at 30 feet and fly at 50 feet, enabling versatile movement options. It has a Challenge Rating of 4, indicating it poses a moderate threat, granting those who defeat it 1,100 experience points. The Phase Monster excels in agility and resilience, bolstered by a very good Strength score of 18 and good Constitution score of 16, while displaying average Dexterity. However, it suffers from exceptionally low Intelligence and Charisma, limiting its mental capabilities and social interactions.

The attributes of the Phase Monster are as follows: 
- Strength is 18 (+4 modifier), indicating exceptional physical power, making melee attacks more effective.
- Dexterity is 14 (+2 modifier), providing an average boost to agility and some defensive capabilities.
- Constitution is 16 (+3 modifier), contributing to its exceptional endurance in combat.
- Intelligence is 4 (-3 modifier), reflecting very bad mental acuity, making it incapable of complex thought.
- Wisdom is 14 (+2 modifier), which is an average perception and insight score.
- Charisma is 8 (-1 modifier), leading to an overall bad presence in social situations.

The saving throw bonuses are: Dexterity +4, making it relatively agile but with no other noteworthy defensive saves. The creature has a skill bonus of +4 in both Perception and Stealth, enhancing its abilities to notice hidden threats and avoid detection. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, along with a passive Perception score of 14, which is good for detecting approaching enemies.

One of the key special abilities of the Phase Monster is Mirror Image. This ability cloaks the creature in a magical illusion that creates reflections of the monster, making attacks against it more difficult. While this ability is active, attackers have disadvantage on their rolls. However, being hit by an attack dispels this effect until the end of the creature's next turn.

In combat, the Phase Monster can utilize its Multiattack option, allowing it to strike with both its horns and claws consecutively. The Horns attack has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, which deals 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the monster moves at least 20 feet toward a target before using this attack, it can inflict an additional 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone. The Claw attack, usable only in its true form, also has a +6 to hit, deals 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage, and can deal an extra 5 (2d4) slashing damage if the target is already prone.

Additionally, the Phase Monster can unleash a Blood-Curdling Scream as a powerful action that can be used every 5 to 6 turns upon recharge. Each creature within a 60-foot radius that hears the scream must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. Affected creatures must use their turns to dash away from the monster unless they have no options available. If a frightened creature ends its turn without line of sight to the Phase Monster, they can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the frightened condition.

As a bonus action, the Phase Monster can shapeshift into the form of a small goat or revert to its true form. While in goat form, it loses its fly speed and the Mirror Image trait, but its physical statistics remain unchanged aside from its size and speed attributes, offering a tactical option to reduce its profile while maintaining its combat effectiveness.
