The Cackling Skeleton is a medium-sized undead creature defined by its chaotic and malevolent nature. It has a challenge rating of 1/2, reflecting its capabilities in battle. The skeleton possesses a low Armor Class of 9 and a moderate pool of hit points totaling 26, making it relatively easy to defeat in direct combat. However, its strengths lie in its ability to demoralize and disrupt the actions of its foes through its unsettling laughter and mocking abilities. The Cackling Skeleton is particularly effective against living opponents, utilizing its cackle to impose disadvantage on their attacks. Its weaknesses are its vulnerability to effects that turn undead and its lower Dexterity score, which impacts its ability to dodge incoming attacks.

The Cackling Skeleton has the following attributes: Strength 12 (with a modifier of +1, which is average), Dexterity 9 (with a modifier of -1, which is bad), Constitution 15 (with a modifier of +2, which is good), Intelligence 8 (with a modifier of -1, which is bad), Wisdom 10 (with a modifier of +0, which is average), and Charisma 14 (with a modifier of +2, which is good). The skeleton is immune to poison damage and conditions such as exhaustion and being poisoned, which enhances its durability under certain circumstances. It has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive perception score of 10, allowing it to see in the dark and notice things in its surroundings to a basic extent. Notably, it can understand the languages it knew in life, although it cannot speak.

The Cackling Skeleton has a couple of special abilities that set it apart in combat. The first is its Cackle ability, which creates a pervasive and unsettling sound. Any creature within 30 feet that can hear the skeleton must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the start of their turn; failure results in disadvantage on attack rolls until their next turn. This ability allows the skeleton to diminish the effectiveness of multiple attackers at once. The second ability, Turn Vulnerability, grants the skeleton disadvantage on saving throws against effects that can turn undead, making it particularly susceptible to clerics and other divine characters.

In terms of actions, the Cackling Skeleton can execute a Slam attack, making a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and dealing 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. If a target is currently demoralized due to the Cackle effect, the skeleton gains advantage on this attack roll, increasing its chances of hitting and dealing damage significantly. The skeleton can also use the Mock ability, which has a cooldown requiring a recharge of 5 to 6 to activate. This ability allows it to target up to three living creatures within 30 feet and call out derisive comments. Each target must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw; failure results in 5 (2d4) psychic damage, while a successful save grants them half damage. If the target has been previously demoralized, they have disadvantage on this saving throw, further enhancing the skeleton's method of weakening its opponents through psychological warfare.
