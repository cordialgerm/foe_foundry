A Lich is a powerful and cunning medium undead creature that serves as an exemplar of dark magic and eternal life. As an undead spellcaster, it boasts a fearsome combination of high Intelligence and a vast repertoire of spells, making it a formidable foe in combat. With an Armor Class of 18 and significant hit points totaling 170, the Lich is well-equipped to withstand damage but has specific vulnerabilities, such as damage from nonmagical weapons. It has exceptional magical capabilities, allowing it to manipulate the battlefield, hinder enemies, and resurrect fallen allies, making it a central figure in any encounter. The Lich's actions can freeze enemies, unleash devastating spells, and even protect itself with its auras. Although powerful, the Lich is reliant on maintaining its soul vessel for rejuvenation and must be approached with caution due to its various immunities and resistances.

The Lich has the following attributes: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 20 (+5), Wisdom 16 (+3), and Charisma 16 (+3). Its saving throws are impressive, with Constitution at +11, Intelligence at +12, and Wisdom at +10, indicating good resistance to spells and effects targeting these abilities. In terms of skills, it excels in arcana, history, and religion, each at +12, which gives it an exceptional understanding of magical lore and the undead. It has resistances to cold and lightning damage, immunity to necrotic and poison damage, and advantages against turning effects, making it a tough opponent for many classes.

Special abilities of the Lich enhance its survivability and offensive capabilities. Legendary Resistance allows it to reroll failed saving throws three times per day, ensuring it can avoid debilitating effects with good reliability. The Rejuvenation ability grants it the capacity to regain a body within days if it possesses a soul vessel, making it difficult to permanently defeat. With Tongueless Utterance, the Lich can cast spells without vocal components, allowing for stealthy spellcasting. Its undead nature means it does not require air, food, or sleep, further increasing its resilience in prolonged encounters.

As a 16th-level spellcaster, the Lich's spellcasting ability is tied to Intelligence, with a spell save DC of 20 and a +12 attack bonus for spell attacks. The spells it has prepared include a variety of offensive, defensive, and control spells, such as Fireball and Finger of Death, which can significantly impact battles by dealing massive damage or incapacitating foes. For example, Fireball has a large area of effect and can devastate groups of enemies if they fail their Dexterity saves. Meanwhile, spells like Confusion can cause chaos in ranks, leaving enemies vulnerable as they act unpredictably.

In terms of its actions, the Lich has powerful offensive capabilities. The Paralyzing Touch can immobilize an enemy if they fail a Constitution saving throw, offering the Lich significant control over the battlefield. Arc Lightning allows it to target multiple creatures, dealing substantial lightning damage. The Fire Bolt cantrip serves as a reliable ranged attack option, while Thunderwave provides area control by pushing back foes. Defensive spells like Blur make it harder for enemies to land successful hits against it, while Disintegrate can eliminate targeted creatures altogether, with the potential to destroy nonmagical items.

The Lich can use bonuses to enhance combat, summoning various auras. Its Eldritch Aura provides dim light and serves as a physical manifestation of its power. The Death Aura deals necrotic damage to nearby living foes while healing the Lich, making it more dangerous in close quarters. The Shield Aura can absorb damage meant for the Lich, effectively creating a buffer, while the Spell Shield Aura protects against incoming magic from outside its radius.

In reaction to threats, the Lich can sabotage spells targeting it, dealing damage to spellcasters attempting to harm it. It can also activate Shield as a reaction to increase its AC, providing further defense against attacks, including magic missiles.

The Lich has the ability to take legendary actions that allow it to cast additional spells or attack after other creatures' turns, showcasing its tactical nature and ability to control the flow of combat. This versatility makes the Lich a terrifying opponent to face and a master strategist in any encounter.
