The Astral Snapper is a Medium Aberration classified as neutral evil. It has a unique ability to invade the bodies of other creatures, drawing power from its hosts while posing a significant threat in combat. The creature has an Armor Class of 12 and gains 78 hit points from rolling twelve 8-sided dice plus an additional 24 hit points, which makes it relatively resilient against attacks. With a challenge rating of 3, the Astral Snapper can present a moderate difficulty to adventurers, granting 700 experience points upon defeat. This creature boasts impressive Dexterity and Wisdom scores, making it agile and perceptive, though its Charisma is notably low.

The Astral Snapper's physical attributes include a Strength score of 12 (+1 modifier, considered average), Dexterity of 15 (+2 modifier, regarded as good), and Constitution of 14 (+2 modifier, also good). It has an Intelligence of 12 (+1 modifier, average) and a Wisdom of 16 (+3 modifier, which is very good). The creature has a Charisma score of 8 (-1 modifier, bad), indicating it is not persuasive in social interactions. It is proficient in Constitution saving throws (+4 total), arcana checks (+4 total), perception checks (+5 total), and stealth checks (+4 total), but its deception skill is less effective at +1. The Astral Snapper has resistances to bludgeoning and slashing damage from nonmagical sources and possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, with a passive perception score of 15.

The creature has a notable special ability called Astral Devour. This ability forces a creature that is hosting an Astral Snapper to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each long rest. A successful save ejects the Astral Snapper from the host's body and into an unoccupied space on the Material Plane within 10 feet of the host, where it remains stunned for one round. However, if the saving throw fails, the Astral Snapper devours part of the host's internal organs, reducing the host's Constitution score by a roll of 1d4. If the host's Constitution score is reduced to 0 due to this ability, the host dies, and the Astral Snapper violently exits the host's body in a corporeal form, emerging through the abdomen.

In terms of actions, the Astral Snapper can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to strike twice with its claws. When it hits the same target twice, that target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failing this saves creates a rift to the Astral Plane, from which the Astral Snapper can escape, thus activating its Astral Devour ability on the target. Each claw attack uses a melee weapon attack modifier of +4 and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 9 slashing damage (calculated as 2d6 + 2).

The Claws attack is its primary offensive option, dealing reliable damage and posing a risk of further debilitating effects due to its connection with the Astral Plane. Overall, the Astral Snapper serves as a formidable opponent that can disrupt player strategies and increase the stakes in combat encounters.
