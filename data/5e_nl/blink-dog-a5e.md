The Blink Dog is a Medium fey creature known for its agility and mystical teleportation abilities. With an Armor Class of 13 and 22 hit points, it is relatively fragile, yet it poses a unique challenge for adventurers due to its high Dexterity and stealth capabilities. Its Challenge Rating of 1/4 indicates that it is suitable for low-level encounters, providing players with an engaging and whimsical opponent. The Blink Dog's strengths lie in its exceptional Dexterity, granting it a +3 modifier, and its ability to teleport, making it difficult to pin down in combat. However, it lacks significant offensive power with a mediocre bite attack. Notably, its keen senses enhance its effectiveness in perception checks that rely on hearing and smell.

The Blink Dog has the following attributes: Strength at 14 (+2), Dexterity at 16 (+3), Constitution at 12 (+1), Intelligence at 10 (+0), Wisdom at 12 (+1), and Charisma at 10 (+0). The Dexterity score allows it to be quite agile, providing good evasion in combat. Its skills include Perception at +3 and Stealth at +5, indicating that it excels in sneaky maneuvers and is alert to its surroundings. With a passive Perception score of 13, it can easily detect hidden creatures or traps. The Blink Dog understands the Sylvan language but cannot speak, adding a layer of mystery and allure to its character.

In terms of special abilities, the Blink Dog possesses Keen Hearing and Smell, which gives it an advantage on Perception checks that depend on these senses. This means it typically rolls two d20s for relevant checks and takes the higher result, significantly increasing its chances of success in detecting prey or threats.

For actions, the Blink Dog can perform a Bite attack, utilizing a melee weapon attack roll of +3 to hit with a 5-foot reach against a single target. If successful, it inflicts 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, which is fairly average for its challenge rating.

As a bonus action, the Blink Dog can use its Teleport ability, which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6 on a d6 after use. This allows the Blink Dog to magically teleport up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, enabling it to reposition itself rapidly during combat. This ability adds an exceptional level of mobility and unpredictability, allowing it to evade attacks or gain advantageous positions on the battlefield.
