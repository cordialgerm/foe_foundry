The Keg Golem is a Medium-sized Construct that serves as a unique, unaligned creature. Its notable characteristics include a solid physical presence, with a robust armor class of 11, and a healthy pool of hit points totaling 45. This creature excels in its role on the battlefield due to its strong physical attributes—particularly its Strength of 16, granting a +3 modifier, and Constitution of 16, which also provides a +3 modifier—making it able to deal significant damage and withstand attacks. However, its weaknesses include a low Dexterity of 10 (+0 modifier), which provides only average agility, and a poor Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, indicating that it lacks sophistication in both combat strategy and social interactions. The Keg Golem can be a resilient foe with some ability to knock opponents prone, but it depends on ale to maintain its combat effectiveness, enforcing an interesting tactical element.

The Keg Golem has the following attributes: Strength at 16 (+3), Dexterity at 10 (+0; average), Constitution at 16 (+3, good), Intelligence at 8 (-1; very bad), Wisdom at 7 (-2; very bad), and Charisma at 3 (-4; very bad). It possesses several skills as well as specific immunities and resistances. It is immune to poison and psychic damage, making it exceptionally resistant to those types of attacks. Additionally, it is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that are not made with adamantine. It also cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. With darkvision extending 60 feet, the Keg Golem has a limited awareness of its surroundings, though its passive Perception score is relatively low at 8. It can understand the languages of its creator but lacks the ability to speak.

The Keg Golem has several special abilities that enhance its role in combat. Its 'Empty Keg' ability allows it to carry 20 gallons of ale, and should it deplete its stock, its speed is reduced to 0, and it suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls until it is refilled with at least 1 gallon of ale. This means maintaining its ale supplies is crucial for its effectiveness. The 'Immutable Form' ability makes it immune to any spells or effects that would change its form, while 'Magic Resistance' gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it harder to control or defeat with magic. Its 'Rolling Charge' ability allows the golem to knock prone a creature if it charges into them, requiring a Dexterity saving throw; if successful, it opens up opportunities for additional attacks.

In terms of actions, the Keg Golem has a 'Slam' attack that allows it to perform a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit. It can deal 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage with this attack. The 'Ale Blast' special action has a recharge mechanic and allows the golem to eject a jet of ale in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Targets in this blast must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 9 (2d8) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, the damage is halved, and the target does not suffer from poisoning. Additionally, a poisoned creature can attempt to save at the end of each of its turns in order to end the effect. Overall, the Keg Golem presents a unique challenge in battle, emphasizing a mix of physical prowess and thematic reliance on ale.
