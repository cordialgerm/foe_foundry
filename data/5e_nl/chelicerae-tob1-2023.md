The Chelicerae can perform the following actions during combat:

- **Bite:** This melee attack grants a +9 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 17 piercing damage (2d10 + 6). The target must also make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute, which renders it unconscious if it is medium-sized or smaller while in this state. A poisoned creature can attempt to escape this condition at the end of its turns by repeating the saving throw.

- **Claw:** This claw attack also has a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 slashing damage (2d8 + 6) on a successful hit.

- **Magical Discharge (Recharge Special):** This ability allows the Chelicerae to release a burst of magical energy that affects all creatures within 15 feet. Each creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 36 force damage (8d8) on a failed save and half that on a successful one. This attack can only be used again after it siphons magic from a creature or takes a long rest.

- **Spellcasting:** Using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability, the Chelicerae has access to several spells. At-will spells include *mage hand* and *minor illusion*, which can aid in manipulation and deception. It can cast *haste*, *hold person*, *invisibility*, and *phantasmal killer* once per day, allowing for a tactical advantage in combat and interrogation scenarios. These spells can increase its mobility, incapacitate foes, or deal significant damage.

For bonus actions, the Chelicerae can use:

- **Nimble Moves:** This allows it to take the Dash or Disengage action, providing it exceptional mobility during combat.

- **Siphon Magic:** While grappling a spellcaster, the Chelicerae can attempt to drain magic, requiring the target to make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On failure, the target loses one spell slot of the highest level it can cast, while the Chelicerae regains an expended use of its spellcasting. This ability makes the Chelicerae a formidable opponent as it can diminish a combatant's magical capabilities while enhancing its own.

With its blend of physical prowess, magical versatility, and tactical abilities, the Chelicerae is not only a dangerous adversary in combat but also an unsettling foe that can manipulate its environment and opponents to achieve its goals.
