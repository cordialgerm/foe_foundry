The Mangrove Treant is a huge plant creature that embodies the essence of nature. It serves as a protector of its environment, often found in coastal regions or mangrove forests. With a natural armor class of 15 and 136 hit points, it demonstrates considerable durability in combat, making it a formidable opponent. The Mangrove Treant has a challenge rating of 7, indicating that it poses a serious threat to adventurers. Its primary strengths lie in its high strength score of 20 and good constitution score of 19, which enhance its physical resilience and combat effectiveness. However, it has a poor dexterity score of 7, rendering it less agile and making it more susceptible to effects that rely on agility. The treant's ability to manipulate its environment, summon mosquitos, and communicate with nature are notable aspects that can significantly impact gameplay by providing strategic advantages.

The special abilities of the Mangrove Treant include:

- **False Appearance:** This ability allows the treant to remain motionless and blend seamlessly into its environment, appearing indistinguishable from a regular mangrove tree. This can provide strategic advantages in ambush scenarios.

- **Grasping Roots:** The Mangrove Treant has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws against being knocked prone, making it difficult to topple in combat.

- **Siege Monster:** This ability enables the treant to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it particularly effective in situations where it must break through barriers or siege equipment.

- **Tiny Spies:** The treant can communicate with mosquitos, which serve as its eyes and ears. These mosquitos alert the treant to the presence of intruders within 60 feet, granting it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice nearby creatures.

In terms of actions, the Mangrove Treant can perform the following:

- **Multiattack:** This enables the treant to make two slam attacks in one turn, significantly increasing its damage output against enemies.

- **Slam:** This is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. If it hits, it deals 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, emphasizing its strength in close-quarters combat.

- **Mangrove Mosquitos:** The treant can summon a swarm of mosquitos that acts as an ally. This swarm possesses the statistics of a regular swarm of insects, with a flying speed of 30 feet, offering tactical options such as distracting foes or creating difficult situations for enemies. The swarm remains for a duration of one day or until dismissed, allowing for strategic planning in and out of combat. However, the treant can only maintain one swarm at a time, necessitating careful management of this resource.
