The Fulminar is a formidable elemental creature characterized by its mastery over lightning and its ability to move swiftly in combat. As a large neutral elemental, it excels in aerial mobility, able to fly and hover with ease, making it a challenging opponent for melee attackers. With an Armor Class of 15 and 112 hit points, it presents a decent defense against physical attacks. Its offensive capabilities are enhanced by a high Dexterity score, granting it exceptional agility and effectiveness in combat, particularly through its swift movements and lightning-infused attacks. While it possesses a range of immunities and resistances, including immunity to poison and resistance to lightning and thunder, magical attacks can still pose a risk to it. Overall, the Fulminar is a well-rounded adversary that thrives in fast-paced encounters, dishing out substantial lightning damage while maintaining a strong defensive position.

The Fulminar has specific attributes that shape its combat role. It has a Strength of 10, which is average and not particularly effective for physical strength. It has a remarkably high Dexterity of 20, resulting in a +5 modifier, making it very good at dodging attacks and performing dexterous maneuvers. Its Constitution score of 14 provides it with a +2 modifier, giving it good resilience against health-draining effects. Intelligence is notably low at 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is very bad for tasks requiring knowledge. Wisdom is 17, yielding a +3 modifier, which is good for perception and insight checks. Charisma is neutral at 10, functioning at a +0 modifier with no significant strengths or weaknesses in social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Fulminar excels with a +9 to Dexterity saves and +4 to Charisma. Its proficiency in stealth (+9 modifier) and perception (+7 modifier) further enhance its ability to remain hidden and aware of its surroundings. Damage immunities include poison, while it has resistances to lightning, thunder, and all forms of nonmagical physical damage, making it particularly resilient against common attacks. It is immune to many conditions such as exhaustion, grappling, paralysis, and more, allowing it to remain active in battle. With darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 17, it effectively locates threats in the dark.

The Fulminar has several notable special abilities. The Flyby ability allows it to fly without provoking opportunity attacks, ensuring it can maneuver freely in combat. Its Essence of Lightning ability allows it to create a glowing field of light around it, with a choice of radius between 5 and 20 feet. This not only adds a visual aspect to its presence but can impact any characters trying to stealthily approach. The Lightning Form ability allows it to occupy a creature's space and deliver lightning damage of 7 (2d6) to anyone who touches it or strikes it in close proximity, making it very punishing to engage in close quarters.

In combat, the Fulminar can perform a Multiattack, making three attacks in one turn: a single bite and two claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage alongside 7 (2d6) lightning damage. Additionally, targets hit by the bite cannot take reactions until the end of the Fulminar's next turn, allowing it to control the battle's flow. Each Claw attack also has a +9 to hit, dealing 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) lightning damage. 

The Fulminar's Lightning Shackles ability is particularly powerful; it can magically create three sets of lightning shackles targeting creatures it can see within a 60-foot radius. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 18 (4d8) lightning damage and become restrained for one minute. If the target succeeds, they only take half damage and avoid being restrained. A restrained creature has an opportunity to escape at the end of each of its turns, adding a tactical element to engagements with the Fulminar.
