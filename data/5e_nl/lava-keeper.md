The Lava Keeper is a formidable Huge elemental that embodies the essence of fire and earth, standing as a guardian of volcanic landscapes. Its role in combat is as a powerful adversary that can deal significant damage with both melee and ranged attacks, while also using environmental tactics to control the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 18, it presents a serious threat to adventurers, leveraging high hit points, strong physical attacks, and a suite of innate spellcasting abilities. Its natural armor makes it difficult to hit, while its immunities to fire and poison grant it resilience against many typical attacks. However, its weaknesses lie in its moderate Dexterity, making it less agile compared to other creatures, which could be exploited by nimble opponents.

The Lava Keeper has an Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, making it good at avoiding hits. It possesses 276 hit points, calculated using 24d12 plus 120, which allows it to absorb a significant amount of damage before being defeated. Its speed varies based on movement, allowing it to walk or burrow at 40 feet per round. The creature's statistics include a Strength score of 24, resulting in a very good +7 modifier, a Dexterity score of 10, providing an average +0 modifier, and a Constitution score of 21, yielding a good +5 modifier. The Wisdom score is 18 with an exceptional +4 modifier, and its Charisma is 12, giving it a bad +1 modifier. For saving throws, it excels in Constitution and Wisdom, with bonuses of +11 and +10, respectively. Its skills in History (+12) and Perception (+10) further enhance its effectiveness in various situations.

In terms of damage survivability, the Lava Keeper is immune to fire and poison damage, while it has resistance to acid and lightning, as well as to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. It also has immunity to several conditions such as exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, being poisoned, and being prone. Its senses include darkvision out to 60 feet and tremorsense out to 120 feet, allowing it to detect creatures nearby regardless of light conditions.

The Lava Keeper has several special abilities that enhance its role in combat. The "Lava Dribble" ability requires creatures starting their turn within 5 feet of it to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. This ability encourages opponents to stay away from the Lava Keeper while also punishing close-range engagement. Its "Innate Spellcasting" allows it to cast spells using a Wisdom modifier with a DC of 17. It can cast "move earth" and "stone shape" at will, affecting the terrain significantly. Three times a day, it can use "wall of fire" and "wall of stone," creating strategic barriers against enemies. Once per day, it can summon an earth or fire elemental, create an earthquake, or unleash a fire storm, all of which have significant battlefield control potential.

The Lava Keeper's actions are quite lethal. It can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make four slam attacks, or use its "Lava Lob" attack twice. The "Slam" attack has a +13 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 25 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The "Lava Lob" is a ranged attack with the same +13 to hit, dealing 21 fire damage and imposing an additional damage effect where the target must save against taking more fire damage on their next turn. Lastly, the "Fumarole" ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, lets the Lava Keeper unleash a plume of fire, rock, and toxic smoke, forcing nearby creatures to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, suffering extensive damage and potentially being poisoned for a minute upon failure. This eruption creates a heavily obscured area for others, disrupting visibility and movement until the smoke is dispersed, further enhancing the Lava Keeper's control of the encounter.
