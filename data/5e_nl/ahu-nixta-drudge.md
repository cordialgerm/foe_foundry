The Ahu-Nixta Drudge is a medium-sized aberration characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This creature is notable for its reliance on clockwork armor, which provides both protection and functionality. Its strengths lie in its ability to withstand damage due to its decent armor class and unique immunities, making it tough to defeat through conventional means. It possesses a variety of resistances to both physical and magical effects, making it a resilient opponent. However, its dependence on its clockwork armor is a significant weakness; if the armor is destroyed, the Ahu-Nixta Drudge is rendered defenseless and dies. As it engages in battle, it utilizes its whirring blades to deal damage up close while leveraging its innate spellcasting for both offensive and defensive strategies.

The Ahu-Nixta Drudge has an armor class of 13, which classifies it as having a good defensive capability. It has 26 hit points, calculated using the roll of four eight-sided dice plus an additional eight hit points from its Constitution modifier, indicating average durability for a creature of its challenge rating. Its speed allows it to fly at 30 feet, hover indefinitely, and walk at the same distance, providing it with exceptional mobility on the battlefield.

It has an Intelligence score of 12, with a +1 modifier, resulting in an average capability related to mental tasks.

It has damage immunities to poison and psychic attacks and is immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and prone. Its proficiency in darkvision allows it to see in the dark up to 60 feet, adding strategic advantages during low-light situations. The drudge communicates using Deep Speech and Void Speech, typical of aberrations.

The Ahu-Nixta Drudge possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities. The Clockwork Encasement ability indicates that the creature is dependent on its clockwork armor for survival; it cannot live outside of it and will die if the armor is reduced to 0 hit points. The Immutable Form ability grants it immunity to any spell or effect that would alter its form, safeguarding both the armor and the creature it encases as long as it remains intact. 

In terms of spellcasting, the Ahu-Nixta Drudge has an innate spellcasting ability tied to its Intelligence, with a spell save DC of 11 and a +3 attack bonus on spell strikes. It can cast the fire bolt cantrip at will, dealing 1d10 fire damage, which is useful for ranged attacks. Additionally, it can cast the fear spell once per day, which can instill fear in its opponents, potentially causing them to flee or become incapacitated from fright, thereby impacting combat dynamics.

For its actions during combat, the Ahu-Nixta Drudge can use whirring blades as a melee weapon attack, which has a +4 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and can strike a single target, dealing an average of 7 (ranging from 2d4 + 2 slashing damage) on a hit, making it a reliable source of damage in close quarters.
