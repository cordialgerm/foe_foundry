The Zmey is a formidable and chaotic evil dragon known for its impressive physical power and a suite of devastating abilities. As a huge creature, it boasts a high armor class of 18, making it quite resilient in combat. With a total of 189 hit points, derived from rolling 18 twelve-sided dice plus an additional 72, it can take substantial damage before being defeated. The Zmey's challenge rating of 15 indicates that it poses a significant threat to adventurers, offering 13,000 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths lie in its multiple heads, powerful attacks, and innate resistances, while its vulnerabilities include taking acid and fire damage that can negate its regeneration abilities.

The Zmey's primary attributes showcase its physical prowess and durability. It has a Strength of 22 with a modifier of +6, which is exceptionally powerful, allowing it to deal significant damage in melee combat. Its Dexterity is a decent 13 with a +1 modifier, providing average agility. With a Constitution of 19 (+4), it has very good resilience against direct damage and saving throws. Intelligence is respectable at 16 (+3), demonstrating a strategic mind. Wisdom at 16 (+3) also gives it good perception and saving throw capabilities. Charisma is the least impressive at 12 (+1), indicating average social skills.

In addition to its powerful attributes, the Zmey has several notable abilities. It possesses advantageous saving throws against various conditions due to its three heads, utilizing the advantage mechanic effectively. This means it has a good chance of resisting being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. With legendary resistance used thrice per day, the Zmey can ignore failures on saving throws, making it infuriatingly tough for adventurers to control. Its regeneration ability allows it to recover 15 hit points at the start of its turn, unless it has taken acid or fire damage, creating a dire challenge for those opposing it. If reduced to 0 hit points, it dies, which underlines the stakes of bringing it low.

The Zmey's multiattack feature allows it to strike fear into its opponents by making multiple attacks in one turn. It can use its powerful Bite attack, rolling a +11 to hit for an average of 19 piercing damage, and its Claw attack, which also rolls a +11 to hit but deals an average of 20 slashing damage. Additionally, the Zmey can unleash a devastating Fire Breath, which has a recharge mechanic. This breath attack targets a 30-foot cone and forces creatures within range to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw against potentially severe fire damage, which can range up to 49 points on a failed save. With tactical options for its fire breath to avoid damaging plants or plant creatures, the Zmey can control the battlefield effectively.

Furthermore, the Zmey has legendary actions, allowing for tactical flexibility. It can move stealthily or fly without incurring attacks of opportunity, position itself strategically with its Tail Whip to knock foes prone, or unleash a terrifying Tripartite Roar that imposes debilitating conditions based on the number of heads it has left, enhancing its threat and control over the battlefield. Each roar can result in deafness, fright, or even a stunning effect depending on how many heads remain, offering a dynamic threat that continuously shapes combat encounters.
