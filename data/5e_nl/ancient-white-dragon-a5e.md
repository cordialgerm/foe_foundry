The Ancient White Dragon is a gargantuan and formidable creature known for its mastery of icy elements and its terrifying presence on the battlefield. With an exceptionally high Armor Class of 20 and a massive pool of Hit Points totaling 370, this dragon possesses both durability and resilience, making it a significant challenge for adventurers. Its movement options are versatile, including walking, flying, and even burrowing through snow and ice, allowing it to navigate various terrains with ease. This dragon's offensive capabilities are impressive, including powerful physical attacks and devastating cold-based abilities. However, it has lower Dexterity, which could make it vulnerable to ranged attacks if not adequately protected. The Ancient White Dragon excels in controlling the battlefield, devastating foes with icy breath weapons and powerful spells, making it a notable threat in any encounter.

The Ancient White Dragon has the following attributes: Strength 26 (+8, exceptional), Dexterity 12 (+1, average), Constitution 26 (+8, exceptional), Intelligence 10 (+0, average), Wisdom 16 (+3, good), and Charisma 16 (+3, good).

This dragon possesses high saving throw bonuses in Constitution (+15, exceptional), Wisdom (+10, very good), and Charisma (+10, very good). Its Dexterity saving throw bonus is also robust at +8 (good). It has a reputation for intimidation (+10, very good) and keen perception (+10, very good), and is capable of stealth (+8, good). One of its key advantages is its immunity to cold damage, which allows it to withstand attacks from adversaries that utilize frost spells or weapons. With a blindsight of 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive perception score of 23, it can effectively detect and engage foes in various conditions.

The Ancient White Dragon's special abilities include Cold Mastery, which allows it to move and see without hindrance in icy conditions and burrow through snow without leaving a trace. It also has Legendary Resistance, allowing it to automatically succeed on a failed saving throw three times per day, but using this ability reduces its Armor Class temporarily if overused. As a spellcaster, its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma, with a save DC of 18. It can cast several spells which include Dominating beasts, creating protective fire shields, charming animals, conjuring sleet storms, controlling weather, and forming walls of ice.

In combat, the Ancient White Dragon can make multiple attacks through its Multiattack option, delivering powerful bites and claw attacks. Its Bite attack has an attack bonus of +15 to hit, dealing 30 piercing damage plus an additional 9 cold damage on a successful hit. The Claw attack, with the same attack bonus, inflicts 21 slashing damage, and the Tail attack, also with +15, can deal 21 bludgeoning damage and push targets away.

Additionally, the dragon can unleash Spit Ice, a ranged attack that forces a target within 60 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer 22 cold damage, immobilizing them for their next turn. Its Cold Breath ability, which can be used only as it recharges, unleashes a frost cone affecting all within a 90-foot area, requiring enemies to make a Constitution saving throw or take severe cold damage and face movement restrictions.

In terms of reactions, the dragon can perform a Tail Attack when it is hit by a melee attack, retaliating against the attacker. Furthermore, it has access to Legendary Actions, allowing it to use abilities like Roar, which frightens nearby enemies; Wing Attack, which can push foes away and enable the dragon to reposition itself; and Raging Storm, creating an area of difficult terrain and cold damage for anyone moving within it.

The Ancient White Dragon is not only a fearsome foe but one that can manipulate the battlefield, making it a memorable and dangerous encounter for any adventuring party.
