The Willowhaunt is a formidable Huge Undead creature with a neutral evil alignment, renowned for its ability to manipulate and confuse foes with illusions and madness. This monster has a respectable Armor Class of 14 and boasts a total of 90 hit points, derived from rolling twelve d12 dice plus an additional twelve hit points. The Willowhaunt's movement is relatively slow, allowing it to walk only 20 feet per turn, but it compensates for this with various tactical abilities that can turn the tide of battle. Its Challenge Rating is 5, suggesting it’s a substantial threat worthy of 1,800 experience points upon defeat. Notably, this creature has high Charisma and Strength scores, giving it good proficiency in intimidation and the ability to deal significant damage. It is particularly dangerous due to its immunities to necrotic and poison damage, as well as its resistance to nonmagical physical attacks, making it tough to bring down without magical intervention.

The Willowhaunt has a Strength score of 17, granting it a +3 modifier, which is considered good for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is average at 10, meaning it has no modifier for actions relying on agility. With a Constitution score of 12 (+1), it has moderate stamina, but its Intelligence is low at 9 (-1), suggesting it is less adept at tasks requiring cunning or reasoning. The monster has a Wisdom score of 14 (+2), which provides an average advantage on perception checks. However, its Charisma score is exceptional at 19 (+4), making it very persuasive and effective in manipulation through charm or intimidation. In terms of saving throws, it is especially strong against Strength and Charisma, with bonuses of +6 and +7 respectively.

The Willowhaunt demonstrates a variety of skills, boasting +5 in Insight, which allows it to gauge the emotional states of others effectively, and +7 in Intimidation, showcasing its ability to instill fear. It is immune to the conditions of being charmed, exhausted, frightened, and poisoned, making it highly resilient against many forms of control. The creature possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 12, enabling it to see in darkness and notice hidden foes adequately. Although it cannot speak, it can understand Common and communicate via telepathy within a range of 60 feet.

Among the Willowhaunt's special abilities, its **Living Projection** feature allows it to cloak its skeletal form in a magical illusion, appearing as a living willow tree. This illusion can be dismissed as a bonus action, but careful physical inspection can reveal its true nature, requiring a dedicated action and a high Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 20) to succeed.

When it comes to combat, the Willowhaunt’s **Multiattack** feature enables it to deliver two powerful **Slam** attacks in one turn. Each slam attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, and upon a hit, inflicts 9 bludgeoning damage along with an additional 7 necrotic damage, making it capable of dealing substantial damage in melee.

One of its most dangerous abilities, **Provoke Murder**, allows the Willowhaunt to target up to two creatures within 30 feet. Those affected must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or succumb to an overwhelming urge to kill anything within their range of sight for one minute. During this time, affected creatures have advantage on their melee attacks, but they cannot distinguish between allies and enemies, potentially turning friends against one another. They can attempt to break free from this effect at the end of their turns by making another saving throw.

Finally, the **Whispers of Madness** attack, rechargeable on a roll of 5-6, inflicts psychic damage and can cause madness. Any creature within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; on failure, they take 18 psychic damage and experience short-term madness. A particularly poor saving throw (by 5 or more) leads to long-term madness. Those suffering from madness have disadvantage on saving throws against the Willowhaunt's **Provoke Murder**, making this creature even more fearsome in its capacity to manipulate the battlefield.
