The Lorelei is a Medium-sized fey creature that embodies chaotic evil, making her a formidable foe in any encounter. With an Armor Class of 15 and a significant pool of 93 hit points, she can withstand a fair amount of damage. Her high Dexterity score of 21 (+5 modifier) grants her exceptional agility, allowing her to dodge incoming attacks effectively. The Lorelei thrives in combat situations, particularly against humanoid opponents, using her enchanting abilities and spell-like powers to control the battlefield and incapacitate her enemies. While she appears to be powerful, she lacks physical strength, as indicated by her average Strength score of 10 (+0 modifier), which limits her capability in direct melee combat. Her challenge rating of 5 suggests that she poses a fair threat, especially to parties of lower levels.

The Loreleiâ€™s attributes reveal her strengths: she has a Constitution of 18 (+4 modifier) that enhances her durability, and her high Charisma of 21 (+5 modifier) makes her particularly persuasive and deceptive in social interactions. She possesses significant saving throw bonuses, being able to dodge attacks with a Dexterity saving throw of +8 and resist charms or mental effects with a Charisma saving throw of +8. Her skills in Deception, Performance, and Persuasion are all +8, indicating her effectiveness in manipulating others both in and out of combat situations. With darkvision that allows her to see up to 60 feet in darkness and a passive perception of 13, she is adept at navigating her surroundings discreetly.

The Lorelei's special abilities further enhance her tactical prowess. Her Alluring Presence can charm humanoids within 30 feet, forcing them to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is incapacitated and compelled to move toward her for a kiss, rendering them vulnerable. However, they can repeat the saving throw if they take damage, allowing them an opportunity to break free. Her Amphibious trait allows her to breathe both air and water, providing her with versatile movement options in different environments. The Free Water Spirit ability grants her immunity to difficult terrain when in contact with water and allows her to escape from nonmagical restraints with ease.

In terms of attack options, the Lorelei employs a strategy of combining her special abilities and spells. Her Multiattack allows her to use the Stunning Glance, which can stun a target within 30 feet if they fail a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, rendering them unable to act until the end of their next turn. Following this, she can unleash three Psychic Blast attacks, which deal 12 (2d6 + 5) psychic damage. Additionally, she can opt to use her Corrupted Kiss as part of this attack, which is a melee spell attack that also deals 14 (2d8 + 5) necrotic damage to a creature that is either incapacitated or willingly chooses to receive it. Remarkably, the Lorelei regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt, making her sustain herself in prolonged encounters.

Overall, the Lorelei is a master manipulator and a dangerous combatant, capable of charming and incapacitating foes while wielding powerful psychic magic. She can dominate the battlefield with her ability to stun and inflict damage, all while restoring her own health, making her a significant threat to adventurers who underestimate her seductive powers.
