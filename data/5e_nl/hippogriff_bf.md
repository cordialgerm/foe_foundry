The Hippogriff is a large monstrosity that blends the features of a horse and a bird of prey, making it a unique creature often found in arid and mountainous terrains. Its capabilities include a good movement speed both on land and in the air, with a flying speed that grants it exceptional mobility during encounters. Although it possesses a somewhat low Armor Class of 11, it compensates with moderate hit points totaling 44, allowing it to sustain a reasonable amount of damage before being incapacitated. With a Challenge Rating of 1, the Hippogriff is typically considered a manageable opponent for lower-level characters but can still pose a considerable threat due to its offensive capabilities. Notably, it has special abilities that enhance its perception and resilience, making it a formidable creature in combat situations.

The Hippogriff has a Strength score of 16, granting it a +3 modifier, which is classified as good, enabling it to deal substantial physical damage. Its Dexterity is average at +1, while its Constitution also has a +1 modifier, thus ensuring decent survivability. The creature’s Intelligence is low with a -4 modifier, making it ineffective in situations requiring mental capacity. However, it has a Wisdom score of 16, translating to a +3 modifier, which is good and reflects its strong perceptive abilities. Charisma is the weakest attribute at -1, indicating a lack of social influence.

As for its senses, the Hippogriff has a Perception score of 13, allowing it to notice changes in its environment but lacks specialized sensory features. Its Stealth ability stands at 10, which is average, indicating it can be somewhat stealthy but not particularly adept at it. The Hippogriff cannot speak any languages, limiting its interactions to non-verbal communication.

Among its special abilities, the Hippogriff has Heightened Sight, elevating its Perception score to 18 when relying on sight. This remarkable ability allows it to notice subtle movements or hidden creatures effectively. Additionally, it benefits from Monstrosity Resilience, granting it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it less susceptible to certain debilitating effects.

In combat, the Hippogriff can use the Multiattack action to perform one Beak attack and one Claws attack. The Beak attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, reaching up to 5 feet, and when successful, deals 8 piercing damage using a 1d10 roll plus the Strength modifier. The Claws attack also uses a +5 to hit and reaches 5 feet, allowing it to inflict 10 slashing damage by rolling 2d6 plus the Strength modifier.

The Hippogriff can also utilize a bonus action called Dive, which has a recharge mechanism requiring a roll of 5 or 6. When flying, the Hippogriff can dive toward a creature below it. The creature must move at least 20 feet in a straight line before the action. The target is then required to make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 13. If the target fails, it suffers 7 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone, which can significantly alter the dynamics of the battlefield.

Overall, the Hippogriff is a well-rounded creature capable of strong offensive moves, with resilience to common conditions and awareness that makes it a significant encounter for adventurers.
