The Giant Boar is a robust creature that embodies the traits of a large beast with impressive physical capabilities. With an armor class of 12, it can withstand moderate attacks, while its hit points totaling 63 give it substantial endurance in combat, rated at a Challenge Rating of 2. The boar is well-suited for frontline engagement due to its speed of 40 feet, allowing it to close distances quickly. Its Strength score of +3 contributes to its potent melee attacks, while its Constitution score of +3 provides strong resilience. However, it is notably lacking in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, making it poor at mental contests and communication. The boar's distinct abilities, such as Charge and Relentless, enhance its lethality and survivability, making it a formidable opponent despite its mediocre Dexterity and lack of any noteworthy senses or languages.

The Giant Boar has a Strength of 16, contributing to its attack modifier of +5, which means its chances of landing hits in combat are good. Its Dexterity is 10, making it average in terms of agility or finesse required for stealthy movements or ranged attacks. With a Constitution of 16, the creature possesses a very good ability to take damage. The Wisdom and Charisma scores are both quite low at -2 and -3 respectively, which makes the boar very bad at Wisdom saves and interactions that require charm or persuasion.

As for its special abilities, the Giant Boar can use Charge to enhance its tusk attacks significantly. If it rushes at least 20 feet toward a target and lands a hit, the additional damage dealt is 7 (2d6) slashing damage. The target must also succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. This ability can be pivotal in combat, allowing the boar to potentially incapacitate a foe with a single powerful maneuver. Additionally, its Relentless ability allows it to remain active and in the fight after taking what would normally reduce it to 0 hit points, instead dropping to 1 hit point, making it exceptionally durable.

In terms of standard combat actions, the Giant Boar can utilize Multiattack to perform two tusk strikes in one turn; if both attacks land on the same target, that target must also succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone again. The tusk strike itself inflicts an average of 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, solidly contributing to the boar’s offensive capabilities.

Additionally, the Giant Boar features a bonus action called Challenging Snort, where it can intimidate a creature within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn, which also imposes disadvantage on its next save against being knocked prone by the boar, potentially setting the stage for further attacks.

Overall, the Giant Boar is a strong physical combatant with useful traits for both dealing and absorbing damage in battle.
