The Bearfolk Chieftain has several notable special abilities:
- **Brute:** This feature allows the chieftain to deal one extra die of damage with its melee weapon attacks, increasing its lethality significantly.
- **Frenzy (available once per rest):** As a bonus action, the chieftain can enter a berserk state for one minute. While frenzied, it gains resistance against nonmagical physical damage and benefits from advantage on attack rolls. However, this also means all attacks against the chieftain have advantage, showcasing a trade-off between offense and defense.
- **Keen Smell:** This ability grants the chieftain advantage on wisdom (perception) checks based on smell, enhancing its tracking and hunting capabilities.
- **Savage Charge:** If the chieftain moves at least 20 feet towards a target and strikes with a battleaxe, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone. If they fall prone, the chieftain can use a bonus action to make a bite attack against them.

For its actions in combat:
- **Multiattack:** This feature allows the chieftain to make two battleaxe strikes and one bite attack on its turn, providing a high potential for damage.

It also has a tactical ability called **Leadership** which can be used as a reaction once per short or long rest.

This ability facilitates better performance among its allies, reflecting the chieftain's role as a leader in battle. The effect becomes inactive if the chieftain is incapacitated.
