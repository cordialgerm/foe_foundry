The Deva is a powerful Medium celestial being often regarded as an angelic figure in Dungeons & Dragons. With a challenge rating of 10, it serves as a formidable ally or a daunting adversary in any encounter. Its defense is notably strong, boasting an Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of 165 Hit Points, allowing it to endure significant damage in battle. The Deva possesses exceptional abilities in combat and healing, making it exceptionally useful for providing support to allies or punishing foes. Despite its strengths, it is not invulnerable; it is particularly vulnerable to magical attacks that bypass its defenses. Overall, the Deva balances offense and defense with high mobility, impressive damage output, and powerful restorative abilities.

The Deva's attributes are as follows: Strength 18 (+4, good), Dexterity 18 (+4, good), Constitution 18 (+4, good), Intelligence 16 (+3, average), Wisdom 24 (+9, exceptional), and Charisma 24 (+9, exceptional). The Deva has darkvision to a range of 120 feet, allowing it to see in the dark, and a Perception score of 19, which provides a good chance of noticing hidden creatures or traps. It has a Stealth modifier of +14, indicating it can be very quiet when necessary. The Deva can communicate in all languages and use telepathy over a distance of 120 feet.

Among its many special abilities, the Deva showcases impressive resilience, being resistant to radiant damage and nonmagical physical damage, while it is immune to exhaustion and conditions such as being charmed or frightened. It uses Angelic Senses to locate Aberrations, Celestials, Fiends, and Undead within 30 feet, and can discern the nature of consecrated or desecrated areas. Its weapon attacks are magical and inflict an extra 4d8 radiant damage, significantly increasing its threat level in combat. With Immortal Nature, the Deva does not require food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. It also benefits from Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. One of its group-supporting abilities, Reviving Prayer, allows the Deva to return a creature to life within 24 hours of its death, restoring half of its maximum hit points, but it cannot revive the same creature again within 30 days.

In combat, the Deva can initiate a Multiattack, making three attacks with its Mace, which has a +8 to hit and deals 7 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 18 radiant damage on a successful strike. The Healing Touch ability, usable three times per day, allows the Deva to touch a creature to restore 20 hit points while also curing any curses, diseases, poisons, blindness, or deafness that may afflict the target.

As a bonus action, the Deva can use Change Shape to magically transform into a Large or smaller Beast or Humanoid with a challenge rating not exceeding its own. This transformation preserves several of its key traits, including Angelic Resilience, Angelic Senses, and Immortal Nature while adapting its statistics to fit the new form. The Deva will revert to its true celestial form upon death. This versatility allows the Deva to strategically alter its appearance to suit various situations in combat or exploration.
