The Wind Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon of chaotic neutral alignment, embodying the unpredictable nature of storms. With a challenge rating of 1, it is a formidable foe for lower-level adventurers, possessing a solid mix of speed, agility, and unique powers. Specific strengths include its exceptional Dexterity and Strength, allowing for effective melee attacks as well as stealthy maneuvers. In addition, it is immune to lightning damage and resistant to cold damage, making it tough against certain kinds of assaults. However, its weaknesses include lower hit points relative to its speed and strength, and as a young creature, it may lack some more powerful spellcasting abilities. The Wind Dragon Wyrmling is notable for its wind-based abilities, which not only provide it with offensive options but also enhance its mobility and survivability in combat.

The Wind Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, which is considered good, allowing it to deal significant melee damage. Dexterity is also 16, providing a +3 modifier that also falls into the good category, enhancing both its agility in combat and its Stealth capabilities. Constitution measures at 14, giving it a +2 modifier which is average, contributing decently to its hit points. Intelligence is 12 (+1), Wisdom is 11 (+0), and Charisma is 14 (+2), with the Charisma being good and helpful for interactions if necessary, while the Wisdom is less impactful.

In terms of saving throws, the Wind Dragon Wyrmling is particularly quick and resilient. It holds a +5 to Dexterity saves (good), +4 to Constitution saves (good), +2 to Wisdom saves (average), and +4 to Charisma saves (good). This resilience makes it adept at avoiding harmful effects in battle. The dragon is skilled in Acrobatics with a +7 modifier (very good), Perception at +4 (good), and Stealth at +5 (good), allowing it to maneuver effectively both in and out of combat.

The Wind Dragon Wyrmling has damage immunities to lightning and resistance to cold, making it impervious to these types of attacks. In terms of sensory perception, it has blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, with a passive Perception score of 14, enabling it to detect creatures and hidden threats effectively. It speaks Draconic and Primordial languages, allowing for communication with certain creatures.

Its special abilities include Elusive, which grants the dragon advantage on any ability checks and saving throws to escape effects that would reduce its speed or restrain it, making it difficult to pin down in combat. Additionally, Storm Sight allows it to see clearly through fog, mist, clouds, or precipitation, enhancing its utility in inclement weather conditions.

The Wind Dragon Wyrmling can attack with a Bite, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 8 points of piercing damage, categorized as 1d10 plus its Strength modifier. 

Moreover, it possesses a powerful area attack called Tempest Breath, which has a recharge time of 5 to 6. The dragon can unleash this ability as a 15-foot cone of stormy wind. Creatures in that area must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw. Failure results in 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and being pushed back up to 5 feet from the dragon, while a successful save results in half damage with no pushback. This ability also has an environmental impact, extinguishing unprotected flames, such as torches, and giving a 50% chance of extinguishing protected flames, like those in lanterns. This combination of combat and environmental control makes the Wind Dragon Wyrmling a dynamic addition to any encounter.
