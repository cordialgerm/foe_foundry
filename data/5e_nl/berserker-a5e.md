The Berserker is a medium humanoid creature characterized by its aggressive combat style and ability to unleash powerful attacks when wounded. With a challenge rating of 2, it is intended for encounters that provide a moderate challenge to adventurers. The Berserker boasts a strong combination of physical attributes, particularly in strength and constitution, which enhance its combat effectiveness. However, its relatively low armor class suggests that it is more vulnerable to attacks when compared to more heavily armored foes. The Berserker shines in offensive capabilities but risks being easily overwhelmed if not supported by allies.

The Berserker has an armor class of 13, which is considered average for its challenge rating, allowing it a reasonable chance to avoid attacks. Its hit points total 45, calculated as 6d8+18, providing it with a solid buffer against damage. The creature's movement speed is 40 feet, facilitating aggressive positioning maneuvers during its turn in combat.

- Strength: 14 (+2), which is good and enhances athletics and melee attack rolls.

The Berserker possesses special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. The first, Bloodied Frenzy, grants the Berserker advantage on all attacks and imposes advantage on attacks against it while it is bloodied, making it a formidable opponent when injured. The second ability, Unarmored Defense, allows its armor class to be calculated as 10 plus its Dexterity modifier (0) and Constitution modifier (+3), which contributes to an effective AC of 13.

In combat, the Berserker's Multiattack action allows it to make two melee attacks during its turn, increasing its overall damage output significantly. Its primary weapon is a Greataxe, which allows it to make melee weapon attacks with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 (1d12 + 2) slashing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, it can use a Handaxe, employing it either as a melee or ranged weapon with the same +4 to hit modifier and a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet. The Handaxe inflicts 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage on a successful hit.

Berserkers are known as lightly-armored and heavily-armed shock troops who prefer aggressive tactics such as charging at opponents and engaging in singular combat, rather than employing coordinated group formations. This fighting style makes them unpredictable and fierce adversaries on the battlefield.
