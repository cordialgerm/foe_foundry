The Chuul is a large aberration that embodies a formidable presence in combat, renowned for its ability to grapple and control its enemies. With a solid hit point total of 80 and a challenge rating of 4, it poses a significant threat, particularly in watery environments due to its amphibious nature. The Chuul excels at both melee attacks and unique magical abilities, making it a versatile opponent. A major strength lies in its resistance to various conditions, allowing it to endure through prolonged encounters. However, it suffers from a low intelligence score and cannot effectively communicate, limiting its strategic options. Players encountering a Chuul must be cautious of its grappling capabilities and the potential paralysis it can inflict.

The Chuul has an armor class of 15, indicating a good level of protection and its hit points of 80 provide a strong buffer against damage, marking it as a tough adversary. Its speed is 30 feet on land and 30 feet swimming, giving it good mobility in various terrains. The creature's strength score of +4 represents a very good modifier, enhancing its attack damage and grappling abilities. Its dexterity is average at +0, while its constitution at +3 also conveys a good level of durability. An intelligence score of -3 is very bad, indicating a lack of cognitive abilities, while its wisdom of +2 is good, providing it some perceptual skills. The charisma score of -3 is very bad, which means it is ineffective in social interactions.

The Chuul's special abilities enhance its survivability and utility in combat. Its "Aberrant Resilience" grants it resistance to being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned, alongside advantage on saving throws against spells or effects that would alter its physical form. This makes the Chuul a resilient foe. The "Amphibious" ability allows it to breathe both air and water, making it equally dangerous on land and in aquatic environments. The "Sense Magic" ability permits the Chuul to detect magic within 120 feet, revealing a faint aura surrounding magic users or items, which can be strategically advantageous in combat.

In terms of actions, the Chuul can perform a "Multiattack," enabling it to make two different Pincer attacks in a single turn. The Pincer attack has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, delivering bludgeoning damage with an average output of 17 (3d8 + 4). If it successfully hits a target that is Large or smaller, the target becomes grappled, imposing an escape difficulty of 14. Furthermore, the "Wild Reach" ability (which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6) allows the Chuul to unleash an area burst of kinetic energy. Creatures within a 15-foot radius must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, suffering damage on a failure. The nature of the damage—either force or necrotic—depends on the presence of magic near the Chuul, adding versatility to its damage output.

As a bonus action, the Chuul has "Paralyzing Tentacles," which target one grappled creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one minute, during which it is paralyzed. This affliction poses a serious threat in battle, as paralyzed creatures cannot act and are vulnerable to critical hits, potentially turning the tide of combat in favor of the Chuul.

Overall, the Chuul embodies a creature that thrives on grappling and manipulating enemies while leveraging its magical sensing powers to maintain an upper hand in conflict.
