The Cactid is a large, plant-like creature that embodies both a defensive and offensive presence in combat. With a relatively high Armor Class of 14, it can withstand a good amount of damage, bolstered by its significant Hit Points total of 76, which equates to 8d10 plus 32. This makes it a resilient foe, particularly at Challenge Rating 3, where it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. However, the Cactid is notably vulnerable to fire damage, which is a considerable weakness that can be exploited by players. Although its Dexterity score is low, resulting in a bad modifier, its exceptional Constitution allows it to absorb damage effectively. The creature's special abilities, such as its Tendril attacks and the ability to drain the life force from grappled opponents, make it dangerous in close encounters.

The Cactid has the following attributes: a Strength score of 16, providing a good modifier of +3, making it capable of dealing substantial melee damage; a Dexterity of 8, leading to a bad -1 modifier; a Constitution of 18, granting an exceptional +4 modifier for hit points; an Intelligence of 5, resulting in a very bad -3 modifier; a Wisdom of 10, translating to an average +0 modifier; and a Charisma of 9, registering a bad -1 modifier. In terms of resistances, the Cactid is resistant to bludgeoning and piercing damage but is highly susceptible to fire. It is immune to being blinded or deafened and possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, making it effective in detecting creatures nearby, although it is unable to perceive anything beyond that range.

In combat, the Cactid can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Tendril attacks and also use its Reel ability during a single turn. The Tendril attack functions as a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 15 feet. On a hit, it deals 10 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 piercing damage, and it grapples Medium or smaller creatures, imposing a fighting disadvantage as they become restrained. While grappled, opponents must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turns or suffer a reduction of their hit point maximum by 3. This effect can lead to the eventual death of the target if their hit point maximum reaches 0, making the grapple particularly dangerous. The Reel ability allows the Cactid to pull each creature it has grappled up to 10 feet closer, repositioning foes for further attacks.

As a reaction, the Cactid can unleash a Hail of Needles once per day when its health drops below half its maximum. This attack targets all creatures within 15 feet, requiring them to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 10 piercing damage, or half that amount on a successful save. This ability serves as a powerful deterrent when the Cactid's health is low, providing a defensive measure against clustered opponents. Overall, the Cactid is a formidable combatant that can drain life from its prey while effectively defending itself.
