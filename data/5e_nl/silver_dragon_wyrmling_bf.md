This Medium dragon boasts a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating it can pose a significant threat to low-level adventurers. With an Armor Class of 17, it has good defenses due to its natural armor, along with 51 hit points, making it reasonably resilient in combat. The wyrmling is quick on its feet with a walking speed of 30 feet and an impressive flying speed of 60 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in battle. Its abilities reflect a balance of strength and agility, with a strong Constitution score enhancing its durability and a good Charisma score suggesting its inherent draconic majesty. Notably, the Silver Dragon Wyrmling is proficient in flight and has abilities that allow it to control the flow of battle, particularly through its breath attacks.

It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Its keen senses grant it an additional 10 feet of enhanced perception, allowing it to detect creatures more effectively. With a Perception score of 14, it has a good awareness of its surroundings. The wyrmling also has a Stealth score of 12, indicating it can move silently when necessary. It communicates in Draconic, the language of dragons.

The Silver Dragon Wyrmling has a special ability called Pounce. This ability allows the dragon to knock a target prone if it moves at least 15 feet straight toward it and then successfully hits it with a Claw attack on the same turn. If the target is prone, the wyrmling can make an additional Claw attack against that creature as a bonus action, which can be a devastating combination in combat.

In combat, the wyrmling can use the Multiattack action to make both a Bite attack and a Claw attack on its turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 9 piercing damage on a hit. The Claw attack similarly has a +6 to hit and deals 7 slashing damage with the same reach.

The Silver Dragon Wyrmling also has two breath weapon abilities: Cold Breath and Paralyzing Breath. Cold Breath can be used when it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allowing the dragon to exhale an icy blast in a 15-foot cone. Creatures within the area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. The Paralyzing Breath, which recharges on a roll of 6, is equally devastating, exhaling a gas that can paralyze creatures in a 15-foot cone. Affected creatures must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for up to one minute, with a chance to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns.

The combination of these abilities and spells makes the Silver Dragon Wyrmling a dynamic enemy that can control the battlefield and pose serious threats to adventurers caught in its icy grip or in the path of its ferocious claws and bite.
