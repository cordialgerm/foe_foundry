The special ability, Goblin Skulker, allows this creature to deal an additional 3 points of damage (1d6) when it attacks with advantage or when an ally is within 5 feet of the target that isn’t incapacitated. This ability significantly enhances its offensive capabilities when coordinating with others, making it more dangerous in group settings.

The Goblin Skulker has two primary actions in combat:

1. Shortsword Attack: It makes a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit against a single target. If it hits, it deals 4 points of piercing damage (1d6 + 1). This attack is effective for close combat situations.

2. Shortbow Attack: The goblin can also engage ranged foes with a ranged weapon attack, similarly using a +3 to hit. It can attack targets up to 80 feet away, or up to 320 feet at disadvantage. A successful hit with this weapon also deals 4 points of piercing damage (1d6 + 1), making it versatile and capable of threats from a distance.

As a bonus action, the Goblin Skulker can employ Nimble Escape, allowing it to either Disengage or Hide. This ability gives it greater tactical flexibility in combat, enabling it to escape from melee or to find better positioning for sneaky strikes. Overall, the Goblin Skulker excels in ambush situations, leveraging its ability to deal extra damage in combination with its nimble maneuvering and stealth capabilities.
