The Ancient Brass Dragon is an exceptionally powerful and intelligent creature classified as Gargantuan in size. With an impressive Armor Class of 20 and a hefty 367 hit points, this dragon serves as a formidable opponent in combat. Notably, its strengths include a high Constitution score of 24, which enhances its durability, and a wide array of spells that enhance its versatility. Its ability to fly at a speed of 80 feet allows for swift maneuvers in battle. However, it has a poor Dexterity score of 10, making it vulnerable to ranged attacks. With a Challenge Rating of 22, the Ancient Brass Dragon is a significant threat to any adventuring party, capable of dealing devastating amounts of damage while showcasing its deep knowledge as a scholar.

The Ancient Brass Dragon has the following attributes: Strength of 26, Dexterity of 10, Constitution of 24, Intelligence of 20, Wisdom of 16, and Charisma of 18. The Strength score provides an exceptional +8 modifier, making its physical attacks quite potent. Dexterity is average with a +0 modifier, meaning it is neither agile nor clumsy. Constitution offers a very good +7 modifier, contributing positively to the dragon's hit points and resilience. Intelligence shows a good +5 modifier, indicating strong reasoning and knowledge capabilities. Wisdom possesses a +3 modifier, reflecting average insight and perception, while Charisma is very good with a +4 modifier, enhancing its social and magical abilities.

For saving throws, the dragon has a +7 modifier for Dexterity (average), a +14 for Constitution (very good), a +10 for Wisdom (good), and a +11 for Charisma (good). Its Immunities to fire damage grant it exceptional resilience against such attacks, while its advanced senses—including blindsight and darkvision—allow it to effectively perceive its surroundings even in total darkness.

The following are the dragon’s special abilities: 

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** This ability allows the dragon to succeed on saving throws even if it fails, a tactic that grants it substantial tactical advantage. If it uses this ability and exhausts its uses, its Armor Class is reduced to 18 until it completes a long rest.
- **Self-Sufficient:** This ability shows the Ancient Brass Dragon’s ability to survive on minimal resources, requiring only a quart of water and a pound of food per day.
- **Scholar of the Ages:** The dragon gains a d4 expertise die on Intelligence checks, enhancing its ability to recall lore. It can also use its Legendary Resistance to treat a failed roll as a 20, showcasing its exceptional knowledge.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** Using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a save DC of 19, this dragon can innately cast several spells. Three times a day, it can cast spells such as "comprehend languages," "identify," "commune," and "legend lore," and once per day, it casts "teleport" and "true seeing," which reflects its versatility and cunning.

In terms of actions, the Ancient Brass Dragon can perform a **Multiattack**, where it makes one bite attack and two claw attacks or substitute its bite for a **Molten Spit** attack. 
- **Bite:** With a +15 to hit, it deals 30 piercing damage plus an additional 9 fire damage. 
- **Claws:** Also at +15 to hit, each claw attack inflicts 21 slashing damage. 
- **Tail:** The dragon can deal 21 bludgeoning damage with its tail and pushes the target 10 feet away. 
- **Staff (Humanoid Form Only):** In humanoid form, it can use a staff for 12 bludgeoning damage. 
- **Molten Spit:** A ranged attack that forces a target within 60 feet to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 22 fire damage on a failure and ongoing fire damage if it fails the initial save.
- **Breath Weapons:** The dragon can unleash **Molten Breath**, which inflicts significant fire damage and can blind targets, or **Sleep Breath**, which can incapacitate enemies for 10 minutes unless they take damage or are woken.

The dragon's **Change Shape** ability allows it to transform into a humanoid or beast form, maintaining its statistics but changing its size and the types of attacks it can perform. 

For reactions, the dragon can perform a **Tail Attack** against a creature it can see within 10 feet when hit by a melee attack.

Finally, the dragon can utilize **Legendary Actions** at the end of another creature's turn, which include:
- **Analyze:** This action lets the dragon gather crucial information on an opponent.
- **Roar:** An intimidating ability that can frighten nearby creatures.
- **Wing Attack:** It can generate a powerful attack to push away and knock prone surrounding creatures while allowing it to reposition itself in the air.

The Ancient Brass Dragon is a tactical and intelligent foe, making it an exciting challenge for any adventuring party.
