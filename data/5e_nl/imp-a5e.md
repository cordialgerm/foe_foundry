The Imp is a tiny fiend known for its cunning and mischievous nature, often acting as a servant or spy for more powerful entities. With a decent Armor Class of 13 and 14 hit points, it is not particularly durable but can evade attacks by utilizing its high Dexterity score of 16, which grants it a good modifier of +3, making it effective at avoiding damage. In addition to its ability to fly at a speed of 40 feet, the Imp’s primary strengths lie in its magical capabilities and stealth, reinforced by its high Stealth skill of +5 and its access to invisibility. However, its low Strength score of 6 (-2 modifier) makes it ineffective in direct combat, relying instead on hit-and-run tactics and illusion. The Imp also has several useful traits, such as damage immunities to fire and poison, as well as resistances against cold and nonmagical attacks, making it a resilient foe despite its small size.

The Imp has the following attributes and values: 
- Strength (STR): 6, which translates to a very bad modifier of -2.
- Dexterity (DEX): 16, providing a good +3 modifier for dodging.
- Constitution (CON): 12, with a average +1 modifier to determining hit points.
- Intelligence (INT): 10, giving it an average +0 modifier.
- Wisdom (WIS): 12, which results in an average +1 modifier.
- Charisma (CHA): 14, resulting in a good +2 modifier.

With skills that enhance its deceptive and perceptive nature, the Imp has the following skill values:
- Deception: +4 (good)
- Insight: +3 (good)
- Perception: +3 (good)
- Persuasion: +4 (good)
- Stealth: +5 (very good)

The Imp has several special abilities that enhance its combat versatility and interaction capabilities:
- Devils Sight: Allows the Imp to see in magical darkness as if it were dim light, greatly benefiting its stealth and surprise tactics.
- Ventriloquism: The Imp can imitate any voice it has heard, creating the illusion that the voice comes from a point within 30 feet. This ability is useful for distraction and trickery during encounters.
- Lawful Evil: This characteristic defines the Imp's nature, showing its alignment and intentions to others familiar with such divine or fiendish auras.
- Magic Resistance: Provides the Imp with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, giving it a significantly better chance of resisting harmful magical attacks.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Imp has two actions:
- Sting: This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, allowing it to reach a target within 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 5 piercing damage (1d4 + 3) and an additional 3 poison damage (1d6). This dual damage type allows the Imp to inflict significant harm despite its small size.
- Shapeshift: The Imp can magically transform into a rat, raven, or spider, each with different movement capabilities while keeping its statistics mostly intact. This allows it to escape danger or infiltrate areas more easily, reverting back to its true form upon death.

The Imp also possesses a notable bonus action:
- Invisibility: The Imp can turn invisible, which lasts until it attacks, falls unconscious, or dismisses the effect. This ability makes it a formidable opponent that can ambush or evade foes, contributing to its role as a trickster within the game.
