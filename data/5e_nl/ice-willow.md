The Ice Willow is a large, neutral plant creature characterized by its formidable defenses and chilling attacks. With a challenge rating of 6 and a significant experience value of 2,300, it poses a considerable threat to adventurers. The Ice Willow's natural armor provides it with a good Armor Class of 15, and its remarkable pool of 142 hit points makes it durable in combat. While it is exceptionally resistant to cold damage and has decent resistances to lightning and slashing damage, it is notably vulnerable to fire—a weakness that can easily be exploited by clever adventurers. Its false appearance allows it to blend in with its environment, making it challenging to detect until it is too late. 

In terms of attributes, the Ice Willow has impressive physical strength with a Strength score of 19, granting it a strong modifier of +4, which is very good for melee attacks. However, its Dexterity is low at 9, resulting in a bad modifier of -1 that affects its ability to dodge and evade attacks. The Constitution of 18 provides an excellent +4 modifier, allowing it to withstand significant damage, while its Intelligence and Charisma scores are poor (-2 and -3, respectively), indicating a lack of finesse and social presence. The Wisdom score of 14 gives it an average +2 modifier, enhancing its perception skills slightly, which can be useful in spotting foes.

The Ice Willow has a number of special abilities and actions that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its **False Appearance** trait allows it to remain motionless and appear as a standard ice-covered willow tree, making it difficult for enemies to identify it as a threat until they are close. The **Ice Melt** ability activates when it takes fire damage; it causes nearby creatures to gain advantage on their saving throws against its attacks for one turn, making it a clever tactic to employ when it is attacked.

In combat, the Ice Willow can launch a **Multiattack**, allowing it to perform two **Slam** attacks per turn. These attacks have a +7 to hit, reach 10 feet, and deal significant damage: 13 bludgeoning damage plus a chilling 7 cold damage, making it a formidable foe in close quarters. 

The Ice Willow can unleash an **Icicle Drop** as a special action, available after it has recharged. This ability affects all creatures within 10 feet, forcing them to make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 15. On a failed save, a creature takes 9 piercing damage and 7 cold damage, or half damage if they succeed. The **Icicle Spray** is a more potent attack requiring a recharge of 6 turns but affects a larger area in a 30-foot cone, dealing 18 piercing damage and 14 cold damage to all creatures within that zone unless they pass the save.

As a reaction, the Ice Willow can activate **Melting Icicles** whenever it takes fire damage, allowing it to use **Icicle Drop** immediately if that ability is available. This reaction not only capitalizes on its vulnerability but also increases its threat level by punishing attackers with an immediate counterattack. 

Overall, the Ice Willow is a tactical and resilient enemy that can control the battlefield with its chill, making it a notable encounter for adventurers.
