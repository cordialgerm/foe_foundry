The Rakshasa, Slayer is a formidable medium-sized fiend characterized by its lawful evil alignment and cunning abilities. It serves as an assassin or a lethal enforcer with impressive skills and strategic advantages in combat. With an armor class of 18, it is well-protected, while its hit points totaling 142 provide it with substantial durability in battle. The creature possesses a strong dexterity, making it very agile, and its charm is notable, allowing it to manipulate situations to its benefit. However, it is vulnerable to piercing damage from magic weapons wielded by good creatures, presenting a clear weakness for any heroes utilizing such weapons. The Rakshasa's challenge rating of 9 indicates that it is a dangerous foe that can inflict significant damage with its multiattack capability and exploit its magical advantages effectively.

The Rakshasa has the following attributes and modifiers: Strength at 14 (+2, which is good), Dexterity at 20 (+5, which is exceptional), Constitution at 16 (+3, which is good), Intelligence at 13 (+1, which is average), Wisdom at 14 (+2, which is good), and Charisma at 18 (+4, which is very good). 

Special abilities include Limited Magic Immunity, which allows the Rakshasa to ignore the effects of spells of 4th level or lower, unless it chooses to be affected, granting it significant resilience. It also has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects, making it very difficult to control through magic.

In terms of actions, the Rakshasa can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make three attacks using either a rapier or a light crossbow in a single turn. The rapier attack rolls +9 to hit and deals 9 piercing damage plus an additional 7 poison damage, requiring the target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn. The light crossbow functions similarly, also with a +9 to hit and the same damage calculations, alongside the same poison condition. 

The Rakshasa is capable of spellcasting, using its Charisma for spell save DC of 16. It can cast spells like Detect Thoughts and Disguise Self at will, which can provide useful information or enable disguises for infiltration. It can use Invisibility three times a day and Mislead once a day, enhancing its ability to evade attackers or confuse adversaries.

For bonus actions, the Rakshasa can engage in Cunning Action, which allows it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide actions, thereby increasing its agility in combat. Additionally, it can use Gain the Upper Hand to study a creature within 30 feet, granting it advantage on its next attack roll against that target. If the attack hits, it can deal an extra 9 piercing damage.

Lastly, for reactions, the Rakshasa can utilize Shadow Leap, allowing it to teleport 30 feet to a space it can see when a creature moves within 5 feet of it while in dim light or darkness. This ability enhances its mobility and can be a tactical advantage in combat situations, enabling it to escape threats or reposition itself to launch a surprise attack.
