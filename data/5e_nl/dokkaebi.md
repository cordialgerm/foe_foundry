Its Dexterity is also commendable at 15 (+2), which bolsters its initiative and improves its defense against physical attacks. The Constitution score of 14 (+2) contributes positively to its hit points and stamina. Its Intelligence score is 13 (+1), which provides a slight bonus for knowledge checks.
