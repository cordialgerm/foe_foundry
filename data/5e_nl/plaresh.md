The Plaresh is a Medium-sized Fiend of chaotic evil alignment, making it a formidable foe in any encounter. It possesses several advantageous abilities that grant it resilience in combat, including damage immunities to poison and resistances to various elements like cold, fire, and lightning. Its natural armor provides it with good defensive capabilities, while its ability to burrow allows it to create destructive pathways through solid materials. However, its physical strength is exceptionally weak, making it reliant on its agility and cunning in battle. The Plaresh also has a significant challenge rating of 3, signaling that it poses a substantial threat to low-level adventurers.

The Plaresh has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good, making it difficult to hit with attacks. With a total of 30 hit points, derived from rolling 4d8 and adding 12, it has an average resilience in terms of endurance. Its movement capabilities allow it to burrow, swim, and walk at a speed of 30 feet, giving it versatility on the battlefield. The Plaresh's Strength is exceptionally low at 2, which is very bad, but its Dexterity is strong at 17, yielding a good +3 modifier, enabling it to dodge attacks effectively. It has a good Constitution score of 16, giving it a +3 modifier that bolsters its hit point total. The creature’s Intelligence is very low at 6, translating to a bad -2 modifier, while its Wisdom is average at 12, resulting in a +1 modifier, and its Charisma is exceptionally low at 3, with a very bad -4 modifier.

The Plaresh has several unique abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Firstly, the Grinding Maws ability enables it to burrow through solid objects like wood, stone, or metal at half its burrow speed. This creates bore holes that weaken the material significantly, imposing a -5 penalty to its Armor Class and halving the usual hit points of the structure. The Plaresh also boasts Magic Resistance, giving it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it difficult to control or harm with magic. The Swarm ability allows the Plaresh to occupy another creature's space and to move through any opening that is sufficient for a Tiny worm, although it cannot regain hit points while in this form.

In terms of actions, the Plaresh has a Bite attack that is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 0 feet, meaning it must share space with a target to land the attack. On a successful hit, it deals significant piercing damage of 14 (4d6), which drops to 7 (2d6) if the swarm is at half hit points or fewer. Additionally, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage. If the target is wearing nonmagical armor, it suffers a permanent and cumulative penalty of -1 to its Armor Class, potentially destroying the armor if it reaches an AC of 10.

The Plaresh's Infest Corpse ability can be used after a long rest, allowing it to target the corpse of a humanoid within its space. This action destroys the body and allows a new Plaresh to rise from it. The newly formed Plaresh retains its free will but is likely to obey its creator, adding to the Plaresh’s threat level by potentially increasing its numbers in combat situations.
