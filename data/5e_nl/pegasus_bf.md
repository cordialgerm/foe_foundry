The Pegasus is a majestic and powerful celestial creature that plays the role of both a steed and a guardian. With an impressive flying speed and the ability to deal notable bludgeoning damage with its hooves, the Pegasus serves as an excellent means of transportation as well as a formidable combatant. It possesses several strengths, including resistance to radiant damage, advantage on saving throws against spells, and magical attacks that can bypass typical defenses. While its Armor Class is relatively low, making it somewhat vulnerable to attacks, its abilities allow it to excel in mobility and support, particularly in situations where its rider needs protection.

In terms of attributes, the Pegasus has the following scores: Strength is +4 (good), Dexterity is +2 (average), Constitution is +3 (good), Intelligence is +0 (very bad), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +1 (bad). This combination makes the Pegasus a strong physical combatant with good durability, while its mental attributes lag behind.

The special abilities of the Pegasus enhance its combat effectiveness and survivability. "Celestial Resilience" grants the Pegasus resistance to radiant damage, meaning any damage it takes from radiant sources is halved. "Diving Pounce" allows the Pegasus to execute a powerful attack after flying down toward a target, requiring that target to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone. If the target does fall prone, the Pegasus can then make an additional attack as a bonus action, significantly increasing its offensive potential. With "Magic Resistance," the Pegasus has advantage on saving throws against spells, making it highly resilient against magical attacks. Finally, "Magic Weapons" ensures that its weapon attacks are treated as magical, effectively overcoming resistance properties enemies might possess.

When it comes to actions, the Pegasus can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two melee attacks with its hooves during its turn. Each of these "Hooves" attacks has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit, which is quite substantial for a creature of its Challenge Rating.

The Pegasus also has an interesting reaction called "Catch Rider." If its rider fails a check or saving throw to stay mounted, or is subjected to a dismounting effect, the Pegasus can use this reaction to shift and catch the falling rider, effectively preventing them from being dismounted. This ability showcases the Pegasus's loyalty and protective nature toward its rider.

Overall, the Pegasus embodies both grace and power, providing valuable support and combat prowess while also offering unique protective capabilities for its rider in various scenarios.
