The Sand Young Dragon is a formidable opponent characterized by its neutral evil alignment and natural agility. This large dragon, known for its stealth in sandy environments, boasts a high armor class of 19 and an impressive health pool of 189 hit points, making it a resilient adversary in combat. Its combination of speed—on land, in the air, and underground—allows it to engage opponents strategically. With a challenge rating of 11, this dragon is a significant threat in battle, able to deal considerable damage while also inflicting debilitating effects on its foes. However, it has vulnerabilities, notably being limited by its requirement for half the usual sustenance of a creature its size and its immunity to fire, which reflects its connection to elemental forces.

The Sand Young Dragon has a strong set of attributes. Its Strength stands at 20 with a modifier of +5, which is exceptional, enabling it to deliver potent physical attacks. Its Constitution is also robust at 21 (+5), granting it good resistance to physical damage. However, it has average Dexterity at 12 (+1), which affects its agility in avoiding attacks. The dragon has good Wisdom at 16 (+3), enhancing its perception and making it difficult for opponents to surprise it. Its Charisma of 14 (+2) suggests some level of influence over interactions, while its Intelligence of 13 (+1) indicates a basic level of knowledge and cunning.

In addition to its incredible physical attributes, the Sand Young Dragon benefits from its strong saving throws: Dexterity save of +5 is average, while its Constitution is very good at +9, Wisdom is good at +7, and Charisma is good at +6. Notably, it is immune to fire damage and resistant to piercing damage, making it harder to defeat in battle while being completely immune to blindness. With excellent sensory perception through blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision reaching 120 feet, it can detect enemies in low light or complete darkness. The dragon can communicate in Common and Draconic, allowing it to interact with various beings.

The dragon possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Sand Camouflage ability grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in sandy areas, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting opponents effectively. The Sandy Nature ability signifies that its elemental essence allows it to survive on half the food and water typically required by dragons of its size. Additionally, with the Stinging Sand ability, the dragon can inflict debilitating effects when it successfully hits a target with a melee attack. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

In combat, the Sand Young Dragon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +9 to hit and deals 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage, making it a significant melee threat. Each Claw attack also strikes with +9 to hit, dealing 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. 

The dragon's Breath Weapon, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, offers two devastating options. Its Sand Blast can unleash superheated sand in a 30-foot cone, dealing 22 (4d10) piercing damage and 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, with an additional debilitating effect causing level exhaustion if the creature fails its save by 5 or more. Alternatively, the Blinding Sand breath attack can blind creatures in a 30-foot cone for 1 minute unless they make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Blinded creatures can use their action to clear their eyes, thereby ending the effect for themselves. This versatile offense makes the Sand Young Dragon a dangerous and tactical foe in combat scenarios.
