The Giant Frog is a Medium-sized beast that serves as a unique monster in Dungeons & Dragons 5e, particularly known for its amphibious nature and grappling abilities. It has an Armor Class of 11, which is considered average, and a total of 18 hit points, representing a modest endurance in combat situations. The Giant Frog excels in close-range combat, utilizing its ability to grapple opponents and potentially incapacitate them by swallowing them whole. Its movement is versatile, as it can walk and swim at a speed of 30 feet each. The creature’s Challenge Rating is 1/4, making it suitable for lower-level encounters, offering players a manageable threat that can surprise with its tactical capabilities. While its combat efficacy is reasonably good, it lacks intelligence and charisma, which affects its overall effectiveness in social interactions and strategic planning.

The Giant Frog's strength score is 12, granting it a +1 modifier, which is good for dealing melee damage, while its dexterity is also 12, providing a +1 modifier for skills like stealth. The creature has a constitution score of 10, resulting in a 0 modifier, reflecting average resilience to effects like poison or exhaustion. Its intelligence score is notably low at 2, giving it a -4 modifier, which is very bad and limits its problem-solving abilities. The wisdom score is 10, translating to a +0 modifier, which is average, and its charisma is very low at 4, leading to a -3 modifier, which is very bad for any social interactions.

The Giant Frog is notably skilled in perception, boasting a +2 modifier, which is good for noticing hidden creatures or traps. It also has a +3 modifier in stealth, making it relatively good at sneaking up on its prey. The creature possesses darkvision up to 30 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, contributing to its effectiveness in ambush tactics. 

A defining feature of the Giant Frog is its amphibious ability, enabling it to breathe both air and water. This versatility allows it to operate effectively in aquatic environments, providing strategic advantages in specific terrains.

In combat, the Giant Frog can utilize three main actions: “Bite,” “Swallow,” and “Vaulting Leap.” 

The “Bite” action allows the frog to make a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and, if it successfully hits, deals 4 piercing damage (1d6+1). Additionally, the target becomes grappled with an escape DC of 11, meaning they must succeed on a strength check to free themselves. This action is powerful as it both deals damage and limits the target's mobility.

The “Swallow” action can only be used if the Giant Frog is already grappling a Small or smaller creature. If it bites successfully and has not swallowed another creature yet, it can swallow the target. A swallowed creature is considered to have total cover from attacks outside the frog, becomes blinded and restrained, and takes 5 acid damage (2d4) at the beginning of each of the frog’s turns. This ability can dramatically alter the battlefield, potentially removing an opponent from play entirely until the frog is defeated.

The "Vaulting Leap" ability allows the frog to leap up to 10 feet horizontally and 5 feet vertically. If it lands within 5 feet of a creature it is not currently grappling, it can make a bite attack against that creature with advantage, giving it a higher likelihood of hitting and dealing damage.

In summary, the Giant Frog is a versatile and unusual combatant with grappling and voracious abilities that can pose a unique challenge in aquatic environments or when encountered unexpectedly by adventurers.
