The Remorhaz is a massive, fearsome monstrosity known for its imposing physical presence and exceptional abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 11, it serves as a formidable adversary in combat scenarios, capable of dealing substantial damage while also possessing impressive defenses. Its natural armor grants it an Armor Class of 17, making it difficult to hit, and with 216 hit points, it can sustain a significant amount of damage. The Remorhaz excels in both melee combat and environmental manipulation due to its burrowing ability, allowing it to traverse through ice and snow effortlessly. While its high Strength and Constitution scores indicate strong physical power and durability, it has poor Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, which are not typically advantageous in social interactions or strategy-based combat.

The Remorhaz possesses a Strength of +11, which is considered exceptional, allowing it to perform powerful melee attacks. Its Dexterity of +1 is average, indicating that it is not particularly nimble. With a Constitution score of +9, also exceptional, the creature can withstand significant punishment. However, its Intelligence at -3 is very bad, its Wisdom at +0 is average, and its Charisma at -3 is likewise very bad, meaning it lacks the mental faculties to engage in strategic dialogue or effective social encounters. The creature's senses are heightened with darkvision and tremorsense, both extending 60 feet, which enhances its awareness of surroundings, especially in darkness or under snow.

The Remorhaz's special abilities enhance its danger in combat. The Heated Body ability inflicts damage on any creature that comes into physical contact with it or attacks it while within 5 feet, dealing 7 fire damage. Monstrosity Resilience provides the Remorhaz resistance against exhaustion and fear effects, making it tough to control in battle. The Tunneler ability enables it to burrow through ice and snow, leaving a tunnel of 5 feet in diameter, adding versatility to its movement and tactics.

The primary action it can take is its Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack that adds +11 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet. Upon successfully hitting a target, the Remorhaz inflicts 40 piercing damage plus an additional 10 fire damage. Critically, if the target is a Medium-size or smaller creature, they must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or risk being swallowed, which subjects them to being blinded and restrained. This scenario provides total protection against outside attacks while dealing continuous acid and fire damage to the swallowed creature each turn.

As a bonus action, the Remorhaz can vent heat when its hit points are 119 or fewer. This action generates intense heat around its body, forcing all creatures within a 5-foot radius to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in one level of exhaustion, which could significantly weaken opponents and alter the dynamics of combat.

In summary, the Remorhaz is a terrifying monster characterized by its overwhelming strength, substantial resistance to debilitating effects, and destructive abilities, making it a powerful foe in any encounter.
