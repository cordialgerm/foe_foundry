The Red Hag is a Medium-sized Fey creature, known for its cunning and malevolent nature. As a neutral evil entity, it revels in causing suffering and mischief, utilizing its powerful magic and physical attacks to overwhelm foes. With a challenge rating of 7, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, boasting an impressive collection of attributes, special abilities, and spells that enhance its combat efficacy. While its combat prowess is formidable, it remains vulnerable to strategies that exploit its weaknesses, such as ranged attacks and magical effects that do not require constitution saving throws.

The Red Hag has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good, making it moderately difficult to hit in combat. With 136 hit points, calculated from 16d8 + 64, it has a solid health pool, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being defeated. It can move at a speed of 30 feet, which is average for humanoid creatures in the game.

In terms of attributes, the Red Hag has the following scores: Strength 19 (+4, very good), Dexterity 16 (+3, good), Constitution 18 (+4, very good), Intelligence 18 (+4, very good), Wisdom 21 (+5, exceptional), and Charisma 15 (+2, average). These attributes make the Red Hag not only a strong melee combatant but also a powerful spellcaster with a high degree of resilience against spells due to its Magic Resistance, giving it advantage on saving throws against magical effects.

The Red Hag has several notable special abilities. It is Amphibious, allowing it to breathe in both air and water, which can be advantageous in diverse environments. Its Blood Sense ability enables it to locate living creatures within 60 feet and sense their general direction up to a mile away, except for Constructs or Undead. This ability increases its capabilities in stalking potential prey. Additionally, it can communicate with beasts due to its Speak with Beasts ability, adding a layer of versatility to its interactions.

The Red Hag's combat actions are as follows: it can perform a Claw attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 slashing damage, complemented by an additional 9 necrotic damage. The Blood Bolt is a Ranged Spell Attack with a +8 to hit and a range of 60 feet, delivering 14 necrotic damage; if the target has blood, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. One of its most potent abilities is Siphon Blood, which requires a recharge of 5-6; it forces creatures within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw against 35 necrotic damage, or half on success. If this attack is successful on at least one target, it enhances the power of the Red Hag's next spell, allowing it to cast as though it were using a spell slot two levels higher.

The Red Hag's spellcasting abilities augment its threat level significantly. It can cast spells using a Wisdom modifier as its casting ability, with a spell save DC of 16. At will, it can use animal friendship to charm animals, druidcraft to perform minor nature-based effects, and entangle to restrain enemies in an area. It can cast cure wounds and lesser restoration three times per day to heal itself or allies, as well as dispel magic to negate magical effects. Once per day, it can control water, affecting a large area, and gain freedom of movement, allowing it to navigate difficult terrain and avoid being restrained. Each of these spells provides tactical advantages, making the Red Hag a complex and formidable opponent in any encounter.
