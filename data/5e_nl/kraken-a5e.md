The kraken is a gargantuan monstrosity, known for its immense size and powerful presence, especially within the depths of the ocean. It serves as a formidable challenge for any adventurer, boasting extraordinary defenses, a formidable assortment of attacks, and the ability to manipulate the battlefield. With a challenge rating of 25, the kraken possesses high durability with 444 hit points and exceptional armor class standing at 20. Its strengths lie in its numerous physical attack options, superior resistances, and devastating magical abilities. However, it has very poor Dexterity, making it less effective in quick maneuvers. This creature's notable features include its ability to summon storms and control lightning, along with its rather unique grappling attack mechanics that can severely hinder combatants.

The kraken has a Strength score of 30, which translates to a remarkable +10 modifier, classifying its strength as exceptional. The Constitution is equally impressive at 26 (+8 modifier), ensuring that it can withstand significant damage. However, its Dexterity is a mere 10 (+0 modifier), making it very bad for dodging attacks. Its Intelligence is high at 22 (+6), Wisdom at 18 (+4), and Charisma at 18 (+4), allowing it to excel in spells and telepathic communication. The kraken has formidable saving throw bonuses: +18 in Strength (exceptional), +8 in Dexterity (average), +16 in Constitution (very good), +14 in Intelligence (good), +12 in Wisdom (good), and +4 in Charisma (average). 

Damage immunities include lightning and damage from nonmagical weapons, while it resists cold, fire, and thunder damage. The kraken has truesight up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 14, allowing it to detect hidden foes and navigate through darkness. The kraken understands the Primordial language but cannot speak, communicating instead through telepathy within 120 feet.

The kraken's special abilities enhance its survivability and combat effectiveness. With "Immortal Nature," it does not require air, food, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. The "Legendary Resistance" allows it to succeed on failed saving throws three times per day, enhancing its survivability, and it can retaliate with an attack when it uses this ability. Its "Magic Resistance" provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it resilient to magical attacks. Additionally, as a "Siege Monster," it inflicts double damage to structures, allowing it to wreak havoc on ships or fortifications.

When attacking, the kraken can use a "Bite" action, making a melee weapon attack with a +18 hit modifier and an attack range of 5 feet. On a hit, it delivers a staggering 36 piercing damage. If it grapples a Huge or smaller target, it can swallow the creature, rendering it blinded and restrained while inflicting 42 acid damage at the start of the kraken's turns. 

The "Ink Cloud" ability lets the kraken create a heavily obscured cloud of ink in a 90-foot radius while underwater. Any non-kraken creature within this cloud must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 27 poison damage and become poisoned for one minute. A successful save results in half damage and negates the poisoned condition.

The kraken can also "Summon Storm" once per day, creating a raging storm that lasts for one hour over a 5-mile radius. Its "Lightning" attack can strike up to three targets in a stormy environment, dealing 28 lightning damage with a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw for half damage. 

For its melee options, the kraken can strike with a "Tentacle," which has a +18 to hit and 30 feet reach, dealing 28 bludgeoning damage while grappling the target, which has an escape DC of 26. It can grapple up to 10 creatures simultaneously and can use "Fling" to toss a grappled target, inflicting additional damage.

The kraken also has legendary actions, allowing it to use a tentacle attack or Fling at the end of other creatures' turns, and it may spend two actions to use "Squeeze," enabling it to escape any magical restraints while moving. Overall, the kraken is a terrifying presence in any encounter, with abilities designed to dominate and control the battlefield.
