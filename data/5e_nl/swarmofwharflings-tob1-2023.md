The Swarm of Wharflings is a large, unaligned beast that serves as a chaotic hazard in its environment. This creature's primary role in combat is to overwhelm enemies with swarming attacks while also creating disruption by stealing items. With an armor class of 13 and hit points totaling 66, it maintains a fair level of durability in battles, but it does not possess strong offensive capabilities aside from its swarm-based attacks. The swarm's mobility allows it to occupy spaces of other creatures, making it a strategic nuisance. It has strong resistance to physical damage types, but it lacks any intelligence or charm, making it susceptible to spells and abilities that target those weaknesses. Notably, the swarm's unique movement allows it to traverse any opening that fits a Tiny wharfling, giving it exceptional maneuverability despite its size.

The Swarm of Wharflings has the following attributes:

- Strength: 10, which is considered average.
- Dexterity: 16, rated as good, making it quite agile.
- Constitution: 10, also average, indicating standard resilience.
- Intelligence: 2, very bad, showing it has extremely low cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 12, average, which indicates moderate awareness but limited insight.
- Charisma: 8, very bad, meaning it lacks social presence or influence.

In terms of skills, the swarm has proficiency in Perception with a modifier of +3, deemed good, and Sleight of Hand at +5, regarded as very good. The swarm enjoys resistances against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, reducing the chances of being significantly harmed by such attack types. It is immune to various conditions including charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned, allowing it to remain active and dangerous even against crowd control efforts. The swarm possesses darkvision out to 60 feet, and has a passive Perception of 13, making it reasonably aware of its environment.

Special abilities of the Swarm of Wharflings include:

- Amphibious: This ability allows the swarm to breathe both air and water, giving it versatility in various aquatic or terrestrial environments.
- Snapping Jaws: If a creature tries to move into or out of the swarm’s space, it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take an average of 7 piercing damage from the swarm’s snapping jaws.
- Swarm: This ability enables the swarm to occupy another creature's space and vice versa, facilitating unique combat strategies. However, the swarm cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, limiting its sustainability in prolonged encounters.

For actions, the Swarm of Wharflings can perform:

- Pilfering Bites: This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, and the swarm can attack a creature in its space with a reach of 0 feet. Upon a successful hit, the attack deals 28 piercing damage (using 8d6), or 14 piercing damage (using 4d6) if the swarm is at half hit points or fewer. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or lose one item it is wearing or carrying, as long as the item weighs no more than 10 pounds, isn’t a weapon, and isn’t firmly attached to them.

This combination of mobility, crowd control, and item theft makes the Swarm of Wharflings a unique and potentially disruptive foe in any encounter.
