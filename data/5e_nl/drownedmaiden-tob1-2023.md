The Drowned Maiden is a Medium-sized undead creature typically associated with themes of decay and malevolence. Possessing a neutral evil alignment, this creature is particularly deceptive and dangerous, using its magical abilities and physical prowess to manipulate and harm adventurers. With an armor class of 15 and 90 hit points, the Drowned Maiden is moderately durable in combat, presenting a potent threat particularly with its high charisma stat of 18, allowing it to excel in charm-related effects. However, its weakness lies in its vulnerability to damage from magical attacks and its inability to resist the most powerful forms of strength reduction attacks.

The Drowned Maiden has the following attributes: Strength 15 (+2), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 10 (+0), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 18 (+4). The dexterity and charisma scores are very good, enhancing her agility and effectiveness in social interactions or spells that require charisma. Her saving throws include a Dexterity modifier of +6 and a Charisma modifier of +7, making her quite adept at dodging certain attacks and withstanding effects targeting her willpower. The maiden is immune to necrotic and poison damage, as well as conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned, granting her significant advantages in combat and overcoming debilitating effects.

In combat, the Drowned Maiden can take multiple actions thanks to her Multiattack ability, allowing her to execute three Hair attacks on her turn, potentially overwhelming her targets. Each Hair attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, having a reach of 20 feet, which allows her to grapple targets. If she strikes successfully, she deals 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage and grapples the target, requiring a DC 16 escape to break free. This grappling ability enables her to control up to three creatures at a time, creating an effective crowd control mechanism.

The Drowned Maiden can also use her Draining Kiss ability in conjunction with her grappling. A target within her reach must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw; failure results in 10 (3d6) psychic damage and a reduction of their Strength score by 1d6, potentially leaving them weakened and more vulnerable. If their Strength is reduced to 0, the target dies. Success on the saving throw allows the target to take half damage without any reduction in Strength, which adds a layer of tension during combat encounters.

Additionally, the Drowned Maiden can employ her Illusory Appearance ability to disguise herself as another creature of similar size. This illusion can be maintained until she either chooses to drop it or dies. It can be revealed by creatures who take the time to investigate carefully, requiring a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. This ability enables her to engage in deception and ambush tactics, manipulating perceptions and potentially gaining the upper hand before revealing her true, threatening form.

Finally, as a bonus action, the Drowned Maiden can use the Reel ability to pull up to three grappled creatures toward her, effectively repositioning her enemies and maintaining control over the battlefield. This can disrupt enemy formations or isolate individuals, allowing her to focus her attacks more effectively on specific targets.
