The lion is a large beast known for both its physical prowess and predatory instincts. It boasts an impressive speed and the ability to attack swiftly, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With a challenge rating of 1, it is adequate for early encounters but possesses strong abilities, allowing it to coordinate effectively with allies. The lion's strengths lie in its potent melee attacks and its bonus from pack tactics, which enhances its effectiveness when fighting alongside others. However, it has low hit points and is susceptible to various forms of attacks, making it moderately vulnerable despite its offensive capabilities.

The lion has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average, providing standard protection in combat situations. It has a total of 30 hit points derived from rolling 4d10 plus an additional 8 points, representing average durability for a creature of its challenge rating. Its speed is notable, allowing it to cover 50 feet in a single movement, making it very mobile on the battlefield.

The lion's ability scores reflect its physical nature. It has a Strength score of 16, granting it a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee attacks, and a Dexterity score of 14, yielding a +2 modifier, which is good for acrobatics and stealth checks. The Constitution score is also 14, providing a +2 modifier that is good for maintaining health and resisting effects. However, the lion's Intelligence is quite low at 3, resulting in a -4 modifier, which is very bad for mental challenges. Wisdom is more favorable with a score of 12, leading to a +1 modifier that is average in sensing dangers, and its Charisma is particularly low at 4, providing a -3 modifier that is also very bad for social interactions.

The lion has proficiency in Perception and Stealth, with relevant bonuses of +3 and +4, respectively. Its passive perception is calculated at 13, allowing it to notice hidden creatures most of the time. 

The special abilities of the lion enhance its effectiveness in various contexts. The Keen Smell ability provides the lion with advantage on Perception checks that rely on its sense of smell, making it very good at tracking or locating hidden foes. The Long Jump ability permits the lion to leap up to 25 feet, giving it exceptional mobility in and out of combat. The Pack Tactics ability grants the lion advantage on attack rolls against any creature that has an ally within 5 feet of it, effectively increasing its chances of successfully landing hits when working with companions.

In terms of actions, the lion can make two types of melee attacks: Claws and Bite. The Claws attack allows the lion to strike with a +5 to hit and inflicts 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage. If the lion has moved at least 20 feet straight towards a target before using this attack, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or fall prone, potentially creating a significant tactical advantage. The Bite attack is similarly potent, with the same +5 to hit modifier but dealing 8 (1d10+3) piercing damage.

As a bonus action, the lion can utilize its Opportune Bite ability to attack any creature that is prone, showcasing its opportunistic nature and ability to capitalize on favorable conditions in battle. This ability further reinforces the lion's effectiveness in combat, particularly when engaging weakened or disadvantaged foes.
