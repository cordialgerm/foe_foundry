Among its abilities, the Ashen Custodian employs unique traits that enhance its strategic approach in combat. The Fire Controller ability allows it to manipulate fires within a 5-foot cube at a distance of 30 feet as a bonus action, which can control the battlefield effectively by creating or extinguishing flames. If it interacts with a fire elemental, it can grant advantage or disadvantage on its attack rolls.

Using its Forest Cleanser ability, when the Ashen Custodian successfully hits a plant or plant creature with its Cleansing Strike, it inflicts an additional 2d8 fire damage, making it particularly dangerous against plant-based adversaries. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it difficult to incapacitate through magic.

The Warming Presence ability inflicts fire damage on hostile creatures that begin their turn within 10 feet of the Ashen Custodian if they fail a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Additionally, it provides a healing benefit to friendly creatures nearby when they regain hit points, granting them an extra 1d6 healing.

In combat, it can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Cleansing Strike attacks in one turn.

If the target is flammable, it will ignite and suffer additional fire damage until the flames are extinguished.

The Ashen Custodian's spellcasting capabilities are driven by its innate spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 15 based on its Charisma. It can cast certain spells at will, including druidcraft and produce flame, and more powerful spells like burning hands, cure wounds, flame blade, and fog cloud three times per day each, making it versatile in both offense and support roles. Additionally, it can summon a fire elemental and create a wall of fire once per day, significantly impacting the battlefield dynamics.
