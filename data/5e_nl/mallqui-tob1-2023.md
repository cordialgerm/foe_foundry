The Mallqui is a Medium undead creature characterized by its lawful neutral alignment. This being excels in both offense and defense, boasting a solid Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of hit points at 120, making it quite durable in combat. The creature's challenge rating of 8 means that it presents a significant threat to parties of adventurers, providing a balance of necrotic damage and debilitating abilities that can weaken opponents. Its impressive Wisdom score allows it to excel in Insight checks, further enhancing its role as a dangerous and cunning adversary. However, it is notably vulnerable to radiant damage, which can negate its regenerative abilities, making it crucial for players to exploit this weakness during encounters. 

The Mallqui has the following attributes: Strength of 16, which grants a modifier of +3 and indicates a good level of physical power; Dexterity of 9, rated as bad, reflecting its poor agility; Constitution of 16, allowing for a good resilience; Intelligence of 11 for an average intellect; Wisdom of 18, yielding an exceptional modifier of +4 for perception and insight checks; and Charisma of 14, giving a good +2 modifier that enhances its ability to affect or interact with others. In combat, it has saving throw bonuses of +3 in Intelligence and +5 in Charisma, indicating good capabilities to resist mental effects and manipulate others. Additionally, it is immune to necrotic and poison damage, while also resistant to cold and lightning, as well as nonmagical physical attacks. The Mallqui cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned, making it a formidable foe. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 14, allowing it to perceive its surroundings even in darkness.

Among its special abilities, the Mallqui has Regeneration, which allows it to heal 10 hit points at the start of its turn unless it has taken radiant damage recently. This ability makes it exceptionally resilient, as it can withstand prolonged combat unless radiant damage is a consistent threat. Its Undead Nature means it does not require basic biological needs like air, food, or sleep, enhancing its endurance in extended encounters. However, the Mallqui is hypersusceptible to water, suffering radiant damage for both movement in water and for being submerged, presenting a tactical point for adventurers to exploit.

The Mallqui can perform several actions during its turn. Its primary attack, Xeric Blast, is a spell attack that can target creatures within 5 feet in melee or up to 60 feet away. It has a +7 bonus to hit, and a successful strike inflicts 18 points of necrotic damage, representing a significant threat to targets. The Xeric Aura ability affects all creatures within a 20-foot radius and forces them to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the creature suffering one level of exhaustion, a debuff that can severely hinder combat effectiveness, while success grants immunity to this aura for the next 24 hours. 

Additionally, the Mallqui can cast spells, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 15, allowing it to exert further control in combat. It can use the druidcraft cantrip at will, while also possessing three daily uses each of create or destroy water and entangle, alongside one daily use of locate animals or plants and wind wall. Each of these spells provides various effects, from controlling the battlefield with entangle to manipulating water elements for defensive or offensive purposes, showcasing the Mallqui's versatile threat in any encounter.
