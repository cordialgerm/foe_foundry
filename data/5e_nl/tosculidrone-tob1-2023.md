While its challenge rating is relatively low at 1/2, it can become more formidable when paired with other Tosculi or when leveraging its unique abilities.

In terms of special abilities, the Tosculi Drone has several noteworthy skills that enhance its combat capabilities. The ability called **Crowd Tactics** allows the creature to share its space with up to one other Tosculi, providing it advantage on attack rolls against an enemy when not incapacitated. This feature promotes teamwork and can significantly increase the effectiveness of its attacks. The **Glide** ability enables the Tosculi Drone to slow its descent while falling, allowing it to take no falling damage and move horizontally corresponding to its vertical drop. This ability can be used strategically in combat, facilitating evasive maneuvers or surprise attacks from above. Lastly, **Hive Sense** allows the Tosculi to identify the location of its hive queen within 300 feet, reinforcing its loyalty to the hive structure and its role within it.

When engaging in combat, the Tosculi Drone can utilize its **Claw** action, making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. On a successful strike, it deals 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage to a target. This action provides a significant offensive capability, particularly when combined with its special abilities to create tactical advantages in encounters.
