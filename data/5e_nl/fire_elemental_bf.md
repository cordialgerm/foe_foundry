The Fire Elemental is a formidable entity that embodies the raw and destructive power of fire. As a large elemental creature, it functions effectively in combat scenarios, utilizing both melee and ranged attacks to deal high amounts of fire damage. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, particularly as it exhibits various resistances and immunities that make it difficult to overcome. Its ability to blend with flames allows it to approach foes stealthily, while its fiery manifestations contribute to an aggressive and dangerous presence on the battlefield. However, the Fire Elemental is vulnerable to water, suffering damage when exposed, which can be leveraged by clever players to gain the upper hand.

The Fire Elemental has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average for a creature of its Challenge Rating, and it possesses 110 hit points, indicating good durability. Its speed is notable at 50 feet, allowing it to maneuver quickly around the battle. The creature has the following ability scores: Strength +0 (very bad), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +3 (good), Intelligence -2 (very bad), Wisdom +0 (average), and Charisma -2 (very bad). Its darkvision of 60 feet allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a Perception score of 10, which is average.

One of its key special abilities is "Elemental Nature," which means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, giving it high endurance in prolonged engagements. Additionally, "Elemental Resilience" grants it resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks while immunizing it against poison damage and several debilitating conditions, making it very difficult to disable. The "Fire Camouflage" ability enhances its Stealth score to 18 when in a Medium or larger fire, allowing it to hide effectively in combat.

The "Fire Form" ability allows the Fire Elemental to move through spaces as narrow as one inch wide without any hindrance. When a creature comes into contact with it, or if it is attacked in melee while near, that creature receives 5 (1d10) fire damage. Furthermore, upon entering a creature's space, it can potentially set that creature on fire, causing ongoing damage until the fire is extinguished. The "Illumination" ability enables the Fire Elemental to emit bright light within a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, giving it a significant influence on the battlefield's visibility. However, it also suffers from "Water Susceptibility," taking one cold damage for every 5 feet it moves in water or when splashed with one gallon of water.

In terms of combat actions, the Fire Elemental can utilize a "Multiattack" to make two melee or ranged attacks on its turn. Its "Fiery Touch" melee attack benefits from a +6 to hit and can deal an average of 12 (2d8 + 3) fire damage. If successful, the target will ignite and take additional fire damage on its turns until extinguished. Alternatively, its "Spit Fire" ranged attack also has a +6 to hit and deals even more damage at 16 (3d8 + 3) fire damage, making it a powerful ranged option.

As a bonus action, the Fire Elemental can use "Fiery Dash" (which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6), allowing it to move 20 feet in a straight line while igniting spaces it passes through. Any creature entering these fiery spaces must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking damage, adding an additional layer of threat to its mobility. Overall, the Fire Elemental serves as a destructive force in any confrontation, wielding its fire abilities to devastating effect.
