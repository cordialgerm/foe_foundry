The Basilisk is a medium-sized monstrosity, known for its terrifying ability to petrify its foes with its gaze. This creature poses a significant threat in combat due to its ability to deal considerable poison damage and its petrifying capabilities, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 15, it has a decent defensive capacity, while its 68 hit points provide it with a moderate level of durability for a creature of its challenge rating of 3. However, its speed is quite slow at only 20 feet per round, which can limit its mobility in battles. Overall, the Basilisk is a dangerous adversary, particularly when engaged in close quarters where it can utilize its special abilities and attacks effectively.  

In terms of attributes, the Basilisk has a Strength score of 13, granting it a good modifier of +3, which reflects its physical power. Its Dexterity is notably lower at 9, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, meaning it is not particularly agile. The Constitution score of 14 gives it a good modifier of +2, enhancing its ability to withstand damage. However, the creature has very poor scores in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, with modifiers of -4, -1, and -2 respectively, making it ineffective in skill checks that rely on these attributes. The Basilisk has darkvision that allows it to see in low-light conditions up to 60 feet, but its perception and stealth scores are mediocre, both sitting at a modest value of 9.

The Basilisk has special abilities that enhance its survivability in combat. Its Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it harder to incapacitate. The Petrifying Gaze is its most dangerous ability, allowing it to target creatures within 30 feet. If a creature can see the Basilisk's eyes, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become restrained as it begins to turn to stone. It can attempt to escape this petrification by repeating the saving throw at the end of its turn, but failure results in it becoming fully petrified until released by the spell greater restoration or other magic.

The Basilisk can employ actions during combat, including a Multiattack option, where it can make two Bite or Poison Spit attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and causes 7 piercing damage along with 7 poison damage on a hit. The Poison Spit is a ranged weapon attack with the same +5 to hit, effective at a range of 20 feet normal and 60 feet at disadvantage, and deals 13 poison damage. If both attacks successfully hit a single target, that creature is poisoned until the end of its next turn, adding to the Basilisk's threat level.
