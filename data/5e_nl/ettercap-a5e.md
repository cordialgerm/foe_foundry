The Ettercap is a Medium Monstrosity that embodies a terrifying combination of spider-like features and predatory instincts. Its role in combat is primarily as a physical attacker with control capabilities, thanks to its various abilities and attacks. With an Armor Class of 13, it has moderate defenses and a total of 44 hit points, translating to an average resilience in encounters. The Ettercap excels at stealth and survival, bolstered by a Dexterity score of 16 (+3), making it good at avoiding detection and enabling it to ambush foes. However, its low Intelligence score of 8 (-1) limits its strategic options and problem-solving capabilities. Overall, the Ettercap's strengths lie in its maneuverability, stealthy approach, and ability to restrain enemies, while its weaknesses include its average defensive capabilities and limited cognitive resourcefulness in combat situations.

The Ettercap has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 13 (+1), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 8 (-1). The Dexterity saving throw is particularly potent at +5, classifying it as good in defensive actions against effects that target this attribute. Skills such as Perception (+3), Stealth (+5), and Survival (+3) further enhance its effectiveness when navigating its environment or engaging in tactical combat scenarios.

In terms of senses, the Ettercap has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and it possesses a passive Perception of 13, which is average for detecting hidden foes. It can communicate through its special ability, Speak with Spiders, facilitating interaction with spiders in the vicinity. Furthermore, its Spider Climb ability grants it exceptional climbing capabilities, allowing it to traverse difficult or vertical surfaces effortlessly. The Web Sense ability enhances its situational awareness, as it can pinpoint any creatures in contact with webs directly. Lastly, Web Walker negates any movement limitations posed by webs, ensuring it can operate freely in environments with webs present.

For actions, the Ettercap can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make both a bite attack and a claw attack in one turn. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 5 piercing damage along with an additional 3 poison damage on a hit, making it a solid offensive choice. Its Claws attack also has a +5 to hit, deals 8 slashing damage, and is effective against foes in close proximity. The Strangle ability is particularly dangerous, as it provides the Ettercap with a grappling option against Medium or smaller creatures, dealing 7 bludgeoning damage and restricting the target's ability to breathe.

As a bonus action, the Ettercap has access to the Web ability, which requires a recharge of 5-6. This ranged weapon attack targets one Large or smaller creature, and upon hitting, it restrains the target in webs. Creatures caught can attempt to break free by making a DC 11 Strength check as an action. The webs themselves have an Armor Class of 10, 1 hit point, and are immune to all damage except for slashing, fire, and force, allowing for strategic interplay in combat situations involving terrain manipulation.
