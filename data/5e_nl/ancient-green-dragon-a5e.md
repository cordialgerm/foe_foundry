The Ancient Green Dragon is a gargantuan creature renowned for its cunning intelligence, overwhelming strength, and magical prowess. With an impressive Armor Class of 21 and a staggering 420 hit points, it is a formidable opponent in combat, capable of withstanding significant damage. The dragon's challenge rating is 24, indicating it offers a very high level of difficulty and presents a substantial challenge for adventurers, granting a substantial experience reward of 62,000 XP. Its impressive array of abilities allows it to control the battlefield through stealth, powerful attacks, and debilitating spells. However, despite its many strengths, its moderate Dexterity leaves it vulnerable to ranged attacks and some troop formations that require speed.

The Ancient Green Dragon's attributes are formidable: it has a Strength score of 26 (+8), indicating very good physical prowess; a Constitution score of 24 (+7), reflecting exceptional endurance; an Intelligence of 20 (+5), denoting good reasoning abilities; a Wisdom of 16 (+3), showcasing average perceptiveness; and an impressive Charisma of 28 (+9), which grants it exceptional influence over others. Its Dexterity is 12 (+1), which can be seen as average. The creature’s saving throw modifiers reflect its robust defenses, such as a +14 to Constitution (very good), and Charisma with a +11 (good), allowing it to resist many spells and effects.

This dragon possesses various special abilities that enhance its power in combat. It is amphibious, meaning it can breathe both air and water, allowing it strategic mobility. The Legendary Resistance, usable three times per day, lets it choose to succeed on saving throws, which is of exceptional value as it protects against debilitating spells. However, if the dragon exhausts this ability, its Armor Class is reduced to 19 until it rests, demonstrating a significant potential weakness. Woodland Stalker gives the dragon an advantage on Stealth checks within forested areas and enables it to speak while remaining hidden, making it a master of ambush attacks. Blood Toxicity can be particularly punishing; when a creature attacks it in melee while bloodied, it must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or suffer poison damage, adding a layer of threat to close-range combat.

The Ancient Green Dragon's innate spellcasting abilities are noteworthy, with a spellcasting ability based on Charisma and a save DC of 19. It can cast spells like Animal Messenger, allowing it to communicate over distances; Tongues, enabling it to speak and understand any language; and Modify Memory, which could manipulate the recollections of others. The dragon can also cast Scrying to spy on distant creatures, with access to powerful spells like Mass Suggestion and Telepathic Bond once per day, making it a potent manipulator in social interactions and strategic planning.

In combat, the dragon executes a Multiattack action that includes a bite and two claws, or it may opt to use Spit Poison instead of the bite. The bite attack has a +15 to hit with a significant damage output of 30 piercing damage plus 9 poison damage. The claws deal 21 slashing damage each, while the tail attack can push its target away, providing battlefield control. When using Spit Poison, the dragon targets a creature forcing it to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in 22 poison damage and potential poisoning for one minute, which can severely impair the creature's combat effectiveness.

The Poison Breath ability allows the dragon to unleash a devastating 90-foot cone of poisonous gas, requiring creatures in that area to succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take massive poison damage. Interestingly, even creatures that typically resist poison take half damage, making it an exceptional area-of-effect attack. 

The Honeyed Words ability can turn allies against one another, forcing a creature within 60 feet to attack a target of the dragon's choice. This ability relies on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. Affected creatures must use their reactions to carry out the attack if possible, which could lead to chaos among the party. Finally, the Ancient Green Dragon also has a Tail Attack reaction available when hit by melee attacks, allowing it to counterattack effectively.

Through legendary actions, the dragon can utilize its powerful abilities such as Honeyed Words, instilling doubt in its opponents. The Roar can frighten creatures within a substantial range, further manipulating the battlefield by causing enemies to flee or freeze in fear. The Wing Attack allows it to push back foes, positioning itself while also knocking them prone, showcasing its formidable combat versatility and control over the environment. Overall, the Ancient Green Dragon is an exceptional, cunning predator with numerous abilities that affect both its offensive capabilities and its tactical options in battle.
