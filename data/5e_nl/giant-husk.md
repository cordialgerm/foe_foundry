The Giant Husk is a formidable undead creature characterized by its chaotic evil nature and large size. With a significant pool of hit points and decent armor class, it can absorb considerable damage before being taken down. It thrives in melee combat, utilizing its physical strength and unique abilities to restrain and damage its opponents. However, its low dexterity leaves it vulnerable to dexterity-based attacks and ranged assaults. The Giant Husk excels at grappling and inflicting ongoing damage, making it a serious threat in close quarters. Its challenge rating of 7 indicates that it can pose a substantial challenge to parties of lower level, and its unique abilities make it versatile in combat situations.

The Giant Husk has an armor class of 9, which is considered very bad, making it quite easy for attackers to hit. It possesses a total of 76 hit points, calculated as 8d12+24, indicating it has good durability in battle, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of punishment. The creature has a walking speed of 40 feet, enabling it to move sufficiently across the battlefield. 

In terms of ability scores, the Giant Husk has a Strength of 19, translating to a modifier of +4, which is exceptional and allows for powerful melee attacks. Its Dexterity is low at 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, making its defensive capabilities weak. The Constitution score of 16 grants it a +3 modifier, which is good, providing additional hit points and resistance to effects that rely on Constitution saving throws. Both Intelligence and Charisma are very low at 5, resulting in -3 modifiers, leading to very bad performance in any tasks requiring these attributes. Wisdom is also poor at 7, with a -2 modifier, indicating bad perception and insight.

This creature possesses certain immunities that enhance its survivability: it is immune to poison damage and can never be poisoned. Its darkvision allows it to see clearly in darkness up to 60 feet, and its passive perception is measured at 8, classified as average, indicating a reasonable awareness of its surroundings. The Giant Husk understands all languages it knew during its life, though it cannot communicate verbally.

The Giant Husk has several notable special abilities. The Amorphous ability allows it to squeeze through spaces that may not normally accommodate its size, giving it an advantage in positioning. The Damage Transfer ability means that any damage it would take can be split evenly among creatures it grapples, which can be a strategic advantage in limiting the damage it receives from attacks.

In combat, the Giant Husk can utilize the Multiattack feature, allowing it to make two attacks during its turn, thereby significantly increasing its damage output. One of its primary attacks is called Smother, which is a melee weapon attack that requires a roll of +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit against a Huge or smaller creature, it grapples the target, necessitating an escape DC of 14. While grappling, the target is restrained, blinded, and faces the risk of suffocating. Additionally, at the start of each of the target's turns, it takes 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, making this attack not only debilitating but also a serious long-term threat to the target's survivability. The Giant Husk can manage to smother varying amounts of creatures at once: one Huge, two Large, or up to four Medium or smaller creatures, demonstrating its ability to control multiple opponents in combat effectively.
