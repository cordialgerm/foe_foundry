The Duffel Crab is a formidable Large monstrosity that resides in aquatic environments. Known for its exceptional ability to manipulate extradimensional spaces, this creature serves as both a predator and a complex trap. It can hold multiple creatures within its unique "shell," allowing it to capture its prey efficiently. With strong physical attributes, particularly in strength and constitution, the Duffel Crab poses a significant threat in combat, especially to those who find themselves within its grasp. Though it has some weaknesses, such as low intelligence and charisma, its ability to incapacitate foes by trapping them makes it a challenging encounter for adventurers.

The Duffel Crab has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good, providing it a solid defense against attacks. It has 60 hit points, calculated as 8d8 plus 24, making its durability very good in combat. The creature moves at a speed of 30 feet on land and can swim at 30 feet, granting it average mobility. It is classified as having a Challenge Rating of 3, which indicates that it is a moderately difficult foe for an adventuring party, granting 700 experience points upon defeat.

The creature's attributes are as follows: Strength 16 (+3) gives it a strong melee capability with attack rolls, making it very good offensively. It has Dexterity 12 (+1), which contributes to its initiative and Armor Class, representing average agility. Constitution is also 16 (+3), which aids its overall hit points, making it very good in terms of resilience. The Intelligence of 2 (-4) is very bad, indicating a lack of cognitive abilities. Wisdom is 12 (+1), providing a good passive insight, while Charisma is 7 (-2), which is very bad for social interactions.

In terms of skills, it has a perception score of +1, which is average. The crab possesses blindsight up to 30 feet, enabling it to sense its surroundings without relying on sight, making its awareness very good within that range. It does not have any known languages, meaning it cannot communicate verbally.

The Duffel Crab has an intriguing special ability called "Extradimensional Bag." This power allows it to use spaces like a bag of holding as its shell, capable of holding creatures along with it. These creatures can survive inside the bag for a limited time, which is determined by the number of creatures present. If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it will be destroyed, but due to the crab's unique existence, it prevents the contents from being lost in the Astral Plane. Instead, when the crab dies or the bag breaks, the items and creatures simply spill out into the surrounding area. After the crab's death, the bag reverts to a standard bag of holding 24 hours later.

Another special ability is "False Appearance," allowing the crab to remain motionless and appear as an ordinary bag with an open lid, making it difficult for keen observers to differentiate it from a regular object.

In combat, the Duffel Crab can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike with two claws or use one claw and perform its "Collect" action. The claw attack has a +5 to hit and inflicts 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. Additionally, a successful hit grapples the target, which triggers a contest against an escape DC of 13. Until the grapple ends, the target is considered restrained, meaning it cannot move freely and can only interact with its environment in limited ways.

The "Collect" action is particularly dangerous, as it allows the crab to place a grappled target into its extradimensional space, rendering the victim blinded and restrained, offering total cover against external attacks. Trapped creatures can attempt to escape by making a successful Strength or Dexterity check against a DC of 13. If the crab dies while a creature is inside, the creature can use 5 feet of movement to exit the bag, but they will be prone when they do so.
