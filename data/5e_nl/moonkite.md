The Moonkite is a formidable celestial creature that embodies goodness and light. With its large stature and impressive abilities, it serves as a protector and a guide for those in need. It possesses high mobility with a flying speed of 120 feet, making it an agile combatant and an effective ally in tight situations. While its natural armor grants it a fair amount of protection, its true strengths lie in its special abilities and damage immunities. The Moonkite is immune to poison and resistant to fire and radiant damage, which are common in magical encounters. Additionally, its condition immunities make it an exceptional fighter, unable to be hindered by conventional means like exhaustion or fright. However, while it is strong in combat, it does not excel in traditional melee attacks.

The attributes of the Moonkite are as follows: it has a Strength score of 15 (+2), Dexterity of 18 (+4) which is very good, Constitution of 16 (+3) which is also good, Intelligence of 14 (+2) which is average, Wisdom of 16 (+3) which is good, and Charisma of 19 (+4) which is very good. For saving throws, it has a Wisdom modifier of +6 and a Charisma modifier of +7, which suggest it is very effective at resisting charm and mind-affecting effects. The Moonkite has skills in insight (+6), perception (+6), and religion (+5), indicating its deep understanding of celestial matters and its acute awareness of its surroundings.

The Moonkite has several special abilities that enhance its capabilities in various contexts. "Celestial Freedom" allows it to ignore difficult terrain and escape grapples or nonmagical restraints easily, needing only to expend 5 feet of movement for such escapes. This ability also grants it advantage on saving throws against spells that would banish or bind it. The "Flyby" ability enables the Moonkite to move away from enemies without provoking opportunity attacks, avoiding risks when engaging or retreating. "Magic Resistance" offers the Moonkite an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its resilience. Additionally, the Moonkite's attacks are magical and silvered, allowing it to bypass the defenses of many creatures.

In combat, the Moonkite can perform a "Multiattack," which allows it to unleash four wing buffet attacks, or it can opt for two "Radiant Arrow" attacks. The "Radiant Arrow" is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit, dealing 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a successful hit, which can significantly impact foes vulnerable to radiant damage. The "Wing Buffet" is a melee weapon attack also with a +7 to hit, dealing 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the Moonkite scores a critical hit with the Wing Buffet, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute, which presents a substantial tactical advantage in combat. Lastly, the "Planar Traveler" ability allows the Moonkite to teleport itself and a willing rider to a different plane of existence, functioning like the plane shift spell but limited to only itself and a willing companion. This ability is invaluable for strategic escapes or tactical repositioning during encounters.
