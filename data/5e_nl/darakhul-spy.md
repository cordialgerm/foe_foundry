The Darakhul Spy is a formidable Medium undead creature characterized by its devious and stealthy nature. As a neutral evil being, it excels in subterfuge and manipulation, making it particularly dangerous in social situations and combat alike. With an impressive Armor Class of 16, it can withstand significant damage, supported by a robust pool of 91 hit points derived from 14d8+28. The Darakhul Spy moves quietly, with a walking speed of 30 feet, and is rated with a Challenge Rating of 5, indicating that it poses a serious threat to adventurers, providing 1,800 experience points upon defeat. 

The Darakhul Spy possesses several attributes that highlight its strengths. It has a Strength score of 16, translating to a modifier of +3, which is considered good for grappling and melee attacks. Its Dexterity of 18 gives it a +4 modifier, allowing it to excel in stealth and ranged attacks, enhancing its capacity for evasion. With a Constitution of 14 (+2), it maintains average resilience, while its Intelligence and Charisma both sit at 14 (+2), indicating a good level of cunning and social manipulation. The Wisdom score of 12 (+1) denotes an average ability to notice details and perceive threats. 

In terms of skills, the Darakhul Spy excels in Deception (+5), Stealth (+7), and has proficiency in related survival checks, making it exceptionally skilled in avoiding detection and manipulating situations to its advantage. It is immune to poison damage, suffers from necrotic resistance, and is never charmed or exhausted, giving it a significant edge in prolonged encounters. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and speaks both Common and Darakhul languages, allowing it to communicate and see in dark environments effectively.

The special abilities of the Darakhul Spy further enhance its capabilities. With Evasion, it avoids damage from effects that allow a Dexterity saving throw on a success, which can turn an otherwise harmful situation into a safe one. The Master of Disguise ability grants it advantage on Deception checks when disguised as a living creature, though it sacrifices its Stench ability while doing so. The Sneak Attack ability allows it to deal an additional 7 (2d6) damage on certain attack conditions, emphasizing its role as a predator in combat. 

Stench affects its environment, forcing creatures within 5 feet to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer being poisoned, disrupting enemy tactics. Sunlight Sensitivity adversely affects its combat effectiveness under sunlight, hampering its ability to attack and perceive threats visually. Lastly, Turning Defiance provides advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, making it a resilient presence in combat against clerics and other summoners.

In combat, the Darakhul Spy can execute a Multiattack, launching three separate attacks: one Bite, one Claw, and one Shortsword strike. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit with the potential to inflict 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is humanoid, it may also risk contracting darakhul fever unless it succeeds on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The Claw attack, similarly modified to hit, can inflict 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, and may paralyze non-undead targets on a failed saving throw. The Shortsword and ranged Light Crossbow attacks, both also scoring +7 to hit, deal 7 (1d6 + 4) and 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage respectively, rounding out its approach to both melee and ranged confrontation effectively. 

Overall, the Darakhul Spy stands as a lethal blend of stealth, deception, and combat prowess, positioning it as a significant threat in varied encounters.
