This creature serves both as a formidable combatant and a master of deception, capable of using its environment to its advantage. With a high Armor Class of 21 and substantial hit points totaling 367, it is tough to bring down. This dragon boasts a Challenge Rating of 23, indicating its potential to be a significant threat in any encounter, awarded 50,000 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths lie in its high Constitution, Charisma, and Strength scores, which enhance its melee attacks and magic usage. However, with average Dexterity and Wisdom, the dragon shows some vulnerabilities in terms of speed and perception, making stealth and maneuverability more challenging.

The Ancient Copper Dragon has immunity to acid damage, enhancing its durability in battles featuring such attacks. Its senses include blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision within 120 feet, complemented by a high passive perception score of 23. Communicating in Common, Draconic, and three additional languages, the dragon possesses good versatility in interactions.

Among its notable abilities, "Flow Within the Mountain" grants the dragon advantage on Stealth checks while hiding in mountainous areas and allows it to merge with stone, providing unique ways to surprise or evade enemies. The "Legendary Resistance" ability, usable three times per day, allows the dragon to treat failed saving throws as successes, with a drawback of reducing its Armor Class to 19 after these uses—this underscores the dragon's resilience. 

The dragon's innate spellcasting ability uses Charisma with a save DC of 19, allowing it to cast spells without the need for material components. It can cast "Hideous Laughter," which incapacitates a creature with laughter; "Suggestion," enabling it to influence a target's actions; "Mislead," creating an illusory double to confuse foes; and "Polymorph," allowing for transformation into other beings. Once per day, it can use "Irresistible Dance," forcing a target into a whimsical dance that limits their actions, and "Mass Suggestion," giving it significant control over multiple creatures.

In combat, the Ancient Copper Dragon can utilize its "Multiattack" feature to make three attacks: one bite and two claw strikes, or substitute the bite with the "Acid Spit." The bite deals 30 piercing damage plus an additional 9 acid damage on a successful hit, making it a formidable melee attack. The claws inflict 21 slashing damage, while the tail can deal the same amount and push an enemy back 10 feet. When in humanoid form, it can use a war pick dealing 12 piercing damage.

The "Acid Spit" attack targets a creature within 60 feet, requiring a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. If failed, the target takes 22 acid damage and suffers 11 ongoing acid damage unless they use an action to end the effect. The dragon's "Breath Weapons," usable every 5 to 6 turns, can either unleash a potent Acid Breath in a line or a Slowing Breath in a cone, impacting multiple foes and controlling the battlefield.

As a legendary creature, the dragon has access to three legendary actions, allowing for additional actions during other creatures' turns. With the "Roar," it can frighten opponents within range, imposing a significant psychological effect. The "Wing Attack" allows it to push back and knock down foes while taking flight. The "Tricksters Gambit" lets the dragon teleport and create illusory duplicates, adding a layer of complexity to battles and making it difficult for enemies to effectively target or predict its actions. The Ancient Copper Dragon combines cunning strategy with raw power, making it a memorable and formidable adversary in any campaign.
