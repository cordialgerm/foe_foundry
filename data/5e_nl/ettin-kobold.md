The Kobold Ettin is a medium-sized giant with a chaotic and mischievous nature, characterized by its two heads that engage in constant bickering. As a creature of lawful evil alignment, it embodies a unique combination of giant strength and kobold cunning. This creature has a solid foundation in melee combat, boasting decent hit points and strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution. However, its intelligence and charisma are notably low, making it less effective in social interactions and strategic planning. The Kobold Ettin excels in situations where it can leverage its size and combat abilities, especially when supported by allies, but it suffers significantly in bright light due to its sunlight sensitivity, which hinders its accuracy and perception.

The Kobold Ettin has an Armor Class of 12, which is average for a creature of its challenge rating. It possesses 34 hit points, calculated as 4d8+16, providing it with good durability in battle. The creature has a movement speed of 30 feet, allowing it to traverse the battlefield effectively.

The Kobold Ettin's ability scores are as follows: Strength 17 (+3, which is very good), Dexterity 11 (+0, which is average), Constitution 18 (+4, which is exceptional), Intelligence 6 (-2, which is very bad), Wisdom 8 (-1, which is bad), and Charisma 7 (-2, which is very bad). The creature has a skill in perception with a modifier of -1, reflecting its poor wisdom. It has darkvision that allows it to see 60 feet in darkness as if it were dim light, and a passive perception score of 9, which is average.

Special abilities enhance the Kobold Ettin’s effectiveness in combat. The Bickering Heads feature creates a situation in which it has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, while gaining advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, allowing it to be more aware of its surroundings despite its noise. Additionally, it holds advantage against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious, showcasing its resilience. The Might of Giants trait means that it classifies as a large giant when determining carrying capacity, benefitting from the strength associated with its giant heritage. The Pack Tactics ability grants the Ettin advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one ally is within 5 feet of the target, making it formidable in cooperative encounters. Lastly, the Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve sight when in sunlight, presenting a significant challenge for the creature when exposed to bright conditions.

In terms of actions, the Kobold Ettin can make two attacks per turn using a Multiattack feature. It may use either a Greatclub or a Spear for these strikes. The Greatclub has a +5 to hit and deals 7 (1d8+3) bludgeoning damage on a hit, while the Spear has the same attack bonus and can be used in melee or ranged forms. In melee mode, a two-handed attack with the spear deals 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage, while a one-handed melee attack deals 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage, and when thrown, it deals 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage with a range of 20 feet for normal range and 60 feet for long range.

The Kobold Ettin also has a special action called Echoing Burps which can be used after a recharge period of 5 to 6 rounds. This attack sends forth smelly belches in a 15-foot cone, dealing 10 (4d4) thunder damage to all creatures within the area. Creatures must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to take half damage and avoid being incapacitated until the end of their next turn, making this an effective area control ability that can hinder multiple foes at once.
