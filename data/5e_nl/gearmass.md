The Gearmass is a large ooze creature that serves as both a formidable adversary and a hazardous environmental obstacle in Dungeons & Dragons. With a challenge rating of 5, it is designed to pose a significant threat to parties composed of low to mid-level adventurers. This creature excels in grappling opponents and inflicting continual damage through its engulf ability. Its main strengths lie in its high constitution and the corrosive effects it has on non-magical metal weapons, which can turn the tide of battle by damaging the adventurers' tools. However, its low dexterity makes it clumsy in stealth, and its intelligence is exceptionally poor, limiting its strategic thinking. With immunities to many common conditions and a unique ability to pass through tight spaces, it exemplifies the unpredictable dangers present in dungeon environments.

In terms of attributes, the Gearmass has a strength of 16, which equates to a good modifier of +3, indicating its capability for melee combat. Its dexterity is low at 5, representing a very bad modifier of -3, which detracts from its ability to move silently or dodge attacks. The creature's constitution is exceptionally high at 20, granting a +5 modifier, resulting in high hit points totaling 115. Its intelligence is very low at 1, with a -5 modifier, making it incapable of complex thinking. The wisdom score of 6 gives it a bad modifier of -2, while charisma remains ineffectual at 1, also with a -5 modifier. The Gearmass has proficiency in perception, adding a modest +2 to its perception checks, leading to a passive perception score of 8.

The Gearmass possesses several notable special abilities. Its "Amorphous" feature allows it to move through spaces as narrow as 1 foot, making it difficult to contain. The "Clanging Mass" ability causes it to produce noise as it moves, giving it disadvantage on stealth checks. It does not require sleep due to its "Ooze Nature" feature, allowing it to remain active indefinitely.

One of its most dangerous traits, "Rust Metal," inflicts ongoing damage to any non-magical metal weapon that strikes it, causing a permanent cumulative penalty of -1 to damage dealt by the weapon after it hits. If this penalty reaches -5, the weapon is destroyed. Also, any non-magical metal ammunition used against it is completely destroyed after making a successful attack.

When it comes to actions in combat, the Gearmass can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two Gear Slams or Cog Tosses in a turn. The Gear Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, capable of dealing an average of 12 bludgeoning damage. The Cog Toss is a ranged weapon attack that also has a +6 to hit and deals the same average damage; if the target fails a DC 14 Strength save, it gets knocked prone. If the Gearmass successfully grapples a creature with both Gear Slams, it can then use its "Engulf" ability. Engulfing a medium or smaller creature severely restricts its movement, rendering it blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe. The engulfed target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the beginning of each of the Gearmass's turns or suffer an average of 14 acid damage. Furthermore, non-magical ferrous metal items that the creature is wearing corrode over time, leading to significant reductions in AC for armor and shields or complete destruction for weapons. While engulfed, the victim moves wherever the Gearmass travels, complicating potential escape strategies.

In summary, the Gearmass is a formidable ooze that balances high durability, unique environmental hazards, and significant damage potential, making it a noteworthy foe in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign.
