The Witch Queen has a range of spells at her disposal, including:
- Cantrips such as acid splash, mage hand, message, and ray of frost which she can cast at will to deal damage or manipulate objects and communications.
- 1st level spells including burning hands, magic missile, and sleep, providing her with offensive capabilities and crowd control options.
- 2nd level spells like invisibility, spider climb, and suggestion, allowing her to evade attacks, traverse vertical surfaces, or influence the actions of others.
- 3rd level spells such as blink, fear, and lightning bolt, granting her powerful movement options, the ability to instill fear in opponents, and direct damage.
