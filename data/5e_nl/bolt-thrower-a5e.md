The Bolt-Thrower is a small construct designed for ranged combat, functioning effectively as a turret-like guardian on the battlefield. With an armor class of 14 and hit points totaling 44, it is moderately durable for its challenge rating of 2, making it a viable opponent for lower-level adventurers. The creature excels in dexterity, boasting a +3 modifier, which allows it to perform well in ranged attacks without suffering penalties from close combats due to its unique ability, Clockwork Sights. However, its strength is alarmingly low at -2, ranking it as very bad, making it ineffective in melee situations. Its low intelligence, wisdom, and charisma also limit its ability to engage in complex interactions or tactics. Still, thanks to its damage immunities to poison and psychic, as well as several condition immunities, the Bolt-Thrower is a reliable and resilient foe.

The attributes of the Bolt-Thrower are as follows: Strength is 6 with a -2 modifier, making it very bad in physical confrontations. Dexterity is 16 with a +3 modifier, a good rating that significantly boosts its ranged attack efficacy. Constitution is 14 with a +2 modifier, providing an average resilience. Intelligence is 1 with a -5 modifier, which is very bad, reflecting its limited decision-making abilities. Wisdom is 6 with a -2 modifier, also very bad, indicating poor perception in situations that require insight. Finally, Charisma is 1 with a -5 modifier, marking it as very bad and ineffective in social encounters or interactions.

The Bolt-Thrower has a passive perception of 14, which is average, allowing it to notice threats in its vicinity effectively. Its ability called Clockwork Sights means that it does not suffer disadvantage when making ranged attacks against a target that is within 5 feet of a hostile creature, enabling it to maintain accuracy even in tight situations. Additionally, the Rooted ability allows it to anchor itself using a bonus action, limiting its movement to zero while granting it greater stability for firing its heavy crossbow. Detaching from a surface requires a successful DC 20 Strength check, which is a formidable challenge for most creatures.

During combat, the Bolt-Thrower can perform a Multiattack action, allowing it to strike once with each of its two crossbows. Its Light Crossbow attack has a +5 to hit and can target a range of 80 feet normally and up to 320 feet at disadvantage, inflicting 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage upon success. The Heavy Crossbow, similarly, has a +5 to hit and can reach targets within 100 feet normally and 400 feet at a disadvantage, dealing 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage. This combat flexibility allows the Bolt-Thrower to effectively engage from a distance while maintaining a formidable offense.
