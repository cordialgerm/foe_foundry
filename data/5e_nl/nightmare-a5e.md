The Nightmare is a Large Fiend known for its role as a fearsome steed and harbinger of dread. Typically associated with dark magic and evil entities, this creature possesses a range of strengths including high mobility with its flying speed, decent armor class, and formidable melee attacks. With 68 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, while its fire resistance adds to its durability against elemental attacks. However, the Nightmare is also limited by its challenge rating of 3, which indicates that it would be best suited for encounters with lower-level adventurers. It has a mix of physical and magical abilities that allow it to interact with both combat and exploration elements of the game effectively, making it a versatile opponent.

The Nightmare has the following attributes: Strength is 18 (+4), Dexterity is 14 (+2), Constitution is 16 (+3), Intelligence is 10 (+0), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 14 (+2). Its high Strength score indicates that it is exceptionally capable of dealing damage in melee combat, while its good Constitution allows for resilience in battle. The Dexterity score is average, contributing moderate effectiveness to initiatives and ranged attacks, and while its Intelligence is average, it doesnâ€™t pose as a strategic threat. The Wisdom score provides a little awareness, and the Charisma score indicates a good presence, fitting for a fiendish creature.

The Nightmare has several special abilities. The Evil aura it radiates signifies its malevolent nature, potentially affecting how characters perceive it. The Fiery Hooves ability allows the Nightmare to illuminate its surroundings, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet; moreover, it leaves charred hoofprints that can indicate its path. Its Fire Resistance ability provides an added strategic advantage by granting fire resistance to a rider, which can be particularly useful in fiery encounters.

In terms of actions, the Nightmare can perform a melee weapon attack using its Hooves. It has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. Upon a successful hit, it deals 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage. Notably, if the Nightmare moves at least 20 feet straight toward the target before the attack, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone, giving the Nightmare an operational advantage in controlling the battlefield. The Nightmare can also move through the space of a prone creature, allowing for fluid movement during combat.

Furthermore, the Nightmare has a special action known as Ethereal Shift, which can be used after a recharge period of 5-6. This ability allows the Nightmare and a rider to magically transition between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane, creating unique tactical opportunities for escape or repositioning during encounters. 

Overall, the Nightmare presents a blend of physical prowess and mystical abilities, making it an intriguing foe or ally in any D&D campaign.
