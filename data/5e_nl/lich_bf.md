The Lich is a powerful medium undead creature renowned for its immense magical capabilities and cunning intellect. With a Challenge Rating of 21, it serves as a formidable adversary, often found manipulating events from the shadows in its quest for knowledge and power. It boasts a high Armor Class of 17 and a significant pool of 314 hit points, making it a resilient opponent in combat. However, it relies heavily on its spells and abilities to control the battlefield rather than brute force. The Lich can concentrate on two spells simultaneously, allowing it to maintain pressure on both its foes and allies while performing dangerous maneuvers. Its defensive capabilities like Rejuvenation and Legendary Resistance enable it to regain vitality after defeat and survive potentially crippling circumstances. However, its reliance on spells and magical powers may leave it vulnerable during intense physical confrontations.

The Lich has the following attributes: Strength of +0 (very bad), Dexterity of +3 (average), Constitution of +10 (very good), Intelligence of +12 (exceptional), Wisdom of +9 (very good), and Charisma of +3 (average). These scores affect its power and abilities in various ways, particularly its intelligence, which governs its spellcasting.

The Lich possesses several special abilities. Its Arcane Mastery allows it to concentrate on two spells at once, which is exceptionally powerful for maintaining multiple magical effects simultaneously. It can use Legendary Resistance three times a day to automatically succeed on a saving throw it would otherwise fail, providing it an extraordinary level of resilience. Its Rejuvenation ability can bring the Lich back to life within 1d10 days if it possesses a phylactery, reinstating its full hit points and presence in the game. The Lich also enjoys Turn Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead, further solidifying its position as a terrifying undead entity. Importantly, the Lich has Undead Nature, meaning it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, and Undead Resilience grants it immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition.

In terms of actions, the Lich can perform a Multiattack, using its Lich’s Gaze and then making up to four Arcane Death Burst attacks or a combination of different attacks. Arcane Death Burst is a potent spell attack with a +12 to hit and delivers substantial force and necrotic damage upon a successful hit. The Death-Infused Rod is another melee weapon attack that can deal significant bludgeoning and necrotic damage while also offering a chance to paralyze a target, providing strategic control over the battlefield. The Lich’s Gaze can charm or frighten a target, making it a valuable tool for manipulating the actions of its enemies. 

Regarding spellcasting, the Lich can cast spells using its Intelligence with a spell save DC of 20. It can cast various spells at will, such as detect magic and disguise self, to assist in its schemes. Three times a day, it may cast charm, detect thoughts, dispel magic, invisibility (self only), and mirror image, all of which can influence encounters significantly. The Lich also has access to powerful spells that it can cast twice or once per day, including bestow curse, cloudkill, dimension door, greater hold, plane shift, power word stun, and wall of force, making it a quintessential spellcaster capable of affecting combat and diplomacy alike.

As a bonus action, the Lich can Levitate up to 20 feet vertically without needing to concentrate or maintain a duration, allowing it to adjust its position on the battlefield with ease. It also has the Absorb Spell reaction, letting it counter an enemy spell within a range of 60 feet and gain temporary hit points based on the level of the spell countered, enhancing its survivability and reflecting its deep mastery of arcane energies.

For legendary actions, the Lich can perform a Move action to reposition itself without provoking opportunity attacks, utilize spellcasting, or unleash a Disrupt Life ability that deals necrotic damage to nearby living creatures, simultaneously healing itself by an equivalent amount, which serves to further exemplify its dangerous presence.

Overall, the Lich stands as a powerful undead spellcaster with a variety of abilities that allow it to manipulate its enemies and maintain a commanding position in battle. Its unique mechanics and vast repertoire of spells make it a threat not easily dismissed in any adventurer's journey.
