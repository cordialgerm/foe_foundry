Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells, making it highly resilient to magical attacks.

The spells at the Whisperer's disposal allow it to manipulate situations to its advantage. It can cast spells at will such as alter self, detect magic, detect thoughts, disguise self, fear, identify, invisibility (self only), misty step, sleep, and suggestion. These spells provide it with versatility for both combat and social interactions. Three times per day, it can cast confusion, dimension door, disintegrate, dream, modify memory, plane shift, and teleport, allowing for powerful battlefield control, escape, or movement. Once per day, it can unleash catastrophic effects with spells like feeblemind, meteor swarm, mind blank, and weird, which can severely impede or devastate its foes.

In combat, the Whisperer employs a multiattack strategy, making two Grasp of the Void attacks. Each Grasp of the Void is a melee spell attack that has a +12 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, this attack inflicts 21 (6d6) force damage and forces the target to succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the stun on a success. This ability makes its melee engagements particularly threatening, as it can incapacitate opponents while dealing significant damage.
