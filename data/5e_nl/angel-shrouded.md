The Shrouded Angel is a powerful Medium celestial creature that embodies chaotic good ideals. With a challenge rating of 13, it boasts impressive combat capabilities alongside formidable defensive traits. The angel's armor class of 18 and its 161 hit points provide a strong base for both offense and survivability. Its mobility is enhanced by a walking speed of 40 feet and a flying speed of 60 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in battle. This creature is characterized by exceptionally high Dexterity and Constitution, making its physical attacks both reliable and potent, while its ability to resist numerous conditions grants it remarkable durability. However, despite its strengths, the Shrouded Angel possesses average Charisma, which may limit its interactions that rely on social finesse.

The Shrouded Angel has the following attributes: Strength 18 with a +4 modifier, Dexterity 20 with a +5 modifier, Constitution 20 with a +5 modifier, Intelligence 16 with a +3 modifier, Wisdom 22 with a +6 modifier, and Charisma 10 with a +0 modifier. Its strong saving throws include +9 for Strength, +1 for Dexterity, +1 for Wisdom, and +5 for Charisma. The angel also has perception as a skill with a +6 modifier, which is considered good. It resists damage from poison and radiant sources, as well as from nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. Moreover, it is immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, and poisoned, enhancing its resilience in battle. With sensory capabilities like blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, coupled with a passive perception score of 21, the Shrouded Angel can effectively monitor its surroundings. It speaks all languages and can communicate telepathically within a range of 120 feet.

The Shrouded Angel's special abilities include "Angelic Poison," allowing its weapon attacks to deal magical damage enhanced with radiant poison. This poison can affect creatures resistant or immune to poison, though they have an advantage on saving throws against it. The "Divine Awareness" ability gives the angel the insight to know when it hears a lie. With "Evasion," the angel takes no damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw against effects that allow such saves for half damage; it only suffers half damage if it fails. Its "Immortal Nature" means it does not require food, drink, or sleep, making it capable of constant vigilance. Additionally, "Magic Resistance" grants the angel advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

In terms of actions, the Shrouded Angel can make a multiattack, allowing it to perform three strikes using either "Justicar’s Blade" melee attacks or "Justicar’s Blast" ranged spell attacks. The "Justicar’s Blade" is a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit, targeting a single creature within 5 feet. It deals significant slashing damage of 13 (from 2d8 + 5) in addition to 14 poison damage (from 4d6). The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned, with the poisoned condition persisting until removed by magic, such as the lesser restoration spell. The "Justicar’s Blast" is a ranged spell attack that has a +11 to hit and targets a creature up to 120 feet away, dealing 24 radiant damage (4d8 + 6).

The Shrouded Angel also possesses spellcasting abilities with a Wisdom-based spell save DC of 19. It can cast spells without the need for material components at will, including "bane," "bless," and "locate creature." Three times per day, it can cast "invisibility" (on itself only), "healing word" (at level 5), and "nondetection."

As a reaction, the Shrouded Angel can use "Executioner's Judgment" on a creature that starts its turn poisoned by it. The angel demands the target to repent, which prompts a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails, its hit points are reduced to zero. If it succeeds, it takes 22 radiant damage (5d8). Should the target choose to repent, the angel can determine its next action, similar to the effects of the command spell. The actions include options such as "Draw Nigh" (approach), "Clasp Hands in Prayer" (drop items), "Seek Redemption" (flee), "Be Penitent" (grovel), or "In Stillness Hear the Truth" (halt). The angel can only use this reaction again after it has dealt poison damage to a poisoned target.
