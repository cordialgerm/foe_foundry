Known for its high Strength score of +6, it excels in melee combat, making its attacks particularly dangerous. Its weaknesses include average Dexterity and Constitution scores, which while decent, do not make it exceptionally agile or hard to kill.

The Bugbear Champion can perform several special actions in combat. Its "Brutal" ability allows it to deal an extra die of damage with melee weapons, effectively increasing its damage output significantly. During its turn, it can utilize the "Multiattack" feature to deliver multiple strikes, opting for either two Spiked Club attacks and one Shield Smash attack, or three Javelin attacks. The Spiked Club attack has a +6 to hit and reaches a target within 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 piercing damage on a hit. The Shield Smash also has a +6 to hit, dealing 9 bludgeoning damage, with the potential to knock the target prone if it fails a DC 14 Strength saving throw. For ranged options, the Javelin attack also has a +6 to hit, delivering 11 piercing damage in melee or 7 damage at range.

As a reaction, the Bugbear Champion has "Stubborn Attacker," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. If it misses an attack, it can convert that miss into a hit, thus increasing its reliability as an attacker and heightening the threat level during encounters. This combination of strong offensive capabilities and tactical reactions makes the Bugbear Champion a dangerous opponent on the battlefield.
