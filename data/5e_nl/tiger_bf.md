The Tiger is a formidable large beast that embodies ferocity and agility, often serving as a dangerous predator in its environment. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, leveraging its speed, stealth, and heightened senses to gain the upper hand in combat. It possesses a solid armor class of 12 and a decent pool of hit points, totaling 38, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being subdued. While it has a good strength modifier of +3, enabling it to deal significant damage in melee, its intelligence is very low, indicating a lack of complex thought or strategy. The Tiger's ability to knock foes prone and maintain pressure with bleeding effects make it a tactical threat that can disrupt enemy formations. However, its reliance on physical attacks and vulnerability to magic or ranged combatants can be seen as weaknesses.

The Tiger's attributes are as follows: it has a strength of +3 (good), dexterity of +2 (average), constitution of +2 (average), intelligence of -4 (very bad), wisdom of +1 (average), and charisma of -1 (bad). These stats define its combat effectiveness and interactions. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, and it possesses a good perception score of 13, enhancing its ability to detect hidden enemies. Additionally, with a stealth score of 16, the tiger can move quietly and ambush unsuspecting prey effectively.

One special ability of the Tiger is "Heightened Smell," which allows it to have a significantly improved perception score of 18 when relying on its sense of smell. This makes it particularly adept at finding creatures, making it a dangerous opponent in stealthy encounters. The "Pounce" ability grants the Tiger a tactical advantage in combat; if it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and successfully hits them with its claws attack, that target must make a strength saving throw (DC 13) or be knocked prone. Being prone allows the Tiger to make a bite attack as a bonus action, increasing its damage potential significantly.

The Tiger can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make both a Bite and a Claws attack in the same turn. If both of these attacks hit a single creature, the target must succeed on a constitution saving throw (DC 13) at the start of its next turn or suffer 5 (2d4) damage due to bleeding from the wounds. This emphasizes the Tiger’s role as a vicious combatant, striking multiple times and causing ongoing harm to its foes. 

The "Bite" attack is resolved as a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage upon hitting. The "Claws" attack also functions as a melee weapon attack, similarly with a +5 to hit and 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage on a successful strike. These attacks complement one another and showcase the Tiger’s dual threats in both grappling and cutting through its prey’s defenses.
