The Pech Lithlord is a small elemental creature characterized by its neutral good alignment. It serves as a protector of natural elements, particularly stone. With an armor class of 17 and 104 hit points, it exhibits good defensive capabilities. The creature has a challenge rating of 7, making it a moderately strong opponent for player characters, providing an experience of 2,900 XP upon defeat. It possesses notable strengths in its physical attacks and spellcasting, but its vulnerability to bright light reduces its effectiveness in well-lit areas. 

The Pech Lithlord has the following attributes: Strength of 18 with a modifier of +4, which indicates a very good physical prowess that enhances its melee attacks. Its Dexterity is average at 11, with a modifier of +0, and it has a Constitution of 16, corresponding to a good +3 modifier, offering it robust durability. The creature has a Wisdom of 18, providing a very good +4 modifier, which is beneficial for its spellcasting and perception. It has an Intelligence of 11 and a Charisma of 13, both resulting in average and good modifiers, respectively.

In terms of skills, the Pech Lithlord is proficient in athletics and perception, both at +7, showcasing its ability to move and climb effectively while being keenly aware of its surroundings. It is immune to poison damage and a variety of conditions, including exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, poison, being prone, restrained, and unconsciousness, making it highly resilient in combat. The creature also has excellent senses, with darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 120 feet, and a passive perception score of 17.

The Pech Lithlord has the special ability "Light Sensitivity," which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that depend on sight when it is in bright light, making it less effective in such conditions. It can also use "One with the Stone," a bonus action that grants it resistance against piercing and slashing damage until the end of its next turn, as long as it is in contact with stone. This ability recharges after a short or long rest.

In terms of innate spellcasting, the Pech Lithlord has a Wisdom-based spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 15. It can cast the following spells without requiring material components: at will, it can cast "Mending," which repairs a single object, and "Thunderwave," which creates a wave of thunderous force dealing 4d8 damage; three times a day, it can cast "Shatter," also dealing 4d8 damage; and once a day, it can use "Meld into Stone" and "Stone Shape," allowing it to blend with or manipulate stone.

For its actions in combat, the Pech Lithlord has a "Multiattack" feature allowing it to make three attacks during a turn â€“ two with its pick and one with its hammer. If it hits the same target with two attacks, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for one minute, adding a strong crowd control element to its attack strategy. The pick attack has a +7 to hit and inflicts 8 piercing damage, while the hammer can be used both in melee and ranged attacks, also with a +7 to hit, dealing 7 bludgeoning damage with a melee reach of 5 feet or a ranged reach of 20/60 feet.
