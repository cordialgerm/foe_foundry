The Giant Constrictor Snake is a massive beast known for its powerful constricting capabilities and effective hunting skills. It has a substantial armor class of 12, providing it with decent protection against attacks, and considerable hit points totaling 63, allowing it to withstand a good amount of damage in combat. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a reasonable threat to parties of lower levels. The snake possesses a strong Strength of +3 and a respectable Dexterity of +2, making its physical attacks quite formidable. However, it has very weak Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom scores, meaning it lacks special awareness or social effectiveness. Its notable actions include the ability to grapple and control opponents, particularly through its constricting attack, which can severely hinder foes.

The attributes of the Giant Constrictor Snake are as follows: 
- Strength: +3, which is good, enhancing its ability to inflict physical damage.
- Dexterity: +2, which is average, allowing for moderate agility and attack effectiveness.
- Constitution: +1, which is bad, offering only a slight boost to its durability.
- Intelligence: -5, which is very bad, indicating a significant lack of cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: +0, which is average, revealing a baseline perception and insight.
- Charisma: -4, which is very bad, showing a lack of interpersonal skills or presence.

Senses of the Giant Constrictor Snake include a keen sense of smell, allowing it to detect creatures within 10 feet. Its perception is rated at 12, enabling it to notice threats and changes in its surroundings competently but not exceptionally. Stealth is also rated at 12, providing it with the ability to move quietly and avoid detection, which may benefit ambush tactics.

The special abilities of the Giant Constrictor Snake include:
- Multiattack: This allows the snake to make either one Bite attack and one Constrict attack or make two Bite attacks during its turn, maximizing its offensive potential.
- Bite: With a melee weapon attack modifier of +6 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, the snake can target distant foes effectively. On a successful hit, it deals 10 piercing damage (2d6 + 3), making this a potent option in combat.
- Constrict: This attack also has a +6 to hit but has a 5-foot reach. If it hits, it does 12 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 3) and grapples the target with an escape DC of 14, restraining the creature until the grapple ends. This ability allows the snake to immobilize its prey, making it easier to deal with them while preventing escape.

Additionally, it possesses a bonus action called Crush:
- Crush: When a creature is grappled by the snake, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against DC 14 or take 9 bludgeoning damage (2d8) and begin suffocating. This effect continues until the grapple ends, adding an extra layer of danger as the target risks losing consciousness.

In combat scenarios, the Giant Constrictor Snake's ability to grapple and deal damage through its Crush action makes it a significant threat, especially in close quarters or against isolated targets. Its multiattack ability further amplifies its offensive capabilities, making it a fearsome opponent for adventurers who underestimate its potential.
