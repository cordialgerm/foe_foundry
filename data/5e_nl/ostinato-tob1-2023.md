The Ostinato is a medium-sized aberration with a chaotic neutral alignment, known for its unique abilities and reliance on psychic manipulation. Its armor class is 15, making it moderately protected in combat, while it has 39 hit points derived from rolling six dice of eight plus an additional twelve. With a movement speed of 50 feet, it can maneuver effectively on the battlefield. The creature has a challenge rating of 4, allowing it to be a notable encounter for a party, yielding 1,100 experience points upon defeat. Ostinatos are distinctive for their chaotic and unpredictable nature, harnessing a combination of spell-like abilities and their knack for creating a disorienting musical environment that can be both beneficial and detrimental to their foes.

The Ostinatoâ€™s ability scores reflect its nature, possessing a dexterity of 20, granting it a very good modifier of +5, allowing for agile movement and effective avoidance of attacks. It has a constitution of 15, resulting in a good +2 modifier that contributes to its durability. However, its strength is exceptionally low at 1, with a very bad -5 modifier, meaning it cannot engage in physical combat effectively. Its intelligence is very low at 5, resulting in a bad -3 modifier, signaling minimal cognitive prowess. Its wisdom is average at 12, with a +1 modifier, while its charisma is strong at 17, providing a +3 modifier which enhances its ability to influence others. The Ostinato excels in perception with a passive score of 13, augmented by its skills in perception at +3. 

The creature exhibits vulnerabilities to thunder damage, making it susceptible to attacks utilizing this element. It is immune to poison damage and has resistances to acid, cold, fire, and lightning, along with a range of physical damage types from nonmagical sources. Condition immunities provide it with significant advantages, protecting it from a variety of debilitating effects such as being charmed, exhausted, or paralyzed. With darkvision at 60 feet, it can operate effectively in low-light conditions and possesses telepathy that extends 120 feet, allowing it to communicate with others mentally, even though it cannot speak.

One of the Ostinato's special abilities is Incorporeal Movement, which allows it to pass through creatures and objects as though they are difficult terrain. However, if it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 (1d10) force damage. Its Invisibility ability enables it to remain undetected in combat, granting it a significant tactical advantage. The creature also possesses Magic Resistance, which gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability against magic users.

In terms of actions, the Ostinato can utilize a Multiattack, allowing it to make two separate Cacophony Burst attacks during its turn. Each Cacophony Burst is a spell attack that delivers 16 (3d8 + 3) thunder damage and has a +7 to hit, with a range of up to 60 feet. Additionally, the Ostinato can use its Aural Symbiosis ability, which can merge with a humanoid target within 5 feet. This ability requires the target to succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, the Ostinato becomes an alluring tune in the victim's mind, granting them its Magic Resistance but also imposing disadvantages on their Wisdom saving throws and the inability to concentrate on spells. After a long rest, the host has a chance to recognize the external entity through a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check.

Finally, the Ostinato can unleash Contagious Tune once per day while merged with a humanoid. This ability affects all creatures within a 30-foot radius of its host, requiring them to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, which leads to 21 (6d6) psychic damage on a failure or reduced damage on a success. Following this, the Ostinato gains temporary hit points equal to the highest psychic damage dealt, enhancing its resilience in combat. Notably, a deafened creature is immune to this ability, offering a strategic countermeasure against the Ostinato's sound-based attacks.
