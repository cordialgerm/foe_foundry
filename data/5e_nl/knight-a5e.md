The Knight is a Medium humanoid known for their combat prowess and leadership on the battlefield. With a formidable armor class of 18 and a solid pool of hit points totaling 52, the Knight excels in melee combat, capable of delivering significant damage with their greatsword or lance while also offering support to allies. Their challenge rating of 3 makes them a strong opponent for mid-level adventurers. Notably, the Knight possesses the special ability "Brave," allowing them to stand firm against fear effects. However, while their Dexterity is average, they are primarily built to engage directly in combat with strength and tactical thinking, which makes them quite effective in their role as a frontline warrior.

- Strength: 16 (+3) - This is an exceptional modifier, allowing for heavy melee damage and effective use of physical skills like athletics.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1) - This is an average modifier, giving a minor boost to ranged attacks and defense but not significantly enhancing their combat capabilities.
- Constitution: 14 (+2) - This is a good modifier, improving their survivability with additional hit points and better saving throws against physical ailments.
- Intelligence: 10 (+0) - This is an average modifier, signifying that the Knight is neither particularly insightful nor lacking in intellect.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0) - This is also an average modifier, indicating a reasonable perception but not exceptional wisdom.
- Charisma: 14 (+2) - This is a good modifier, enabling better interactions and inspiring allies effectively through their Knightly Inspiration ability.

Special abilities include:

- Brave: This ability grants the Knight advantage on saving throws against being frightened, making them resilient against fear tactics.

Actions include:

- Multiattack: The Knight can make two attacks with their greatsword during their turn, maximizing their offensive potential.
- Greatsword: This melee attack has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 10 slashing damage on a successful hit, showcasing good damage output.
- Lance (Mounted Only): This attack is also +5 to hit and deals 9 piercing damage with the opportunity for an additional 6 damage and a chance to knock the target prone if certain conditions are met. However, this attack is made at disadvantage when targeting creatures within 5 feet, adding a strategic layer to its use.
- Heavy Crossbow: This ranged attack has a +3 to hit and deals an average of 6 piercing damage, allowing the Knight to engage enemies at range when necessary.

The Knightly Inspiration ability, usable once per day, allows the Knight to inspire allies within a 30-foot radius. Affected creatures gain an expertise die of 1d4 on their attack rolls and saving throws for the next minute, enhancing the party's effectiveness in combat. However, the Knight cannot benefit from this ability themselves or target the same creature more than once at a time.
