The Neophron is a medium-sized fiend embodying chaotic evil, characterized by its deceptive nature and formidable combat capabilities. With an Armor Class of 16, it proves to be a tough opponent, possessing significant Hit Points totaling 114, which translates to a notable resilience in battles. The creature's impressive mobility grants it the ability to fly at 90 feet per round and walk at 40 feet. It holds a Challenge Rating of 8, making it a serious threat that can reward players with 3,900 XP upon defeat. Notably, the Neophron is immune to poison and resistant to a variety of damage types, enhancing its survivability. However, it has a low Intelligence score of 8, which may reflect its limited cognitive abilities. 

The Neophron has the following attributes: Strength is rated at 19, resulting in a modifier of +4, which indicates exceptional physical prowess. Dexterity is 16, providing a good modifier of +3, while Constitution is notably high at 20, offering a very good modifier of +5. Its Wisdom is 16 (+3), giving it a good perception, and Charisma is 14 (+2), denoting a fair level of personal presence. The Neophron has the ability to make saving throws with bonuses of +6 in Dexterity and Wisdom, +8 in Constitution, showcasing its resilience against various effects.

In combat, the Neophron can utilize its special abilities to gain significant advantages. Its Shapechanger ability allows it to polymorph into a Large giant vulture, maintaining the same statistics besides size and speed. This ability to transform can be tactical, allowing for stealthy approaches or fleeing from danger. The Keen Sight and Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell, enhancing its observational capabilities in various situations. Additionally, its Magic Resistance provides it with an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, a considerable benefit in a combat scenario.

In terms of actions, the Neophron can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to perform three attacks during its turn: one with its bite and two with its claws. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit and can inflict 15 piercing damage, with a chance to swallow a Medium or smaller creature (requiring them to succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw). If swallowed, the victim is blinded and restrained, taking ongoing acid damage until it escapes. If the swallowed creature dies, it becomes a ghast under the Neophron's control. The Claw attack similarly has a +7 to hit, dealing 11 slashing damage, and forces the target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being poisoned until the end of its next turn. 

These mechanics create a complex and dangerous foe, capable of controlling battles through its powerful attacks and unique features, presenting both a tactical challenge and an opportunity for creative strategies on the part of the players.
