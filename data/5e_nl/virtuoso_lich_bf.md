The Virtuoso Lich is a powerful Medium undead creature that serves as a formidable foe in any campaign. With a Challenge Rating of 12, it presents a significant challenge, showcasing a blend of potent magical abilities and unique artistic powers. The lich's strengths lie in its formidable armor class of 17 and impressive hit points totaling 185, making it difficult to defeat in combat. Its high Dexterity allows it to be quite stealthy, while its Charisma of +9 alongside other ability scores enhances its effectiveness in spellcasting and charm abilities. The Virtuoso Lich's ability to heal others, manipulate foes with its artistic expressions, and its legendary resistances highlight its complexity and danger. However, it is not without weaknesses; while it can regenerate from its phylactery, reliance on this aspect allows for strategic planning to prevent its return.

In terms of attributes, the Virtuoso Lich has the following values: Strength 10 (average), Dexterity 20 (+7, exceptional), Constitution 14 (+2, average), Intelligence 14 (+2, average), Wisdom 20 (+5, very good), and Charisma 24 (+9, exceptional). The creature has a base speed of 30 feet and possesses truesight for 60 feet, enabling it to see through illusions and darkness. The lich's stealth score is 17, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting characters effectively.

The Virtuoso Lich possesses several special abilities that enhance its resilience and offensive capabilities. Legendary Resistance allows it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw three times a day, making it hard to control or incapacitate. Rejuvenation indicates that if its phylactery exists, it will return to life within 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points. Turn Resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause it to turn as an undead. The lich's Undead Nature means it does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, and Undead Resilience provides immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition. Its unique Versatile Artist ability allows it to choose a form of artistic expression each long rest, granting immunity to a specific damage type associated with that art, which gives it strategic defensive options.

In combat, the Virtuoso Lich can perform a Multiattack, which consists of using Corrupted Art followed by making three attacks with Artistic Flourish. The Artistic Flourish can be a melee or ranged spell attack that hits with a +9 bonus and deals 18 (3d8 + 5) damage alongside additional force damage. If the target is non-undead, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, failing which may blind, charm, or deafen it until the end of the next turn. If the target is undead, it regains 18 hit points, which can exceed its maximum and translate into temporary hit points. The Corrupted Art action allows the lich to target a creature within 60 feet, invoking a similar save as the Artistic Flourish.

The lich can also utilize its Call Muse ability to charm a creature within 30 feet, rendering it incapacitated as it becomes entranced by the lich's artistic expression. While under the effect, the target can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to attempt to break free but suffers the consequences if harmed by the lich. Spellcasting capabilities include an arsenal of spells, such as disguise self, mage hand, and prestidigitation for utility, alongside potent spells like charm, fear, and dimension door for tactical advantage in combat.

Additionally, the Virtuoso Lich has legendary actions that it can use to further influence the battlefield. It can repeat its Call Muse ability, move without provoking attacks, cast spells for an immediate surprise, or unleash its Unrestrained Art, which targets creatures around it to possibly knock them prone if they fail a Dexterity saving throw.

In conclusion, the Virtuoso Lich is an undead menace that combines artistic flair with deadly intent. Its diverse abilities and spells enable it to manipulate the battlefield, heal allies, and incapacitate foes, making it a memorable adversary in any adventure.
