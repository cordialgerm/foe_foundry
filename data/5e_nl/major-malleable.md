The Major Malleable is a sprawling and chaotic aberration that embodies the concept of fluidity and unpredictability in combat. This Huge creature operates under a chaotic evil alignment, leveraging its unique abilities to manipulate its form and absorb the strength of others. With a solid Armor Class of 13 and a substantial hit point pool of 218, the Major Malleable presents a formidable challenge in battle, especially with its ability to grapple and drain the life force of its adversaries. Although its Dexterity is relatively poor, leading to a bad modifier of -1, its Strength of 22 provides it with a very good +6 modifier for physical attacks. Its notable defenses include immunity to psychic damage and various conditions, making it resilient against mental assaults. The creature's challenge rating of 10 indicates a significant threat in encounters. 

The Major Malleable exhibits a strong constitution, reflected in its Constitution score of 17 (+3), which grants it a good resilience against various effects. Its Intelligence of 19 (+4) enables it to be very effective in intelligence-based saving throws, while a Wisdom of 16 (+3) helps it resist various spells. The creature has an average Charisma of 10 (+0), indicating it has no particular strengths or weaknesses in social interactions.

In terms of special abilities, the Major Malleable can use "Absorb Malleable" as a bonus action to absorb smaller malleables nearby, regaining hit points equivalent to the absorbed creatureâ€™s remaining health. This ability allows it to sustain itself in combat and can be troublesome for opponents facing multiple malleable creatures. Its "Amorphous" ability allows it to traverse narrow spaces without restriction, emphasizing its role as a shapeless entity. Through "Controlled Mutability," it can alter its form but must return to its original shape after one turn, making it adaptable in combat without losing its inherent abilities.

"Psychic Absorption" makes the Major Malleable immune to psychic damage, healing it instead when it would normally take such damage. This presents a significant tactical challenge for spellcasters relying on psychic attacks. Additionally, with "Spider Climb," it can easily scale vertical surfaces or ceilings, further enhancing its mobility.

In combat, the Major Malleable can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three attacks with its "Flesh Tendril." Each melee attack utilizes a +10 to hit, dealing an average of 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. When it grapples a target, it imposes an escape difficulty of 16, making it challenging for creatures to break free. Its "Psychic Drain" ability forces a grappled target to make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw, dealing 45 (10d8) psychic damage on a failure and significantly reducing the target's maximum hit points; this can be lethal if pushed to zero, converting the target into a minor malleable. 

In addition, the Major Malleable has the ability to "Join Malleables" with other nearby Major Malleables to create a larger entity, combining their hit points and gaining the conditions affecting either, effective in a coordinated assault. Alternatively, it can "Separate Malleables" to split itself into several smaller malleables, redistributing its hit points and causing confusion among its foes.

As a reaction, "Sudden Separation" allows it to split into minor malleables when taking significant damage (20 or more), effectively mitigating some of the damage it received while also potentially overwhelming foes with additional creatures.

Overall, the Major Malleable excels through its adaptability and ability to manipulate both its form and the battlefield, posing a complex and dangerous foe for adventurers.
