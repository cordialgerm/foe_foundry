Regarding its special abilities:
- Void Casting: This ability allows the Void Giant to enhance a spell with void magic as a bonus action. Any creature that is hit by the spell or fails a saving throw against it becomes stunned until the end of the creature's next turn, creating a powerful tactical advantage.
- Spellcasting: As a spellcaster of 11th level with an Intelligence-based spell save DC of 16, the Void Giant has access to a broad range of spells prepared. It can cast spells including cantrips like chill touch and shocking grasp, along with higher-level spells such as lightning bolt and disintegrate, making it a versatile threat and capable of dealing significant damage or control in battle.

In terms of reactions, it has the Magic Absorption ability. If the Void Giant succeeds on a saving throw against an enemy spell, it can avoid the spell’s effects entirely, and during its next turn, if it uses Void Casting, it can target all affected creatures rather than just one, significantly amplifying its potential impact during combat.
