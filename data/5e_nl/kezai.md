The Kezai is a formidable Medium monstrosity characterized by its ability to inflict both poison and fire damage, as well as its capacity for flight. It possesses a solid Armor Class of 16 thanks to its natural armor and has a decent pool of hit points totaling 67, making it a resilient opponent. The creature excels in Dexterity with a score of 18, giving it a +4 modifier that reflects an exceptional ability to evade attacks. However, it is weak in Intelligence, scoring a mere 4, which results in a significant -3 modifier, making it ineffective at tasks that require cleverness. The Kezai's challenge rating of 4 indicates that it is a moderate threat, suitable for groups of low to mid-level adventurers. It can utilize its flight speed of 50 feet to maneuver around the battlefield, and its gas attacks can limit the movement and effectiveness of nearby enemies.

The Kezai has several notable characteristics: it is immune to fire damage, has blindsight within a range of 60 feet for detecting creatures without the need for sight, and presents a passive Perception of 11, which is average for perceiving hidden threats. Its lack of language suggests a beast-like nature, relying on instinct rather than communication.

The creature’s special ability, Nauseous Gas, creates a hazardous area around it. Any creature that begins its turn within 20 feet of the Kezai must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 2 points of poison damage. Additionally, this area is lightly obscured, complicating visibility and targeting for those within it.

In terms of actions, the Kezai can make a Multiattack, permitting it to perform three attacks per turn: one using its poison barb and two with its claws. The claws carry a +6 to hit, delivering an average of 7 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. The poison barb, which can be used in melee or ranged scenarios, also has a +6 to hit and deals 6 piercing damage on a successful attack, alongside a poison effect that requires the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 7 poison damage and being poisoned for up to one minute, during which the poisoned creature takes 3 poison damage at the start of each turn.

The Kezai also has a powerful Searing Acid ability that can be used again after a cooldown period. When activated, this attack deals significant fire damage—up to 18 points on a failed DC 14 Dexterity saving throw—affecting all creatures within a 20-foot radius. Notably, this ability also temporarily deactivates the Nauseous Gas effect, encouraging strategic usage in combat scenarios.

Overall, the Kezai presents both a tactical challenge and a damaging threat, engaging players to navigate its gas attacks while avoiding its acid and poison effects.
