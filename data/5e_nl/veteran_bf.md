The Veteran is a capable fighter, considered a medium humanoid that can come from any lineage. With an Armor Class of 16 provided by its breastplate, it possesses a reasonable level of defense against attacks. The Veteran has a solid pool of 68 hit points, allowing it to sustain moderate amounts of damage during combat. As a creature of Challenge Rating 3, it presents a notable challenge for lower-level parties. Its combat abilities are further enhanced by a focus on both melee and ranged attacks, showcasing versatility in different scenarios. The Veteran has good Strength, with a +5 modifier, making it effective in physical confrontations, and a decent Dexterity of +2, contributing to its agility in combat scenarios. However, it lacks significant capabilities in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, wherein it holds very low modifiers of +0. The Veteran can employ a variety of attacks, employing multiple weapon types, and leverages its physical prowess in both offense and defense strategies.

The Veteran's attributes consist of the following statistics: 
- Strength of +5 (exceptional effectiveness), 
- Dexterity of +2 (good effectiveness), 
- Constitution of +2 (good effectiveness), 
- Intelligence of +0 (very bad effectiveness), 
- Wisdom of +0 (very bad effectiveness), 
- Charisma of +0 (very bad effectiveness). 

This mix of high offensive capability alongside average defensive and minor mental capabilities makes the Veteran a formidable opponent in direct combat.

The Veteran has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The special ability Multiattack allows the Veteran to make a combination of two Longsword and two Shortsword attacks, or execute three Longsword attacks on its turn, significantly increasing its potential damage output in one round. The Longsword attack has a +5 to hit, and if successful, it deals 7 slashing damage with a standard strike or 8 slashing damage when wielded with two hands. The Shortsword attack similarly has a +5 to hit, causing 6 piercing damage on a successful strike, while the Heavy Crossbow attack provides a long-range option, with a +4 to hit and dealing 7 piercing damage.

In addition to its standard actions, the Veteran can use its bonus action called Shoulder to shove a nearby creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, potentially enabling the Veteran or its allies to capitalize on the prone condition for advantage on attack rolls. 

Furthermore, the Veteran possesses a reaction called Parry, which can be used to increase its Armor Class against an incoming melee attack by 2. This ability must be employed in the moment of being targeted, requiring the Veteran to see the attacker and be armed with a melee weapon.

Overall, the Veteran's combination of weapon proficiency, ability to multitask in attacks, defensive maneuvers, and shoving capability makes it a strong combatant, well-suited to fight alongside allies or stand as a formidable opponent on its own.
