The Chain Devil is a formidable Medium-sized fiend categorized as a devil, known for its ability to ensnare and torment its foes using its remarkable chains. With an armor class of 16, this creature presents a good defense against attacks, while its hit point pool of 138 allows it to withstand considerable punishment, making it a significant threat on the battlefield. The Chain Devil operates at a challenge rating of 8, showcasing its capability to take on medium-level parties effectively. Notable strengths include its impressive resilience to various forms of damage, particularly its immunity to fire and poison, along with magic resistance that allows for strong saving against spells and magical effects. However, its weaknesses include susceptibility to radiant damage and the lack of ranged attacks, making it less effective at dealing with foes from a distance.

The Chain Devil possesses several attributes reflecting its combat abilities. It has a Strength score of 18 (+4), signifying good physical power and melee effectiveness. Dexterity is average at 14 (+2), providing decent agility, while Constitution is exceptional at 21 (+7), indicating a high level of endurance. Intelligence is minimal at 10 (+0), suggesting limited cognitive capabilities, but Wisdom stands at 18 (+4), which is good for perception and insight. Lastly, a Charisma of 20 (+5) highlights the creature's formidable presence and ability to command respect and fear.

In terms of special abilities, the Chain Devil benefits from Devil's Sight, allowing it to see through magical darkness without hindrance. Its Devilish Resilience grants it resistance to cold and nonmagical physical damage, alongside immunity to fire and poison damage effects. Additionally, Magic Resistance adds an advantage on saving throws against magic, enhancing its survivability against spellcasters.

The Chain Devil's actions include a formidable Multiattack option that allows it to strike four times with its Chains. Each Chain attack is executed with a +7 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet. Upon a successful strike, it inflicts 8 slashing damage along with an additional 7 piercing damage, while also grappling the target with an escape DC of 15. The grasping chains subsequently deal 14 piercing damage at the start of the target's turn, causing ongoing harm until the grapple is broken.

As a bonus action, the Chain Devil can use Animate Chains, enabling it to command visible chains within 60 feet to restrain up to two creatures nearby. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained, and an action can be used to free a restrained target by passing a DC 15 Strength check.

For reactions, the Chain Devil can utilize its Unnerving Mask ability. When a creature it can see begins its turn within 30 feet, the devil can alter its visage to appear as someone significant from the creature’s past—be it a loved one or an enemy. If the creature sees this transformation, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its turn, effectively using psychological tactics to impose disadvantage on the affected creature's actions during their phase.
