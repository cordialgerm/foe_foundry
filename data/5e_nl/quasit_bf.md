The Quasit is a tiny fiend associated with demonic magic, serving as a versatile adversary in combat. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, leveraging its speed, nimbleness, and magical abilities to outmaneuver and debilitate its foes. The Quasit possesses strong defensive traits, such as resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, and immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. It excels in stealth, making it a cunning opponent, but its physical attributes are less impressive, with a very bad strength modifier and average constitution. This combination of magical resistance and transformational capabilities makes the Quasit a unique and challenging encounter for any adventuring party.

The Quasit has an armor class of 13, providing average protection against attacks. It has 35 hit points, allowing it to endure some damage before being eliminated. It has a movement speed of 40 feet, which is good, enabling it to reposition frequently during combat. In terms of attributes, it has a strength score of -3 (very bad), dexterity of +5 (very good), constitution of +0 (average), intelligence of -2 (bad), wisdom of +0 (average), and charisma of +0 (average). The Quasit's high dexterity allows it to excel in stealth, with a stealth modifier of +5 (very good), and it has darkvision out to 120 feet, enabling it to see in complete darkness.

The Quasit has several notable special abilities. Its Demonic Resilience grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, which is particularly useful against elemental attacks. Additionally, it is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, allowing it to shrug off effects that might impede other creatures. The Quasit's Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it harder to control or damage through magic.

In combat, the Quasit can initiate attacks using its Claws in its true form. This attack has a +5 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 5 (2d4) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect. 

Alternatively, when in its Beast Form, the Quasit uses a Slam attack, which also has a +5 to hit and can deal 10 (2d6 + 3) damage based on the type of damage that the beast formâ€™s primary attack deals, whether bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. 

One of its unique capabilities is Invisibility, which allows the Quasit to magically turn invisible until it attacks, uses Scare, or changes shape. Anything it carries also becomes invisible with it, providing tactical advantages for ambush or escape.

The Quasit also has a bonus action called Change Shape, enabling it to transform into a Medium or smaller beast with a challenge rating no higher than its own or revert back to its true form. This ability allows it to adapt its strategy mid-combat, maintaining the same statistics except for size and speed.

Lastly, its Scare ability, usable once per day, targets a creature within 20 feet, forcing it to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is frightened for 1 minute, which can significantly alter the flow of combat, as frightened creatures typically cannot approach the source of their fear and may suffer disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect on a success.
