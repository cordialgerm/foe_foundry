The Cloud Giant is a Huge creature known for its tremendous presence and abilities related to clouds and aerial combat. With a solid Armor Class of 14 and substantial Hit Points totaling 175, it can withstand significant damage while dishing out powerful attacks. The Cloud Giant possesses exceptional Strength, Constitution, and Charisma, making it a formidable opponent in melee and spellcasting scenarios. While it is resistant to the stunned condition, it is vulnerable to being knocked prone, which could be a tactical weakness in combat. With a flying speed of 60 feet, the Cloud Giant can maneuver effectively in the battle arena, making it a threatening adversary from both close range and distance.

The Cloud Giant has a Strength score of +8, indicating exceptional physical power, which allows it to effectively perform melee attacks. Its Dexterity is average (+0), implying moderate agility. The Constitution is exceptionally high at +10, granting it incredible durability. The Intelligence modifier is low (+1), suggesting that it is not particularly smart but possesses a good Wisdom modifier of +7, enabling high perceptive abilities. Finally, the Charisma modifier is also exceptional at +8, suggesting a strong presence that can influence others.

The Cloud Giant has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. It possesses "Cloudsight," which allows it to see clearly through obscured areas caused by clouds, fog, smoke, or steam without any penalties. Its heightened smell gives it a Perception score of 22 for detecting creatures by scent alone, making it very adept at sensing enemies nearby. 

In terms of actions, the Cloud Giant can perform a "Multiattack," which allows it to make three attacks using its "Cloud-Coated Mace," a melee weapon that has a +12 to hit and can deliver a combination of piercing and cold damage totaling 22 (18 piercing and 4 cold) on a successful hit. Alternatively, it can use "Wind Burst," a ranged spell attack with an +8 modifier that can deal 31 bludgeoning damage and potentially push the target away while knocking them prone if they fail a DC 16 Strength saving throw.

The Cloud Giant also has powerful bonus actions. Using "Cloud Cover," it can create a heavily obscured area in a 20-foot cube for 1 minute, greatly hindering visibility for opponents. The "Condense" ability allows it to make an area of cloud, fog, or smoke dense and difficult to traverse, creating challenging terrain and restraining creatures that fail a DC 15 Strength saving throw while they start their turns in that area.

Lastly, in terms of defense, the Cloud Giant can use "Cirrus Deflection" as a reaction, which provides a temporary increase of 4 to its Armor Class against an attacking opponent, as long as the giant has a line of sight to the attacker. This ability makes it more challenging to hit during engagements, adding to its already formidable survivability.
