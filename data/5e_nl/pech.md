The Pech is a small elemental creature that embodies a neutral good alignment, known for its mastery of stone and earth. Standing out with an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, the Pech boasts a decent pool of hit points totaling 33, thanks to its Constitution score of 14, which gives it good resilience in battle. The Pech is also uniquely adapted for navigation within rocky environments, able to climb with a speed of 10 feet and walk at a rate of 20 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it provides around 450 experience points to those who defeat it. Notable for its immunity to poison and various conditions such as exhaustion and paralysis, the Pech presents a unique challenge, especially considering its special abilities, which grant it resilience and powerful melee attacks.

The Pech possesses a Strength score of 16, providing a good modifier of +3, making its physical attacks quite effective. Its Dexterity is average at 11, resulting in a neutral modifier of +0, which means it does not excel in evasive maneuvers. With a Constitution score of 14, it enjoys a good +2 modifier for resisting physical effects, while its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all around average to slightly above average. The Pech's skills include Athletics at a +5, which is very good, allowing it to excel in physical contests, and Perception at +3, which is good, for noticing things in its environment.

In terms of special abilities, the Pech has Light Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when in bright light; this can make it vulnerable in well-lit areas. Its main power, One with the Stone, can be activated as a bonus action when in contact with stone. This ability provides it with resistance to piercing and slashing damage until the end of its next turn, allowing it to absorb damage effectively during combat.

The Pech can attack using its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make two strikes in one turnâ€”one with its pick and another with its hammer. If both attacks strike the same target, that target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of the Pech's next turn; this incapacitation can significantly hinder a foe in the midst of battle. When using the Pick, the Pech makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage on a successful hit. When opting for the Hammer, the Pech can choose to attack either in melee with a reach of 5 feet or as a ranged attack within a range of 20 feet to 60 feet, also having a +5 to hit, dealing 6 bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. This versatility in attack types allows the Pech to adapt its strategy based on the distance of its enemies, making it a well-rounded combatant in its elemental domain.
