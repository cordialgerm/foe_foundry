The Greed Swarm is a Medium Construct that embodies the insatiable desire for wealth and material goods. It typically plays the role of a menacing foe that can ambush unsuspecting adventurers with its deceptive appearance and potent attacks. With an Armor Class of 13 and 22 hit points, it stands as a moderately resilient opponent for low-level parties. Its Challenge Rating of 1/2 reflects its manageable threat level, making it an interesting encounter for inexperienced players. The Greed Swarm excels in mobility with a flying speed of 40 feet and is particularly tricky due to its ability to resemble a harmless pile of coins. However, it exhibits a notable weakness to force damage and can be incapacitated by antimagic effects, which can severely limit its effectiveness in combat.

The Greed Swarm has the following attributes: Strength 6, Dexterity 16, Constitution 12, Intelligence 1, Wisdom 9, and Charisma 1. Its Dexterity score is average at +3, making it agile and allowing it to evade attacks effectively. However, its physical strength is very bad at -2, indicating that it is not capable of inflicting significant damage through raw strength.

The swarm possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess and survivability. An important ability is Antimagic Susceptibility, which means that while in an antimagic field, it becomes incapacitated and can fall unconscious if targeted by dispel magic, provided it fails a Constitution saving throw. This makes the swarm vulnerable to spellcasters who can invoke such effects. The Deafening Clatter ability renders any creature in the swarm's space deafened, affecting their ability to communicate and perceive sounds. Its False Appearance grants it the power to remain motionless and indistinguishable from a pile of treasure, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting adventurers. Lastly, the Swarm ability allows it to occupy the space of other creatures and pass through tight openings, enhancing its tactical mobility during encounters.

For its attacks, the Greed Swarm can perform two main actions: Coin Slam and Coin Barrage. The Coin Slam is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit. It has a reach of 0 feet, meaning it only affects targets within its space, dealing 10 (4d4) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the swarm is below half its hit points, this damage drops to 5 (2d4). The Coin Barrage is a ranged weapon attack with the same +5 modifier and a range of 20/60 feet, dealing 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage normally, or 3 (1d6) if it has taken significant damage. 

Finally, the swarm has a special ability called Gather, which can be used once per day. This allows the Greed Swarm to magically collect valuable items within a 60-foot radius worth up to 100 gp, restoring 7 (2d6) hit points and granting it advantage on its next attack roll. Creatures that possess valuable objects must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid having their items pulled towards the swarm, thus helping it to regain vitality and increase its threat in subsequent turns.
