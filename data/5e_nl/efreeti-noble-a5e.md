The Efreeti Noble is a powerful Large Elemental creature with a strong presence on the battlefield. It boasts a high Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 344, making it resilient in combat. Its challenge rating of 11 indicates that it is a formidable opponent for adventurers and can deal significant damage while maintaining a good level of defense. The Efreeti Noble is characterized by its impressive Strength and Constitution, both having a value of 22, translating to a +6 modifier, which is very good. It also has high Dexterity (18, +4), enabling it to agilely evade attacks. Furthermore, its innate spellcasting ability, fueled by a Charisma modifier of +3, allows for additional versatility, enabling it to cast multiple spells without the need for material components. Its weakness lies in its lack of defensive immunities aside from fire, which does provide some vulnerability against non-fire-related damage types. 

The Efreeti Noble's attributes include a Strength of 22 (+6), Dexterity of 18 (+4), Constitution of 22 (+6), Intelligence of 14 (+2), Wisdom of 16 (+3), and Charisma of 16 (+3). Its saving throws are advantageous, with Dexterity at +8, Intelligence at +6, Wisdom at +7, and Charisma at +7, all of which are considered good. In terms of skills, it excels in athletics with a +10 modifier and intimidation and perception, both with a +7 modifier. The creature has damage immunity to fire, allowing it to resist fire damage entirely, which is significant given that it also inflicts fire damage through its attacks and spells. Its darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive perception score of 17 helps it detect unseen threats in dim light or darkness. It can communicate using the Ignan language.

The Efreeti Noble possesses several special abilities. Its innate spellcasting is based on Charisma with a spell save DC of 15, allowing it to cast spells at will, such as alter self, which enables it to change its form to Medium or Large, and detect magic. It can also cast the spells creation, gaseous form, major image, and tongues three times a day, with conjure elemental (fire elemental only) and plane shift (to the Elemental Plane of Fire) available once per day. The use of these spells grants the Efreeti Noble strategic advantages in combat and exploration, facilitating diverse maneuvers and adaptations to different situations.

In terms of actions, the Efreeti Noble can perform a multiattack, making two brass sword attacks or hurling flame twice. It may also replace one of its attacks with a kick. The brass sword attack has a +10 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 slashing damage along with an additional 7 fire damage on a successful hit. The kick attack, which is a melee weapon attack with +10 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, deals 11 bludgeoning damage and pushes the target 10 feet away. The hurl flame action is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 120 feet, causing a substantial 21 fire damage on a hit.

Additionally, the Efreeti Noble can use its bonus action to create a Fiery Wall once per day. This ability allows it to summon an opaque wall of magical flame within 60 feet, which can be up to 20 feet high and 30 feet long. Creatures within the wall upon its appearance must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 fire damage, with half damage on a successful save. Anyone entering the wall for the first time on a turn, or ending their turn within it, also suffers fire damage. This wall can significantly alter the battlefield by restricting movement and dealing continuous damage, proving a valuable tactical asset for the Efreeti Noble in combat scenarios. Overall, the Efreeti Noble is a formidable foe, capable of dealing consistent damage while manipulating the battlefield to its advantage.
