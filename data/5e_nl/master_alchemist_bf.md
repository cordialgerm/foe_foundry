The Master Alchemist is a medium humanoid creature that plays a versatile role as a support and area control spellcaster in combat. Its strengths lie in its high Intelligence, which fuels its potent concoctions and alchemical effects, as well as a significant pool of hit points that allows it to endure in prolonged encounters. With a Challenge Rating of 7, this character can be a formidable opponent, utilizing smoke and effects to confuse and hinder enemies while also providing healing support to allies. However, its average physical attributes mean that it may not excel in direct melee confrontations and requires careful positioning and strategy to maximize its potential in combat. 

The Master Alchemist has an Armor Class of 16, which is considered good for a creature of its type, and it possesses 152 hit points, providing it with a very good level of durability. It has a speed of 30 feet. The alchemist's ability scores are as follows: Strength is +0 (average), Dexterity is +4 (good), Constitution is +6 (very good), Intelligence is +7 (exceptional), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is +2 (average). Its high Intelligence score allows it to excel with magical effects, while its Constitution grants substantial endurance.

The Master Alchemist has a special ability called "Tools of the Trade," which grants proficiency with alchemistâ€™s supplies and doubles its proficiency bonus for any ability check made with these supplies. This enhances its utility during skill checks related to alchemy.

In combat, the Master Alchemist can take multiple actions. Its primary action, "Multiattack," allows it to make three Hasty Concoction attacks, each of which can deal 17 damage (3d8 + 4) of acid, cold, fire, or poison damage based on its preference. Moreover, each attack can trigger one of three special effects: 

1. **Disorienting Vapors:** Targets a creature and anyone within a 5-foot radius, forcing them to make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. Creatures that fail this check move in a random direction on their next turn.
   
2. **Poisonous Cloud:** Creates a 10-foot-radius sphere of green gas that lightly obscures the area. Any creature entering or starting its turn in this cloud must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. The gas dissipates at the start of the Master Alchemist's next turn.

3. **Slick Floor:** Coats a 10-foot area with a thick, purple foam, which lasts until the start of the alchemist's next turn. Creatures moving through this area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

The alchemist can also use "Explosive Flask," an action that requires a recharge on rolls of 5-6. It involves throwing a flask that explodes at a point within 30 feet, forcing all creatures within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 31 fire damage (7d8), or half as much on a success.

Additionally, the Master Alchemist can use "Healing Unguent," available three times per day, to restore 14 hit points (4d6) to an ally.

As a bonus action, it can consume a "Protective Draught" with a recharge of 4-6, granting it resistance to one of several damage types (acid, cold, fire, or poison) until the end of its next turn. 

Overall, the Master Alchemist combines potent offensive capabilities with tactical battlefield control and support, making it a dynamic addition to any encounter.
