The Magma Mephit is a small elemental creature that embodies the essence of fire and earth. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. Its strengths lie in its ability to deal fire damage and create disruptive effects, especially upon death, when it explodes, causing additional harm to nearby foes. The mephit can be stealthy, making it adept at ambush tactics. However, it has relatively low hit points, and its defenses rely on its natural armor, making it vulnerable to concentrated attacks.

The Magma Mephit has the following ability scores: Strength is +2, Dexterity is +0, Constitution is +0, Intelligence is -2, Wisdom is +0, and Charisma is +1. The mephit's Strength score indicates an average physical capability, with the Dexterity score being neutral, making its agility neither strong nor weak. With a very bad Intelligence score, the mephit is not particularly clever, while its average Wisdom reflects a decent awareness of its surroundings. Its Charisma, however, is slightly above average, influencing its ability to interact in social situations.

In terms of senses, the Magma Mephit possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception and Stealth skills are both rated at 12, indicating it can notice things well and hide effectively. The mephit can communicate in Ignan and Terran, the languages of fire and earth creatures.

The Magma Mephit has several notable abilities. Upon death, it triggers a "Death Burst," where it explodes in a fiery burst of lava. Creatures within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 11; failure results in being pushed back 10 feet, knocked prone, and catching on fire, which inflicts 3 (1d6) fire damage on their turns until extinguished. It also has a "False Appearance" ability that allows it to blend in with its surroundings when motionless, making it camouflaged as a mound of molten rock.

In combat, the mephit can use its melee claws, executing an attack with a +4 modifier to hit, dealing 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage supplemented by 3 (1d6) fire damage upon a successful hit. Its "Lob Magma" ranged attack allows it to deal 7 (2d6) fire damage to a target within 20 to 60 feet, with a +2 to hit.

One powerful ability is the "Pyroclastic Burst," which recharges on a roll of 6. This ability unleashes an explosive blast of lava in a 15-foot cone. Creatures within this area must make a Strength saving throw with a DC of 11; failure results in 7 (2d6) fire damage and being pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone, while success reduces the damage by half with no additional effects.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Magma Mephit can perform a "Pyrotechnic Display" once per day by casting the spell Color Spray, requiring no material components. The spell creates a dazzling display of colors that can incapacitate creatures if they fail a saving throw against a DC of 11 based on its Charisma, potentially affecting multiple opponents in a single action.

Overall, the Magma Mephit is a cunning and explosive foe, capable of dealing significant fire damage and utilizing its environment to ambush unsuspecting adventurers.
