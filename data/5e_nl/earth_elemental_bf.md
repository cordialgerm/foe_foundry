The Earth Elemental is a formidable creature embodying the essence of earth, known for its strength and resilience. As a Large elemental, it occupies a significant role in battles, excelling in melee combat with formidable physical attacks. With a high Armor Class of 17 and 114 hit points, it is difficult to take down, making it a durable adversary. Its powers allow it to move stealthily through various terrains and to disrupt the battlefield with earth-shaping abilities. However, it does have limitations, such as susceptibility to magical attacks and reliance on physical force. The Earth Elemental is particularly adept at engaging in direct combat or sieging fortifications, thanks to its ability to deal double damage to structures. 

The Earth Elemental has several key attributes that affect its performance during gameplay: it has a Strength of 20 (+5 modifier, which is exceptional), Dexterity of 9 (-1 modifier, which is bad), Constitution of 20 (+5 modifier, which is exceptional), Intelligence of 8 (-2 modifier, which is very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0 modifier, which is average), and Charisma of 6 (-3 modifier, which is very bad). Its senses include darkvision and tremorsense, both extending 60 feet, granting it excellent perception capabilities with a Perception score of 13 (which is good). It also has limited Stealth ability with a score of 9 (which is bad) and can understand the Terran language.

The Earth Elemental possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Earth Glide ability allows it to burrow through nonmagical earth and stone without disturbing the terrain, making it highly mobile in environmental settings. With Earthen Camouflage, it can utilize the terrain to improve its Stealth score to 14 in rocky or muddy environments. As an Elemental, it does not require basic needs such as air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously in various situations. Its Elemental Resilience grants it resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, immunity to poison damage, and protection from exhausting or debilitating conditions. Finally, its Siege Monster ability enables it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it a significant threat to fortifications.

When it comes to actions, the Earth Elemental can employ a Multiattack feature, allowing it to make three Slam attacks or two Lob Stone attacks. Each Slam has a +8 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage upon a hit. The Lob Stone, a ranged attack with the same +8 to hit, has a range of 20/60 feet and inflicts 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. Notably, if a creature is hit by two Slam or Lob Stone attacks, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, creating opportunities for further attacks from allies.

Additionally, the Earth Elemental can use a bonus action called Earth Tremor (which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6). This action causes the ground to shake violently at a point within 30 feet, forcing each creature within 10 feet of that point to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. This ability can turn the tides of battle by disrupting enemy formations and positioning.
