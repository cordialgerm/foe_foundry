The Adult White Dragon is a formidable creature that embodies the chilling aspect of ice and snow. As a Huge dragon with a Challenge Rating of 13, it plays a role as a powerful adversary in campaigns, capable of dealing and absorbing significant amounts of damage. Its noteworthy strengths include a high Armor Class of 18, formidable hit points totaling 238, and excellent mobility with various modes of travel, including flying and swimming. The dragon benefits from high Constitution and Dexterity scores, making it exceptionally durable and quick in combat. The dragon's primary weaknesses include its lower mental attributes, specifically Intelligence, which is significantly lower than its other traits, and its reliance on cold-based attacks, which may be less effective against fire-resistant foes. Overall, the Adult White Dragon is a devastating foe in both melee and ranged combat, with abilities that can control the battlefield.

The Adult White Dragon possesses the following attributes: Strength of +6, Dexterity of +5, Constitution of +11 (exceptional), Intelligence of -1 (very bad), Wisdom of +7 (very good), and Charisma of +7 (very good). Its perception score of 22 allows it to detect hidden threats effectively, while its Stealth score of 15 is average. The dragon has darkvision, allowing it to see in low-light conditions up to 120 feet, and it can keenly sense creatures within 60 feet.

The dragon's special abilities include Ice Walk, which allows it to traverse icy surfaces easily and negates difficult terrain penalties caused by ice or snow. Legendary Resistance, which it can use three times per day, enables it to succeed on a saving throw even if it initially fails, providing an exceptional method for avoiding debilitating effects. The Numbing Chill ability creates an area of cold around the dragon, imposing a speed reduction on creatures that fail a DC 19 Constitution saving throw when they start their turn within 20 feet of the dragon. 

In combat, the Adult White Dragon can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make a Frightful Presence attack, followed by one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +11 to hit, reaches 10 feet, and deals 17 piercing damage along with an additional 4 cold damage. The Claw attack, also with a +11 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicts 13 slashing damage. The Tail attack has a +11 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, and deals 15 bludgeoning damage. The Frightful Presence makes it a psychological threat; creatures within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute, with the chance to repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns. The Cold Breath attack, which recharges on a 5-6 roll, allows the dragon to exhale a devastating icy blast in a 60-foot cone, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw to mitigate damage.

The dragon's legendary actions further augment its combat capabilities. The Detect action allows it to sense all creatures and traps within 30 feet, enhancing its tactical awareness. The Tail Attack acts as an additional melee option. The Elemental Roar costs two actions and targets up to two creatures within 120 feet, forcing them to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw; failure leaves them vulnerable to cold damage for their next turn. Lastly, the Wing Attack allows the dragon to deal damage to creatures within 10 feet, and it can move up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

In addition to its powerful presence and abilities, the Adult White Dragon can create regional effects. Should it perish, these effects fade after a period determined by a roll of 1d10 days, indicating its deep connection to its territory and the lingering magic of its icy domain.
