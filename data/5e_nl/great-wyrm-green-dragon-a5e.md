The Great Wyrm Green Dragon is a gargantuan and formidable creature, often viewed as one of the most powerful dragons in existence within the game world. It serves as an apex predator, cunningly navigating both air and aquatic environments with exceptional speed and versatility. With an impressive array of abilities and high damage output, the Great Wyrm excels in combat, utilizing poison to debilitate its foes while employing stealth and intimidation tactics. Despite its strengths, its vulnerability stems from its reliance on saving throws and its limited use of powerful abilities, making it crucial for players to strategize effectively to overcome it.

The Great Wyrm Green Dragon has strong physical attributes, with a Strength score of 26, granting it a +8 modifier, considered very good, allowing it to overpower foes easily. Its Dexterity of 12 provides a +1 modifier, which is average and shows that while it is agile, it is not exceptionally quick. With a Constitution score of 24 (+7 modifier), the dragon has a good level of durability, and an Intelligence of 20 (+5 modifier) makes for tactical cunning in battle. Its Wisdom score of 16 (+3 modifier) is good for perceiving its surroundings, while an exceptional Charisma score of 28 (+9 modifier) makes it a master manipulator in social situations.

When it comes to saving throws, the Great Wyrm boasts a +8 to Dexterity, +14 to Constitution, +10 to Wisdom, and +11 to Charisma, all of which are very good to exceptional, allowing it to withstand various effects from attacks and spells. The skills it possesses include deception and persuasion at +11, insight and perception at +10, and stealth at +8—skills that make it a consummate trickster and a difficult adversary to track in its preferred environments.

The dragon is immunized against poison damage and is never impeded by being poisoned. Moreover, it possesses the ability to breathe both air and water, enabling it to thrive in diverse settings. Its senses are exceptionally sharp, with blindsight extending to 60 feet and darkvision to 120 feet, coupled with a high passive Perception of 23, allowing it to easily detect intruders in its territory.

Among its intriguing special abilities is Amphibious, allowing it to function seamlessly in water and on land. The Legendary Resistance feature, which it can use three times a day, lets it choose to succeed on a saving throw instead of failing, which adds to its resilience—though using this ability reduces its Armor Class from 21 to 19 for the remainder of the day. The Woodland Stalker ability provides the dragon advantage on Stealth checks in forests and enables it to project its voice to confuse adversaries while remaining hidden. With Blood Toxicity, if a creature that is in close proximity strikes the dragon, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take poison damage, which punishes melee attackers. The Venomous Resurgence ability can recharge its breath weapon when it first takes damage, spreading green gas that impacts creatures’ resistance and vulnerabilities to poison damage.

The Great Wyrm Green Dragon has formidable actions in combat. It can attack thrice per turn—once with its bite, which has a +15 to hit and deals 30 piercing damage plus poison damage, and twice with its claws, each dealing 21 slashing damage. Its tail attack can push enemies back, providing excellent battlefield control. A noteworthy ranged attack is Spit Poison, targeting creatures within 60 feet, forcing a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or suffering significant poison damage and potential poisoning for up to a minute.

The dragon's breath weapon, Poison Breath, can be unleashed in a 90-foot cone, inflicting considerable poison damage with the possibility of hindering poison immunity in creatures that fail to save against it. Its Honeyed Words ability manipulates opponents, forcing them to attack allies while moving towards the dragon, thus showcasing its command over social dynamics.

In reactive situations, the dragon can utilize a Tail Attack to strike back at melee attackers within 10 feet, maintaining pressure against aggressors.

Furthermore, the Great Wyrm Green Dragon has legendary actions that include the ability to use Honeyed Words again, unleash a terrifying Roar to frighten multiple foes, or execute a Wing Attack to clear space around itself, showcasing its dominance in combat and control over the battlefield. Each legendary action proves to be a tactical advantage, allowing it to respond swiftly to threats.
