The Bat is a tiny beast known for its agility and sensory abilities. With a challenge rating of 0, it serves primarily as a minor creature that can be encountered early in a campaign. While its low hit points and minimal damage output make it relatively weak in combat, its unique sensory capabilities such as echolocation and keen hearing give it a notable advantage in certain situations, particularly in stealth or exploration scenarios. The Bat can serve as an interesting environmental detail or a minor obstacle, but players should not underestimate its ability to provide information about its surroundings.

This creature has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average, making it somewhat difficult for low-level adventurers to hit without a penalty. It has 1 hit point, which results from rolling 1d4 and subtracting 1, indicating it can be easily defeated by practically any attack. The Bat can walk at a speed of 5 feet and has a flying speed of 30 feet, making it exceptionally mobile and able to escape threats quickly.

In terms of ability scores, its Strength is very low at 4, reflecting a -3 modifier, which is very bad for physical confrontations. The Dexterity score of 10 translates to an average modifier of +0, offering no real advantage or disadvantage in dexterous tasks. Its Constitution score is 12, granting it a +1 modifier that is average for resilience. The Intelligence score of 2, with a -4 modifier, indicates very poor cognitive abilities, making it incapable of understanding complex commands or strategies. The Wisdom score of 12 provides a +1 modifier, allowing for some basic awareness, while its Charisma of 4 corresponds to a very bad -3 modifier, making it ineffective in social interactions.

The Bat has a few significant special abilities. It possesses echolocation, which allows it to navigate and detect nearby creatures by sound. However, this ability is rendered ineffective if the Bat is deafened. Its keen hearing gives it an advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing, making it more likely to notice hidden creatures or incoming threats.

In combat, the Bat can perform a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit, allowing for a good chance to land the strike on unsuspecting targets. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 1 piercing damage on a hit. Notably, if the damage from the Bite reduces a Small or larger target to 0 hit points, that target takes no damage from this attack. This mechanic makes the Bat particularly useful in exploiting weakened or distracted foes, potentially allowing it to draw attention away from more significant threats.
