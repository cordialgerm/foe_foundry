The Infernal Centaur is a formidable creature with a unique combination of features that make it both a fierce combatant and a strategic ally to hell hounds. As a Medium Fiend with a lawful evil alignment, it has a strong sense of authority and dominance, particularly over fire-based creatures. It possesses a solid Armor Class of 15, making it somewhat resilient in combat. With 60 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, placing it in the Challenge Rating 4 category, which is appropriate for a mid-level encounter. One notable strength of the Infernal Centaur is its fire immunity, which allows it to stand strong against fire attacks. However, its limitations include a moderate Dexterity, which affects its mobility and initiative to some extent.

The Infernal Centaur has the following ability scores: Strength is at 17 (+3), which indicates good physical power; Dexterity is 12 (+1), representing average agility; Constitution is 16 (+3), showing strong endurance; Intelligence is 11 (+0), suggesting average reasoning skills; Wisdom is 14 (+2), indicating good perception and insight; and Charisma is 13 (+1), demonstrating above-average social influence. Its inherent skills include intimidation at +3, which is considered good for coercion, and perception at +4, considered very good for noticing details in the environment. 

This creature is immune to fire damage, making it exceptionally resistant to fire-based attacks, and it has darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions. The Infernal Centaur speaks Common, Gnomish, and Infernal, enabling effective communication with various creatures.

The Infernal Centaur has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. "Cruelty" allows the centaur to make a second attack against a target if it scores a critical hit with a melee attack, significantly increasing its potential damage output and making its attacks more dangerous. "Hell Hound Affinity" means that hell hounds respect the authority of infernal centaurs, allowing the centaur to influence them more readily during combat and resulting in disadvantage for coerced hell hounds when attacking the centaur. "Pack Tactics" provides the centaur with an advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is nearby, reinforcing its effectiveness in cooperative scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Infernal Centaur can make two attacks with its daggers during its turn if it uses the multiattack action. Each dagger attack has a +5 to hit, which is good, and does 5 piercing damage (1d4 + 3) to a single target, whether used in melee or at range up to 60 feet. Additionally, the centaur possesses the "Fiery Breath" ability, which can be used every 5 to 6 rounds. This powerful attack allows it to exhale a stream of fire in a 15-foot cone, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in a substantial 28 fire damage (8d6), while a successful save halves the damage, making this ability a significant threat in combat.
