The unicorn has several special abilities. It radiates a 'Good' aura, emphasizing its role as a beneficial and protective entity.

These spells provide the unicorn with versatile options for combat, exploration, and social interactions.

In combat, the unicorn can utilize a multiattack action, making one strike with its hooves and one with its horn. The hooves attack has a +8 to hit and deals 9 points of bludgeoning damage. The horn attack similarly has a +8 to hit, but inflicts 9 points of piercing damage in addition to 10 points of radiant damage. Notably, if the unicorn charges at least 20 feet toward a target before utilizing its horn attack, the target also suffers an additional 9 points of bludgeoning damage and must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw to avoid falling prone.

The Grant Boon ability, usable three times per day, allows the unicorn to touch a willing creature and bestow one of four beneficial effects. The Healing boon allows the target to regain 21 hit points and cure any diseases, while the Luck boon grants a temporary bonus for enhanced rolls over the next 24 hours. The Protection boon grants the target a glowing mote that can be used to succeed on a failed saving throw, and finally, the Resolution boon bestows immunity to being charmed or frightened for a full day. Each of these boons showcases the unicornâ€™s role as a healer and protector, enhancing its allies' capabilities and fortitude.
