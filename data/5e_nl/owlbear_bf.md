The Owlbear is a large and formidable monstrosity, resembling a nightmarish combination of an owl and a bear. Its challenge rating of 3 indicates that it could pose a significant threat to a group of adventurers, particularly due to its natural armor and impressive hit points totaling 80. The Owlbear excels in melee combat, striking fear into smaller foes with its powerful claws and piercing beak. It possesses notable strengths in physical abilities, showcasing good Strength and Constitution scores, making it dangerous in close quarters. While it lacks intelligence and charisma, its sensory capabilities are exceptional, providing it with heightened awareness of its surroundings. However, its Dexterity is only average, making it somewhat less effective in avoiding attacks compared to more agile creatures.

The Owlbear has the following attributes: Strength 20, Dexterity 12, Constitution 16, Intelligence 2, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 6. The creature boasts a Strength modifier of +5, which is very good, allowing it to deal significant melee damage. Its Dexterity modifier of +1 is average, providing minimal bonuses to initiative and Armor Class but not significantly aiding in escape or stealth. With a Constitution modifier of +3, the Owlbear has very good endurance, resulting in its substantial hit points. It has an Intelligence score of -4, making it very bad at any tasks requiring mental acuity. Its Wisdom modifier of +1 is good, enabling it to perceive and react to its environment effectively, while a Charisma score of -2 indicates very bad capability in social interactions.

In terms of special abilities, the Owlbear can glide, allowing it to slow its descent from heights and avoid falling damage, although it cannot gain altitude. Its heightened sight and smell grant it a Perception score of 18 when using those senses, making it adept at sensing its surroundings. Additionally, the Owlbear possesses Resilience against exhaustion and fear, making it durable in prolonged encounters.

The Owlbear's main combat action is the Multiattack, which allows it to make one beak attack and one claws attack. Both attacks can target the same creature, and if both hit a Medium or smaller target, the creature is grappled with an escape DC of 15. The Beak attack is a melee weapon attack that hits on a roll of +7 to hit, delivering 10 piercing damage on a success. The Claws attack similarly has a +7 to hit and inflicts 14 slashing damage, showcasing the creature's ability to deal significant harm.

When the Owlbear's hit points drop to 44 or fewer, it can unleash a Vicious Bound attack, moving up to 20 feet in a straight line, moving through the spaces of Medium or smaller creatures. The first creature it enters during this movement must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take 18 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone, with success reducing the damage by half and preventing the prone condition.

The Owlbear can also use a bonus action to perform a Rend on a creature it is grappling. This action requires the grappled creature to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. A failure results in 9 slashing damage, while a successful save halves the damage dealt. This ability showcases the Owlbear's potent offensive capabilities even against foes it has already subdued.
