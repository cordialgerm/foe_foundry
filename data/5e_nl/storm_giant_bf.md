The Storm Giant has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and versatility. "Amphibious" allows it to operate effectively in both water and land environments without any limitations. It has "Giant Attributes," granting it resistance to the stunned condition while also making it vulnerable to being knocked prone. The ability "Influence Weather" allows the Storm Giant to change weather conditions within a 3-mile radius every minute without any action required. This highly tactical ability can significantly affect both the battlefield conditions and the morale of foes. "Stormsight" gives the giant the capability to see through obscured environments, while "Updraft" provides a flying speed of 30 feet when outdoors, enabling it to maneuver effectively in large-scale battles.

In terms of attack capabilities, the Storm Giant can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to either make three attacks with its Greatsword or four with its Lightning Bolt. The Greatsword attack has a high attack bonus of +14 and can deal a substantial 30 slashing damage on a hit. Its Lightning Bolt ranged attack has a +9 to hit and inflicts 22 lightning damage, with an added effect of paralyzing the target on a critical hit unless a DC 17 Constitution save is successful. The "Thunderous Strike" is a powerful area attack, dealing significant damage to creatures within a 10-foot radius, with a potential to stun them until the end of their next turn if they fail a DC 17 Dexterity save.

Moreover, the Storm Giant can react to melee attacks through its "Stormy Rebuke," allowing it to push an attacker away and knock them prone if they fail a DC 17 Strength saving throw. This makes the Storm Giant not only a powerful offensive threat but also a strategic defender of itself in close combat.
