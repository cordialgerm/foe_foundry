The Death Knight is a formidable undead creature that serves as a powerful adversary in combat situations. With an impressive armor class of 18 and 140 hit points, it can withstand a considerable amount of damage. The Death Knight has a challenge rating of 8, indicating that it poses a significant threat to adventurers at lower levels. Its strengths lie in its ability to deal substantial necrotic damage, its magic resistance that offers it an advantage against spells, and its unique ability to return from destruction unless redeemed. However, it lacks mobility beyond a standard walking speed of 30 feet and is vulnerable to radiant damage, which can exploit its undead nature. Overall, the Death Knight is a relentless foe that embodies the themes of death and retribution.

The Death Knight possesses the following attributes: strength at +4 (good), dexterity at +0 (average), constitution at +3 (good), intelligence at +1 (average), wisdom at +5 (very good), and charisma at +4 (good). These values provide it with solid combat capabilities and make it particularly effective at influencing other creatures, especially regarding its magic and abilities.

The Death Knight has several notable special abilities. Its "Disgraced Rejuvenation" allows it to return to life 1d4 days after being destroyed, fully healed and positioned near the location of its demise unless it is redeemed. It has "Magic Resistance," granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its durability against magical attacks. The "Undead Nature" ability indicates that it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it a versatile and persistent opponent. Lastly, "Undead Resilience" grants it immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, further reinforcing its undead nature.

For actions in combat, the Death Knight can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three attacks—either Greatsword or Necrotic Bolt attacks. The Greatsword attack is a melee weapon attack that hits with a +7 modifier, delivering 11 slashing damage along with an additional 7 necrotic damage, resulting in a total of 18 damage when it connects. The "Necrotic Bolt" is a ranged spell attack with a +7 modifier and a range of 60 feet that inflicts 18 necrotic damage on a hit.

As a bonus action, the Death Knight can use "Champion’s Challenge," targeting one creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 charisma saving throw or suffer disadvantage on attack rolls against any creature other than the Death Knight until the end of its next turn, effectively drawing its focus away from other foes.

In terms of reactions, the Death Knight can use "Parry" to enhance its defense. It adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it, but it must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon to do so. Another reaction, "Soul Drain," occurs when the Death Knight reduces a humanoid to 0 hit points. The dying creature must succeed on a DC 15 wisdom saving throw or die immediately, with its soul becoming trapped in the Death Knight’s sword. This ability grants the Death Knight advantage on attack rolls for 1 minute after absorbing a soul, making it a lethal foe that can become even more dangerous unless dealt with swiftly. Moreover, the absorbed soul cannot be restored to life until the Death Knight itself is permanently destroyed, adding a grim layer to its already deadly arsenal.
