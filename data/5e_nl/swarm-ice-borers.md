The Ice Borers Swarm is a medium elemental creature that embodies the chilling aspects of winter in its attack style and abilities. It has a moderately resilient defense with an Armor Class of 12 and a total of 40 hit points, rendering it fairly tough to eliminate for lower-level adventurers. While it mainly deals damage through its swarm tactics, its ability to inflict significant cold damage makes it particularly dangerous, especially against warm-blooded opponents. However, its Strength score is notably low, indicating a weakness in physical confrontations, and its combat effectiveness can be severely affected when its hit points are reduced. This creature thrives in icy environments and utilizes its unique abilities to gain an upper hand in battle.

The Ice Borers Swarm possesses the following attributes:
- Strength: 7 (-2), which translates to a very bad modifier indicating it is incapable of performing physical feats effectively.
- Dexterity: 15 (+2), resulting in a good modifier that enhances its ability to dodge attacks or act quickly in combat.
- Constitution: 10 (+0), an average modifier suggesting its resilience is neither strong nor weak.
- Intelligence: 3 (-4), showing very bad intelligence, making it limited in problem-solving and strategy.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), which means it has an average perception of its surroundings.
- Charisma: 3 (-4), marking it as very bad, indicating poor social interaction skills.

This swarm also has several notable abilities:
- **False Appearance:** While motionless, the swarm can camouflage itself as a cluster of icicles, providing it with a strong tactical advantage. This ability ceases to function if the swarm has damaged a creature with blood within the last two hours, making it more vulnerable after an attack.
- **Frigid Mass:** Any creature starting its turn within the swarm's space takes 4 (1d8) cold damage, which can quickly deplete the health of unfortunate targets who linger too long in its vicinity.
- **Heatsense:** The swarm is capable of detecting warm-blooded creatures within a 30-foot range, allowing it to effectively hunt and target those who would be most affected by its cold attacks.
- **Spider Climb:** This ability grants the swarm movement across difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without needing to make ability checks, giving it an advantage in terms of mobility.
- **Swarm:** This trait enables the swarm to occupy the space of other creatures and move through extremely small openings, reinforcing its role as a constant threat that can infiltrate spaces easily. However, it cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points while in this form.

In terms of actions, the swarm can make an:
- **Impale Attack:** This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit within its space. On a successful hit, it deals either 7 (2d6) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage, or if the swarm is at half its hit points or fewer, it deals reduced damage of 3 (1d6) piercing plus 4 (1d8) cold damage. This versatile damage output allows it to remain dangerous even when weakened.

Overall, the Ice Borers Swarm serves as a formidable adversary in cold environments, capable of inflicting significant cold damage and taking advantage of its mobility and disguise to ambush foes effectively.
