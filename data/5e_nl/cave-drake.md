The Cave Drake is a large neutral dragon with a formidable presence in any subterranean environment. Its armor class of 13, bolstered by natural armor, along with its considerable hit points totaling 95, makes it a tough opponent. Rated with a challenge difficulty of 3 and providing 700 experience points, the Cave Drake is well-suited for encounters designed for moderate-level adventurers. It boasts notable strengths in melee combat with a strong physical build and advantageous abilities that enhance its stealth and surprise attack potential. However, its intelligence is low, which can limit its strategic capabilities in more complex encounters.

The Cave Drake has the following attributes: a Strength of 17 with a modifier of +3, indicating it is very good at physical attacks; a Dexterity of 14 with a +2 modifier, rating as average for agility; a Constitution of 18 contributing a +4 modifier, which is very good for resilience and health. Its Intelligence is notably low at 6 (-2), resulting in very bad cognitive skills; Wisdom is at 13 (+1), which is average; and Charisma stands at 11 (+0), reflecting an average social presence.

In terms of skills, the Cave Drake possesses a Perception skill of +3, making its ability to notice things fairly good, and a Stealth skill of +4, which is very good for sneaking around in its rocky habitat. It has damage immunity to poison and is also immune to the poisoned condition, providing a solid defense against various attacks. The creature has darkvision extending 90 feet, allowing it to see in the dark, and a passive Perception score of 13. It can communicate in the Draconic language.

The Cave Drake has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Its "Ambusher" ability grants it advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised, allowing for deadly opening strikes. The "Keen Smell" feature gives it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks based on smell, enabling it to detect foes more easily. With "Spider Climb," it can traverse difficult surfaces, including walking on ceilings without any setbacks. "Stone Camouflage" provides advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in rocky terrain, reinforcing its stealthy nature.

In combat, the Cave Drake can make multiple attacks with its "Multiattack" action, enabling it to perform three separate strikes: one bite and two claw attacks. For the bite, it makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit against a target within a 5-foot reach, dealing an average of 10 piercing damage (2d6 + 3) on a hit. Its claw attacks also have a +5 to hit and deal an average of 7 slashing damage (1d8 + 3) on a successful strike.

Additionally, the Cave Drake can use a ranged ability called "Blinding Spit," which is usable after a recharge on rolls of 5 or 6. This attack has a +4 to hit within a range of 30 feet and targets one creature. On a hit, it causes the affected creature to become poisoned for 1 minute. The target must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded while suffering from the poison effect, adding a potent crowd control element to the Cave Drake's arsenal.
