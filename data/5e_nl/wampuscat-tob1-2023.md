The Wampus Cat is a Medium chaotic neutral monstrosity known for its cunning and charm. It possesses a unique combination of offensive capabilities and manipulative skills, making it a versatile threat in combat. The creature has a respectable Armor Class of 14 and a pool of hit points totaling 39, providing it with decent durability for its challenge rating of 1. With sharp claws and a powerful vocal presence, the Wampus Cat can deal significant damage while also imposing status effects on opponents through its Sweet Song and Terrifying Yowl abilities. While it excels against divine beings due to its Divine Animosity advantage, its polymorphic ability allows it to adapt and infiltrate various situations, creating both opportunities for ambush and avenues for deception. 

The Wampus Cat has the following physical attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 18 (+4), Constitution 15 (+2), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 16 (+3). Its Dexterity score of 18 is exceptional, allowing it to be very agile and proficient in avoiding attacks, while its Charisma score gives it good social manipulation capabilities. The creature has skills in Deception and Persuasion, both of which are valued at +5, making its ability to influence others also very good. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, enhancing its effectiveness in stealth and ambush scenarios. 

The Wampus Cat's special ability, Divine Animosity, grants it advantage on attack rolls against divine or celestial beings, such as clerics or paladins. This advantage reflects a very good capability to damage foes that might otherwise rely on protection from their divine powers. 

For its actions, the Wampus Cat can use its Claw attack in its true form, rolling a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 11 slashing damage, calculated as 2d6 + 4. This damage output represents a good level of threat in melee combat. 

The Sweet Song ability is a recharge action that takes place on rolls of 5 or 6. It allows the Wampus Cat to charm creatures within a 60-foot radius that can hear the song, requiring them to pass a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they become charmed for one minute, with the potential to repeat the save at the end of their turns. This ability can significantly impact battlefield dynamics, as charmed creatures may be less likely to attack the Wampus Cat and may even be more susceptible to manipulation. However, creatures that succeed in their saving throw instantly gain immunity to this ability for 24 hours. 

The Terrifying Yowl is another recharge action that also requires a roll of 5 or 6. This ability affects creatures within 15 feet, compelling them to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. A failed save results in 10 thunder damage (3d6) and inflicts the frightened condition until the end of their next turn, a powerful effect that can disrupt enemy actions. If a creature succeeds in its save, it only takes half damage and is not frightened. 

As a bonus action, the Wampus Cat can use its Change Shape ability to polymorph into a Medium female Humanoid or revert back to its true form. This transformation does not alter its statistics, but it allows the Wampus Cat to blend into society or escape a situation more easily. Equipment worn or carried by the Wampus Cat also changes with its form, providing additional tactical options. This ability makes the Wampus Cat a versatile and unpredictable adversary in any encounter.
