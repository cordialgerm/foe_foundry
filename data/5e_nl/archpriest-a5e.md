The Archpriest is a powerful Medium humanoid, known for its combination of martial prowess and potent magical abilities. With an exceptional Armor Class of 20 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 150, the Archpriest is capable of enduring considerable damage while also providing substantial healing and support to its allies. This creature excels in both offensive and defensive roles, utilizing a mix of devastating spells and physical attacks to overwhelm opponents. However, it has some weaknesses, particularly in its Dexterity, which is average, making it less nimble than other combatants. As a challenge rating 16 creature, it poses a significant threat in battle, capable of dealing large amounts of damage while also aiding its allies with healing spells and buffs.

The Archpriest has several notable special abilities. "Anointed Healing" allows any spell it casts that restores hit points to heal an extra 11 points (2d10), increasing its effectiveness in supporting allies. "Magic Resistance" grants the Archpriest advantage on saving throws against spells, making it exceptionally tough against magical attacks. As a powerful spellcaster, with its spellcasting ability tied to Wisdom, the Archpriest has a Spell Save DC of 18 and a +10 bonus to hit with spell attacks, indicating exceptional capability in casting spells.

The Archpriest's spellcasting includes a range of cleric spells, with the following prepared: 
- Cantrips such as "light," "mending," "sacred flame," "spare the dying," and "thaumaturgy" can be used at will.
- For 1st-level spells, it can cast "bane," "bless," "cure wounds," and "inflict wounds."

In combat, the Archpriest uses its "Multiattack" to strike twice per turn. The "Mace" attack has a +9 to hit and deals 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage with an additional 10 (3d6) radiant damage, making it formidable even with physical attacks. The spell "Flame Strike" creates a column of divine flame that requires a Dexterity saving throw, causing fire and radiant damage, while "Fire Storm" unleashes flames in a large area, also having devastating effects on objects and terrain. 

The "Holy Aura" spell provides a significant defensive advantage by giving targets within a 30-foot radius advantage on saving throws, while also imposing disadvantage on attacks against them. Additionally, any fiend or undead hitting a target is at risk of being blinded. The Archpriest can also use "Divine Word," which has effects that can incapacitate or even kill enemies based on their current hit points, significantly changing the tide of battle in its favor. 

Overall, the Archpriest serves as a formidable enemy or powerful ally, embodying the roles of healer, protector, and fierce combatant within the realm of Dungeons and Dragons.
