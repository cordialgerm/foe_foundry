The Stone Colossus is a gargantuan construct designed for frontline combat, serving as an imposing protector or weapon in battles. With a formidable Armor Class of 17 and a robust pool of 263 hit points, it can withstand significant damage while delivering its own devastating attacks. The colossus possesses exceptional physical strength, represented by a Strength score of 22, which allows it to deal substantial melee damage. However, it lacks mobility and dexterity, indicated by its average Dexterity score of 10. While it has some limitations, such as low Intelligence and Charisma scores, rendering it incapable of complex thought or negotiation, its notable abilities make it a powerful adversary. With a challenge rating of 16, the Stone Colossus yields 15,000 experience points upon defeat, making it a valuable foe for adventurers.

The Stone Colossus has several attributes that influence its performance in combat. It has a Strength score of 22, granting a +6 modifier, which is exceptional for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is average at 10, so the creature isn't particularly nimble, granting a +0 modifier, while its Constitution score of 20 provides a +5 modifier, indicative of its durability. The Colossus has a poor Intelligence score of 3 (-4 modifier), indicating it cannot engage in analytical tasks. With a Wisdom score of 12 (+1 modifier), it has average perception and insight, while its Charisma is extremely low at 1 (-5 modifier), making it ineffective in social interactions. The creature is immune to several types of damage, including poison and psychic damage, as well as damage from nonmagical, non-adamantine weapons. It also has immunity to various conditions, like being charmed or frightened.

The Stone Colossus has several special abilities that enhance its resilience and combat effectiveness. Its Immutable Form means it cannot be altered in any way, providing a strong defense against manipulatory effects. Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it harder to affect with magical attacks. The Constructed Nature ability signifies that it does not require air, food, or sleep, thus preventing the need for rest. With Legendary Resistance, it can choose to succeed on saving throws it would normally fail; this power can be used twice per day, but the creature will take 20 hit points of damage when it does. As a Siege Monster, it inflicts double damage on objects and structures, making it a threat to fortifications.

In combat, the Stone Colossus can perform multiple attacks. Its Multiattack feature allows it to make two slam attacks in one turn. The Slam attack has a +10 to hit and accomplishes an average of 19 bludgeoning damage. For ranged attacks, it can use the Rock ability, hitting targets from a distance with a +10 to hit and inflicting 30 bludgeoning damage; a failed DC 18 Strength saving throw forces the target to fall prone.

The colossus also has a powerful bonus action called Slow, which can target multiple creatures within 30 feet, compelling them to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the slow condition for a minute. In each of their turns, affected creatures can retry the saving throw to end the effect.

Additionally, the Stone Colossus can take legendary actions. It can seize an enemy with a melee attack, grappling and restraining them, or it can fling a target it has grappled; this action can throw the target up to 60 feet, dealing significant bludgeoning damage. The Stomp action allows it to deal damage while potentially knocking down smaller creatures. Finally, it can unleash a devastating Bolt from the Blue attack, calling down energy to strike a target area, impacting a 10-foot radius with substantial lightning damage and affecting all targets within.

Overall, the Stone Colossus serves as a formidable force on the battlefield, with high durability, powerful attacks, and a suite of abilities that make it a challenging opponent for any adventuring party.
