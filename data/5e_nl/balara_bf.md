The Balara is a formidable undead creature known for its imposing presence and terrifying abilities. As a Large creature, it boasts an armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and stands out with a significant hit point total of 114, making it quite durable in combat. This creature is classified as Challenge Rating 6, meaning it poses a substantial threat to parties of adventurers. Its primary strengths lie in its ability to instill fear with its Terrifying Luminance ability and its resilience against various forms of damage. However, it has lower intelligence and charisma, which may limit its effectiveness in social interactions and strategic planning. The Balara's actions make it a constant menace in combat, capable of both melee and ranged attacks, while its reactions allow it to pursue fleeing foes effectively.

The Balara has a Strength score of 16 (+3), indicating its physical might is above average, contributing positively to its attack abilities. Its Dexterity score of 14 (+2) allows for average agility, providing some defense and dodging capability. With a Constitution score of 14 (+2), the Balara shows good resilience against damage. However, its Intelligence is notably low at 6 (-2), indicating poor cognitive abilities, while it holds a Wisdom score of 14 (+2), demonstrating a good level of awareness and perception. Lastly, with a Charisma of 9 (-1), the Balara struggles in charm and social situations, marking it as exceptionally low for a creature of its nature.

The Balara possesses several special abilities. Firstly, its Terrifying Luminance can affect creatures that start their turn within 30 feet of it. Affected creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 14. On failure, they become frightened until the start of their next turn, resulting in their speed dropping to 0 and prohibiting any reactions. This ability is particularly effective at controlling the battlefield and debilitating its opponents. The Balara's Undead Nature means it does not need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep, granting it remarkable persistence in its actions. Additionally, its Undead Resilience provides immunity to poison damage and conditions, making it a solid opponent against certain types of attacks.

Regarding its actions, the Balara can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite and two Claw attacks, or alternatively, three Necrotic Bolt attacks. When using its Bite attack, it has a +6 bonus to hit and can inflict 16 points of piercing damage alongside an additional 4 points of necrotic damage. This attack also prevents the target from regaining hit points until the Balara's next turn. The Claw attack also has a +6 bonus to hit, dealing 13 slashing damage. For range, the Necrotic Bolt attack operates at a +5 bonus to hit and can strike from up to 60 feet away, dealing 15 necrotic damage while also preventing the target from regaining hit points until the Balara's next turn. This consistent ability to restrict healing makes the Balara a deadly foe during encounters.

Finally, the Balara has a reaction called Relentless Pursuit. When a creature it can see moves away from it, the Balara can move up to half its speed towards that creature without provoking opportunity attacks. This ability allows the Balara to maintain pressure on its targets and keeps foes from easily escaping its clutches, reinforcing its role as a relentless and intimidating adversary on the battlefield.
