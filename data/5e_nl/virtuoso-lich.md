The Virtuoso Lich is a medium undead creature with an evil alignment that serves as a twisted master of artistry and magic. With an impressive Armor Class of 17 and a substantial 123 hit points, this lich excels in both defensive and offensive capabilities. Its challenge rating of 12 indicates that it is a formidable adversary, capable of dealing substantial damage while also being highly resistant to physical attacks from nonmagical sources. The Virtuoso Lich combines spellcasting prowess with unique artistic abilities, allowing it to support allies and hinder enemies in various ways. Its strengths lie in its multiple legendary actions and the powerful effects of its spells, but it is not without its weaknesses, particularly its reliance on maintaining its phylactery to avoid destruction. 

The Virtuoso Lich has the following attributes, with abilities reflecting its complex nature: Strength 11 (average), Dexterity 16 (good), Constitution 15 (average), Intelligence 15 (average), Wisdom 12 (average), and Charisma 20 (exceptional). When it comes to saving throws, it excels in Dexterity (+7), Wisdom (+6), and Charisma (+9), indicating very good resilience against specific challenges. In terms of skills, it has high proficiency in Deception (+9), Persuasion (+9), and a moderate proficiency in Perception (+5). The creature has immunities to poison damage, conditions including blinded, charmed, and paralyzed, and advantages against effects that would turn undead. With a notable truesight range of 60 feet and spoken command of several languages, it can easily manipulate and deceive opponents.

The Virtuoso Lich possesses several special abilities that enhance its capabilities in combat and beyond. Legendary Resistance allows it to succeed in saving throws it would otherwise fail, with three uses per day, adding a layer of durability. The Rejuvenation ability specifies that if the lich is destroyed but still has its phylactery intact, it can reconstitute itself within 1d10 days. This makes it exceptionally difficult to permanently defeat the creature without addressing its phylactery. Additionally, the lich has Turn Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, further enhancing its survivability.

A defining trait of the Virtuoso Lich is its Versatile Artist ability. At the end of each long rest, the lich chooses a form of artistic expression—such as song or paint—that grants it immunity to a specific damage type associated with that art. However, this ability cannot grant immunity to force, psychic, or radiant damage, which limits its flexibility to avoid some powerful attacks.

In terms of combat, the Virtuoso Lich is a 12th-level spellcaster whose spellcasting is centered around Charisma, with a spell save DC of 17 and a +9 modifier to hit with spell attacks. It has a wide array of bard spells prepared, including cantrips like Mage Hand and Vicious Mockery, which allow for both utility and damage dealing. Its first-level spells, such as Bane and Thunderwave, can disrupt foes and control the battlefield, while higher-level spells like Dominate Person and Confusion provide additional ways to manipulate or incapacitate enemies.

The Virtuoso Lich can use Multiattack to unleash its Corrupted Art and make two Artistic Flourish melee spell attacks. The Artistic Flourish is a powerful attack that deals 12 damage of a type chosen based on its Versatile Artist trait, with an attack bonus of +9. The Corrupted Art action affects creatures based on their undead status; for non-undead targets, it deals necrotic damage contingent on a failed Constitution saving throw, while for undead creatures, it allows for healing instead, making it a powerful tool for both offense and support. 

The Call Muse ability allows the lich to charm a humanoid or beast near it, incapacitating them as they become enthralled by the lich's artistry. This effect can significantly control the battlefield by neutralizing threats. Moreover, the lich possesses three legendary actions, which include making an additional Artistic Flourish attack, moving without provoking opportunity attacks, or casting a prepared spell. The Unrestrained Art legendary action releases a wave of damage around the lich, forcing nearby creatures to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking damage and becoming prone, which can alter the tide of battle in its favor. Overall, the Virtuoso Lich combines spellcasting with unique abilities to create a complex and dangerous opponent in any encounter.
