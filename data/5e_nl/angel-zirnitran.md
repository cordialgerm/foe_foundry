The Zirnitran is a formidable celestial creature, classified as Huge and neutral good in alignment. It boasts an impressive Armor Class of 19 thanks to its natural armor and has an enormous pool of Hit Points totaling 325, making it highly resilient in combat. With a Speed of 30 feet on the ground and 80 feet in flight, it is versatile in movement. The creature holds a Challenge Rating of 20, indicating a significant threat level, and offers an experience reward of 25,000 XP for defeating it. The Zirnitran’s strengths include powerful magical attacks, numerous resistances, and impressive abilities that enhance its effectiveness in battle, but it is also vulnerable to certain conditions if caught off-guard.

The Zirnitran's ability scores reflect its celestial nature: it has a Strength of 19 (+4), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 23 (+6), Intelligence of 25 (+7), Wisdom of 25 (+7), and Charisma of 20 (+5). The Strength modifier is good, while Dexterity is average. Its exceptional Constitution grants high durability, and the Intelligence and Wisdom modifiers are both exceptional, allowing it to excel in knowledge and perception checks. Charisma, while good, helps in interactions and spellcasting.

In combat, the Zirnitran has a range of special abilities that define its role. Its Angelic Weapons feature turns all weapon attacks into magical strikes that deal an additional 5d8 radiant damage upon hitting a target, greatly enhancing its offensive capabilities. The Aura of Balance prevents creatures within a 20-foot radius from gaining advantage or disadvantage on their rolls, demonstrating its control over the battlefield's dynamics. Divine Awareness enables the Zirnitran to discern lies, adding a layer of tactical insight.

It is especially resilient against powerful dragon attacks due to the Dragon Watcher ability, granting it advantage on saving throws against dragon breath weapons and negating damage on a successful save. The Hardened Scales ability gives it resistance against critical hits, turning them into normal hits instead, enhancing its survivability. With Immortal Nature, the Zirnitran does not require sustenance or rest, making it a persistent threat. It also has Legendary Resistance, allowing it to automatically succeed on failed saving throws three times a day, and Magic Resistance, granting an advantage on saving throws against spells.

One of its most visually striking abilities is Glimpse from the Heavens, which can frighten and potentially blind multiple creatures within a 60-foot range, requiring a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw to resist. This ability can turn the tide of battle by incapacitating opponents. It can also use Secrets of the Hidden Hoard twice per day to cast spells of 8th level or lower as an action, providing further versatility.

The Zirnitran can engage in multi-attacks by using its Glimpse from the Heavens ability followed by three Anointed Claws or Draconic Blasts. Anointed Claws is a melee weapon attack that deals 11 slashing damage and 22 radiant damage on success, while the Draconic Blast is a ranged spell attack dealing 29 radiant damage that can be changed to other elemental damage types.

It can unleash Sacred Flame Breath in a large 90-foot cone, causing 33 fire and 33 radiant damage, forcing a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw for half damage while also negating lower-level spells within the area. 

As a reaction, the Zirnitran can employ the Six-Scaled Aegis, which grants it resistance to a damage type for one minute after taking damage, including the damage that triggered the reaction.

Finally, the Zirnitran is equipped with legendary actions that enhance its capabilities further. It can detect the location of dragons, move without provoking opportunity attacks, make additional attacks, cast spells, or create a magical feathered shield that increases a creature's Armor Class by 2 and grants 20 temporary hit points until the end of its next turn. This combination of attributes, mechanics, and abilities makes the Zirnitran an exceptional adversary or ally in any campaign.
