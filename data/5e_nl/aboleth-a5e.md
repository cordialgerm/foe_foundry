The Aboleth is a large aberration known for its cunning intellect and formidable presence, often lurking in the depths of dark waters. With a robust armor class of 17 and a substantial pool of hit points at 171, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who venture too close to its lair. The creature's speed allows it to move swiftly in water, swimming at 40 feet, but its terrestrial movement is limited to only 10 feet. The Aboleth operates at challenge rating 11, making it a powerful adversary for parties of lower levels, and it can be expected to provide a serious combat challenge with its multiattack capabilities and potent special abilities.

The Aboleth boasts an impressive array of physical and mental attributes. Its Strength is 20, providing an exceptional +5 modifier, allowing for powerful melee attacks, while its Dexterity is average at 12 (+1), and its Constitution is very good at 18 (+4), granting it durability in battle. Intellectually, the Aboleth is outstanding, with both Intelligence and Wisdom at 20, translating into +5 modifiers that enhance its spellcasting and perception. Its Charisma also stands at a notable 18 (+4), allowing for effective social interactions and innate spellcasting. The creature excels in saving throws with very good proficiency in Constitution (+8), Intelligence (+9), and Wisdom (+9), making it resilient against various effects.

Additionally, the Aboleth possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat strategies. Its amphibious nature allows it to breathe both air and water, making it versatile in different environments. With innate spellcasting rooted in Charisma, the Aboleth can cast spells such as Detect Thoughts, Project Image, and Phantasmal Force three times a day without the need for any material components. This ability grants it significant advantages in manipulating and controlling encounters through telepathy and illusions.

In combat, the Aboleth can utilize its Multiattack feature to strike three times with its tentacles, which have a reach of 15 feet and deal an average of 19 bludgeoning damage. Moreover, the tentacle attack can inflict a debilitating disease known as Sea Change. When an opponent is hit, they must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in contracting the disease, causing disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and a time-sensitive transformation that forces the victim to become more aquatic in nature if not treated. This disease can be removed with high-level spells and becomes even more dangerous should the afflicted remain dry for extended periods.

The Aboleth can also unleash its Slimy Cloud ability once per day while bloodied. This action creates a heavily obscured area filled with inky slime that poisons creatures caught within it unless they succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. The damage dealt is significant, averaging 44 poison damage for those who fail.

As a formidable creature, the Aboleth can utilize legendary actions to extend its influence during combat. It has the ability to move up to its swim speed without provoking opportunity attacks, and it can use a telepathic summon to charm and direct a creature to move towards it. For powerful mind control, it can target one creature affected by the Sea Change disease with its Baleful Charm, forcing them to obey its commands, while its Soul Drain ability allows it to deal psychic damage to charmed creatures and regain hit points, enhancing its survivability.

In summary, the Aboleth is a dangerous foe with significant combat prowess, spellcasting capabilities, and the potential to disrupt the tactics of adventurers through disease and mind control. Its unique abilities create a demanding challenge for any party, making encounters with it both strategic and perilous.
