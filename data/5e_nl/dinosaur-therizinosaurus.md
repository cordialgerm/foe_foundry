The Therizinosaurus is a huge, powerful beast categorized as unaligned, known for its impressive physicality and resilience on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 13, it benefits from natural armor, providing it a decent level of defense for its size. It has 95 hit points, reflecting a robust constitution that makes it a formidable opponent. This dinosaur boasts a Challenge Rating of 5, indicating that it presents a moderate challenge for a party of adventurers. One of its standout attributes is a very high Strength score of 21, granting it exceptional offensive capabilities, while its Dexterity is relatively low at 9, resulting in a bad modifier. It moves with a speed of 40 feet, allowing it to traverse the battlefield effectively.

The Therizinosaurus has a Constitution score of 17, which provides a good modifier that contributes to its large pool of hit points. It possesses average Wisdom at 14, giving it a good perception skill, though it lacks intelligence, reflected in its very bad score of 3. Charisma is similarly low, at 7, resulting in a very bad modifier, rendering it ineffective in social interactions. 

One of its notable special abilities is Relentless, which recharges on a short or long rest. This ability allows the Therizinosaurus to remain in the fight longer, as it can endure lethal damage; if it would be reduced to 0 hit points after taking 20 damage or less, it instead drops to 1 hit point, allowing it to continue battling.

In combat, the Therizinosaurus can make multiple attacks in a turn thanks to its Multiattack feature, where it can perform two claw attacks against its foes. Each claw attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit, making it a good offensive option. When successful, a claw inflicts a significant 18 (3d8 + 5) slashing damage. Additionally, the target of the claw attack must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which not only hinders their ability to act but can also provide an advantage to the Therizinosaurus and potential allies in subsequent turns. Overall, the Therizinosaurus is a strong creature that excels in brute force and survivability, making it a dangerous adversary in any encounter.
