The Ogre is a large and formidable giant known for its brute strength and intimidating presence on the battlefield. With an armor class of 12, it possesses a decent level of resilience, but it is not impervious to damage. The Ogre has a total of 59 hit points, providing it with a good amount of stamina for combat situations. While its challenge rating is 2, indicating it poses a moderate threat, its highest attribute is Strength, scoring a notable 19 (+4), making its physical attacks particularly devastating. However, the Ogre's Dexterity is quite low at 8 (-1), resulting in a very bad agility, making it less effective in dodging attacks. The creature's intelligence, wisdom, and charisma values reflect its simple-mindedness, leading to average social and mental capacities. The Ogre's abilities are primarily focused on melee attacks, making it adept at engaging in direct confrontations, although its lack of finesse and lesser ranged options could serve as limitations in more strategic encounters.

The Ogre has the following ability scores: Strength at 19 (+4), which is exceptional and allows for strong melee attacks; Dexterity at 8 (-1), which is very bad and impairs its ability to dodge; Constitution at 16 (+3), which is good, contributing to its hit points; Intelligence at 10 (+0), which is average; Wisdom at 10 (+0), also average; and Charisma at 8 (-1), which is very bad and indicates social difficulties.

In terms of skills, the Ogre does not excel, but it has darkvision up to 60 feet, which allows it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Its passive perception score is 10, indicating an average ability to notice hidden threats. The Ogre can communicate using Common and Giant languages, which enhances its interactions within various encounters.

The Ogre has three significant actions it can perform during its turn in combat which are:

1. **Greatclub:** This is the Ogre's primary melee attack, where it rolls a +6 to hit against a target within 5 feet. When it successfully hits, it deals an average of 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 14. If the target fails, it falls prone, making it easier for the Ogre or its allies to strike or maneuver against it.

2. **Sweeping Strike:** This attack also has a +6 to hit and targets all creatures within a 5-foot radius. It deals an average of 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, similar to the Greatclub attack. Creatures of Medium size or smaller must also make a Strength saving throw against the same DC of 14. A failed save results in being pushed 10 feet away from the Ogre, potentially disrupting their positions in the battle.

3. **Javelin:** The Ogre can employ this attack as a melee or ranged option, having a range of 30 feet for close combat or 120 feet for long-range. It rolls +6 to hit and on a successful strike, it inflicts an average damage of 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

Overall, the Ogre is a brute force creature best utilized in close combat scenarios, where it can leverage its strength to dominate foes, but its limitations in mobility and intelligence may hinder it in more strategic environments.
