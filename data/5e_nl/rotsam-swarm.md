The Rotsam Swarm is a large ooze creature characterized by its unaligned nature and an affinity for necrotic energy. This monster thrives in environments where decay is prevalent, representing a menacing force with strong defensive capabilities due to its immunities and resistances. The Rotsam Swarm exhibits significant health and can endure prolonged encounters, thanks to its high hit points and ability to inflict debilitating diseases. Its main offensive threat lies in its diseased bites, which can not only cause substantial damage but also spread a dangerous disease called bog rot. The Rotsam Swarm's weaknesses include a low Armor Class, making it vulnerable to concentrated attacks, and its poor Dexterity score, which results in clumsiness.

The Rotsam Swarm has an Armor Class of 9, indicating very bad defensive capability, and possesses 142 hit points, derived from 15d10+60, which provides a good amount of durability in battle. The creature's speed is 10 feet when walking and 30 feet when swimming, allowing it to navigate both land and water environments effectively.

The attributes of the Rotsam Swarm include a Strength score of 19 (+4), which is exceptional and allows it to deal considerable melee damage, while its Dexterity score of 8 (-1) is very bad, limiting its agility and making it easier to hit. The Constitution score is 18 (+4), providing it with good resilience against combat damage. Meanwhile, the Intelligence score is 1 (-5), making it very bad in terms of cognitive functions, and Wisdom at 9 (-1) is average, indicating some perception but not remarkable. The Charisma score of 6 (-2) is very bad, suggesting it has minimal social influence or presence.

The Rotsam Swarm has several notable special abilities. One of these is **Bog Rot**, where a creature that fails its saving throw against the swarm's diseased bite must deal with a debilitating infection that lowers its hit point maximum by 7 (2d6) each day until cured. The infection also creates a foul odor, giving advantage on checks to locate the infected creature. If the creature's hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. The **Spider Climb** ability permits the Rotsam Swarm to move effortlessly along difficult terrain, including ceilings, without any struggle or need for checks. Additionally, the **Swarm** ability allows it to occupy the same space as its targets, providing versatility in battle.

For its actions, the Rotsam Swarm utilizes **Diseased Bites**, executing a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit. The attack can reach any creature in the swarm's space and inflicts 10 (4d4) piercing damage along with 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a successful hit. If the swarm is at half hit points or lower, the damage decreases to 5 (2d4) piercing and 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract the bog rot disease, compounding the threat posed by the swarm.

Overall, the Rotsam Swarm combines strong health, the ability to inflict severe status effects, and a unique movement ability, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. However, its low Armor Class and poor Dexterity may leave it vulnerable to attacks if not properly supported.
