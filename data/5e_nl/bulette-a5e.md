The Bulette is a formidable large monstrosity known for its brute strength and tenacity in combat. Its notable ability to burrow allows it to surprise unsuspecting foes while its powerful attacks can deal substantial damage. With a challenging rating of 6, the Bulette poses a significant threat to adventurers who venture into its territory. However, despite its physical prowess and low intelligence, which is rated at a very bad -4, the Bulette compensates with high scores in strength and constitution, reflecting its hardy nature. Its weaknesses include a lack of ranged attacks and reliance on direct confrontation.

The Bulette has an Armor Class (AC) of 17, making it relatively difficult to hit, and it possesses 95 hit points, indicating it can endure a good amount of damage before being taken down. It has a walking speed of 40 feet and a burrowing speed of 40 feet, allowing it to navigate both the ground and underground terrains adeptly. In terms of ability scores, it has a strength of 18, granting it a very good +4 modifier for melee attacks; its dexterity is average at 10, which doesn't particularly aid it in combat maneuvers; and its constitution is also 18, which supports its substantial hit points and resilience.

The Bulette has specific saving throw abilities, including an intelligence saving throw modifier of -1, reflecting its lack of mental acuity. It has a perception skill bonus of +3, indicating it is somewhat aware of its surroundings, aided by its darkvision and tremorsense, each effective within a range of 60 feet. The creature cannot communicate using languages, but utilizes its formidable presence to navigate combat scenarios.

One of its special abilities is called "Steely Hide." This unique trait inflicts a penalty on melee attacks made with nonmagical weapons, as a weapon that rolls a natural 1 breaks upon hitting the Bulette. This deters attackers from recklessly engaging in melee combat.

In terms of actions, the Bulette has several options. Its "Leap" ability, which can be used once it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows it to jump both horizontally and vertically up to half of its speed without suffering opportunity attacks. When landing, it can affect every creature in its landing space, forcing them to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and become knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is pushed 5 feet back.

The "Burrow" action allows the Bulette to change its location underground without incurring attacks of opportunity, enabling it to reposition effectively. If it surfaces within 5 feet of a creature, it can then make a bite attack against that creature.

Its primary offensive action is the "Bite," which is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully hits a target, it inflicts a staggering 30 (4d12 + 4) piercing damage, showcasing its threat level in direct combat.

The Bulette also has two significant reaction abilities. "Jaw Clamp" can be executed once per day when an enemy misses it with a melee attack. The Bulette responds by making a bite attack against that enemy. If the attack hits, the opponent becomes grappled, meaning they are restrained until they can escape with a DC 15 check, limiting their options in battle. The second reaction, "Hard Carapace," is activated once per day as a defensive maneuver. After sustaining damage from an attack, the Bulette lies low, raising its AC to 21 and gaining advantage on all saving throws until the start of its next turn, thus enhancing its survivability in confrontations.

Overall, the Bulette is a relentless opponent characterized by physical might, surprise tactics, and durable defenses, making it a challenging foe in any encounter.
