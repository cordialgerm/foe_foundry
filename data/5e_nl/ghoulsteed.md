The Ghoulsteed is a large undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It possesses a robust presence on the battlefield, with a relatively high Armor Class of 13 and significant hit points totaling 85. This makes it resilient against many forms of attack, with the Challenge Rating of 3 indicating it presents a moderate threat to adventurers. The creature is notable for its speed and mobility, particularly through its Pounce ability, which allows it to knock opponents prone, creating tactical opportunities during combat. The Ghoulsteed is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, but it is less effective in mental attributes with low Intelligence and Charisma scores. Overall, while it has strengths in physical combat and survivability, it does not excel in social interactions or spells.

The Ghoulsteed has the following attributes: Strength at 18 (+4, very good) indicates its physical might and ability to inflict substantial damage; Dexterity at 10 (+0, average) shows it has no bonuses to its agility, which may limit its defensive capabilities; Constitution at 16 (+3, good) contributes positively to its durability; Intelligence at 6 (-2, very bad) signifies poor cognitive abilities, rendering it ineffective in any intelligence-based tasks; Wisdom at 10 (+0, average) shows it has standard perception; and Charisma at 6 (-2, very bad) suggests it lacks social skills.

In terms of skills, the Ghoulsteed has a +2 bonus to Perception, making it somewhat aware of its surroundings, particularly in low-light conditions due to its darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet. It speaks Common and Darakhul, which provides it with limited interaction capabilities.

The Ghoulsteed's special abilities are designed to enhance its combat effectiveness. Pounce allows the Ghoulsteed to move swiftly toward a target, providing an opportunity to both knock them down with a successful bite attack and follow up with a bonus action bite against a prone target. This ability can significantly alter combat dynamics as it can incapacitate players and make them easier targets. The Sprint ability, usable three times per day, allows the creature to Dash, maximizing its movement on the battlefield. This, combined with its Pounce ability, makes it a fast and aggressive combatant. Undead Fortitude is particularly noteworthy as it enables the Ghoulsteed to potentially survive attacks that would normally reduce it to zero hit points. Instead of falling, it can come back from the brink by rolling a Constitution saving throw, making it much harder to dispatch in battle.

For actions, the Ghoulsteed can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two bite attacks in one turn. The Bite attack has a to-hit bonus of +6 and deals substantial damage, averaging 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. Additionally, each successful Bite attack grants it 5 temporary hit points, which can stack to a maximum of 10. This ability to gain temporary hit points with each successful attack enhances its durability further and allows it to sustain itself longer in combat. 

Overall, the Ghoulsteed is a dangerous undead opponent, leveraging its mobility, strength, and resilience to challenge adventurers effectively in a variety of combat situations.
