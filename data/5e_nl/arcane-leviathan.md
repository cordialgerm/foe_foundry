The Arcane Leviathan is a formidable gargantuan construct, renowned for both its immense size and magical capabilities. Employed as a powerful guardian or weapon by its creator, this creature excels in aquatic environments, showcasing impressive swimming speed and devastating electrical attacks. With an impressive armor class of 17 and a massive pool of 279 hit points, it can withstand significant amounts of damage. The Arcane Leviathan's challenge rating of 16 indicates that it poses a substantial threat to adventuring parties. While its strength and constitution are exceptional, its dexterity is very poor, making it vulnerable to attacks that require nimbleness. It possesses a variety of damaging abilities and spells, significantly enhancing its combat prowess.

The Arcane Leviathan has the following attributes: Strength 26 (+8), Dexterity 5 (-3), Constitution 21 (+5), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 17 (+3), and Charisma 8 (-1). With an exceptional Strength score, it is capable of overpowering opponents with ease. Its Constitution is also very good, providing it with substantial hit points. Meanwhile, its poor Dexterity impacts its overall agility in combat, categorized as very bad. The Wisdom score is good, enabling it to resist mental effects effectively. Intelligence and Charisma are both very bad, limiting its proficiency in knowledge-based activities and interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Arcane Leviathan has bonuses of +1 for Strength, +1 for Constitution, +2 for Intelligence, +8 for Wisdom, and +4 for Charisma. These modifiers signify varying effectiveness, with Wisdom being very good, making it highly resilient against effects requiring Wisdom saves. It possesses good skills in perception, with a +3 modifier.

This creature is immune to several types of damage, including lightning, poison, and psychic damage, which makes it resilient against many common attacks. It also has resistances to acid and thunder damage, as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The Arcane Leviathan is immune to conditions like being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it extraordinarily difficult to hinder through typical magical effects. Its senses include truesight out to 120 feet, providing it with an exceptional ability to perceive its surroundings, along with a passive perception of 13.

The Arcane Leviathan boasts several notable special abilities. Its "Construct Nature" means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to function continuously without breaks. The "Impregnable" ability ensures that if it succeeds on a saving throw against an effect that would usually deal half damage, it instead suffers no damage, making it incredibly resilient. Its "Siege Monster" trait allows it to deal double damage to objects and structures, which is useful in combat against fortifications or for demolishing obstacles.

The Arcane Leviathan can perform a "Multiattack," permitting it to execute one Slam attack and two Claw attacks, or four Lightning Bolt spell strikes in one turn, granting it excellent versatility in combat. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +13 to hit, extending 15 feet, dealing 26 (4d8+8) slashing damage. Should the target be Huge or smaller, it gets grappled, with a DC of 19 required to escape. The Slam attack similarly has a +13 to hit and affects a target within 5 feet, delivering 18 (4d4+8) bludgeoning damage while forcing the target to make a DC 19 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone.

Its ranged capabilities are formidable due to the Lightning Bolt spell, which allows it to target enemies up to 600 feet away with a +8 to hit, dealing 17 (4d6+3) lightning damage. When the Arcane Leviathan uses "Pylon Discharge" (available on a recharge of 5-6), it sends out a powerful surge of energy to a visible point within 200 feet. All creatures within a 30-foot radius of the point take 45 (10d8) lightning damage and are blinded until the end of their next turn, with a DC 19 Dexterity save allowing them to take only half damage and avoid the blinded condition.

As a bonus action, the Arcane Leviathan can use "Arcane Barrage" to target a creature within 120 feet, causing that target to glow with arcane energy. At the end of the affected creature's next turn, it suffers 35 (10d6) radiant damage, and a DC 19 Constitution save allows it to take half damage. This damage is shared evenly between the target and all creatures within 10 feet of it, excluding the Leviathan itself. This ability adds significant pressure in combat, as enemies find themselves potentially damaging their allies while engaging with the Arcane Leviathan.
