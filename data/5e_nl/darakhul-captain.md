The Darakhul Captain is a formidable Medium undead creature that embodies the epitome of tactical malevolence. With a lawful evil alignment, it serves as a master manipulator and fierce combatant on the battlefield. The captain boasts a high armor class of 16, thanks to its breastplate, and an impressive pool of hit points totaling 165, granting it remarkable durability. Its challenge rating of 9 implies that it poses a significant threat to adventurers, rewarding foes with 5,000 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the Darakhul Captain wields a range of abilities that make it dangerous both in melee and at range, while its special features enhance its combat effectiveness and leadership role in undead hordes. However, its susceptibility to sunlight reduces its effectiveness in direct light, making it vulnerable in certain environments.

In terms of physical attributes, the Darakhul Captain has a Strength score of 18, granting it a good modifier of +4, allowing it to excel in melee attacks. Its Dexterity at 16 (+3) gives it a good modifier for maneuverability and ranged attacks. The Constitution of 17 (+3) ensures it can sustain damage effectively. An Intelligence of 14 (+2) reflects average cognitive abilities, beneficial for tactical decisions. Wisdom and Charisma scores of 14 (+2) and 18 (+4), respectively, highlight its exceptional capability in influencing and deceiving others, particularly with skills relevant to its undead nature.

The Captain is proficient in Insight (+6), Intimidation (+8), and Perception (+6), showcasing its ability to read situations and assert dominance through fear. It enjoys damage immunities to poison and resists necrotic damage, while being immune to conditions like charm, exhaustion, and poison. The Darakhul Captain has darkvision extending 60 feet and a passive perception of 16, enabling it to operate effectively in the dark. It can communicate in Common, Darakhul, and Undercommon, allowing it to interact with various creatures.

Among its special abilities, the Darakhul Captain can use Master of Disguise, giving it advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks when camouflaged as a living creature, at the cost of losing its Stench ability temporarily. Its Necrotic Weapons ability ensures that all of its weapon attacks deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage, significantly increasing its threat level in combat. The Stench ability forces creatures within 5 feet to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned, creating an unsettling effect in close quarters. Sunlight Sensitivity presents a tactical challenge, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based Wisdom checks when exposed to sunlight. The Turning Defiance ability grants the Captain and nearby ghouls advantage on saves against effects that would turn undead, allowing it to maintain its tactical position against clerics and other holy influences.

The available actions for the Darakhul Captain include a Multiattack feature where it can unleash three strikes: a bite, a claw, and a longsword hit, or it can make four longsword attacks. Its Bite attack has a +8 modifier to hit and deals 13 piercing damage plus 7 necrotic damage, with the potential to contract darakhul fever on humanoid targets failing a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The Claw attack, also at +8 to hit, inflicts 11 slashing damage and can cause paralysis on non-undead creatures, making the target unable to act unless they succeed on saving throws at the end of their turns. The Longsword attack, with a +8 to hit, delivers consistent slashing damage, enhanced further by the added necrotic damage. The Heavy Crossbow offers a ranged option, with a +7 attack modifier and similar additional necrotic damage.

The Captain can unleash a powerful ability known as Imperial Conscription, which targets incapacitated creatures within 30 feet. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 27 necrotic damage on a failure, while having its hit point maximum reduced by the damage dealt, persisting until a long rest. This ability also has grave implications for humanoids, as those slain rise as ghouls under the Captain's control after several hours. The Leadership ability allows the Captain to empower allies, enabling them to add a d4 to attack rolls or saving throws within range, fostering team synergy and boosting combat effectiveness. This ability can be used again after a short or long rest, making the Darakhul Captain an unyielding leader amidst its undead minions.
