The Fate Eater is a medium aberration known for its dark and unsettling nature. It embodies the concept of manipulating destiny and inflicting psychic damage, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 130, the Fate Eater can withstand a considerable amount of damage before succumbing. Its Challenge Rating of 6 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, offering 2,300 experience points upon defeat. This creature is notable for its resilience and its ability to poison creatures that consume its flesh, as well as its potent psychic attacks that can alter a target's fate, introducing a strategic layer to encounters with it.

The Fate Eater possesses strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength with a score of 18 (+4), which puts it in the good range for melee attacks. Its Constitution is also respectable at 14 (+2), providing good durability. Its Intelligence score is high at 18 (+4), granting it very good proficiency in knowledge-related skills, while its Wisdom is decent at 16 (+3), allowing for good perception and insight. However, its Charisma is below average at 9 (-1), which indicates it may struggle in social interactions. It has a strong Constitution saving throw modifier of +5, helping it resist various effects. The Fate Eater is immune to charming and frightening conditions, making it difficult to control or intimidate in combat.

For skills, the Fate Eater excels in Arcana, History, and Religion, each with a +7 modifier, which represents exceptional capability in those areas. It also has good Insight with a +6 modifier. It possesses truesight out to 60 feet, enabling it to see through illusions and detect hidden creatures, and its passive Perception is calculated at 13, reflecting average awareness in its surroundings. It understands all languages but is unable to speak, instead communicating through telepathy over a range of 100 feet.

The Fate Eater’s special ability, Visionary Flesh, poses a unique risk to those who consume its flesh. When a creature eats the flesh, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A failure results in the creature being poisoned for 1 hour, which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and if successful, the creature gains the benefits of the divination spell, allowing for insight into future events.

In terms of actions during combat, the Fate Eater employs a Multiattack that allows it to make two Bite attacks on its turn. Each Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it inflicts 13 slashing damage in addition to 7 necrotic damage, combining physical and dark energy effects.

Its most formidable ability is Alter Fate, which it can use on a recharge of 5 or 6. This ability targets a creature within 30 feet, forcing it to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the targeted creature suffers 36 psychic damage, and its fate is altered in a random way. If the targeted creature succeeds on the saving throw, it takes half the damage without suffering any fate alterations. A creature affected by Alter Fate can attempt to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns for less than a minute, or at the end of each long rest if the effect lasts longer, to end the effect on itself. This ability adds a dynamic element to encounters, potentially shifting the tide of battle based on the outcome of the saving throw.
