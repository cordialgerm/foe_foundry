The Gargoyle is a medium elemental creature that excels in both offensive and defensive capabilities, making it a formidable adversary in combat. With an Armor Class of 15, it can withstand a considerable amount of damage. Its 45 hit points give it average durability, allowing it to endure several rounds in battle. The creature possesses a flight speed of 60 feet, enhancing its mobility and giving it the ability to engage or retreat from threats effectively. Its main strengths include a decent Strength score of 14 and a high Constitution score of 16, which translates to good physical resilience. However, its mental attributes—particularly its low Intelligence and Charisma—are very bad, making it less effective in social situations or complicated problem-solving. Its versatility in combat is notable, as it can attack multiple times per turn, delivering both piercing and slashing damage.

The Gargoyle has the following combat attributes: 

- Strength: 14 (+2), resulting in a good modifier for melee attacks. 
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), translating to an average modifier for Dexterity-based actions.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), offering a very good modifier for saving throws against harmful effects.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1), giving it a very bad modifier, affecting its problem-solving abilities.
- Wisdom: 14 (+2), providing a good modifier for Wisdom-related skills, which includes perception.
- Charisma: 8 (-1), also a very bad modifier affecting its presence in social interactions.

The Gargoyle’s saving throw bonuses are as follows: Strength +4 and Constitution +5, which are both good and help it resist physical attacks and harmful effects. It has perception skills at +4, allowing it to notice hidden threats effectively.

The Gargoyle enjoys several strengths in terms of damage immunities, resistances, and condition immunities. It is immune to poison damage, and it has resistance to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical and non-adamantine weapons. It is also immune to conditions like fatigue, petrified, poisoned, and unconscious, making it a tough opponent to disable. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 14, which allows it to detect hidden creatures in low-light conditions swiftly.

Special abilities of the Gargoyle include:

- **False Appearance:** When the Gargoyle remains motionless, it resembles a normal statue, making it an excellent ambush predator.
- **Elemental Nature:** This ability means that Gargoyles do not require air, food, or sleep, making them incredibly durable in long-duration encounters.

In terms of actions, the Gargoyle can perform the following:

- **Multiattack:** This allows the Gargoyle to make multiple attacks on its turn, specifically a bite and its claws.
- **Bite:** A melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, this can deal 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, making it a reliable option for close encounters.
- **Claws:** Another melee attack option with +4 to hit. It deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage under normal circumstances, but if the Gargoyle started its turn at least 20 feet above the target, it deals 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, showcasing its aerial advantage.
- **Rock:** A ranged attack option that allows the Gargoyle to hurl a rock at distance. It has a +4 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet, dealing 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit.

Overall, the Gargoyle presents a well-rounded threat in combat, with solid physical attributes, multiple attack options, and useful special abilities that make it a unique elemental foe in any adventure.
