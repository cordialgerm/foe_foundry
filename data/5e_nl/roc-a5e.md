The Roc is a formidable gargantuan beast, renowned in the realms as a mighty aerial predator. With an impressive Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 232, it boasts considerable resilience in battle. The Roc possesses exceptional strength and constitution, making it a powerful attacker and difficult to bring down. However, its dexterity and intelligence are subpar, leading to average evasiveness and tactical awareness. With a Challenge Rating of 13, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, particularly those unprepared for its immense size and power. Notable abilities include keen sight for superior perception and the ability to deal double damage to structures, marking it as a dangerous foe in both combat and environmental contexts.

The Roc's Strength score is 28, granting it a very good melee attack modifier of +9, while its Dexterity score is a mediocre 10, providing an average modifier of +0. Its Constitution score is 20, resulting in a very good +5 modifier for saving throws. The Roc's Intelligence is a mere 3, yielding a very bad -4 modifier, which signifies poor problem-solving abilities. Its Wisdom score of 12 gives it an average modifier of +1, and its Charisma of 8 results in a bad -1 modifier.

In terms of saving throws, the Roc has bonuses of +5 for Dexterity, +10 for Constitution which is very good, +6 for Wisdom which is good, and +4 for Charisma, also good. It has perception skills of +6 and a passive perception of 16, indicating an ability to effectively notice hidden threats or ambushes.

The Roc's special abilities enhance its effectiveness in combat. "Keen Sight" allows the Roc to have advantage on Perception checks related to sight, making it very difficult to hide from this creature. The "Siege Monster" ability enables the Roc to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it particularly destructive when attacking fortifications or other inanimate targets.

In combat, the Roc can make a "Multiattack," enabling it to attack twice: once using its beak and once with its talons, or to perform a beak attack while dropping a grappled creature or held object. Its "Beak" attack is a melee weapon strike with a +14 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, doing an average of 23 piercing damage on a hit, computed as 4d6+9. Its "Talons" attack also carries a +14 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and similarly deals an average of 23 slashing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, when a target is struck by the talons, they are grappled with an escape DC of 22, meaning that they find it quite challenging to break free. While grappled, the target is restrained, meaning they cannot move and have disadvantages on attacks.

The Roc also has a reactive ability called "Retributive Strike." When it is hit by a melee weapon attack from a creature it can see, the Roc can respond with a beak attack against that attacker. This serves as a deterrent against engaging the Roc in close combat, as the creature can retaliate swiftly and powerfully.
