The Niya-Atha Sorcerer is a Medium Fey creature that embodies a unique combination of magic and physical prowess, categorized under the lawful neutral alignment. With its ability to inflict cold damage and manipulate its size, it serves as a formidable adversary in combat. The creature has a fair amount of resilience, given its Armor Class of 13 and Hit Points totaling 66, which allows it to withstand several rounds of battle. While its combat effectiveness is high, its reliance on ice-based abilities and spells makes it vulnerable to fire damage. With a Challenge Rating of 4, the Niya-Atha Sorcerer is considered an intermediate threat, capable of dealing significant damage and controlling the battlefield through its special abilities and actions.

The creature has the following attributes: Strength of 13 gives it an average modifier of +1, Dexterity of 16 provides a good modifier of +3, Constitution of 13 results in an average modifier of +1, Intelligence of 12 also grants an average modifier of +1, Wisdom of 10 leads to a very bad modifier of +0, and a Charisma of 18 offers an exceptional modifier of +4. 

In terms of saving throws, the Niya-Atha Sorcerer is proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom, with modifiers of +3 and +2 respectively, reflecting its good defenses against mental and magical effects. It has no proficiency bonuses for skills, resulting in a perception score that is very bad at +0, and its cold damage resistance grants it a level of protection against icy spells. The creature can communicate in Common and Sylvan languages, facilitating interactions with various characters.

The Niya-Atha possesses several special abilities. Its "Icy Wrath" ability allows its weapon attacks to deal an additional 4 (1d8) cold damage, enhancing its melee capabilities. However, while enlarged, it loses this additional damage but gains an increased Armor Class of 16. The "Reduce" ability gives it tactical flexibility, allowing it to revert to its normal size without using an action if it starts its turn enlarged.

In combat, the Niya-Atha Sorcerer can execute a "Multiattack," which allows for three strikes with its Scepter or two ranged attacks using "Ice Shard." The Scepter attack is a melee weapon strike with a +3 to hit, dealing 4 (1d6+1) bludgeoning damage plus the additional cold damage if not enlarged; if it is enlarged, it deals 8 (2d6+1) bludgeoning damage instead. The "Ice Shard" attack is a ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit, able to strike targets from a distance of up to 240 feet, dealing 9 (1d10+4) piercing and an extra 9 (2d8) cold damage on a hit.

One of its most impactful abilities is "Summon Iceberg," which can be used when the Niya-Atha Sorcerer is not enlarged. By recharging on a roll of 5–6, it can select a point within 120 feet to summon an iceberg that affects creatures within a 20-foot radius. Affected creatures take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) cold damage, and they are restrained until the end of their next turn. The restraint can significantly hinder opponents’ movement and actions in combat, especially because it requires a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage and avoid being restrained.

Finally, the Niya-Atha Sorcerer can also perform the "Enlarge" action as a bonus action to increase its own size and the size of anything it is carrying. While enlarged, it doubles the damage dice on its weapon attacks and gains an advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. However, the use of this ability means it cannot summon an iceberg concurrently, creating a strategic choice between offense and battlefield control. If there is insufficient room for enlargement, the attempt fails, highlighting a tactical limitation in certain environments.
