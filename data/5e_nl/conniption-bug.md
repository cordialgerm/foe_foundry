The Conniption Bug is a small beast that presents a unique challenge in combat due to its distinctive abilities and its capacity to grapple foes. With an Armor Class of 13 and 55 hit points, it can withstand some damage, although it is not particularly sturdy compared to stronger monsters. It excels in mobility with a walking and swimming speed of 30 feet each, making it versatile in different environments. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it can pose a moderate challenge to low-level adventurers. Its primary strengths lie in its grappling capabilities and pack tactics, allowing it to deal consistent damage to enemies while receiving support from allies. Notably, it has a unique mechanic where it continues to inflict damage even after it dies, making it a dangerous foe if not dealt with quickly. 

The Conniption Bug has the following attributes: Strength 13 (+1), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 3 (-4). Its Strength and Dexterity scores are above average, making it effectively capable in physical confrontations, while its Intelligence and Charisma scores are exceptionally low, indicating a lack of cognitive and social capabilities. The Constitution score provides solid durability, reflecting its ability to absorb damage. The Bug has a perception skill modifier of +0, which is average, and its tremorsense lasts for 30 feet, allowing it to detect creatures close by, even if they are hidden or obscured.

The special abilities of the Conniption Bug enhance its combat effectiveness. The "Death Trap" ability means that when the bug dies, it remains threatening by continuing to grapple its last target. This lasts until the grapple ends, causing the target to take 4 piercing damage at the start of its turns, creating a dangerous situation that requires prompt intervention. The "Limited Amphibiousness" ability allows it to survive in both air and water but imposes a risk of suffocation if it fails to be submerged periodically. "Pack Tactics" grants the bug an advantage on attack rolls against targets if an ally is within 5 feet, boosting its offensive potential significantly. Furthermore, it has a "Standing Leap" ability, enabling impressive long jumps of up to 20 feet and high jumps of up to 10 feet, enhancing its maneuverability in battle. Lastly, its "Vicious Wound" ability allows its melee attacks to score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20, increasing its damage output and threat level.

In terms of actions, the Conniption Bug has two primary melee attacks. The "Barbed Mandibles" attack has a +4 to hit and allows it to deal 6 piercing damage (1d8 + 2) while attempting to grapple the target. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature and the bug isn't currently grappling another creature, it can grapple successfully with an escape DC of 13. Once grappled, the victim suffers an additional 4 piercing damage at the start of its turns. The second attack, "Barbed Claws," also has a +4 to hit and inflicts 7 piercing damage (2d4 + 2), focusing on raw damage rather than grappling. 

Overall, the Conniption Bug is a formidable opponent for adventurers who underestimate its potential to inflict damage and control the battlefield through its grappling and cooperative combat strategies.
