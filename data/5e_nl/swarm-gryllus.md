The Gryllus Swarm is a large, construct creature that embodies a unique blend of magical and mechanical properties, making it an intriguing opponent in combat. As a lawful neutral entity, its actions are predictable and structured, often making tactical decisions rather than acting on whim. With strong Dexterity, it has good agility that allows for dexterous maneuvers in battle, while its notable feature of being bound to a book provides a strategic vulnerability that players can exploit. Though it possesses a substantial pool of hit points, its reliance on proximity to its book for maximum health can be a significant weakness. Overall, the Gryllus Swarm presents a considerable challenge with its mix of mobility, resistances, and unique abilities, but a well-strategized approach can turn the tide in players' favor.

The Gryllus Swarm has the following statistics: it has a Strength score of 14, granting a good modifier of +2, which means it is capable of executing physical actions effectively. Its Dexterity score is 18, resulting in a very good +4 modifier, enhancing its agility and opportunities to evade attacks. The Constitution score is 13, translating to an average +1 modifier, which grants it decent resilience. Intelligence is notably low at 6, resulting in a very bad -2 modifier, indicating a lack of mental capacity. Wisdom and Charisma scores are both average at 13 and 10 respectively, providing a modest +1 and neutral 0 modifier.

In terms of special abilities, the Gryllus Swarm has several notable traits. Firstly, its "Book Bound" ability limits its maximum hit points by 1 for every minute it is more than 60 feet away from its book. If its maximum hit points drop to 0, it dies. Additionally, if the book is destroyed or taken to another plane, the swarm must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or its hit points will drop to 10. The swarm can bind itself to a new book by resting in contact with it. The "Construct Nature" ability indicates that the swarm does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, enabling it to operate without the typical biological needs. "Immutable Form" grants immunity to any spell or effect that would alter its form. Furthermore, the "In the Margins" ability allows the swarm to transition in and out of its book, blending seamlessly into its illustrations when inside. Lastly, its "Swarm" ability means it can occupy another creature's space, allowing for flexible movement during encounters, although it cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

In combat, the Gryllus Swarm can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two melee attacks known as "Go for the Knees" or "Go for the Eyes," with the option to swap one of these attacks for a use of its "Timber" ability. The "Go for the Knees" attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit. It deals 18 slashing damage on a hit, or 8 slashing damage if the swarm has half or fewer hit points remaining. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a speed reduction of 10 feet until the end of its next turn. The "Go for the Eyes" attack is a ranged weapon attack also with a +7 to hit, dealing 18 piercing damage or 8 piercing damage when the swarm's hit points are low. A victim hit must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. "Timber" is a special ability that allows the swarm to call out in a chorus of tiny voices before attempting to knock a creature in its space prone, requiring the target to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw to resist. If successfully knocked prone, the swarm can then make one "Go for the Knees" attack as a bonus action against that target, adding a layer of strategy and potential devastation in its actions.
