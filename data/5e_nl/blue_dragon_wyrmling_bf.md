In combat, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling has a special ability called Pounce. This ability allows the dragon to move at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a target and, if it successfully strikes with its Claw attack, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failure results in being knocked prone, granting the dragon an additional Claw attack as a bonus action against that opponent. 

For its actions on each turn, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling can utilize a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack and one Claw attack. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit modifier, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage plus an additional 3 lightning damage. The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit modifier, dealing 6 slashing damage.

One of the most devastating abilities of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is its Lightning Breath, which can be used after a recharge period of 5-6. This powerful attack lets the dragon exhale a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 27 lightning damage (5d10) on a failed save, taking half damage if they succeed. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield, allowing the dragon to damage multiple enemies at once while possibly forcing them to reposition.
