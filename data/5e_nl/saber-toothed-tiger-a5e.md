The Saber-Toothed Tiger is a large beast renowned for its ferocious nature and predatory instincts. With an Armor Class of 12, it has some degree of protection, but its true strengths lie in its high Strength score of 20, allowing for powerful melee attacks. The tiger can deal significant damage with its claws and bite, making it a formidable opponent in combat. Its Challenge Rating of 2 indicates it can be a challenging encounter for lower-level adventurers, providing 450 experience points upon defeat. Although it lacks intelligence and charm, the tiger compensates with decent Dexterity and Constitution scores, demonstrating agility and resilience. Its Keen Smell ability enhances its awareness, allowing it to detect creatures nearby. However, its low Charisma and Intelligence make it less effective in social interactions.

The attributes of the Saber-Toothed Tiger are as follows: 
- Strength: 20 with a modifier of +5, which is exceptional and allows the tiger to excel in melee combat, delivering powerful strikes.
- Dexterity: 14 with a modifier of +2, which is good, enabling the tiger to dodge and avoid some attacks.
- Constitution: 14 with a modifier of +2, which is good, providing a decent amount of hit points and durability.
- Intelligence: 3 with a modifier of -4, which is very bad, indicating a lack of reasoning and problem-solving skills.
- Wisdom: 12 with a modifier of +1, which is average, helping it notice its surroundings, but not significantly affecting its interactions.
- Charisma: 6 with a modifier of -2, which is very bad, making it ineffective in any social scenario.

The skills of the Saber-Toothed Tiger include a +3 modifier in Perception, making it good at detecting hidden creatures or threats, and a +4 in Stealth, which enhances its ability to move silently and ambush prey. It has a passive Perception of 13, indicating it remains vigilant even when not actively searching.

The special ability of Keen Smell grants the Saber-Toothed Tiger advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell, allowing it to easily track prey or detect hidden enemies.

In terms of actions, the tiger has two primary attacks:
- Claws: The tiger makes a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit against a target within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals an average of 10 slashing damage using 2d4 plus its Strength modifier. Additionally, if the tiger has moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target before the attack, the target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. Failure results in the target falling prone, giving the tiger an advantage on its next attack roll against that target.
- Bite: This attack also has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 12 piercing damage using 2d6 plus its Strength modifier.

The tiger can use a bonus action called Opportune Bite, allowing it to attack a creature that is prone. This enhances its ability to capitalize on opportunities in combat, especially when opponents are incapacitated.

Overall, the Saber-Toothed Tiger relies on its physical prowess and predatory abilities to dominate its environment, making it a compelling foe for adventurers in a D&D setting.
