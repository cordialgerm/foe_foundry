The Echo is a medium-sized chaotic evil fiend characterized by its unsettling presence and formidable combat abilities. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 102, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. It is capable of both flying and walking, with movements of 20 feet and 30 feet, respectively. Its Challenge Rating of 6 indicates that it is a moderate challenge for a party of adventurers, offering 2,300 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the Echo wields both physical and psychological tactics, employing its special abilities and actions to disrupt opponents while also dealing consistent damage. Its strengths lie in its high Strength and Dexterity scores, both rated at 20 (+5), making it exceptionally effective in combat situations. However, it does possess weaknesses such as being vulnerable to specific damage types not detailed in its resistances.

The creature's attributes include a Constitution of 18 (+4), boosting its overall durability, and a Wisdom score of 18 (+4), enhancing its insight against spells and effects that involve mental fortitude. The Echo also has useful Charisma and Intelligence scores of 16 (+3) and 14 (+2), respectively, allowing for persuasive interactions and strategic planning in engagements. It is immune to poison damage and conditions, while resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage. The Echo's skills in persuasion (+6) and stealth (+8) further underline its deceptive nature, which challenges heroes both in and out of battle. 

One of its defining special abilities is the **Aura of Cacophony**, which imposes disadvantage on concentration checks for any creature within 100 feet of the Echo that can hear it. This ability disrupts spellcasters and can significantly hinder strategic planning during combat.

In terms of actions, the Echo can use its **Iron Claws**, a melee attack that has a +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. This attack inflicts an average of 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage, and if the target is wearing metal armor, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be deafened until the end of its next turn. This effect can heavily disadvantage opponents who rely on sound.

The Echo also possesses the ability **Everywhere at Once**, which allows it to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space. Following the teleport, it can make an iron claws attack with an advantage as a bonus action, enhancing its combat agility and unpredictability, particularly useful for repositioning in battle.

Lastly, the **Echoes of the Abyss** ability, usable once per day, allows the Echo to unleash horrifying wails that affect creatures within 60 feet who can hear them. These creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the start of the Echo's next turn. Moreover, affected creatures must deal with the mental strain of the echoes, suffering disadvantage on Intelligence checks until they complete a long rest. This feature not only staves off foes in the immediate turn but also affects their capabilities in upcoming encounters, making the Echo a well-rounded and dangerous adversary.
