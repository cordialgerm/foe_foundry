The Stirge is a tiny beast known for its vampiric feeding behavior. These creatures are typically found in swarms and are notable for their ability to attach to larger creatures, draining blood and inflicting damage over time. They have low hit points, making them frail compared to other beasts, but their unique ability to drain blood can swiftly weaken foes who are unable to shake them off. Stirges excel in evasion thanks to their flight capability, but they suffer from very poor physical attributes, especially in strength and constitution, making them poor in direct confrontations. With a challenge rating of 1/8, they can pose a minor threat if underestimated, particularly because their blood draining ability can quickly add up if multiple stirges attack the same target.

The Stirge has an armor class of 14, which is considered good for a creature of its size. It possesses 7 hit points, making it very fragile and likely to be defeated in a single hit from most adventurers. The Stirge can move at a speed of 10 feet on the ground, but it can fly at a speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver quite effectively. 

The Stirge’s attributes are as follows: it has a strength score of -3, which is very bad for physical attacks and grappling; a dexterity score of +2, which is good for dodging attacks and improving stealth; a constitution score of +0, which is average; an intelligence score of -4, which is very bad and indicates that it cannot engage in complex thought; a wisdom score of -1, which is bad and suggests limited perception; and a charisma score of -2, which is also bad indicating a lack of social skills.

The Stirge possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, though only in shades of gray. It has a perception score of 9, which is poor, and a stealth score of 12, which is average. The Stirge does not understand any languages.

The notable special ability of the Stirge is Blood Drain. This attack functions as a melee weapon action with a +4 to hit, meaning it has a good chance of successfully attaching to its target if within 5 feet. When it successfully hits, it deals 4 piercing damage and attaches itself to the creature, continuing to drain health. While attached, the Stirge cannot attack, but on each of its turns, it causes the target to lose an additional 4 hit points due to blood loss, which can stack up if untreated. After draining a total of 8 hit points from the target or if the target dies, the Stirge can detach itself.

Additionally, the Stirge has a reaction called Reactive Wiggle. If it is targeted by an attack from within 5 feet while attached, it can perform this reaction, attempting to redirect the attack. The attacker must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw; if they fail, they hit the creature to which the Stirge is attached instead. This ability adds an interesting tactical element, as it allows the Stirge to mitigate damage and potentially cause confusion among its enemy’s ranks.
