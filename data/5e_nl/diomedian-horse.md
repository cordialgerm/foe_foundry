The Diomedian Horse is a powerful large beast that serves as a formidable combatant in its environment. With a high Armor Class of 14 and plenty of hit points at 57, it stands as a resilient opponent on the battlefield. This creature excels in strength, boasting a Strength score of 20, which translates into an exceptional attack potential, while its Dexterity and Constitution scores also provide it with good agility and endurance. However, its Intelligence is notably low, making it relatively simple-minded. The Diomedian Horse has access to special abilities and a multiattack capability that enhances its effectiveness in combat, especially when teamed up with allies. Its challenge rating of 3 means that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, offering 700 XP for overcoming it.

The attributes of the Diomedian Horse are as follows: 
- Strength is 20 (+5), which is exceptional, allowing it to deal significant damage in melee combat.
- Dexterity is 14 (+2), providing good agility for various checks.
- Constitution is 18 (+4), contributing to its very good durability and hit points.
- Intelligence is 4 (-3), which is very bad, meaning it lacks complexity in thought processes and strategies.
- Wisdom is 12 (+1), resulting in average perception abilities.
- Charisma is 10 (+0), which is average, indicating it has no particular charm or social capabilities.

The Diomedian Horse possesses several special abilities:
- **Keen Smell:** This ability allows the horse to have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, making it more aware of its surroundings.
- **Pack Tactics:** With this ability, the Diomedian Horse gains advantage on its attack rolls against a creature if at least one ally that is not incapacitated is within 5 feet of that creature, making it more effective in groups.
- **Pounce:** If the horse moves at least 20 feet straight towards a creature and successfully strikes with a claw attack, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the horse can then make a bonus action Bite attack against it, enhancing its offensive potential.

In terms of actions, the Diomedian Horse can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and one Claw attack during its turn. 
- For the **Bite** action, it has a melee weapon attack modifier of +7 to hit, dealing an average of 12 piercing damage (2d6+5), making it a strong attack option.
- The **Claws** attack also has an attack modifier of +7 to hit, doing around 10 slashing damage (2d4+5), which contributes to its overall ability to inflict sustained damage over time.

In combat, the combination of its high mobility, strength, and advantageous abilities makes the Diomedian Horse a dangerous adversary, particularly in a pack, where it can create overwhelming scenarios for its opponents.
