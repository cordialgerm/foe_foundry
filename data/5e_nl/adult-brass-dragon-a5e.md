The Adult Brass Dragon is a formidable creature known for its intelligence, charm, and combat prowess. As a Huge dragon, it serves a significant role in both combat and social interactions, leveraging its innate spellcasting abilities and high intelligence. With an impressive Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 161, this dragon is exceptionally resilient in battle. Its strengths lie in its fire immunity, versatility in actions, and its powerful breath weapons, such as the Molten Breath and Sleep Breath, which can control the battlefield effectively. The dragon's weaknesses include its lower Dexterity, only average for a creature of its caliber, and its reliance on legendary actions to maximize its combat potential. Notably, its ability to change shape allows it to navigate social encounters more adeptly.

The Adult Brass Dragon has the following attributes: Strength of 22 (+6, exceptional), Dexterity of 10 (+0, average), Constitution of 20 (+5, very good), Intelligence of 18 (+4, good), Wisdom of 14 (+2, average), and Charisma of 16 (+3, good). For saving throws, it boasts exceptional resilience with Constitution +10, Charisma +8, Wisdom +7, and average but still effective Dexterity +5. Its skills are impressive, allowing adept rolls in arcana +9, history +9, nature +9, perception +7, persuasion +8, religion +9, and stealth +5.

The dragon has fire damage immunity, meaning it takes no damage from fire-based attacks, which can be a crucial advantage in combat. It possesses blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, along with a passive perception of 20, making it incredibly aware of its surroundings. The dragon can communicate in Common, Draconic, and two additional languages.

Among its special abilities, the Adult Brass Dragon has "Legendary Resistance" which allows it to succeed on a failed saving throw three times a day; however, its Armor Class drops to 16 after using this ability if it runs out. "Self-Sufficient" indicates that the dragon only requires a quart of water and a pound of food daily. Notably, it has "Scholar of the Ages," granting it a d4 expertise die on Intelligence checks to recall lore and allowing it to use a Legendary Resistance to treat a failed roll as a 20. The dragon possesses "Innate Spellcasting," with a Charisma-based spellcasting ability (DC 16), allowing it to cast spells like "Comprehend Languages," "Identify," "Commune," and "Legend Lore" three times daily.

In combat, the dragon employs the "Multiattack" feature, allowing it to make a bite attack and two claws attacks, or to use "Molten Spit" in place of one bite. The "Bite" attack has a strike bonus of +11 and deals 22 piercing damage plus an additional 4 fire damage on a hit. Its "Claws" attacks also hit with a +11 bonus and deal 19 slashing damage, while the "Tail" attack, with the same strike bonus, deals 15 bludgeoning damage and pushes the target 10 feet away. If in humanoid form, it can use a staff for a melee attack that deals 10 bludgeoning damage.

The "Molten Spit" ability allows the dragon to target a creature within 60 feet, forcing a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw for 11 fire damage on a failure and half damage on a success, along with 5 ongoing fire damage if the saving throw fails. This ongoing damage can be removed with an action. The dragon's breath weapons offer devastating options: with "Molten Breath," it can exhale a line that deals 56 fire damage (DC 18 Dexterity save) and blinds targets that fail, or the "Sleep Breath" that can incapacitate creatures for up to 10 minutes on a failed DC 18 Constitution saving throw.

The dragon also has the "Change Shape" ability, allowing it to assume the appearance of a humanoid or beast while keeping its stats unchanged except for size, reverting back to dragon form upon death. In reactions, the "Tail Attack" can be executed in response to a melee hit from a creature within 10 feet.

Finally, the Adult Brass Dragon can use up to three legendary actions, which can be decided at the end of another creature's turn. It can use "Analyze" to gather intelligence on a target, "Roar" to frighten creatures within 120 feet with a DC 16 Charisma save, and "Wing Attack" to create a knockback effect with a DC 19 Dexterity save, allowing for aerial mobility.
