The Triceratops is a massive creature classified as a Huge Beast, notable for both its imposing physical presence and formidable defensive capabilities. With an Armor Class of 14 and substantial hit points totaling 84, it can withstand considerable damage in combat. This creature boasts impressive Strength at 20, making it highly effective in melee combat, and a solid Constitution score of 18, enhancing its resilience. Despite its low Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma scores, the Triceratops compensates with powerful attacks that utilize its natural weapons. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, capable of dealing heavy damage while also imposing penalties on opponents.

The attributes of the Triceratops highlight its strengths and weaknesses. Strength is a very good attribute with a +5 modifier, allowing it to excel in physical confrontations. Dexterity is average, as indicated by a +0 modifier, suggesting it is not particularly agile. Constitution offers a good modifier of +4, contributing to its survivability. Intelligence is very bad at -4, representing its lack of cunning or problem-solving ability. Wisdom, with a modifier of +1, shows that while it isn't particularly insightful, it has some awareness of its surroundings. Finally, Charisma is very bad at -3, meaning it has little influence in social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Triceratops does not have any specific skills, but it possesses passive perception at a level of 11, which enables it to notice hidden creatures or unusual circumstances reasonably well. It does not communicate in any known languages.

The Triceratops can perform several actions in combat. Its primary melee attack, called "Defensive Gore," is a potent offensive option that has a +8 to hit and can reach a target within 5 feet. When it succeeds in this attack, it deals considerable piercing damage totaling 24 (3d12 + 5). Moreover, this attack imposes a tactical disadvantage on the target's next attack against the Triceratops, which continues until the end of the Triceratops's next turn, making it easier for the creature to withstand subsequent attacks.

Its other significant action, "Trample," allows the Triceratops to charge forward up to its movement speed of 50 feet in a straight line. It can stride through the spaces occupied by creatures that are Large or smaller, showcasing its size and power. Any creature within this path must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Failure to do so results in taking 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, illustrating its ability to effectively maneuver and deal area-of-effect damage against multiple foes during encounters.
