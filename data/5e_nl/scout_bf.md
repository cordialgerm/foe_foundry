The Scout is a Medium humanoid creature that can belong to any lineage. It serves as a stealthy, agile combatant, often acting as a reconnaissance unit on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 13 due to its leather armor and 25 hit points, it is relatively resilient for its Challenge Rating of 1/2. The Scout excels in Dexterity, providing a good balance of speed and evasiveness, while its keen Wisdom allows it to notice hidden threats effectively. However, it possesses average strength and charisma, indicating that it is not particularly strong in physical confrontations or social interactions. The combination of stealth, perception, and nimbleness makes the Scout a formidable opponent in ambush scenarios, but it lacks raw power and depends on its agility and tactics to succeed.

The Scout has the following ability scores: Strength is +0 (average), Dexterity is +2 (good), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is +0 (average), Wisdom is +3 (very good), and Charisma is +0 (average). These attributes contribute to its overall performance in various aspects of the game, such as attacking, defending, and perceiving its surroundings.

A notable special ability of the Scout is its Heightened Hearing and Sight, which boosts its Perception score to 18 when the scout uses either sight or hearing to detect something. This exceptional level of perception allows the Scout to effectively notice hidden enemies or traps, greatly enhancing its scouting capabilities.

In terms of combat actions, the Scout can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two separate attacks using either a Shortsword or a Shortbow. When attacking with the Shortsword, the Scout has a +4 to hit, indicating a good chance of landing a blow against foes, and deals 5 piercing damage per successful hit (1d6 + 2). The same attack bonus applies to the Shortbow, which has a range of 80 feet normally and 320 feet at a disadvantage, again dealing 5 piercing damage per successful hit. These ranged and melee options ensure the Scout can adapt to different combat scenarios.

As a bonus action, the Scout can employ the Escape to Report ability, allowing it to take either the Dash or Disengage action. This feature enables the Scout to quickly escape from combat or reposition itself, often to relay critical information back to allies or to avoid direct confrontation.
