Its ability to resist nonmagical damage gives it an additional layer of defense, and its mobility is enhanced by its burrowing capability, allowing it to maneuver through the battlefield unpredictably.

The Young Earth Dragon has several notable special abilities. Its Earth Glide allows it to burrow effortlessly through nonmagical earth and stone, making it a master of stealth and surprise attacks. Through its False Appearance ability, the dragon can camouflage itself as a natural rock formation when remaining still, making it difficult for enemies to detect. The Essence Link means the dragon is spiritually connected to a specific area, affecting its ability to rest and influencing the environment if it dies, resulting in significant penalties for creatures entering the area that has lost its vital essence. Lastly, the dragon has Innate Spellcasting, with a Charisma-based spellcasting ability that allows it to cast spells like Locate Animals or Plants and Spike Growth three times a day without needing magical components.

In combat, the Young Earth Dragon can launch a coordinated Multiattack, using its Bite and Slam actions. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit and deals 22 (4d10 + 4) piercing damage on a successful hit, while the Slam attack also has a +8 to hit and causes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. One of its most dangerous abilities is the Scouring Breath, which can be used when recharged on a roll of 5 or 6. This breath attack unleashes a cone of scouring sand and stones, requiring creatures within the area to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 38 (11d6) slashing damage, or half that on a successful save, making it a devastating area attack that can impact multiple foes at once.
