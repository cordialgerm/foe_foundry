The Giant Hellfire is a formidable creature characterized by its immense size and neutral good alignment. It serves a significant role as a guardian or protector, utilizing both its physical might and magical abilities in combat. With a high Armor Class of 16 and substantial Hit Points totaling 168, it boasts a resilient presence in battles. The Giant Hellfire is particularly effective in dealing fire damage, thanks to its magical weapon attacks which inflict additional fire damage. Its challenge rating of 9 indicates it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, earning it 5,000 experience points upon defeat. One of its notable abilities is Death Malison, which can severely hinder nearby creatures upon its death.

The Giant Hellfire possesses the following attributes: Strength of 23 with a +6 modifier, making it exceptionally powerful in melee combat. It has a Dexterity score of 15 (+2), which provides it with average agility. Its Constitution score is 19 (+4), giving it good resilience against physical damage. The Intelligence score is 10 (+0), indicating average cognitive capability. Wisdom is at 12 (+1), which is average as well, and Charisma is 17 (+3), reflecting good personal magnetism. The giant has saving throw bonuses of +5 for Dexterity, +6 for Constitution, and +4 for Wisdom, which are all good. It has proficiency in the Perception skill with a total of +1, allowing for average awareness of surroundings. This creature is resistant to fire damage and has darkvision extending 60 feet, with a passive Perception score of 15.

The Giant Hellfire's special abilities enhance its effectiveness in combat. Death Malison triggers when the giant dies, causing runes on its body to flash bright green before turning to malachite. Creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become cursed for 7 days. Cursed creatures suffer disadvantages on saving throws and on their first attack roll each turn, while fiends have a particular disadvantage on saving. Its weapons also have a magical quality, allowing it to deal an additional 2d8 fire damage when it strikes an opponent. The Giant Hellfire benefits from Stone Camouflage, gaining advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in rocky terrains, making it easier for it to hide.

For its actions, the Giant Hellfire can perform a Multiattack, allowing for two strikes with either a Greatclub or a Runic Blast. The Greatclub attack has a +10 to hit, delivers 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and an extra 9 (2d8) fire damage on a hit. The Runic Blast is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit, effective at 60 feet. This attack deals 25 (4d10 + 3) force damage, and if the target fails a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, their speed is halved until the end of their next turn. Again, fiends are at a disadvantage on this saving throw. 

Additionally, the Giant Hellfire can use the Invisibility Rune to magically become invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends. Any equipment the giant carries remains invisible during this time. It also possesses a reaction called Runic Shield, allowing it to add 4 to its Armor Class against an attack it can see, thus providing it good defensive capabilities against incoming strikes.
