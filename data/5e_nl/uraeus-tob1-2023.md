The Uraeus is a tiny celestial creature characterized by its lawful neutral alignment and strong ties to the divine. It possesses unique abilities that make it an effective support and combatant in encounters. With an Armor Class of 14 and 40 hit points, it can withstand a moderate amount of damage, but its offensive capabilities lie in its venomous bite, fiery breath attacks, and protective bond with allies. It excels in maneuverability, having the ability to fly, avoiding opportunity attacks while in flight, which allows for strategic positioning in combat. The Uraeus is resilient against magic and has several immunities and resistances, providing it with defensive advantages. However, its low Strength and Charisma scores make it less effective in physical contests and social interactions.

The Uraeus has the following attributes: Strength 6 (modifier -2, very bad), Dexterity 15 (modifier +2, good), Constitution 14 (modifier +2, good), Intelligence 10 (modifier +0, average), Wisdom 14 (modifier +2, good), and Charisma 9 (modifier -1, bad). Its saving throws include Wisdom +4 and Charisma +1, indicating a good ability to resist effects that rely on willpower and an average ability to handle charm or fear effects. In terms of skills, it has a +4 to Perception, which is good for detecting hidden dangers.

The Uraeus benefits from several damage immunities, including fire and poison, allowing it to completely avoid these types of damage. It also has resistance to radiant damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, which helps it mitigate physical attacks effectively. Additionally, it is immune to being poisoned, while its blindsight of 10 feet allows it to detect creatures without relying on sight, making it adept at navigating in darkness or against invisible foes. The Uraeus understands both Celestial and Common languages, though it cannot speak.

One of the Uraeus's notable special abilities is Flyby, which allows it to fly out of an enemy's reach without provoking opportunity attacks. This capability enhances its mobility in combat, making it difficult for opponents to retaliate against its positioning. Additionally, its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it significantly more difficult to disable with magic.

In terms of actions, the Uraeus has a Bite attack which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 5 piercing damage and an additional 9 poison damage while forcing the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned. While poisoned, the target takes 3 fire damage at the start of its turns, and the condition can be reapplied at the end of its turns if it fails the saving throw. This attack can be extremely dangerous if it successfully poisons an opponent.

The Uraeus also has a ranged attack called Spit Fire, which also has a +4 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet. On a hit, it inflicts a substantial 16 fire damage, making it a powerful ranged option. 

Additionally, it can use Searing Breath, which requires recharging on a roll of 5 or 6. This action allows the Uraeus to exhale a 15-foot cone of fire, forcing all creatures in the area to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails takes 10 fire damage, while successful saves reduce that damage by half.

As a bonus action, the Uraeus can use Ward Bond, creating a magical connection with a willing creature within 5 feet. This bond allows both the Uraeus and its ward to sense each other's distance, direction, and health, fostering teamwork even across planes of existence. 

Finally, the Uraeus has the reaction ability called Bonded Savior. When its bonded ward takes damage, the Uraeus can absorb the damage, losing hit points equal to that amount, regardless of the damage type. This protective ability makes the Uraeus a valuable ally, capable of shielding its friends from harm.
