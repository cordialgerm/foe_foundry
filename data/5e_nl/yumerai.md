The Yumerai is a Medium-sized fey creature known for its connection to dreams and psychic abilities. As a neutral entity, it operates primarily as a manipulator in combat, using its charm and innate magic to alter the landscape of battle. With a decent Armor Class of 13 and 65 hit points, it possesses a good amount of durability for its Challenge Rating of 2, which offers a moderate challenge for adventurers. The Yumerai excels in stealth and psychic damage but is somewhat limited in physical combat options. Its most notable powers revolve around dream manipulation, allowing it to traverse between the dreams of sleeping creatures, control their actions, and inflict psychic harm.

The Yumerai has the following attributes: Strength is 13 with a modifier of +1, which is considered average; Dexterity is high at 17 with a +3 modifier, classified as good; Constitution is 14 with a +2 modifier, rated as average; Intelligence is also 13 with a +1 modifier indicating average ability; Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier regarded as average; and Charisma is 16 with a +3 modifier, which is good. Its skills include insightful understanding and perception, both at +4, and stealth with +5, making it quite proficient in lurking undetected. The creature is resistant to psychic damage and immune to being rendered unconscious. Yumerai has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 14, allowing it to navigate poorly lit environments effectively. Additionally, it can communicate in all languages and possesses telepathy out to 60 feet.

The Yumerai's special abilities significantly enhance its role in combat. Firstly, it can use "Dream Leap" to magically enter the dreams of a sleeping creature within 5 feet. This ability allows it to reappear in the dreams of another sleeper up to 1 mile away. However, if there is no other sleeping creature within range, the Yumerai becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, representing a vulnerability during its transition. Secondly, the Yumerai has innate spellcasting, relying on its Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 13. It can cast several spells, including at-will options like "dancing lights," "message," and "minor illusion," which can provide utility and stealth in various situations. It can also cast "detect thoughts," "silent image," and "sleep" three times per day, making these spells useful for control and deception. Lastly, once per day, it can cast the more powerful "confusion" and "major image" spells, allowing for significant disruption in enemy tactics.

In combat, the Yumerai makes two attacks using its "Multiattack," employing a "Psychic Lash," which is a melee spell attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 7 (2d6) psychic damage, representing its focus on mental rather than physical damage. Additionally, it can use "Somnambulism" to exert control over a sleeping creature within 30 feet, issuing simple commands unless the creature is harmed or otherwise disrupted. This ability can control only one creature at a time, allowing for deft manipulation of combat dynamics, but requiring the Yumerai to maintain its focus on the victim. If it lays claim to another creature's mind, the previous target's influence ends. Overall, the Yumerai is a trickster with a potent combination of stealth, psychic damage, and dream manipulation, making it a unique foe in combat scenarios.
