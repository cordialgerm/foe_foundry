The Mirage Monster is a huge monstrosity that excels in deceptive tactics and control during combat. Its challenge rating is 4, providing a moderate threat to parties, particularly through its unique abilities that can ensnare and restrain foes, making it a potent ambush predator. With an armor class of 12 and hit points totaling 76, it can endure several hits while imposing significant damage with its melee attacks. However, its intelligence is quite low, which limits its strategic options. The creatureâ€™s strong physical attributes, particularly its strength of 18 (+4), enable it to grapple effectively and deal substantial damage through its biting and pseudopod attacks.

The Mirage Monster has a strong melee weapon attack bonus of +6, indicating a good effectiveness in physical confrontations. It boasts a stealth skill of +4, making it very good at remaining unnoticed while it lays in ambush. Its unique abilities grant various advantages and tactics: it can disguise itself indistinguishably as an inanimate object when motionless, making it exceptionally good at deception. It can also stick targets that come into contact with it using its Sticky mechanic, requiring a DC 14 Strength check to escape. This adds strategic depth to its encounters as it can control the battlefield by limiting the movements of its opponents. 

The creature's Telepathic Sense enables it to sense humanoids within 120 feet, thus enhancing its ambush potential by gaining mental images of desired inanimate objects around it. This ability is blocked by obstacles such as 3 feet of wood or dirt. Additionally, the Mirage Monster has a vulnerability; it assumes its true form if splashed with at least 1 gallon of water, which reduces the difficulty to escape its grips. The Legendary Resistance allows it to automatically succeed on a failed saving throw once per day, providing it with exceptional resilience against spells or effects that could otherwise incapacitate it.

In terms of combat abilities, the Mirage Monster can perform a Multiattack action, allowing it to deal damage through both a bite attack and a pseudopod attack in one turn. The bite attack deals 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage and restrains the target if they are already stuck, while the pseudopod deals 6 (1d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage and also applies the Sticky effect. The Swallow action is particularly dangerous, as it allows the creature to consume a Medium or smaller creature, granting it cover while dealing ongoing acid damage each turn until the swallowed creature manages to damage the Mirage Monster enough or it dies.

As a bonus action, the Mirage Monster can shapeshift, enabling tactical versatility during combat by changing its form to mimic an inanimate object of similar size or return to its true form. This keeps its statistics unaffected, allowing it to maintain combat effectiveness while altering its appearance. 

When it comes to legendary actions, the Mirage Monster can use two at the end of other creatures' turns, which allows it to react effectively in combat. It can perform a Grasping Pseudopod attack to pull enemies closer, which enhances its ability to capture targets. Alternatively, it can launch a bite attack which can serve as a devastating follow-up if it needs to strike harder.

Overall, the Mirage Monster is primarily a cunning ambusher with significant physical strength and crowd control capabilities, making it a formidable opponent in a variety of combat scenarios.
