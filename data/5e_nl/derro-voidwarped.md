The Derro, Voidwarped is a small humanoid creature with a neutral evil alignment. This unique being possesses an unusual combination of capabilities that make it a formidable opponent in the battlefield. It stands out due to its flight ability, high dexterity, and proficiency in magical attacks, along with its resilience against various forms of damage. While it does have weaknesses, particularly daylight sensitivity, its strengths lie in its potent attacks and spell-like abilities, which allow it to inflict substantial damage and incapacitate foes.

The Derro, Voidwarped has an armor class of 14, indicating a decent level of defense. It has 120 hit points, calculated with 16d6 plus 64, suggesting good survivability in combat. With a walking speed of 25 feet and the ability to fly at 30 feet, it can maneuver effectively during encounters. It poses a challenge rated at 6, which equates to 2,300 experience points for players who defeat it.

The creature's attributes are as follows: Strength is 8, which is rated as bad, offering a -1 modifier. Dexterity stands at 18, giving it a +4 modifier that is considered very good, enhancing its agility and attack capabilities. Constitution is also high at 18, with a +4 modifier, contributing to its durability. Intelligence is 13, yielding a +1 modifier that is average, while Wisdom is very low at 5, resulting in a -3 modifier, making it rather poor at perception-dependent tasks. Charisma is strong at 17, producing a +3 modifier, which is good for influencing and communicating with others.

In terms of saving throws, the Derro has a +7 bonus to Dexterity saves, +4 to Intelligence saves, and +6 to Charisma saves, indicating good resilience against effects targeting those attributes. It possesses a perception skill of +3, which is average. The creature is immune to cold damage, and resistant to both force and psychic damage, as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. It has darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive perception score of 10. The Derro speaks Common, Dwarvish, Undercommon, and Void Speech.

The Derro, Voidwarped possesses several special abilities. It has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened due to its Insanity trait. With the Mortal Void Traveler ability, it does not require air or ambient pressure to survive, making it effective in environments lacking oxygen. However, it also suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom-based perception checks in direct sunlight.

The Void-touched Weapons ability makes all its weapon attacks magical. When attacking, the Derro inflicts an additional 1d6 cold and 1d6 force damage on top of its regular weapon damage. 

In combat, the Voidwarped can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to perform two Shortsword attacks and one Void Tendril attack in a single turn. The Shortsword has a +7 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 7 piercing damage (1d6+4), along with the additional cold (3 damage from 1d6) and force damage (3 damage from 1d6). The Void Tendril also has a +7 to hit and a longer reach of 10 feet, dealing 7 bludgeoning damage (2d6) with added effects: it also inflicts 3 cold and 3 force damage while potentially reducing the target's hit point maximum. A target that takes damage must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its maximum hit points reduced by the damage taken, lasting until it finishes a long rest. If this reduction drops the target’s maximum hit points to 0, that target dies.

The Derro can also unleash a Void Speech Rant, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. By spewing a tirade in its Void Speech, it can affect all creatures within 40 feet that can hear it, inflicting 27 psychic damage (5d10) and incapacitating them until the end of their next turn. Affected creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to take half damage and avoid the incapacitation effect.
