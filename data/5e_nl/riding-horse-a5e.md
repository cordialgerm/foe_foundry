The Riding Horse is a large beast commonly utilized as a mount in adventures. With a good speed of 60 feet and a modest challenge rating of 1/4, this creature is primarily valued for its ability to transport characters rather than for direct combat prowess. Its strengths lie in its robust Strength score of 16, allowing it to effectively engage in melee attacks with its hooves, and its decent Constitution score of 12, giving it a fair amount of hit points. However, it presents very bad intelligence, low wisdom, and poor charisma, making it incapable of understanding languages or performing complex actions outside of its basic instincts.

- Strength: 16, providing a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee attacks.

- Constitution: 12, giving it a +1 modifier, which is average and contributes to its overall durability.
- Intelligence: 2, indicating a -4 modifier, which is very bad and signifies the horse's lack of cognitive abilities.
