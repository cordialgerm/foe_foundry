The Shrieker is a medium-sized plant creature known for its distinct auditory abilities rather than its physical prowess. With a very low Armor Class of 5 and minimal Hit Points totaling just 7, the Shrieker is not built for direct combat; instead, it functions as a deterrent through sound. Its Challenge Rating of 0 indicates that it poses little threat to experienced adventurers. The Shrieker's notable powers include the ability to emit a thunderous sound and a frightening shriek, which can influence the battlefield by affecting the mental state of nearby creatures. However, its weaknesses become apparent due to its poor physical attributes, especially with negative modifiers in Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma, making combat poorly suited for it.

The Shrieker possesses the following core attributes. Its Strength is -5, resulting in very bad physical effectiveness; its Dexterity is also -5, which gives it very bad agility; Constitution is average at +0, providing a basic level of endurance; Intelligence is -5, making it exceptionally poor in its mental capabilities; Wisdom is -4, leading to a bad perception; and Charisma is again -5, meaning it has very bad social interactions. 

In terms of sensory abilities, the Shrieker has a keen sense of 30 feet, limiting its perception to this radius. Beyond this area, it is blind. Its Perception score is a low 6, and it has a Stealth score of 5, allowing it to blend in quite well when stationary. The Shrieker does not communicate in any language.

The Shrieker is equipped with two special abilities. The first, False Appearance, allows it to remain motionless and blend in seamlessly with its environment, appearing as ordinary fungus to any who might pass by. The second ability, Plant Resilience, grants it unusual durability against exhaustion and specific debilitating conditions such as being paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious.

In terms of actions, the Shrieker can execute a Thunderous Burst. This action involves the creature releasing a concentrated sound wave targeted at a creature within a range of 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in 2 thunder damage, while a successful save halves the damage taken.

Its primary bonus action is the Shriek, where the Shrieker emits a loud high-pitched sound that can be heard from 300 feet away. Any creature that can hear the shriek and is within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for the duration of the shriek. The Shrieker needs to utilize its bonus action on subsequent turns to maintain this shriek, but it has the ability to cease the action whenever it chooses. The shriek also ends if the Shrieker becomes incapacitated.

As a reaction, the Shrieker can perform a Startled Shriek whenever bright light or a non-plant creature approaches within 30 feet of it. This allows it to immediately engage its shriek, even if it was not already doing so, potentially catching nearby creatures off guard.
