The Hoarfrost Drake is a medium-sized dragon characterized by its chaotic evil nature. This formidable foe serves as a menace in icy locales, embodying the dangers of the cold with its frigid breath and sharp claws. With a challenge rating of 2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, capable of dealing notable damage while being relatively sturdy thanks to its hit points and natural armor. However, the drake is vulnerable to fire damage and possesses average physical strength. Its tactical advantages make it a more challenging opponent in its preferred terrain, and it features abilities that allow it to maneuver and fight effectively, especially on icy surfaces.

The Hoarfrost Drake has an armor class of 14, which is considered good and provides decent protection in combat. It has 52 hit points, calculated with 8d8+16, indicating that it can sustain a fair amount of damage before falling in battle. With a fly speed of 30 feet and a walk speed of 20 feet, it is agile, enabling strategic positioning in combat. The drake has a strength score of 9, which translates to a very bad modifier of -1, indicating it is not physically strong. Its dexterity of 15 gives it a good +2 modifier, making it relatively nimble, while its constitution at 14 grants a good +2 modifier for saving throws. It has an intelligence and charisma of 10, both average with no modifiers, and a wisdom of 13 provides a good +1 modifier for perception or insight checks.

In terms of saving throws, the Hoarfrost Drake has a +4 modifier to Constitution saves, which is effective, allowing it to resist various effects. With skills in perception and stealth at +3 and +4 respectively, it exhibits good abilities to navigate its surroundings undetected and notice threats in its environment. The creature has specific vulnerabilities and immunities; it is vulnerable to fire damage, which can significantly increase the risk to the drake if faced with a fire-wielding opponent. However, it is completely immune to cold damage, allowing it to withstand attacks from that element without harm. It possesses darkvision up to 90 feet, enhancing its ability to see in dark environments, and has a passive perception score of 13. The Hoarfrost Drake can communicate in both Common and Draconic, which allows for interaction with a variety of creatures.

The Hoarfrost Drake has several notable special abilities. Its Ice Walk ability enables it to move freely across icy terrains without impediments, making it highly mobile in frozen environments. Additionally, its Icy Scales grant it advantage on ability checks and saving throws to escape grapples, allowing it to evade being restrained effectively.

In combat, the Hoarfrost Drake can perform a Multiattack, making three strikes: one bite attack and two claw strikes. Its bite attack rolls a +4 to hit, reaches 5 feet, and deals 5 piercing damage plus an additional 2 cold damage. This combination of damage types makes it versatile against various characters. The claw attack also has a +4 to hit, deals 4 slashing damage, and can also be effective in close melee engagements.

One of its notable abilities is Cloud of Riming Ice, which has a recharge requirement of rolling a 5 or 6. This action creates a cloud of freezing fog within a 20-foot radius that affects all creatures in the area. Affected targets must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid taking 14 cold damage; failure to succeed in a subsequent DC 12 Dexterity saving throw results in dropping any held items. This ability also changes the terrain into difficult ground until the end of the drake's next turn, forcing creatures entering or ending their turns in the area to make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

Finally, the Hoarfrost Drake possesses a reaction called Retaliatory Slip. When a creature grapples the drake, it can immediately attempt to escape from the grapple and, if successful, retaliate with a bite attack against the grappling creature. This ability allows the drake to counter grapplers effectively, maintaining its offensive presence even when restrained.
