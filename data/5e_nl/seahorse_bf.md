The seahorse is a tiny aquatic beast known for its unique adaptations to underwater living. With an armor class of 11, it possesses natural armor that provides some protection, although it is quite fragile with only 9 hit points. The creature has a movement speed of 20 feet while swimming and cannot move on land, making it entirely adapted to life in the water. The seahorse has a challenge rating of 0, indicating it poses no significant threat to adventurers. Its low strength and intelligence scores make it physically weak and not particularly smart; however, it has decent dexterity, allowing it to be somewhat evasive. Notably, the seahorse excels in stealth while submerged and can only breathe underwater, limiting its interactions outside its aquatic habitat.

The attributes of the seahorse are as follows: strength is -5, which is very bad and indicates its inability to deal physical damage; dexterity is +0, an average modifier that provides no bonus to agility-based actions; constitution is -1, which is also poor and reflects its fragility; intelligence is -5, indicating a lack of cognitive ability; wisdom is +0, providing no exceptional insight; and charisma is -4, which is quite bad, suggesting that it has little presence or charm.

The seahorse has a couple of special abilities that enhance its survival in its natural habitat. Its underwater camouflage grants it a stealth score of 17, making it exceptionally good at hiding while submerged, allowing it to evade predators or potential threats effectively. Additionally, the water breathing ability enables the seahorse to function only underwater, meaning it cannot survive out of water, which provides a clear tactical limitation.

In terms of actions, the seahorse can perform a melee attack called "Ram." This attack allows the seahorse to make a weapon attack with a +2 to hit, which is relatively decent for its capabilities. If it hits, it deals 2 bludgeoning damage (1d4), which is a minimal threat level but indicates a means of self-defense when necessary.

Overall, the seahorse is a minor creature with interesting adaptations for underwater life, serving mostly as a passive inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems rather than a meaningful challenge for adventurers. Its abilities and actions are tailored to ensure its survival in its specific environment rather than engaging in combat.
