The Ogre Zombie is a large undead creature that represents a gruesome combination of sheer size and relentless aggression. It functions as a formidable combatant, primarily due to its high strength and multiple actions that can inflict serious damage on opponents. The Ogre Zombie's primary strength lies in its durability and ability to resist typical forms of damage, particularly through its special abilities, which allow it to remain standing even when most creatures would fall. However, its significantly low Dexterity makes it vulnerable to attacks that require finesse or speed, and its poor Intelligence and Charisma indicate limited strategic capabilities and social interaction. This creature can serve as a notable challenge for adventurers looking to test their mettle against the undead.

The Ogre Zombie has an Armor Class of 11, which is considered bad, indicating that it is relatively easy to hit in combat. It possesses 59 hit points, calculated from rolling seven ten-sided dice plus an additional 28 points, representing average resilience overall. With a speed of 30 feet, the Ogre Zombie can move at a reasonable pace. The creature has a challenge rating of 2, which assigns it a value of 450 experience points when defeated.

In terms of its attributes, the Ogre Zombie boasts a Strength score of 18, translating to a +4 modifier, which is considered very good, allowing it to deal heavy damage in melee combat. Its Dexterity is a mere 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, categorized as very bad, signifying that it will struggle with tasks requiring agility. With a Constitution score of 18 (+4, very good), the creature is very resilient to effects that would reduce its hit points. However, it has an Intelligence score of 3 (-4, very bad) and a Wisdom score of 8 (-1, bad), indicating its limited cognitive functions and perception, alongside a Charisma score of 4 (-3, very bad), further reinforcing its inability to engage with others on a social level.

The Ogre Zombie has immunity to poison damage and is unaffected by conditions such as fatigue and being poisoned. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, while its passive Perception score of 8 is low, making it less perceptive to its surroundings. The Ogre Zombie understands the Giant language but cannot articulate speech.

Its special ability, Undead Fortitude, can be used once per day. If the Ogre Zombie is reduced to 0 hit points from non-radiant damage or a non-critical hit, it instead drops to 1 hit point. It then falls prone and is stunned until the end of its next turn, creating an illusion of death that can confuse opponents. Additionally, the Undead Nature ability frees it from the need for air, food, or sleep, allowing it to function continuously without needing rest.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Ogre Zombie utilizes a Greatclub as its primary melee weapon. This attack has a +6 to hit, which is good, and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to strike one target. If it scores a hit, the Greatclub inflicts an average of 13 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

Its Sweeping Strike ability allows it to attack all creatures within a 5-foot radius, also with a +6 to hit. A successful hit deals an average of 8 bludgeoning damage, and targets of Medium size or smaller must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the Ogre Zombie.

Additionally, the Ogre Zombie can perform a Grab action, which also has a +6 to hit. On a hit, it deals an average of 11 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target if it is Medium or smaller, imposing an escape DC of 14. While grappling a target, the Ogre Zombie is unable to grab another.

Lastly, the Bite attack, usable only against a creature that is grappled by the zombie, has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 15 piercing damage. Importantly, the Ogre Zombie regains hit points equal to the damage dealt by this attack, allowing it to sustain itself in combat and continue its relentless assault.
