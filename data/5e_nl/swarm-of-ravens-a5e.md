The Swarm of Ravens is a medium-sized beast that serves primarily as a nuisance in combat due to its ability to harass and distract enemies. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is considered a minor threat, but its swarming ability allows it to occupy spaces and make evasive maneuvers. It possesses moderate mobility with a flying speed of 50 feet, making it agile and difficult to pin down. Defensively, it has an armor class of 12 and 17 hit points, providing it with a limited amount of resilience. The swarm's greatest strengths lie in its damage resistances to various physical attacks and immunities to many debilitating conditions, allowing it to stay active in the fight. However, its low strength and constitution scores indicate that it is rather weak in direct confrontations, making it more effective when used strategically.

The Swarm of Ravens has several attributes that define its capabilities. Its Strength is 6, which gives it a very bad modifier of -2, limiting its physical effectiveness. Its Dexterity is 14, granting it a good modifier of +2, enhancing its agility and ability to hit targets. The Constitution score of 8 results in a bad modifier of -1, indicating below-average durability. Intelligence is negligibly low at 2, resulting in a very bad modifier of -4; therefore, it isn't capable of complex thought or problem-solving. Wisdom is average at 12, with a +1 modifier, allowing some level of perception, while Charisma is exceptionally low at 4, contributing a very bad modifier of -3, which impacts its social interactions. The swarm is proficient in the Perception skill, with a total bonus of +3, enabling it to notice hidden creatures or objects effectively.

In terms of damage resilience, the swarm is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, meaning that these types of attacks deal only half their damage to it. It is also immune to a wide range of conditions including charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, stunned, and unconscious, making it difficult to disable in combat. Its passive perception score is 13, which means it will notice hidden threats reasonably well.

The special ability of the Swarm is "Swarm," which allows it to occupy the space of another creature and move through any openings large enough for a Tiny creature. This maneuverability provides tactical advantages as it can spread out or concentrate on a specific target. However, it cannot gain hit points or temporary hit points, limiting its survivability.

For actions, the Swarm of Ravens can perform a "Beaks" attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, indicating a good probability of hitting targets at close range. The reach is 0 feet, meaning it must be adjacent to the target. On a hit, it deals 7 piercing damage (calculated as 2d6) or 3 piercing damage (1d6) if the swarm is bloodiedâ€”meaning it has taken significant damage. This attack capability allows the swarm to pressure opponents, especially if they are unprepared for a sudden flurry of pecking attacks.
