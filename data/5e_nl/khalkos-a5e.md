The Khalkos is a formidable Medium Aberration that serves as a challenging opponent in combat encounters, characterized by its psionic abilities and high intelligence. With an Armor Class of 16 and a robust pool of 130 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage before succumbing. Its strengths lie in its versatility and magical capabilities, allowing it to engage enemies both physically and mentally. The Khalkos is particularly adept at inflicting confusion and incapacitating foes with its abilities. However, this creature is not without weaknesses; while it has good damage resistances against fire, psychic, and radiant damage, it may still be vulnerable to more physical attacks, especially from those who understand its tactics.

The Khalkos possesses several attributes that define its capabilities:
- Strength: 12 (+1), which is an average modifier, indicating it can handle basic physical tasks but is not renowned for brute force.
- Dexterity: 16 (+3), representing a good modifier that enhances its agility and ability to avoid attacks.
- Constitution: 14 (+2), offering an average resilience that helps it endure damage.
- Intelligence: 18 (+4), giving it exceptional proficiency in mental operations, spells, and tactical planning.
- Wisdom: 16 (+3), which is good, enhancing its perception and insight to judge situations and creatures effectively.
- Charisma: 16 (+3), equally good, allowing it to influence and manipulate others through social interactions.

The saving throws for the Khalkos are impressive, with Intelligence at +8, Wisdom at +7, and Charisma also at +7, indicating an exceptional capability to resist spells and mind-affecting abilities. It is skilled in various areas, including deception, insight, perception, persuasion, and religion, all ranging from +7 to +8, making it a competent manipulator and tactician.

In terms of combat mechanics:
- The Khalkos has damage resistances to fire, psychic, and radiant damage, which provides it with even greater survivability against certain attacks.
- It is immune to being charmed, reducing the effectiveness of certain control spells and abilities used by enemies.
- Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet, enhancing its ability to perceive in low light, and a passive perception of 17, allowing it to detect hidden creatures easily.

The special abilities of the Khalkos are key to its tactics:
- **Detect Alignment:** This allows the Khalkos to sense the alignments of creatures within 30 feet, providing critical strategic information in combat.
- **Magic Resistance:** It has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, significantly boosting its chances of resisting magic-based attacks.
- **Psionic Spellcasting:** With an Intelligence-based spellcasting ability and a spell save DC of 16, the Khalkos can cast powerful spells without any need for components.

The Khalkos has several actions it can take during combat:
- **Claw:** A melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit and deals slashing damage combined with poison damage, making it quite lethal.
- **Chaos Pheromones:** This ability creates a cloud of pheromones in a 20-foot radius, causing confusion among affected creatures unless they succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. A failed save results in 1 minute of confusion, during which the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to break free.
- **Psionic Sting:** A powerful psychic attack that requires the target to make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. If they fail, they take significant psychic damage and become stunned until the end of their next turn, severely limiting their options.

As for bonus actions:
- **Brain Jab:** This attack targets incapacitated creatures with a +7 to hit, inflicting not only piercing damage but also creating a diseased condition that infests the target with brain larvae. This attack can only be used once every 24 hours after a successful hit, making it a strategic choice.

For reactions:
- **Telekinetic Shield:** When targeted by an attack from a creature it can detect within range, the Khalkos can increase its AC by +4 against that attack, providing an additional layer of defense at crucial moments.

Overall, the Khalkos presents a unique blend of psionic abilities and physical attacks, making it a versatile and dangerous adversary for any adventurers daring to confront it.
