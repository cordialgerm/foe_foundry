The Pugilist is a Medium humanoid creature known for its exceptional combat prowess, especially in hand-to-hand fighting. With a solid armor class of 14 and 75 hit points, this creature is moderately resilient in battle. Its challenge rating of 4 indicates that it can pose a significant threat to adventurers, providing a good source of experience points when defeated. The Pugilist excels in agility and strength, with high scores in Strength and Constitution, making its physical attacks particularly potent. However, it lacks magical abilities and relies on brute force and skill in martial combat, presenting a straightforward approach to encounters. With its unique abilities and attacks, it can disrupt opponents and control the flow of combat effectively.

The Pugilist has the following ability scores: Strength is 16 (+3, which is good for melee attacks), Dexterity is 14 (+2, indicating average dexterity), Constitution is 16 (+3, providing good durability during combat), Intelligence is 10 (+0, considered average), Wisdom is 14 (+2, which is good), and Charisma is 10 (+0, also average). Its saving throws are effective, with a +5 in Strength (good) and +4 in Dexterity (average). The Pugilist possesses skills in athletics (+5, good) and intimidation (+2, average), and has a passive Perception score of 12 which is also average. It can communicate in any one language of its choice.

The Pugilist has a special ability called Unarmored Defense, which allows it to calculate its armor class as 10 plus its Dexterity modifier and Wisdom modifier. This makes the base armor class potentially reach up to 15 when factoring in those modifiers, providing solid defensive capabilities without the need for armor.

In combat, the Pugilist can utilize a Multiattack option, allowing it to strike three times with its fists during a single attack action. Each fist attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit (good effectiveness), having a reach of 5 feet and dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. They also have powerful bonus actions including Haymaker, which can be used once per day to enhance its fist attack, dealing an additional 7 (2d6) damage if it connects. Another notable bonus action is Head Shot, usable once per day, which not only deals damage but also forces the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 13); if they fail, they are stunned until the end of the Pugilist's next turn, disrupting their actions significantly. 

Lastly, the Pugilist has a reaction called Opportune Jab, which allows it to make a fist attack against any creature that attempts to grapple it, providing both defensive and offensive capabilities in potential grappling situations.
