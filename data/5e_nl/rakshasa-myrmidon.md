The Rakshasa Myrmidon is a medium-sized fiend characterized by its lawful evil alignment. This creature possesses significant combat prowess, highlighted by its high Armor Class of 18 due to its scale mail and shield. With 51 hit points resulting from a solid constitution, it can withstand considerable damage before being taken down. The Myrmidon is notably versatile in combat, capable of both melee and ranged attacks, and it excels at disrupting enemy actions with its special abilities. However, it is susceptible to piercing damage from magical weapons wielded by good-aligned creatures. Overall, the Rakshasa Myrmidon is a formidable opponent that combines brute strength with tactical support capabilities and magical defenses.

The Rakshasa Myrmidon has the following attributes, with their corresponding modifiers affecting various actions in gameplay: Strength 18 (+4, which is exceptional), Dexterity 14 (+2, which is good), Constitution 18 (+4, which is exceptional), Intelligence 12 (+1, which is average), Wisdom 12 (+1, which is average), and Charisma 14 (+2, which is good). 

In terms of skills, the Myrmidon has a +1 modifier in Perception, which is considered average. This fiend has darkvision extending up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. It understands both Common and Infernal languages, further emphasizing its fiendish nature.

The Myrmidon possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness: 

- **Arcane Weapons**: The Myrmidonâ€™s weapon attacks are magical, dealing an extra 2d4 force damage in addition to regular weapon damage when it hits.
- **Dedicated Warrior**: This ability grants the Myrmidon advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, making it more resilient against such attacks.
- **Limited Magic Immunity**: The Myrmidon cannot be affected or detected by spells of 1st level or lower unless it chooses to be. It also has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects, providing a significant defensive advantage.
- **Tiger Tag Team**: The Myrmidon gains advantage on attack rolls against a target if there is at least one friendly Rakshasa within 5 feet of the target that is not incapacitated, encouraging teamwork in battle.

For actions, the Rakshasa Myrmidon can perform a **Multiattack**, allowing it to make two attacks with either its Forked Scimitar or an Arcane Bolt. 

- **Forked Scimitar**: This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit, spans a 5-foot range, and deals 7 (1d6+4) slashing damage along with 5 (2d4) force damage. Notably, the Myrmidon can choose to disarm an opponent instead of dealing damage, requiring the target to make a DC 12 Strength saving throw or have their weapon thrown randomly within 10 feet.
- **Arcane Bolt**: This ranged spell attack has a +4 to hit, a range of 60 feet, and deals 12 (4d4+2) force damage, making it a reliable option for distance combat.

Additionally, the Myrmidon can utilize its **Spellcasting** ability, using Charisma with a DC of 12 and no material components. It can cast *Detect Thoughts* at will and *Disguise Self* up to two times per day, enabling effective deception and insight into foes.

As a reaction, the Myrmidon has the ability called **Allied Parry**, which allows it to impose disadvantage on an attack roll targeting a creature within 5 feet of it when wielding a shield. This helps protect its allies during combat encounters.
