The Forest Drake is a relatively small draconic creature known for its agility and versatility in combat. As a neutral creature, it occupies an interesting role in the ecosystem, often interacting with both adventurers and other creatures in the forest. The drake boasts a solid Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, along with a respectable pool of 60 hit points, which makes it moderately resilient. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it serves as an appropriate foe for mid-level adventurers. The most notable aspect of the Forest Drake is its ability to launch into impressive leaps, giving it significant mobility in its environment, as well as potent fire-based attacks.

The Forest Drake has the following attributes: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, which is considered very good, making it effective in melee combat. Dexterity is low at 8 with a -1 modifier, which is bad, meaning it is not particularly agile or adept at avoiding attacks. Constitution is high at 19 with a +4 modifier, which is exceptional, granting it a strong hit point pool and resistance to physical blows. Its Intelligence score is 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average, allowing it to understand basic concepts but not complex strategies. Wisdom is decent at 15, with a +2 modifier, indicating that it is fairly perceptive. Charisma is also average at 12 with a +1 modifier.

In terms of skills, the Forest Drake has a +5 modifier in athletics, which is good and reflects its ability to jump and maneuver through terrain effectively. It also has a +3 modifier in nature, again considered good, indicating it possesses knowledge about its natural surroundings. The creature is immune to fire damage and is also immune to being paralyzed and unconscious, allowing it to remain active in combat situations. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and has a passive perception of 12, giving it an edge in low-light conditions. The Forest Drake can communicate using Draconic, Druidic, and Sylvan.

One of its special abilities is **Mighty Leap**, allowing the Forest Drake to perform long jumps up to 30 feet and high jumps up to 15 feet, regardless of a running start. If it lands within 5 feet of a creature, it gains advantage on its first attack roll against that creature before the end of its turn, which significantly enhances its attacking potential after leaping.

In combat, the Forest Drake can use the **Multiattack** action, enabling it to make one bite and one claw attack. Its **Bite** attack allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, allowing for a decent chance to hit a target. If successful, it inflicts 6 piercing damage plus an additional 3 fire damage, making it effective against creatures vulnerable to elemental damage. The **Claw** attack also carries a +5 to hit, dealing 10 slashing damage on a successful hit, and is particularly dangerous due to its ability to deal consistent damage.

The Forest Drake's **Fire Breath** ability allows it to exhale a blast of fire in a 15-foot cone. This attack requires each creature in the area to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, where a failed save results in 17 fire damage and a successful save reduces the damage by half. This ability is particularly powerful and can change the dynamics of a battle, dealing area damage that can affect multiple targets simultaneously. However, it has a recharge mechanism, so it can only be used once every five to six rounds, encouraging strategic deployment during combat encounters.
