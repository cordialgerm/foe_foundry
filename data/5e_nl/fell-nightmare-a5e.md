The Fell Nightmare is a Large Fiend that embodies darkness and flame, making it a formidable creature in combat and a terrifying presence on the battlefield. It boasts a well-rounded set of attributes: a strong Strength score of 18 (+4), which allows it to deal significant physical damage; a respectable Constitution score of 16 (+3), granting it durability with 93 hit points; and an above-average Dexterity of 14 (+2) that enhances its mobility. The creature's Challenge Rating is 5, making it an appropriate foe for mid-level adventurers, providing an experience reward of 1,800 XP. Noteworthy strengths include its ability to create a fiery trail, leaving a path of fire that damages opponents and ignites flammable materials. However, its weaknesses include a low Armour Class (AC 13), making it more susceptible to being hit by attacks.

The attributes of the Fell Nightmare are: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 14 (+2). The Strength modifier of +4 provides the creature with a very good effectiveness in melee combat. The Dexterity modifier of +2 is average, allowing for decent agility, while the Constitution's +3 contributes good resilience, making it harder to take down. Intelligence is average, indicating that it possesses basic understanding but is not particularly clever. Wisdom is also average, suggesting good perception without exceptional insight. Charisma of +2 is good, enabling some influence in social situations, though the Fell Nightmare cannot speak.

Among its special abilities, the Fell Nightmare radiates an Evil aura that may influence players' perceptions of it and shifts the atmosphere of the encounter. Its Fiery Hooves ability not only lights up the area in bright light within a 10-foot radius but also leaves behind charred hoofprints. Fire Resistance allows the rider to benefit from reduced damage from fire attacks, improving survivability in fiery encounters. The Fiery Trail ability is particularly dangerous, creating a burning path that inflicts 10 (3d6) fire damage to creatures entering it or starting their turn there, while also igniting flammable objects—a strategic means of area control. The Telepathy ability allows it to communicate silently with its trainer across a distance, enhancing tactical coordination.

In terms of actions, the Fell Nightmare can execute a Hooves attack, making a melee weapon strike with a +6 to hit that deals 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) fire damage. Additionally, if the Fell Nightmare charges at least 20 feet straight before attacking, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, enhancing the creature's offensive capabilities. The Ethereal Shift, with a recharge requirement available on rolls of 5 or 6, allows the Nightmare and its rider to transition between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane, providing strategic escape or repositioning potential during battles.
