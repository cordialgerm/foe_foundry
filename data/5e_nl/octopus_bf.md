The octopus is a small beast characterized by its aquatic nature and unique abilities that make it adept at surviving in underwater environments. It possesses a relatively low armor class of 11 and a modest 8 hit points, making it vulnerable in combat. Despite its weaknesses, such as poor physical strength and intelligence, the octopus excels in dexterity which allows for good stealth capabilities. Its challenge rating of 0 indicates that it is not a significant threat to adventurers. Notable strengths include its ability to hold its breath for extended periods while out of water, exceptional underwater camouflage, and the capacity to breathe underwater, enabling it to thrive in aquatic settings.

The octopus has the following attributes: Strength -3 (very bad), Dexterity +1 (average), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence -4 (very bad), Wisdom +0 (average), and Charisma -3 (very bad). Its senses include a darkvision range of 30 feet, allowing it to see in dark environments, while its perception score of 12 gives it good awareness of its surroundings. In stealth situations, it boasts a score of 13, which is considered good. However, the octopus cannot communicate verbally as it has no language capabilities.

Regarding its special abilities, the octopus can hold its breath out of water for 30 minutes. This remarkable adaptation allows it to survive during short excursions outside of its aquatic habitat. When submerged, it benefits from underwater camouflage, giving it a significantly improved stealth score of 18, allowing it to hide effectively from predators and threats. Additionally, the octopus has the ability to breathe only underwater, making it ill-suited for life on land.

In terms of actions, the octopus can use its tentacles to make a melee weapon attack against a target within 5 feet. It has a +3 to hit and can deal an average of 3 bludgeoning damage with a successful strike (calculated via 1d4 + 1). Notably, if it hits a Medium or smaller creature, the octopus grapples that target, creating opportunities for strategic advantage. The escape difficulty for the grapple is a DC of 11, which can strain the opponent's ability to extricate themselves.

For its reaction, the octopus possesses the Ink Dash ability, which can be used once every 6 rounds upon taking damage from a visible creature. During this reaction, if the octopus is underwater, it can release a cloud of ink in a 5-foot radius that heavily obscures the area until the end of its next turn. A significant current may disperse the ink prematurely. Following the release of the ink, the octopus can swim up to its swimming speed, but it must immediately release any creature it is currently grappling.

Overall, the octopus is a creature that thrives in its aquatic environment, utilizing its dexterity and specialized abilities to survive. While it may not be a formidable opponent in combat, its unique adaptations allow it to navigate threats effectively and contribute to the aquatic ecosystem.
