The saber-toothed tiger is a large beast known for its fearsome appearance and predatory instincts. As a challenge rating 2 creature, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, leveraging its high speed and strength in combat. The tiger boasts an Armor Class of 12, making it relatively easy to hit, and a sizable hit point pool of 63, which allows it to endure a fair amount of damage. With a strong base Strength score of +4 and decent Dexterity and Constitution values, its physical attacks are potent but are counterbalanced by poor Intelligence and Charisma scores. This creature is particularly dangerous when it can utilize its special abilities, such as its heightened sense of smell and the pounce attack, allowing it to gain an advantage on its targets. However, its lack of ranged abilities can be considered a significant weakness.

The saber-toothed tiger has the following attributes: 
- Strength: +4 (exceptional) 
- Dexterity: +2 (good) 
- Constitution: +2 (good) 
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad) 
- Wisdom: +1 (average) 
- Charisma: -1 (bad) 

The creature's Perception score is 13 (average), while it excels in Stealth with a score of 16 (good). It has no ability to understand or speak languages.

This creature has special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in the wild:
- Heightened Smell: This ability increases the tiger's Perception when reliant on smell to 18 (very good), making it an exceptional tracker and ambush predator.
- Pounce: This ability allows the tiger to move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature, then attack with its claws; if successful, the target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target lies prone, the tiger can make an additional claws attack as a bonus action, significantly increasing its potential damage in one turn.

In terms of actions, the saber-toothed tiger can make two types of attacks:
- Multiattack: This action allows the tiger to make one Bite attack and one Claws attack in a single turn, effectively doubling its attack potential.
- Bite: This is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 9 piercing damage (1d10 + 4) and forces the target to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in a puncture wound that causes the target to bleed, losing an additional 5 hit points at the start of each of its turns until the wound is treated or magically healed.
- Claws: The tiger's claw attack also has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 9 slashing damage (2d4 + 4) on a successful hit.

These abilities and attacks mean that the saber-toothed tiger is a formidable opponent, particularly in environments that allow it to maximize its stealth and ambush potential.
