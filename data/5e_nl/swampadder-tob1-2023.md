The Swamp Adder is a small, non-aligned beast that thrives in wet and murky environments. This creature has a stealthy nature, bolstered by its ability to camouflage itself in swampy areas, making it a formidable ambush predator. Its primary strength lies in its agility and the potential for debilitating poison, which can paralyze unsuspecting foes. However, with a low hit point total and weak physical strength, the Swamp Adder lacks durability in direct confrontations. Its role in combat primarily revolves around stealth and surprise, rather than facing opponents head-on.

The Swamp Adder has the following attributes: Strength 4 with a -3 modifier, which is very bad; Dexterity 16 with a +3 modifier, which is good; Constitution 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average; Intelligence 1 with a -5 modifier, which is very bad; Wisdom 10 with a +0 modifier, which is average; and Charisma 4 with a -3 modifier, which is very bad. The creature has an Armor Class of 13, which offers a moderate level of protection, and has 18 hit points, calculated as 4d6 + 4, granting it some resilience against attacks. It can move at a speed of 30 feet per turn.

One of the Swamp Adder's special abilities is Swamp Camouflage. This ability gives the creature advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when attempting to hide in swampy terrain, making it very effective at remaining undetected in its natural habitat.

In terms of actions, the Swamp Adder can use a melee attack called Bite. The attack roll for this action has a +5 modifier to hit and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to target a single opponent. On a successful hit, the Bite inflicts 1 piercing damage. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer 5 poison damage derived from rolling 2d4 and become paralyzed for 1 minute. If the target succeeds on the saving throw, it only receives half the poison damage and is not paralyzed. The paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the paralysis effect upon a successful roll. This powerful combination of damage and paralysis makes the Swamp Adder a dangerous foe when ambushing or attacking from a concealed position.
