The Voidling is a formidable large aberration with a chaotic evil alignment, known for its adaptability in dim conditions and powerful necrotic abilities. With a challenging presence in combat, it boasts an impressive armor class of 15 and robust hit points amounting to 180, which makes it a tough opponent to defeat. It can traverse the battlefield quickly with a movement speed of 50 feet. As a creature with a challenge rating of 11, it offers a significant challenge to adventurers, providing 7,200 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the Voidling has a combination of strong physical attributes, particularly in Dexterity and Wisdom, leverage to counter magical attacks effectively, and it thrives in areas devoid of light, which enhances its regenerative capabilities.

The Voidling's Strength is 15, which provides a good melee attack potential with a modifier of +2. Its Dexterity is exceptionally high at 21, allowing it a +5 modifier, which translates to very good performance in tasks like initiative rolls and ranged attacks. The Constitution is a solid 15, giving it an average +2 modifier, meaning it can endure some damage. The Intelligence and Charisma scores are average as well, both at 14 and 10 corresponding to modifiers of +2 and +0, respectively, indicating that it is intelligent but not exceptionally charming or persuasively effective. The Wisdom score is particularly useful at 16, allowing for a +3 modifier, which aids in perception checks and makes it good at resisting effects that target mental faculties.

For saving throws, the Voidling possesses a +6 bonus to Constitution and Intelligence saving throws, a +7 bonus to Wisdom, and a +4 to Charisma, indicating strong resilience against mental and magical effects. It has a +9 proficiency in Stealth, making it a stealthy adversary. In terms of damage vulnerabilities, it is susceptible to radiant damage while being immune to necrotic damage, showcasing its unique connection to dark energies. It also enjoys immunity to conditions like exhaustion, petrified, and prone, which makes it highly resilient in various combat scenarios. Enhanced senses provide it with truesight up to 60 feet, allowing it to see through normal and magical darkness, and it can communicate using Void Speech or telepathy within a range of 60 feet.

The Voidling possesses several special abilities that heighten its threat level. Its Darkness Regeneration allows it to regain 5 hit points at the beginning of its turn while in dim light or darkness, making it difficult to kill in such environments. With Magic Resistance, it has the advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which significantly boosts its survivability against spellcasters. The Voids Traveler ability grants the creature the extraordinary trait of not requiring air, food, sleep, or exposure to standard atmospheric pressures, indicating its otherworldly nature.

In combat, the Voidling can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make four attacks, dividing them between its Shadow Tendril and Necrotic Bolt abilities. The Shadow Tendril is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, reaching out to 10 feet, inflicting 8 bludgeoning damage as well as 10 necrotic damage on a successful hit. The Necrotic Bolt functions as a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing 17 necrotic damage on hit. If a victim is struck by two Necrotic Bolt attacks, they must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of their next turn, effectively hindering their ability to act in combat.

Additionally, the Voidling can unleash Shadowâ€™s Grasp, a powerful area-of-effect ability that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This attack sends out grasping shadow tendrils within a 20-foot radius, requiring each affected creature to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 49 necrotic damage and being restrained by the shadows for one minute, while a successful save results in halved damage and no restraints. Creatures can attempt to escape the restraints on their turns, further prolonging the engagement if they fail. Overall, the Voidling is a dangerous adversary that combines magical prowess, resilience, and high mobility, making it a significant threat in any encounter.
