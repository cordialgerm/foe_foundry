Sleipnir is a Large neutral good Monstrosity known for its incredible strength and grace. With a formidable challenge rating of 5, this creature boasts high hit points and impressive physical attributes, making it a resilient combatant. In battle, Sleipnir can effectively engage multiple foes, leveraging its strong melee attacks and unique abilities. It has a slight weakness to magic, particularly against spells that deal cold damage, but it excels in physical prowess with exceptional strength. Additionally, its heroic leap ability demonstrates its agility and versatility, allowing for strategic movements during combat situations.

Sleipnir has an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, along with 105 hit points, which it gains from rolling 10 ten-sided dice and adding 50, giving it a robust constitution and endurance in fights. Its speed allows it to traverse the battlefield effectively, moving 40 feet per turn. Its Strength score is remarkably high at 20, providing a +5 modifier, which is exceptional for inflicting damage and grappling opponents. The Dexterity score is average at 12, granting a +1 modifier, which allows it to evade some attacks but not exceptionally well. Its Constitution score is also 20, contributing another +5 modifier, making it resistant to various effects. The Intelligence score is low at 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, indicating simplistic reasoning but not necessarily lack of understanding. Wisdom is moderately high at 15, giving it a +2 modifier, aiding in perception checks. Finally, its Charisma sits at 10, with a +0 modifier, reflecting average social abilities.

For its saving throws, Sleipnir excels in Constitution with a +8 modifier, which is very good for resisting damage effects and maintaining its health during battles. It possesses skills in athletics (+8) and perception (+5), both of which are useful for physical challenges and detecting environmental changes or foes. Sleipnir has damage resistance to cold, meaning it takes half damage from cold-type attacks, enhancing its survivability in icy conditions. It is immune to exhaustion, which allows it to maintain peak performance even in situations that may tire other creatures. With darkvision extending 120 feet and a passive perception score of 15, it can see in low light and detect nearby threats with good awareness. Sleipnir is capable of communicating in Primordial, enabling it to converse with elemental beings.

Sleipnir possesses special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities. The Heroic Leap ability allows it to leap into the air as a bonus action once per day, gaining a flying speed of 60 feet for one minute. This can provide significant strategic advantages by allowing it to evade attacks or position itself better on the battlefield. The Trampling Charge ability lets it deliver a powerful charge attack; if it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target before hitting them with a rune hooves attack, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If downed, Sleipnir can follow up with an additional attack as a bonus action, making it a threatening adversary.

In terms of actions, Sleipnir can perform a Multiattack, enabling it to make two melee weapon attacks with its rune hooves. Each rune hooves attack has a +8 to hit and a damage output of 12 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 radiant damage. Notably, undead creatures hit by this attack must pass a DC 16 Charisma saving throw; failure results in being restrained by magical runes until the end of their next turn, controlling the battlefield further. Its Gold and Ice ability can be used once per day to summon a powerful avalanche in a 30-foot cone. Affected creatures must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, with those failing taking 13 bludgeoning and 13 cold damage, being pushed back and knocked prone, while those succeeding take half damage without being pushed or prone.

Lastly, Sleipnirâ€™s reaction ability, Eight Hooves, can be triggered three times per day. When a creature moves within 5 feet of it, Sleipnir can move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, enhancing its mobility and ability to reposition itself during enemy maneuvers. This make it a versatile combatant that can respond effectively to threats.
