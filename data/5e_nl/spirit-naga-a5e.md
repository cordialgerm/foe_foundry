The Spirit Naga is a formidable Large Monstrosity known for its potent magical abilities and resilience in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it poses a serious threat to adventurers, boasting an Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 85, derived from 10d10 plus an additional 30 hit points. Its swimming and walking speed of 40 feet each allows it to maneuver effectively in various environments. As a creature steeped in both charm and cunning, the Spirit Naga has the ability to cast spells and can recover from defeat through its unique rejuvenation ability, making it a persistent adversary. However, despite its strengths, it has vulnerabilities rooted in its dependency on spell components and the limited number of spells it can prepare. 

The Spirit Naga has solid ability scores: Strength is at 16 with a modifier of +3, Dexterity is also at 16 (+3), Constitution stands at 16 (+3), Intelligence is at 16 (+3), Wisdom sits at 14 (+2), and Charisma measures 16 (+3). Its saving throws are quite effective, with Dexterity and Constitution both receiving a +6 bonus, Wisdom having a +5, and Charisma also at +6. This indicates that the naga is very good at avoiding certain effects, especially those requiring Dexterity or Charisma savings, while having an average performance with Wisdom. Notably, the Spirit Naga is immune to poison damage and the charmed condition, which enhances its survivability in combat situations. It possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, and communicates in Abyssal, Celestial, and Common languages.

The Spirit Naga's special abilities include being amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, and the ability to rejuvenate. If it is killed, it will regenerate in a new body within 1d6 days, regaining full hit points unless a wish spell is used to prevent this. A critical aspect of the Spirit Naga is its spellcasting; it is a 9th-level spellcaster with an Intelligence-based spellcasting ability that has a spell save DC of 14. The spells it has prepared include various options, from cantrips like mage hand and minor illusion to powerful 5th-level spells like dominate person.

When it comes to actions, the Spirit Naga can execute a melee weapon attack with its bite, which has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 10 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 28 poison damage, while success halves this damage. 

In terms of special attacks, the Spirit Naga can cast Hypnotic Pattern, which creates a visually entrancing pattern within 120 feet, charming all creatures within 10 feet that can see it, on a failed DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. A charmed creature is incapacitated and cannot move for 1 minute, though this effect dissipates if the creature takes damage or is shaken out of the daze. Additionally, the Lightning Bolt spell allows the Naga to unleash a powerful strike of lightning that can hit multiple targets along a 100-foot line, requiring a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw which results in 28 lightning damage on a failure or half on a success. 

Another offensive capability is the Blight spell, which targets a creature or plant within 30 feet, draining its life force for 36 necrotic damage on a failed DC 14 Constitution saving throw (with plants suffering maximum damage and disadvantage on their saves). 

Lastly, the Spirit Naga can respond to attacks with a Shield reaction. If hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, it gains a +5 bonus to its Armor Class and becomes immune to magic missile until the start of its next turn, significantly enhancing its defense for that duration.
