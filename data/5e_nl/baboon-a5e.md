The baboon is a small beast often found in similarly-sized groups in the wild, offering an interesting challenge for low-level adventurers. With a relatively low challenge rating of 0, it poses minimal threat, making it ideal for new players or as a minor encounter. Its primary strengths lie in its agility, reflected in a good Dexterity score of +2, and its ability to utilize Pack Tactics, which allows it to work effectively with its allies. However, its overall combat capabilities are limited, characterized by low hit points and damage output, which could be easily overwhelmed by more capable foes.

In terms of attributes, the baboon has the following scores: Strength at 8, which is considered bad, giving it a -1 modifier; Dexterity at 14, providing a good +2 modifier; Constitution at 10, resulting in an average +0 modifier; Intelligence at 4, very bad with a -3 modifier; Wisdom at 12, which is average with a +1 modifier; and Charisma at 6, very bad with a -2 modifier. The baboon’s passive perception of 11 allows it to notice threats and items in its environment effectively, although it lacks the capability for meaningful communication as it knows no languages.

The baboon possesses a special ability called Pack Tactics. This ability gives the baboon advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of that target and those allies are not incapacitated. This can significantly improve its chances to hit in combat, especially if multiple baboons coordinate their attacks.

When it comes to actions, the baboon can execute one main attack: a Bite action. This is a melee weapon attack with a +1 to hit, and it has a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to engage targets within close proximity. If the attack successfully lands, it inflicts 1 piercing damage. Although the damage output is minimal, the use of Pack Tactics can enhance the likelihood of landing successful hits when attacking in groups. Overall, the baboon may not be a daunting opponent but can create engaging encounters through its social behavior and tactics in a pack.
