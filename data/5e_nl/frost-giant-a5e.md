The Frost Giant is a formidable creature in Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a Huge Giant. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, boasting impressive physical attributes and powerful melee attacks. The Frost Giant's armor class is 15, providing a good defensive capability, while its hit points total 138, ensuring it can sustain considerable damage before being defeated. It moves at a speed of 40 feet, allowing it to close the gap quickly with foes. This giant possesses exceptional strength with a Strength score of 22, allowing it to excel at grappling and causing significant damage. Its Constitution is also noteworthy at 20, contributing to its high hit point pool and resilience. However, the Frost Giant has very poor Dexterity, with a score of 8, making it relatively slow and less agile in combat. The giant is immune to cold damage, indicating a strong affinity with cold environments, while it is susceptible to fire damage, becoming rattled when hit by fire attacks, which can impact its performance in battle.

The Frost Giant has a robust collection of saving throw bonuses, being very good in Strength (+10) and Constitution (+9), which makes it resilient against physical attacks. Its Wisdom and Charisma saving throws are average, with bonuses of +4 and +5, respectively. The giant's skills in athletics (+10), perception (+4), and survival (+4) indicate its prowess in physical challenges, detecting threats, and navigating its environment. 

In combat, the Frost Giant can take multiple actions, including a multiattack option where it can make two melee weapon attacks in a turn. Its primary weapon is a battleaxe, which has a +10 to hit and can deliver an average of 22 slashing damage. Additionally, if the battleaxe attack hits a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or fall prone, gaining a tactical advantage for the giant.

Another key attack is the giant's ability to throw rocks. With a +10 to hit and a reach of 60 feet, a successful hit inflicts 37 bludgeoning damage, and like the battleaxe, it can knock a Large or smaller creature prone on a failed DC 18 Strength saving throw. The Frost Giant can also throw a grappled creature, which can deal bludgeoning damage not only to the thrown target but also to a target it hits, presenting diverse combat options.

As a bonus action, the Frost Giant can attempt to grab a creature within 5 feet by forcing it to make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, the creature is grappled, making it easier for the giant to land attacks with advantage on that target. Once it has grappled a target, it cannot grab another until the first is released. Additionally, once per day, the Frost Giant can use a stomp attack against a prone creature, dealing 13 bludgeoning damage with +10 to hit.

Overall, the Frost Giant is a powerful melee combatant, possessing strong offensive capabilities, resilience, and various tactical options to control the battlefield, while its vulnerability to fire adds a strategic element for attacking characters.
