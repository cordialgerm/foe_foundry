The Vrock is a large fiend classified as a demon, known for its formidable presence in combat and its ability to unleash a variety of debilitating effects on its foes. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it poses a significant threat to adventurers due to its decent armor class, resilience against damage, and magical defenses. The Vrock's natural armor provides it with an effective defense, while its considerable hit points allow it to endure lengthy battles. However, despite its strengths, it has moderate intelligence, making it more reliant on brute force and vicious attacks than on clever tactics.

The Vrock possesses the following attributes: Strength at +3 (average), Dexterity at +5 (good), Constitution at +4 (good), Intelligence at -1 (very bad), Wisdom at +6 (exceptional), and Charisma at +2 (average). These stats imply that while the Vrock can maneuver well in combat, especially in terms of dexterity and resilience, its lack of intelligence may hinder it in strategy-heavy encounters.

In terms of senses, the Vrock has darkvision that extends to 120 feet, which allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Its perception score of 16 indicates a good awareness of its surroundings, while a stealth modifier of 15 suggests that it can be quite stealthy when needed. The Vrock can communicate using Abyssal and has telepathy that reaches 120 feet, enabling it to interact mentally with other beings without the need for speech.

The Vrock has several special abilities that enhance its power. Its Demonic Resilience grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, making it a difficult target for certain types of attacks. Additionally, it is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. Magic Resistance allows it to gain advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it a challenging opponent against spellcasting foes.

In combat, the Vrock can utilize its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make one Beak attack and two Talon attacks per turn. The Beak attack uses a melee weapon modifier of +6 to hit and deals 12 piercing damage on a hit. The Talon attacks share the same hit modifier but deal more damage at 14 slashing damage each. 

Additionally, the Vrock has a special action called Wing Spores, which can be used every 5 to 6 turns. When activated, the Vrock releases a cloud of toxic spores in a 15-foot radius. Creatures within this area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 28 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. A successful save halves the damage, and affected creatures suffer an additional 3 poison damage at the start of their turns. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect early.

As a bonus action, the Vrock can perform a Startling Screech to target a creature within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature cannot take both an action and a bonus action on their next turn and is also unable to take reactions. This ability can significantly hinder a character's effectiveness in battle, especially when facing multiple threats at once.
