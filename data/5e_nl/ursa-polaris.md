Ursa Polaris is a formidable large monstrosity characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This creature possesses significant strength and resilience, with a high Armor Class of 15 due to natural armor, and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 133, derived from 14d10+56. It moves adeptly through both land and water, boasting a walking speed of 40 feet and a swimming speed of 30 feet. With a challenge rating of 7, it presents a serious threat to adventurers, offering a reward of 2,900 experience points upon defeat. Notably, Ursa Polaris is vulnerable to fire damage while completely immune to cold. 

The creature possesses the following attributes: Strength rating is 20 with a modifier of +5, resulting in an exceptional capability for physical attacks. Dexterity is at 12, translating to a modifier of +1, which reflects an average ability to evade attacks. Constitution is high at 18 with a +4 modifier, indicating very good durability. Intelligence is quite low at 4 with a -3 modifier, showcasing a very bad capability for problem-solving. Wisdom is higher with a score of 16 and a +3 modifier, denoting good perceptive abilities, while Charisma is low at 5 with a -3 modifier, illustrating very bad social influence.

Ursa Polaris has skills that complement its abilities, such as athletics at +8, which is exceptional, and perception at +6, showing good awareness of its surroundings. The creature benefits from several special abilities; it has keen smell that grants advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to smell, and snow camouflage that provides advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in snowy environments.

In combat, Ursa Polaris can use a multiattack feature to perform three attacks in a turn: one with its bite and two with its claws. The bite attack uses a melee weapon attack roll of +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 9 piercing damage plus 7 cold damage on a successful hit. The claw attacks also use a melee weapon attack roll of +8 with a reach of 5 feet and inflict an average of 12 slashing damage each on a hit.

Additionally, Ursa Polaris can unleash a cold breath attack, which requires a recharge roll of 5-6. This attack allows it to exhale a blast in a 15-foot cone, compelling affected creatures to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 18 cold damage and 14 piercing damage, while success reduces the damage by half. 

Another significant ability is the Hypnotic Array, also rechargeable on a 5-6. This mesmerizing effect causes ice formations on the creature to create a dazzling light pattern. Creatures within a 30-foot radius must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 21 radiant damage and become stunned for one minute. Successfully saving halves the damage and negates the stunning effect. Stunned creatures can attempt to save at the end of their turns or react to damage from other sources, potentially ending the stunning condition. 

Overall, Ursa Polaris presents a blend of brute force, elemental damage, and control through stunning effects, making it a dangerous encounter for any adventurer brave enough to challenge it.
