The Azza Gremlin is a small fey creature known for its mischievous nature and affinity for lightning. It has a solid Armor Class of 14 and relatively low Hit Points totaling 7, making it somewhat fragile in direct combat. However, its notable agility and dexterity, represented by a Dexterity score of 18 (+4), allow it to evade attacks effectively, resulting in an overall good defense in combat situations. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, this creature is suitable for lower-level encounters, posing a challenging but not overwhelming threat to adventurers. The Azza Gremlin's key strength lies in its ability to manipulate lightning, offering tactical advantages in battle. On the flip side, its Strength is very poor at 5 (-3), limiting its capability for melee attacks without spells. 

The Azza Gremlin has a unique combination of attributes: a Strength of 5 (-3, very bad), Dexterity of 18 (+4, very good), Constitution of 10 (+0, average), Intelligence of 12 (+1, average), Wisdom of 13 (+1, average), and Charisma of 16 (+3, good). This spread makes it particularly adept at dodging attacks and casting spells, while also being somewhat charming. The creature is immune to lightning and thunder damage, providing it with an exceptional defense against those types of attacks. It possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in darkness up to 120 feet, enhancing its sensory perception significantly. The gremlin can communicate in both Common and Primordial, giving it access to a range of interactions but relying on its Charisma for effective communication.

The Azza Gremlin possesses the special ability called Contagious Lightning. When a creature comes into contact with it or strikes it with a metal weapon while within 5 feet, that creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On failure, it attracts lightning for one minute, becoming more vulnerable to future lightning attacks—gaining disadvantage on saving throws against spells and effects with lightning damage—and potentially becoming paralyzed if struck again by lightning damage. This ability adds a layer of strategy, making players think carefully about how to engage the gremlin.

One of its actions is called Lightning Jolt, which it can perform as either a melee or ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit. This attack has a range of 30 feet and can deal 6 (1d6 + 3) lightning damage. The target also needs to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, or they will also become affected by the Contagious Lightning effect, further enhancing the gremlin’s potential to control the battle.

The gremlin's reaction, Ride the Bolt, allows it to instantly teleport along any lightning bolt. Whenever lightning strikes or creatures are dealt lightning damage within 30 feet of it, the Azza Gremlin can choose to relocate to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the strike or damage, facilitating its strategic repositioning in combat. This ability can be especially useful for avoiding danger or catching foes off guard, enhancing its unpredictable nature.
