The Redcap is a dangerous and malevolent fey creature, known for its insatiable thirst for blood and its resilience in combat. This Medium-sized, neutral evil entity excels in dealing damage and incapacitating its foes with its unique abilities and varied attacks. It possesses a formidable combination of strength and constitution, granting it solid health and combat prowess. However, the Redcap's reliance on soaking its cap in blood to maintain its vitality introduces a unique weakness, necessitating that it engage in potentially dangerous bloodletting to avoid ailments. With a challenge rating of 6, it poses a moderate to high threat to adventurers who encounter it.

The Redcap has an Armor Class of 15, which provides it with good protection against attacks. Its hit points total 120, derived from rolling 16d8 plus an additional 48, indicating that it can withstand a considerable amount of damage. The creature moves at a speed of 40 feet, allowing it to cover ground quickly in combat. Its Strength score is exceptionally high at 20, granting it a +5 modifier, which makes its physical attacks particularly powerful. The Redcap has a Constitution score of 17, resulting in a +3 modifier, and it is capable of succeeding on saving throws against damaging effects, as indicated by its +6 in Constitution saving throws. However, its Dexterity is average at 10, meaning it does not excel in agility, and its intelligence is low at 11, with a +0 modifier, suggesting it may not have high tactical awareness. The creature has a Wisdom score of 13 (+1 modifier), enabling it to notice its surroundings well enough, but its Charisma is poor at 8 (-1 modifier), reflecting its intimidating nature rather than interpersonal skills.

The Redcapâ€™s special ability, "Red Cap," requires it to soak its cap in the blood of a humanoid who has died within the last hour at least once every three days. Failing to do so results in it gaining one level of exhaustion for every 24 hours beyond that deadline. This exhaustion can only be cleared by soaking in fresh blood again and then completing a long rest, otherwise, the exhaustion could lead to its death, turning it to dust. This mechanic makes it somewhat vulnerable if adventurers can manipulate the conditions surrounding it.

In terms of actions, the Redcap can utilize a Multiattack feature, allowing it to make one Bleeding Bite attack and two Pike attacks in a single turn. The Bleeding Bite is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. Additionally, this bite inflicts a bleeding effect requiring the target to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose extra health at the start of its next turn. The bleeding damage is 7 (2d6), and the target can reroll the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to try to stop the bleeding. If the target receives magical healing or a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check to stanch the wound, the bleeding effect is also ended. The Pike attack operates similarly, with a longer range of 10 feet and dealing an average of 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.

As a bonus action, the Redcap can perform a "Solid Kick," targeting a Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, offering an opportunity for the Redcap to maintain its offensive pressure on vulnerable foes.

Overall, the Redcap is a ruthless foe with a blend of straightforward attacks and strategic abilities that can create debilitating effects on its enemies, particularly when it exploits its bleeding bite and kicks to control the battlefield.
