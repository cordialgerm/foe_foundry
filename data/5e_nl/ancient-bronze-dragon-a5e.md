The Ancient Bronze Dragon is a gargantuan creature known for its power and versatility. As one of the most formidable dragons, it serves as a guardian of coastal regions and is revered for its intelligence and connection to nature. With a high Armor Class of 21, it is difficult to hit, while its impressive 425 hit points and formidable Constitution make it exceptionally resilient in battle. The dragon possesses a range of abilities that enhance its combat prowess, such as strong multiattack capabilities featuring devastating bite, claw, and tail strikes. Its lightning immunity and natural spellcasting abilities further augment its effectiveness. Notably, it has the capacity for flight and swimming, making it a threat both in the air and underwater. While it has exceptional offensive capabilities, its reliance on advantageous terrain and the potential vulnerability during its recharge abilities may be considered a weakness.

The Ancient Bronze Dragon has the following ability scores: Strength 28 (+9, very good), Dexterity 10 (+0, average), Constitution 26 (+8, exceptional), Intelligence 18 (+4, good), Wisdom 16 (+3, good), and Charisma 20 (+5, very good). In terms of saving throws, it possesses Dexterity +7 (average), Constitution +15 (exceptional), Wisdom +10 (good), and Charisma +12 (very good). Its skills include Insight +10 (good), Perception +10 (good), and Stealth +7 (average). With damage immunity to lightning, it is particularly difficult for foes who rely on lightning attacks. Its senses of blindsight (60 feet) and darkvision (120 feet) grant it an advantage in low-light situations, while a passive Perception of 23 allows it to notice hidden dangers effectively. The languages it speaks include Common, Draconic, and two additional languages of its choice, making it capable of communicating with various races.

The dragon has several special abilities that contribute to its prowess. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, enhancing its mobility in diverse environments. The Legendary Resistance (3/day) enables it to succeed on a failed saving throw, at the cost of some of its scales, while also introducing a potential weakness that reduces its Armor Class to 19 when depleted. The Oracle of the Coast ability allows it to predict the weather for up to seven days and grants it the ability to cast the spell scrying in specific conditions, enhancing its strategic advantage. Its innate spellcasting, utilizing Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a save DC of 20, allows for versatile combat options, enabling it to cast fog cloud and speak with animals three times a day, while controlling the weather and etherealness once per day.

In combat, the Ancient Bronze Dragon can perform a Multiattack, making a bite attack and two claw attacks, or opting for a Lightning Pulse instead of its bite. The Bite attack has a +16 to hit and deals 31 piercing damage plus an additional 9 lightning damage, making it a formidable single hit option. The Claws offer a +16 to hit, delivering 22 slashing damage, while the Tail also has a +16 to hit and can push the target away, combining damage with battlefield control. The Trident can be used in its humanoid form, dealing 12 piercing damage at a distance. 

The Lightning Pulse ability targets a single creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw for significant lightning damage. If the target is in contact with water, nearby creatures can also be affected. The dragon's Breath Weapons have a recharge mechanic, allowing it to exhale powerful lightning or seawater attacks. The Lightning Breath, a long line attack, deals up to 93 lightning damage, while the Ocean Surge attack can push opponents away, controlling their positioning.

In addition to its standard attacks, the dragon has several bonus actions and reactions. The Change Shape ability allows it to transform into a humanoid or beast form without changing its core statistics, but limiting its combat capabilities in certain forms. The Tail Attack reaction offers a counterattack in response to a melee hit, reinforcing its defensive capabilities.

Furthermore, the Ancient Bronze Dragon can utilize legendary actions to further influence the battlefield. The Roar action can frighten creatures within range, while the Wing Attack can push opponents away and allow it to reposition itself. The Foresight action, costing two legendary actions, enhances its defenses by granting advantage on saving throws and disadvantage on attacks against it for a turn, showcasing the creature's foresight and tactical maneuvering in combat.
