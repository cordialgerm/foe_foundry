The Prismatic Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon known for its vibrant appearance and formidable magical abilities. It stands out due to its radiant damage immunity and ability to cast spells, making it a unique opponent in combat. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers. The dragon's physical attributes are balanced, giving it good durability and reasonable offensive capabilities, while its spellcasting adds versatility to its actions. However, with average Dexterity, the wyrmling may not be as evasive, making it susceptible to being hit if its opponents have good accuracy.

The Prismatic Wyrmling has an Armor Class of 16, representing a good level of defense thanks to its natural armor. It has 39 hit points, which gives it average survivability in battle. The creature can walk at a speed of 30 feet and climb at a speed of 15 feet, allowing for decent mobility in both terrain and combat scenarios. It has a Strength score of 15 (+2 modifier), which makes it fairly capable of dealing melee damage, a Dexterity score of 10 (+0 modifier), indicating average agility, a Constitution score of 15 (+2 modifier) that contributes to its hit points and stamina, an Intelligence score of 14 (+2 modifier) that enhances its spellcasting, a Wisdom score of 12 (+1 modifier) providing average perceptiveness, and a Charisma score of 13 (+1 modifier) which aids in some interactions and spellcasting.

The Prismatic Wyrmling's saving throw bonuses are as follows: a +2 for Dexterity, a +4 for Constitution, a +3 for Wisdom, and a +3 for Charisma, which means it has good resilience against effects targeting these attributes. It possesses a skill in Perception with a +1 bonus, indicating it has a bit of effectiveness in noticing hidden things but is not exceptionally good at it. This dragon is immune to radiant damage and cannot be blinded, which can provide strategic advantages in battle. Its senses include blindsight within 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, complemented by a passive Perception score of 15, allowing it to navigate and detect threats in low-light conditions effectively.

In terms of actions, the Prismatic Wyrmling can make a melee weapon attack with its Bite. It has a +4 to hit, targeting a single creature within 5 feet, dealing an average of 7 piercing damage (1d10+2). Additionally, it can unleash its unique Light Beam attack once recharged (on a roll of 5 or 6). This action allows the Wyrmling to emit a 30-foot line of white light, inflicting 18 radiant damage (4d8) to any creature within that line unless they succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, which means that upon failure, they suffer full damage, while a successful save results in half damage, making it a significant area attack.

The Wyrmling also has spellcasting abilities that utilize its Intelligence with a spell save DC of 12 and require no material components. It can cast at will the spell Dancing Lights, creating up to four torch-sized lights that can illuminate an area. Once per day, it can cast the spell Charm Person, which enables it to attempt to charm a humanoid creature, granting the wyrmling a strategic advantage in social interactions. Additionally, it can use Color Spray, which can blind creatures in a cone for a short duration based on their hit points, providing a powerful control option in combat. These spells enhance the wyrmling's versatility and allow it to adapt to different encounters effectively.
