The Snow Terror is a large fiend with a chaotic evil alignment, designed to instill fear and chaos among its foes. With a body that resembles a snow creature, it possesses potent abilities that make it formidable in battle. Its strengths lie in its high Dexterity and multiple damage immunities, allowing it to evade attacks effectively while inflicting significant damage with its biting attacks. However, it is vulnerable to fire damage, which can exploit one of its few weaknesses. Being a shapechanger, the Snow Terror can adapt its form to intimidate opponents or to disguise itself, adding an element of strategy to its encounters. 

The Snow Terror has an Armor Class (AC) of 16, indicating a good level of defense against attacks, and it boasts 127 hit points, which provides it with a solid buffer in combat. Its Challenge Rating (CR) is 8, making it a challenging adversary worth 3,900 experience points. The creature's Strength score is 19, giving it a very good modifier of +4, making it relatively strong in physical combat. The Dexterity score of 22 provides it with an exceptional +6 modifier, which is crucial for both attack rolls and armor class. The Constitution score of 17 yields a good +3 modifier, bolstering its hit points and saving throws. The Intelligence score is moderate at 12, resulting in an average +1 modifier. With a Wisdom score of 9, it has a bad -1 modifier, making it less perceptive. Finally, its Charisma of 16 gives a good +3 modifier, aiding in deception and interaction. 

The Snow Terror has several notable saving throws and skills. It has a +6 bonus to Constitution saving throws, indicating a good chance of resisting effects that require Constitution saves. In terms of skills, it excels in deception with a +6 modifier and stealth with a +9 modifier, enabling it to disguise its intentions and remain hidden. The creature is vulnerable to fire damage while being immune to acid, cold, poison damage, and nonmagical attacks that deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. It is also immune to the poisoned condition and is unable to be frightened. With darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 9, it can see in the dark but is not particularly adept at noticing hidden details.

The Snow Terror's special abilities enhance its combat and stealth capabilities. The "False Appearance (Snow Person Form Only)" ability allows the Snow Terror to blend in perfectly with ordinary snow beings when it remains motionless, making it difficult to detect. Its "Shapechanger" ability enables it to polymorph into a Large snow person or a snowy likeness of a creature it has recently killed, maintaining the same statistics in either form. This ability provides tactical advantages in deception, as creatures familiar with the mimicked victim have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against the Snow Terror's "Horrifying Visage."

In combat, the Snow Terror's "Bite" attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 14 piercing damage along with 14 acid damage on a hit. If it targets a Medium or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed, gaining a restrained condition with total cover. A swallowed creature takes acid damage at the start of each turn and must deal sufficient damage to the Snow Terror to risk being regurgitated. If the Snow Terror takes 15 or more damage from the swallowed creature within a single turn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid regurgitating that creature.

Its "Horrifying Visage" action forces each non-undead creature within 60 feet that can see the Snow Terror to succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for a minute. The frightened status can be shaken off by repeating the saving throw at the end of each of the creature's turns. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw or the effect ends, it becomes immune to the Snow Terror's Horrifying Visage for 24 hours, limiting the ability's repetitive effectiveness.
