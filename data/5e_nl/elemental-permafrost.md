The Permafrost Elemental is a large neutral elemental creature primarily associated with cold and ice. As a strong force in battles, it possesses significant hit points and layers of defense due to its natural armor, making it a formidable opponent. With a challenge rating of 6, it offers reasonable experience points for characters who defeat it. The Permafrost Elemental excels in dealing cold damage and possesses abilities that hinder movement and inflict dangerous diseases. However, it is particularly vulnerable to fire, which can be exploited by fire-wielding characters or spells.

The Permafrost Elemental has an Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, which provides a good level of protection. It has 133 hit points, calculated from 14d10 plus a constitution modifier of 56, granting it above-average durability in combat encounters. Its movement speed is somewhat restricted, allowing only walking at 20 feet, but it can burrow at a speed of 30 feet through nonmagical unworked earth or stone without disturbing the material it passes through. The elemental’s ability scores show strong physical might, particularly in Strength with 19 (+4), making it very good at melee combat. Its Dexterity is low at 8 (-1), which is considered bad, reflecting its cumbersome nature. With a Constitution of 18 (+4), it has excellent endurance, while its Intelligence (5, -3) and Charisma (5, -3) scores are very low, indicating a lack of mental acuity and social skills. Wisdom at 15 (+2) is average, providing it with adequate perception skills.

In terms of skills, the Permafrost Elemental has a perception modifier of +2, which is considered average. It has vulnerabilities to fire damage and resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, making it difficult to damage with standard weaponry. Moreover, it is immune to exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, poisoning, and unconsciousness, allowing it to remain active and capable in various combat scenarios. The creature possesses darkvision and tremorsense, enabling it to detect creatures in darkness and through solid ground within a range of 60 feet. It communicates in Terran, the language of earth elementals.

The special abilities of the Permafrost Elemental amplify its combat effectiveness. Its Earth Glide ability allows it to move through earth and stone without disturbing its surroundings, providing a tactical advantage by enabling stealthy approaches or evasions. The Frigid Footprints ability causes the ground within a 10-foot radius to freeze and turn into difficult terrain, hampering the movement of foes. Its Plague Bearer ability is particularly dangerous; if the elemental takes 15 or more fire damage in a single turn, it infects nearby creatures with a disease, unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 14). This infection can lead to significant health reductions and even death, making it a grave threat.

In combat, the Permafrost Elemental can perform a Multiattack, using two Slam attacks each turn. The Slam attack has a +7 to hit and, on a successful strike, deals 13 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 cold damage. This combination of damage types makes it effective against a wide range of opponents. Its special action, Plague-Ridden Pound, recharges on a roll of 5 or 6 and allows the elemental to slam the ground, sending ice shards flying outwards. Each creature within a 20-foot radius faces 10 bludgeoning damage and 10 cold damage and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 14) to avoid being knocked prone and infected with the primordial plague.
