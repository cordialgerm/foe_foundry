The Black Patch is a large, amorphous ooze that is unaligned and functions as a formidable combatant in aquatic environments. With a notable Armor Class of 7 and impressive Hit Points totaling 153, it can withstand significant damage in battle. Its swimming speed of 40 feet allows it to traverse through water with ease, making it a challenging opponent for creatures that rely on land mobility. As a Challenge Rating 6 creature, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, providing 2,300 experience points upon defeat. The Black Patch's strengths revolve around its evasive capabilities, respectably high Constitution, and its unique ability to mesmerize foes, which can control the battlefield. However, its low Dexterity is a notable weakness, rendering it inept at avoiding attacks and dexterous maneuvers.

The Black Patch's attributes reflect its nature as an ooze. It has a Strength of 18, with a modifier of +4, which is considered very good, enabling it to deal substantial physical damage. Its Dexterity is very poor, documented as 5 with a -3 modifier, affecting its ability to dodge attacks or act quickly. The Constitution of 16 with a +3 modifier is good, enhancing its resilience and endurance in combat. With an Intelligence of 4, Wisdom of 6, and Charisma of 1, these abilities are exceptionally low, indicating that the creature lacks both cunning and social skills. 

In terms of skills, the Black Patch has a passive Perception score of 8 with a -2 modifier, which is average but reflects its inability to sense its environment effectively. It has damage immunities to acid and poison, is resistant to cold damage, and has various condition immunities that protect it from being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, poisoned, or prone. It possesses blindsight up to 120 feet, allowing it to detect creatures in darkness or areas where sight would be hindered.

Its special abilities enhance its versatility in combat. The Amphibious ability allows the Black Patch to breathe both air and water, giving it an advantage in aquatic battles. Eldritch Luminance, a powerful ability, can mesmerize a creature if they start their turn within 90 feet of the Black Patch and fail a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Mesmerized creatures must move towards the ooze, potentially putting themselves in danger. They can attempt to end the effect on subsequent turns, but if they fail, they are drawn closer to the Black Patch, undermining their ability to engage effectively in combat. 

The Flowing Form ability permits the Black Patch to occupy the same space as hostile creatures, allowing for strategic positioning during encounters. This means it can bypass obstacles and squeeze through tight spaces without issue. The Ooze Nature ability ensures that the Black Patch does not need to sleep, allowing it to remain active and on guard at all times.

In terms of actions, the Black Patch is capable of making a Multiattack, which allows it to strike twice with pseudopods. Each pseudopod attack has a +7 to hit, reaches 10 feet, and deals 7 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 13 acid damage, amounting to a total of 20 potential damage if both strikes succeed. The Black Patch can also use its Viscid Suffocation action to target a creature within its space, forcing them to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 18 acid damage and the attachment of the patch to the creature, halving their speed and preventing them from breathing, which can quickly turn the tide of battle against an unsuspecting foe. While attached, the affected creature takes residual acid damage each turn plus suffers disadvantage on swimming checks if they are in water. The Black Patch can detach at will by spending some movement or can be removed by the affected creature through a successful strength check.
