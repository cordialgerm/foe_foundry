The Devil Shark is a formidable and terrifying creature, classified as a gargantuan monstrosity and embodying a neutral evil alignment. With a robust challenge rating of 13 and a substantial pool of 198 hit points, it poses a significant threat to adventurers daring enough to confront it. The Devil Shark excels in melee combat, bolstered by exceptional strength and constitution scores, allowing it to deal high damage while withstanding substantial punishment. Its significant damage immunities and resistances further increase its durability, making it a fierce opponent in aquatic environments. Notably, it possesses unique abilities such as Blood Frenzy which enhances its offensive capabilities against weakened foes, and Magic Resistance that provides it with a crucial edge against spellcasters. However, while it is a powerful predator underwater, its movement on land is nonexistent, limiting its versatility outside of its preferred environment.

The Devil Shark has an Armor Class of 16, attributed to its natural armor, making it relatively hard to hit, although it occasionally falls short in melee attacks against highly skilled adversaries. Its stats are impressive across the board: it has a Strength of 24, granting it a +7 modifier which is exceptional for physical attacks. The Dexterity score of 14 offers an average +2 modifier, allowing for decent movement and reflexes. A Constitution score of 22 yields a strong +6 modifier, providing it with good resilience to damage. The Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 14 each offer a +2 or +5 modifier, which while not exceptionally high, support its abilities in perception, religion, and intimidation.

In terms of saving throws, the Devil Shark excels in Constitution with an exceptional +11 modifier, making it very good at resisting effects that target its health. It possesses a +7 modifier in Dexterity and Wisdom saving throws, indicating a good ability to evade or resist danger. The Devil Shark's skills include a +7 in Intimidation, ensuring it can instill fear, and notable +10 in Perception, highlighting its keen awareness of its surroundings.

The Devil Shark is immune to cold damage and resistant to fire damage, making it particularly durable against elemental attacks. Its senses include blindsight up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 20, enabling it to detect creatures without needing to see them. The creature can communicate in Aquan and Deep Speech, and it has the ability to use telepathy within a range of 120 feet, allowing it to coordinate with other sharks effectively.

The special abilities of the Devil Shark contribute significantly to its threat level. Blood Frenzy grants it advantage on attack rolls against any creature that has less than full hit points, making it dangerous to weakened foes. Keen Smell enhances its perception checks reliant on smell, allowing it to track creatures effectively. Magic Resistance gives it the advantage on saving throws against spells, making it a tougher opponent for spellcasters. Shark Telepathy allows the Devil Shark to command nearby sharks only using simple commands, creating potential strategic advantages. Finally, Water Breathing allows it to thrive underwater, where it can engage in combat without restrictions.

In terms of actions, the Devil Shark has several damaging options. Its Bite attack boasts a +12 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 29 piercing damage on a successful hit and allowing it to grapple the target, who must escape with a DC of 18. The Swallow ability enables the shark to swallow a grappling target, inflicting an additional 21 acid damage at the start of its turns while the target is blinded and restrained inside. This ability can quickly incapacitate foes, eliminating them from the fight unless they manage to escape. If the swallowed creature deals 30 damage in one turn, the Devil Shark must perform a DC 18 Constitution saving throw to prevent regurgitating swallowed creatures. Its Freezing Breath (Recharge 5-6) acts as an area of effect ability, exhaling a 60-foot cone of cold water that requires a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, creatures suffer 54 cold damage and are pushed back 20 feet, while a successful save results in half damage. This breath weapon provides the Devil Shark with a powerful option to control the battlefield and deal substantial damage to multiple foes at once.
