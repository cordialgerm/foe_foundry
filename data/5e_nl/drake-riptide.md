The Riptide Drake is a large and imposing dragon with a lawful evil alignment known for its formidable presence in aquatic environments. With a well-rounded role as both a melee and ranged combatant, it utilizes its significant hit points and natural armor to withstand attacks, making it a tough opponent for even seasoned adventurers. With a challenge rating of 11, it can poses a substantial threat with its powerful abilities, particularly in water where it excels. Its weaknesses are primarily associated with its limited dexterity and reliance on an aquatic setting to unleash its full range of capabilities. 

The Riptide Drake possesses a high strength attribute of 22, resulting in a +6 modifier, categorizing its physical attack capability as exceptional. Its constitution is also relatively high at 20, giving it a +5 modifier which supports its large pool of hit points and durability in combat. However, it has a low dexterity score of 9, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is considered bad, limiting its nimbleness and ranged attacks. The creature has a wisdom score of 16 (+3), which is good, allowing it a decent level of perceptiveness and insight into its surroundings. Intelligence and charisma are average with scores of 11 (+0) and 10 (+0) respectively, providing little in terms of reflection or social maneuverability.

In terms of saving throws, the Riptide Drake is proficient in Dexterity, adding a +3 to its rolls, which is considered average. The creature is skilled in perception, granting it a total of +3 to its perception checks. It is immune to poison damage and conditions such as paralysis, poison, and unconsciousness, increasing its survivability in various confrontations. Additionally, it has resistance to cold damage. Its sensory capabilities are remarkable, with blindsight up to 120 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, in combination producing a passive perception score of 17.

The Riptide Drake has several distinctive special abilities. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, which provides it with an advantage in varied environments. Its echolocation ability indicates that it cannot use its blindsight if it is deafened or out of water. Lastly, it can camouflage itself underwater, granting it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while submerged, making it capable of stealthily launching surprise attacks.

In combat, the Riptide Drake can execute a multiattack, which allows it to perform either three Sonic Pulses or one Bite attack along with two Slam attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit and has a range of 10 feet, dealing a significant 24 (4d8+6) piercing damage. Its Slam attack also features a +10 to hit but has a shorter range of 5 feet, inflicting 20 (4d6+6) bludgeoning damage. 

The Sonic Pulse serves as a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit, capable of striking targets 60 feet away, dealing 21 (4d8+3) thunder damage. This ability can only be utilized while the drake is underwater. The drake can unleash a powerful ability called Buffeting Blast, which requires a recharge on rolls of 5-6. This ability lets it exhale a tumultuous stream of water in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures caught in this line suffer 38 (7d10) bludgeoning damage and become disoriented for one minute, granting them the opportunity to save by making a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage and avoid the disorientation effect.

As a bonus action, the Riptide Drake is capable of manipulating water currents around it while underwater, creating a 20-foot cube of rushing water that makes the space difficult terrain. Any creature starting its turn in this area must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pushed out of the cube directly away from the drake. The drake can also project a current in a 60-foot long and 10-foot wide line, pushing any creature caught within it up to 15 feet from its position unless they can successfully resist with a DC 17 Strength save. Furthermore, the drake can take the Dash action while executing the Manipulate Currents ability, allowing it to reposition itself effectively during combat.
