The Quipper is a tiny aquatic beast known for its swift swimming ability and aggressive nature despite its minuscule size. With an armor class of 13, it possesses decent defenses for a creature of its stature. Its hit points are exceptionally low, totaling only 1, which makes it fragile in combat. However, its swimming speed of 40 feet allows it to navigate through water and evade threats efficiently. As a challenge rating of 0, it is considered a minor threat in the context of the game, primarily seen as a food source for larger predators than anything else. The Quipper's strengths lie in its agility and bite attacks, but its significantly low strength and constitution also make it susceptible to quick defeats.

In terms of attributes, the Quipper has a strength score of 2 with a modifier of -4, which is classified as very bad. Its dexterity score of 16 grants it a +3 modifier, making it good at avoiding attacks and acting swiftly. The creature has a constitution score of 8, yielding a -1 modifier, which is bad for its overall survivability. With a very low intelligence of 2 (-4 modifier, very bad), wisdom of 6 (-2 modifier, bad), and charisma of 4 (-3 modifier, bad), the Quipper does not possess any social or mental capabilities. It has darkvision that extends to 60 feet and a passive perception of 8, allowing it to sense its surroundings in low-light environments, albeit not exceptionally well.

The Quipper has a special ability known as "Water Breathing," which allows it to breathe only underwater. This unique characteristic makes it a proficient inhabitant of aquatic environments where it thrives and poses a difficulty to land-based creatures.
