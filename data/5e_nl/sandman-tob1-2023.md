The Sandman is a medium-sized celestial creature embodying chaotic neutrality. Known for its ethereal nature, it has both formidable abilities and notable vulnerabilities. With an Armor Class of 14, it features 82 hit points, making it fairly resilient for its challenge rating of 5, which corresponds to 1,800 experience points. The Sandman primarily excels in manipulating dreams and inflicting psychic damage, showcasing its strengths in stealth and magic resistance. However, it is vulnerable to magical forces and nonmagical attacks that can penetrate its defenses. The creature's chaotic essence allows it to sway encounters through fear and illusion, while its high Charisma makes it a potent influence in social interactions.

The Sandman's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength of 11, which is average; a Dexterity of 19, indicating a very good level of agility; a Constitution of 16, showcasing good resilience; an Intelligence of 13, which is average; a Wisdom of 14, denoting good insight; and a Charisma of 19, reflecting an exceptional ability to charm and engage. For saving throws, the Sandman has a Wisdom modifier of +5, considered good, and a Charisma modifier of +7, which is exceptional. It possesses damage immunities to poison and psychic, as well as resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, and is also resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks. Furthermore, it is immune to conditions like charm, exhaustion, fear, poison, and unconsciousness. The Sandman has a truesight range of 60 feet and a passive perception of 12, capable of understanding Common, Celestial, and Umbral languages, along with telepathy in a 60-foot range.

The Sandman possesses special abilities that augment its combat prowess and magical resilience. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, improving its survivability against spellcasters. The Stuff of Dreams ability allows it to evade the effects of critical hits, treating them as normal hits due to its partially dreamlike form.

In terms of actions, the Sandman can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Claw attacks. Additionally, it can substitute one of its attacks with its Dreamer’s Sand ability if it is available. The Claw attack has an attack bonus of +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 11 slashing damage along with 7 psychic damage. Notably, damage from this attack does not wake an unconscious creature unless the target is below half its hit points. If the sandman scores a critical hit with its claws, it applies the eye-closer's curse, rendering the target blinded until a long rest is completed or the curse is dispelled through a remove curse spell or similar effects.

The Encourage Dreams ability, which can be used after a recharge of 5 to 6 rounds, affects up to three unconscious creatures within a 30-foot radius. Targets must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw; failure results in experiencing nightmares that deal 35 psychic damage, awakening them and inflicting the frightened condition for 1 minute. Success fills the targets with pleasant dreams, restoring 10 hit points and allowing them the option to continue sleeping or wake up. Targets that are frightened may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to potentially end the effect.

Lastly, the Dreamer’s Sand action allows the Sandman to throw magical sand in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within this area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect can be broken if the affected creature takes damage or is woken by another creature's action, showcasing the Sandman's ability to control and manipulate combat situations effectively.
