The Gnoll Demonfang is a medium humanoid creature that embodies a blend of speed, strength, and chaotic evil. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it presents a formidable challenge for adventurers. Its notable features include a solid Armor Class of 15 and a decent pool of Hit Points totaling 65, making it resilient in combat. The creature excels in melee combat with its high Strength and Dexterity scores, both at 16, providing it an effective attack modifier of +5 on its melee attacks. However, it has average Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, which gives it less versatility in spellcasting and skill checks. The Gnoll Demonfang can inflict significant damage with its multiattack feature and has special abilities that can alter its form and survival conditions.

The Gnoll Demonfang has the following ability scores: Strength is 16, which grants a +3 modifier, categorizing it as very good. Dexterity is also 16, resulting in a +3 modifier, again indicating very good agility. Constitution is 14, giving it a +2 modifier, which is good for supporting its hit points. Intelligence is 10, with a modifier of +0, considered average. Wisdom is similarly 10, with an average modifier of +0, and Charisma is 12, which yields a +1 modifier, classified as average.

In terms of defenses, the Gnoll Demonfang has saving throw proficiencies in Constitution (+4), Wisdom (+2), and Charisma (+3), which are all moderately effective against various forms of attack. It is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions, allowing it to retain its combat effectiveness against certain magical effects. Its darkvision enables it to see in dim light as if it were bright and in darkness as if it were dim light within a range of 60 feet, enhancing its ability to navigate in low-light conditions.

The special ability "Aligned" causes the Gnoll Demonfang to radiate a Chaotic and Evil aura, which can affect the perceptions of nearby creatures. The "Possessed" ability allows it to transform into an ordinary gnoll when affected by spells like dispel evil and good, carrying over any damage it has incurred. If this damage exceeds its maximum hit points, it dies.

In combat, the Gnoll Demonfang can make use of its "Multiattack" feature to attack three times with its primary weapon, the "Charging Claw." The Charging Claw is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, capable of dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage or 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage if it is the first attack on a target during that turn. This ability allows the Gnoll to move up to 10 feet after the attack without provoking opportunity attacks, granting it additional tactical advantages in combat.
