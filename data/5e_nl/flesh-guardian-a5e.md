The Flesh Guardian has several notable special abilities:
- Berserk: If the guardian is bloodied at the start of its turn, it may enter a berserk state by rolling a d6; on a roll of 6, it attacks the nearest creature it can see or an object. It remains berserk until destroyed or healed to full hit points.
- Calming Presence: If the guardian is berserk, its creator can attempt to calm it by making a DC 15 Persuasion check. A successful attempt will return the Flesh Guardian to its normal state.
- Fire Fear: If the guardian takes fire damage, it becomes rattled until the end of its next turn, likely affecting its performance.
- Immutable Form: The guardian cannot undergo any alterations to its shape.
- Lightning Absorption: The guardian regains hit points equal to the lightning damage it receives, turning its vulnerability into a strength.
- Magic Resistance: It has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it less likely to be affected by magic.
- Constructed Nature: The Flesh Guardian does not require air, sustenance, or rest, allowing it to operate continuously without the need for breaks.

In terms of actions:
- Multiattack: The Flesh Guardian can attack twice in one turn using its slam attacks.
- Slam: It has a melee weapon attack bonus of +7 to hit and can reach a target within 5 feet. A successful hit deals 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- Hurl Object: This ranged attack has a +7 to hit with a range of 20 feet to 60 feet. If it successfully hits a target, it deals 18 (4d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- Lightning Bolt (1/Day, While Bloodied): Once per day, while bloodied, the Flesh Guardian can unleash an 80-foot-long and 5-foot-wide lightning bolt from its chest. Every creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. 

The combination of these features and abilities makes the Flesh Guardian a unique and powerful creature in encounters, capable of significant damage output and strategic advantages, particularly in the presence of lightning-based assaults.
