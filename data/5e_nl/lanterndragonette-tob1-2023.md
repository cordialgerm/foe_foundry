The Lantern Dragonette is a tiny lawful neutral dragon known for its distinct ability to create and manipulate light. This creature possesses decent mobility with a walking speed of 40 feet and limited flying capabilities of 15 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it presents a minor threat to adventurers but can surprise them with its fire breath and magical abilities. The dragonette boasts good Intelligence, allowing it to excel in areas such as Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, making it a wise companion or guardian of hidden knowledge. However, its low Strength score leaves it somewhat vulnerable in close combat, relying on its bite attack and breath weapon for offense.

The Lantern Dragonette has an Armor Class of 13, which provides it with average protection. It has 28 hit points, derived from rolling 8d4 plus a constitution modifier of +8, indicating it can endure a decent amount of damage before falling in battle. Its ability scores include a Strength of 7, which is very bad for physical confrontations, Dexterity of 15 (good for agility and evasiveness), Constitution of 13 (average durability), Intelligence of 16 (very good for knowledge-based tasks), Wisdom of 13 (average perceptiveness), and Charisma of 12 (average social interactions). It has saving throws in Wisdom and Charisma, each at +3, which reflects its good capabilities to resist effects targeting these attributes. The dragonette also possesses darkvision that allows it to see in dark conditions up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 13, which falls into the average range for spotting hidden creatures or objects.

One unique special ability of the Lantern Dragonette is its Magical Darkness Hypersensitivity. When within an area of magical darkness, it becomes extremely hindered; it cannot fly, cannot use its Lantern Belly ability, and suffers from ongoing necrotic damage, quantified as 3 (1d6) each minute. This weakness makes it particularly vulnerable in dark environments where magic is at play.

In terms of actions, the Lantern Dragonette can perform a bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. More notably, it can unleash its Fire Breath, which is a powerful attack that affects a 15-foot cone in front of it. Each creature within that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 11. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, whereas a successful save halves this damage.

It also has a notable bonus action called Lantern Belly. This ability allows the dragonette to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, which is useful for exploration and illuminating dark places. For this ability to work, the dragonette must consume at least 4 ounces of candle wax in the previous 24 hours. It can maintain this light for up to 1 hour for every 4 ounces consumed, up to a maximum of 4 hours within a 24-hour period. This light can serve both strategic and thematic roles in adventure settings, providing allies with visibility or creating atmosphere, depending on the situation.
