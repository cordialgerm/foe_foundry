The Nachzehrer is a medium undead creature with a chaotic evil alignment that embodies the horrors of death and disease. With an Armor Class of 15, it is moderately difficult to hit, and its formidable Hit Points of 136 provide it with considerable durability in battle. As a Challenge Rating 8 creature, it presents a significant threat to low-level parties, offering 3,900 experience points upon defeat. The Nachzehrer is particularly notable for its ability to inflict necrotic damage and its diseases that can weaken adversaries significantly. Its strengths lie in its high Strength score of 20, providing it with a good melee attack capability, along with various effects from its special abilities. However, its low Charisma score of 9 could detract from its effectiveness in social interactions.

The Nachzehrer has the following attributes: Strength 20 (+5), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 15 (+2), and Charisma 9 (-1). Its high Constitution suggests exceptional durability, while its average Dexterity offers some agility. The Nachzehrer's modifiers are effective; Strength is exceptional, while Dexterity is average, making it reasonably maneuverable in combat.

It possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities and make it a fearsome adversary. The Grave Pox ability infects creatures upon touch or proximity, making them vulnerable to necrotic damage and imposing a level of exhaustion that they cannot recover from normally. This effect can severely hinder opponents, as they cannot mitigate their exhaustion through rest, and the disease is highly contagious. Additionally, as the condition progresses, the infected creatures will find themselves increasingly weakened, indicated by painful pustules on their skin. In gameplay, this can lead to significant strategic advantages for the Nachzehrer, as it spreads its debilitating influence among party members.

The Weakening Shadow ability causes creatures that are not constructs or undead to have disadvantage on all Strength-based rolls while in proximity to the Nachzehrer, thus lowering their effectiveness in combat. This can demoralize melee-focused characters who rely on their strength.

In terms of actions, the Nachzehrer can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks in one turn: two fists and one bite. The Bite attack is particularly dangerous, with a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and the capability to deal 7 piercing damage plus 13 necrotic damage. Importantly, this necrotic damage reduces the target's hit point maximum by an equal amount, and the Nachzehrer restores its health by that same value. If this reduction brings the target's hit points to zero, they die. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become infected with Grave Pox. The Fist attack, also wielding a +8 to hit, allows the Nachzehrer to inflict 12 bludgeoning damage, presenting a solid damaging option as well.

In summary, the Nachzehrer is a powerful and insidious undead creature that can manipulate the battlefield through disease and debilitation. Its combination of high Strength, substantial health, and debilitating abilities makes it a dangerous foe that players must approach with caution.
