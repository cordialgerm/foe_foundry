The Vulture is a medium-sized beast known for its role as a scavenger in the ecosystem. With a low overall challenge rating of 0, it poses little threat to adventurers in direct combat. The Vulture has an average armor class of 10 and only 8 hit points, making it quite fragile. Its strengths include heightened perception abilities that enable it to detect carrion and enhance its sight and smell. Moreover, it benefits from pack tactics, gaining an advantage on attacks when in proximity to allies. However, its weaknesses include low strength and charisma ratings, rendering it ineffective in melee combat and social interactions. Notably, the Vulture can incapacitate attackers with its defensive bile, adding an unexpected level of utility in a fight.

The Vulture has the following attributes: strength is rated at -2, which is very bad, dexterity is +0 (average), constitution is +1 (average), intelligence is -4 (very bad), wisdom is +1 (average), and charisma is -3 (very bad). The creature's stealth score is a modest 10, while its perception score is 13, translating to an effective perception of 18 when detecting via sight or smell due to its heightened senses.

The Vulture possesses special abilities that enhance its scavenging capability and combat performance. The Carrion Sense allows the Vulture to locate carrion, dead creatures, and undead creatures within 60 feet by scent alone. Heightened Sight and Smell further bolster its perceptive capabilities, making it adept at locating potential food sources from afar. The Pack Tactics ability grants the Vulture an advantage on attack rolls against a foe if at least one ally is within 5 feet, which can significantly increase its chances of hitting a target.

In terms of actions, the Vulture can make a melee weapon attack with its beak. This attack has a +2 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing 2 piercing damage on a successful hit, which is minimal and not very threatening. As a reaction, the Vulture can use Defensive Bile, which activates when it is hit by a melee attack while within 5 feet. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the end of its next turn, providing a tricky countermeasure for foes in close combat. This ability gives the Vulture a way to defend itself effectively despite its low overall combat capability.
