The Giant Eagle is a large beast characterized by its keen senses and aerial prowess, making it an effective scout and a fierce combatant. With a moderate Armor Class of 13 and 40 hit points, it presents a small challenge to unprepared adventurers, earning a Challenge Rating of 1. This creature combines decent physical abilities, particularly in Dexterity with a +3 modifier, which is considered good, allowing it superior agility in flight and combat. However, its Constitution is only average, with a +1 modifier, and it has low mental abilities with its Intelligence being -1, deemed very bad. Notably, the Giant Eagle possesses heightened sight, greatly enhancing its Perception when relying on vision. Its special ability to swim adds versatility, although it can face dangers if it remains submerged too long.

The Giant Eagle has the following attributes: Strength is +3 (average), Dexterity is +3 (good), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is -1 (very bad), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +0 (average). It can perceive its environment with a Perception skill of 14, benefiting from exceptional sight with its heightened sight ability, which increases its Perception to a remarkable 19 when using vision alone. Additionally, it has a Stealth value of 13, making it fairly adept at moving unseen. This eagle understands Common and Auran but cannot speak either language.

In combat, the Giant Eagle can utilize several actions. They are capable of Multiattack, allowing it to take one Beak and one Talons attack in a single turn. For its Beak attack, it makes a melee weapon attack roll with a +5 to hit, which is considered good. The Beak does an average of 6 piercing damage on a hit. On the other hand, the Talons attack also has a +5 to hit and deals significantly more damage, at an average of 10 slashing damage, and it can grapple a Medium or smaller target, restricting their movement until they successfully escape the grapple with a DC 13 check.

The Giant Eagle's special abilities enhance its utility in both exploration and combat. The Heightened Sight ability allows it to see exceptionally well, improving its ability to detect hidden creatures or objects. The Seabird ability grants it the capacity to swim up to 40 feet, although it must always transition to flying or end its movement on solid ground. This adds a layer of strategy, as if the eagle ends its turn submerged, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to avoid suffocating, making it potentially vulnerable in dangerous aquatic environments. Overall, the Giant Eagle is a versatile creature, effective in various contexts, but it does possess some limitations with its swimming ability.
