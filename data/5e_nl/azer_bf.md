The Azer is a Medium elemental creature that embodies the essence of fire and heat. It serves as a formidable combatant with a decent Armor Class of 17, indicating strong defenses bolstered by natural armor and a shield. With 49 hit points, the Azer is resilient in battle, making it challenging for adventurers to defeat. As a CR 2 creature, it poses a moderate challenge with its strong melee capabilities and fiery abilities, which allow for significant damage output. Notably, the Azer excels in close-quarters combat, with its fire-based damage dealing potential. However, it may lack mobility with a speed of 30 feet and has average Dexterity, which might make it vulnerable to faster opponents.

The Azer's attributes are structured as follows: Strength is +3 (good), Dexterity is +1 (average), Constitution is +4 (very good), Intelligence is +1 (average), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is +0 (bad). This distribution indicates that the Azer is particularly tough, allowing it to absorb considerable damage, while displaying average results in other areas.

The special abilities of the Azer include "Heated Body," which inflicts 3 (1d6) fire damage on creatures that touch it or hit it with melee attacks while within 5 feet. This ability encourages opponents to maintain distance, as contact results in damage. With the "Heated Weapons" ability, whenever the Azer strikes with a metal melee weapon, it adds an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage to the attack, enhancing its offensive capability. The "Illumination" ability allows the Azer to emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, which can be advantageous in dark environments and affect visibility in combat.

In terms of actions, the Azer can execute a "Multiattack," permitting it to make two Warhammer attacks in a single turn. Its Warhammer has a +5 to hit, and it can deliver either 7 (1d8 + 3) or 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands, in addition to the 3 (1d6) fire damage from its "Heated Weapons" ability. This combination can lead to significant damage per turn, making it a threatening adversary.

As a bonus action, the Azer can activate "Blazing Bulwark," creating a line of fire that extends 15 feet long and 1 foot wide. This line provides half-cover for creatures behind it, while also dealing damage to any creature that moves through it as if they had touched the Azer. This ability lasts for 1 minute or until the Azer uses this action again, adding a strategic element to its defensive capabilities and shaping the battlefield to its advantage.
