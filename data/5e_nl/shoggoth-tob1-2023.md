The Shoggoth is a massive aberration that embodies chaos and unpredictability in combat. Its formidable presence boasts a high armor class of 18 and an impressive pool of 325 hit points, making it a heavy-hitting adversary that can absorb tremendous damage before succumbing. As a creature with a Challenge Rating of 19, the Shoggoth represents a considerable threat, particularly given its unique abilities and resistances. It possesses extraordinary physical strength with a Strength score of 26 (+8), which allows it to deal significant melee damage and overpower lesser creatures with ease. The Shoggoth is resistant to various forms of damage, including bludgeoning, fire, and piercing, while being immune to cold, slashing, and thunder. Its chaotic nature can be both an advantage and liability, with features that disrupt opponents while being significantly difficult to control or harm.

The Shoggoth’s stat sheet is as follows: it has a Dexterity score of 14 (+2), which gives it average agility; a Constitution score of 28 (+9), indicating very good resilience; an Intelligence score of 12 (+1), marking it as average in cunning; a Wisdom score of 20 (+5), which is good and demonstrates its perceptive abilities; and a Charisma score of 13 (+1), reflecting an average proficiency in influence and interaction. The Shoggoth excels in perception, given its skill modifier of +11, making it exceptional at noticing hidden creatures or environmental changes. 

In terms of its special abilities, the Shoggoth has several notable traits: it does not require air, demonstrating its anaerobic nature; it can absorb fallen foes’ bodies, enabling it to potentially thwart resurrection efforts unless specific powerful spells, like true resurrection or wish, are employed. Its amorphous quality allows it to pass through tight spaces effortlessly, while its hideous cacophony creates a disorienting effect on nearby creatures, potentially rendering them incapacitated for a turn if they fail a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. Additionally, the Shoggoth possesses keen hearing and smell, granting it advantage on related Perception checks, and its limited mutability allows it to temporarily withstand shape-altering spells for just one round.

In combat, the Shoggoth can perform multiattacks, making four Slam attacks in one turn. Each Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +14 to hit, reaching out to 15 feet and dealing an average of 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage to its target. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it becomes grappled with an escape DC of 18. Furthermore, the Shoggoth can use its Crush ability on up to two grappled creatures, forcing them to make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. Failure results in an additional 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage, renders them unable to breathe, and restrains them until the grapple is released. If the Shoggoth moves, it will free the creatures beneath it from restraint, though they remain grappled.

With its enormous size, myriad abilities, and terrifying presence, the Shoggoth stands out as a potent entity on the battlefield, challenging players to think strategically when confronting this chaotic and formidable foe.
