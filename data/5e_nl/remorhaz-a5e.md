The Remorhaz is a formidable Huge monstrosity that serves as a terrifying force of nature in any encounter. With a high Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 195, it is designed to withstand significant damage while delivering its own in close combat. The Remorhaz boasts exceptional strength with a Strength score of 22, allowing it to perform powerful melee attacks and grapple opponents effectively. However, its lower Dexterity score of 12 provides only average agility, making it less nimble in battle. The creature is immune to cold and fire damage, making it resilient against certain types of attacks, but it has very low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, resulting in poor mental capabilities and ineffective interactions outside of combat. Overall, the Remorhaz is a fierce combatant that thrives on grappling and dealing fiery damage, capable of swallowing its foes and subjecting them to continuous harm.

The attributes of the Remorhaz are as follows: 
- Strength is 22 with a modifier of +6, which is exceptionally powerful, allowing the creature to deal significant damage in close combat.
- Dexterity is 12 with a modifier of +1, offering average agility for its movements.
- Constitution is 20 with a modifier of +5, providing it with good resilience and stamina.
- Intelligence is 4 with a modifier of -3, which is very bad, indicating a lack of cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom is 12 with a modifier of +1, which is average, giving it basic awareness.
- Charisma is 5 with a modifier of -3, representing very bad social capabilities.

For saving throws, the Remorhaz has a bonus of +1 to Intelligence saves and +5 to Wisdom saves, with the latter being good against mental effects. It lacks any notable skills.

In terms of special abilities, the Remorhaz features a trait called Heated Body. When a creature starts its turn grappling the Remorhaz, touches it, or hits it with a melee attack while within five feet, they will take 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the Remorhaz is bloodied, this damage increases to 21 (6d6). However, if the Remorhaz has recently taken cold damage, this ability will not function during that turn.

The Remorhaz's actions in combat are quite dangerous. It utilizes a Multiattack option, allowing it to make a bite attack and a constrict attack in one turn. 

Its bite attack has a +10 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, and deals 16 (3d6 + 6) piercing damage along with an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature and is grappled by the Remorhaz, it is swallowed. A swallowed creature becomes blinded and restrained, unable to escape except through specific means. While inside the Remorhaz, they receive 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the Remorhaz's turns. If a swallowed creature manages to deal 30 or more damage to the Remorhaz in a single turn, or if the Remorhaz dies, it will vomit up all swallowed creatures.

The Constrict action also has a +10 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and applying the Heated Body trait to the target. The target is also grappled, with an escape difficulty of DC 18, and remains restrained while grappled. This massive creature can grapple up to three creatures at once, making it a dire threat to any adventurers it encounters.
