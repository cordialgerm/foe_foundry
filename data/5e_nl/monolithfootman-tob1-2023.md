The Monolith Footman is a formidable large construct that serves as an intimidating presence on the battlefield. With its solid defenses, including natural armor, and a substantial pool of hit points, it can absorb a good amount of damage before being taken down. It possesses the ability to deal significant melee damage through its weapon attacks, which are enhanced with magical properties. The Monolith Footman is particularly resilient against various damage types, being immune to poison and psychic damage, and it also has resistances to nonmagical attacks, provided they are not made with adamantine weapons. However, while it boasts a powerful attack and is hard to put down, the construct does have limitations in terms of intelligence and charisma, rendering it less effective in situations requiring complex decision-making or social interactions. It can be a challenging opponent in combat, with unique abilities that can control the battlefield, especially when fighting in areas influenced by fey magic.

The Monolith Footman has the following attributes: Strength is 15 with a +2 modifier, indicating good physical capability; Dexterity is 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average; Constitution is 14 with a +2 modifier, demonstrating good durability; Intelligence is average at 10 with a +0 modifier; Wisdom is also average at 10 with a +0 modifier; and Charisma is once again average at 10 with a +0 modifier. Its armor class is 14, which is good for a creature of its size, allowing it to withstand many attacks. It has 60 hit points, calculated as 8d10 + 16, providing it with decent longevity in battle.

The Monolith Footman also has impressive defensive capabilities. It is immune to poison and psychic damage, meaning it cannot be affected by those types of damage at all, making it a difficult target for certain spellcasters. It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that are not made with adamantine weapons, indicating that while it can still be hurt, it will take less damage from most attackers. Furthermore, it is immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, giving it exceptional resilience in combat scenarios. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, making it effective in low-visibility environments. The creature communicates in Elvish and Umbral, enabling it to have interactions with specific beings in the lore.

The special abilities of the Monolith Footman further enhance its combat effectiveness. Its ability, Coldfire Weapons, means that when it makes a weapon attack, it deals an additional 1d8 damage of either cold or fire type, which is particularly advantageous against foes susceptible to those damage types. This can significantly increase its overall damage output. The Construct Nature ability indicates that it doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate consistently without the limits imposed on organic creatures. A notable vulnerability, however, is its Simple Construction ability, which states that a critical hit will destroy the footman and cause it to burst into pieces. Any creature within 5 feet must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 bludgeoning damage, which can lead to dangerous situations if positioned poorly in combat.

In terms of actions, the Monolith Footman can make two attacks with a Shortsword in a single turn, demonstrating its adeptness in melee combat. The Shortsword attack has a +4 to hit and deals 9 slashing damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) damage of the chosen cold or fire type. Remarkably, if the target is within a fey court or castle, upon being hit, it must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become invisible, silent, and paralyzed for 1 minute. During this time, an illusory double of the target remains visible and audible, creating significant tactical opportunities for the footman as the illusion can mislead the target's allies. The target can attempt to break free from this paralyzing effect at the end of each of its turns by succeeding on the saving throw, which adds a layer of strategy as the Monolith Footman can control enemy actions and create chaos in combat situations.
