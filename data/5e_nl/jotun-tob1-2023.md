The Jotun is a gargantuan giant characterized by its formidable stature and chaotic neutral alignment. With an impressive armor class of 20 and a staggering 370 hit points, it boasts exceptional defensive and offensive capabilities, making it a fearsome opponent on the battlefield. As a challenge rating 22 creature, it is recommended for high-level parties, offering significant experience upon defeat. The Jotun excels in melee combat with powerful attacks and has unique magical abilities that enhance its combat prowess. However, its low dexterity makes it less mobile, presenting a vulnerability against faster enemies. Notably, the Jotun's magical resistance and immunity to certain types of physical damage provide it with substantial resilience.

In terms of attributes, the Jotun possesses a Strength score of 30, which provides a +10 modifier, indicating exceptional physical power. Its Constitution score of 26 yields a +8 modifier, providing it exquisite durability. The Intelligence score of 18 grants it a +4 modifier, signifying above-average intelligence for a creature of its kind. Wisdom and Charisma scores are 20 (+5) and 14 (+2), respectively, while its Dexterity is notably low at 8 (-1), indicating very bad agility. The Jotun's saving throws reflect its strengths: +15 for Constitution (exceptional), +12 for Wisdom (very good), and +9 for Charisma (good).

The Jotun is skilled in Arcana, History, and Nature, each receiving a +11 modifier (very good), and has a decent Stealth score of +6 (average). It is immune to cold damage and nonmagical damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing, enhancing its defensive capabilities. With darkvision extending to 120 feet and a passive Perception of 15, the Jotun possesses good awareness in dimly lit environments. It communicates in Common and Giant languages.

The Jotun's special abilities include Demigod’s Vitality, which prevents its ability scores and hit point maximum from being reduced by anything other than a wish spell. This notably increases its resilience in prolonged encounters. Its Icy Weapons ability ensures that all weapon attacks inflict an extra 6d8 cold damage, significantly raising its damage output to formidable levels. Magic Resistance grants the Jotun an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability against spellcasting foes. The Material Bound ability renders the Jotun immune to spells or effects that would forcibly transport it off the Material Plane. However, it suffers disadvantage on saving throws against spells that attempt to bring it back from other planes.

When it comes to combat, the Jotun employs its Multiattack feature to use Frightful Presence, followed by making three attacks with its Greatclub or rocks. The Greatclub attack rolls a +17 to hit and deals a total of 28 bludgeoning damage plus 27 cold damage. Alternatively, its Rock ranged attack also hits with a +17 bonus and inflicts 32 bludgeoning damage plus 27 cold damage. The Frightful Presence ability instills fear in nearby creatures, forcing them to make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute, introducing a significant tactical advantage in combat. A frightened creature can retry the saving throw at the end of its turn, but once it succeeds, it gains immunity to the Jotun's Frightful Presence for 24 hours.

The Jotun’s Icy Sweep is a recharge ability that allows it to make a sweeping attack with its greatclub. Creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take substantial damage (36 bludgeoning and 54 cold) and be pushed back, while those who succeed take half damage and are unaffected by the push or being knocked prone. Lastly, the Jotun possesses spellcasting abilities, utilizing Wisdom as its spellcasting ability. It can cast earthquake and speak with animals at will, providing strategic benefits. Additionally, it can cast bestow curse and gust of wind three times per day, and divination once per day, adding another layer of versatility and tactical options in encounters.

As a reaction, the Jotun can employ Rock Catching, allowing it to catch thrown rocks with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, resulting in no damage from the projectile. This ability showcases the Jotun's exceptional physical prowess and agility, despite its low Dexterity score. Overall, the Jotun represents a major challenge for adventurers, with its potent combination of strength, magical abilities, and terrifying presence.
