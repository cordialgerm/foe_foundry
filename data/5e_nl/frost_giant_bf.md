The Frost Giant is a formidable creature, categorized as a Huge giant, typically serving as a guardian of icy realms or a powerful adversary in combat. With a robust challenge rating of 8, this creature boasts impressive statistics including high hit points and strong physical attributes, making it a significant threat on the battlefield. It excels in close-quarters combat with its powerful melee attacks and possesses noteworthy cold damage capabilities, but it is vulnerable when knocked prone. The Frost Giant's special abilities enhance its agility on icy terrain and allow it to see clearly through snow and sleet, adding to its tactical advantage during encounters.

The Frost Giant possesses the following attributes: Strength of +6 (exceptional), Dexterity of +2 (average), Constitution of +8 (exceptional), Intelligence of -1 (very bad), Wisdom of +3 (good), and Charisma of +4 (good). Its armor class is 14, primarily due to its hide armor, and it has a significant pool of hit points at 166. The creature moves at a speed of 40 feet and has decent perception, with a score of 13. It can communicate in Common and Giant languages, though it lacks any specialized sensory capabilities, such as darkvision.

One of the Frost Giant's notable special abilities, "Giant Attributes," grants it resistance to being stunned, which can be pivotal in combat, but it is vulnerable to being knocked prone. The "Ice Walk" ability allows the giant to traverse icy surfaces effortlessly, ignoring penalties usually associated with difficult terrain made of ice or snow. Another ability, "Snowsight," enables the giant to see through heavy snowfall and other wintry obscurities without hindrance.

In combat, the Frost Giant can utilize a "Multiattack" action, allowing it to make two attacks with either its Icy Greataxe or Ice Boulder. The "Icy Greataxe" is a melee weapon strike with a +9 to hit that can reach targets 10 feet away, resulting in a potential 25 slashing damage plus an additional 4 cold damage. The "Ice Boulder" serves as a ranged attack option, with a +6 to hit and a range of 60 feet; it deals 18 bludgeoning damage and adds 9 cold damage upon a successful hit.

Additionally, the Frost Giant has a potent special action called "Avalanche," which requires a recharge of 5 to 6 turns. This attack unleashes a wave of snow in a 30-foot cone, compelling affected creatures to make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 16. Failing the save results in the creature taking 14 bludgeoning damage and 18 cold damage while being buried under the snow, thereby becoming restrained. Those who succeed take half damage and remain unburied, while a buried creature can free itself or be freed by others with a successful Strength check.

As a bonus action, the Frost Giant can employ "Wintry Blast," targeting creatures in a 30-foot line with a width of 5 feet. Affected creatures must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 16; if they fail, their movement speed is halved until the end of their next turn. If they fail by a margin of 5 or more, they become petrified in ice for one hour or until they are heated by another creature for a minute.

Overall, the Frost Giant is a powerful adversary capable of dealing substantial damage while controlling the battlefield with its cold-themed abilities. Its strengths lie in its resistances and mobility across icy terrain, while its weaknesses primarily emerge when it is knocked prone.
