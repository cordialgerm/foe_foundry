The Living Shade is a medium-sized fey creature known for its stealthy nature and ability to blend into shadows. It possesses a moderate level of resilience with a challenge rating of 1/4, making it an encounter suitable for low-level adventurers. With an armor class of 12 and 18 hit points, it is not particularly hard to hit, but it compensates for this with significant resistances and immunities. Its innate skills in stealth, combined with its ability to effortlessly navigate through tight spaces, make it an elusive foe in combat. However, the Living Shade is vulnerable to radiant damage, which can pose a significant threat to it. Consequently, while it is adept at evading detection, it must be cautious in brightly lit environments where its abilities are hampered.

The Living Shade has the following attributes: Strength of 6, which is very bad for melee combat, Dexterity of 14, providing a good bonus of +2 to attack and damage rolls, Constitution of 10, which reflects average toughness, Intelligence of 9, which is bad for mental battles, Wisdom of 10, indicative of average perception, and Charisma of 12, giving it a slight edge in social interactions or magical effects. 

In terms of skills, the Living Shade excels in stealth, boasting a modifier of +6, which is very good, allowing it to effectively hide from opponents in its environment. It is also immune to several conditions, including exhaustion and frightened, making it very resilient in combat situations.

The Living Shade possesses several special abilities that enhance its unique traits. Firstly, its Amorphous ability enables it to move through openings as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, which allows it to access tight spaces easily. The Shadow Stealth ability allows it to take the Hide action as a bonus action while in dim light or darkness, enabling it to become even more elusive during combat. However, the Sunlight Sensitivity trait imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks when in sunlight, making it less effective under bright conditions.

When it comes to actions, the Living Shade can make a melee attack called Shadow Touch. This attack has a +4 to hit, which is a good modifier, and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it deals 2 points of cold damage (1d4). The cold damage can be impactful in certain situations, particularly against enemies vulnerable to this damage type.

Overall, the Living Shade serves as a stealthy ambusher that thrives in dark environments but must remain wary of daylight. Its abilities make it adept at evasion and surprise, but it is easily threatened by radiant energy.
