The Shadow Fey is a medium-sized humanoid creature that falls under the lawful evil alignment. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it embodies a blend of mischief and malice common to fey creatures, paired with a distinctive ability to operate in darkness. The Shadow Fey has notable strengths that include proficiency in stealth and a unique ability to traverse shadows. However, it has a significant weakness when exposed to sunlight, making it less effective in bright conditions. The creature wields both a shortsword and shortbow, allowing it to engage effectively in melee and ranged combat.

The Shadow Fey possesses an Armor Class of 15 due to its chain shirt, making it moderately difficult to hit. It has Hit Points totaling 31, derived from 7d8, which provides it with average durability for its Challenge Rating. The creature's movement speed is typical for humanoids at 30 feet. 

In terms of ability scores, the Shadow Fey has a Strength of 10 which signifies an average effectiveness in physical contests, and a Dexterity of 14 (+2 modifier), reflecting good agility and reflexes. Its Constitution also stands at 10, indicating average resilience. The Intelligence score of 11 results in an average capacity for reasoning and problem-solving, while Wisdom and Charisma both sit at 11 and 13, respectively, yielding average awareness and good charm abilities.

The skills of the Shadow Fey include a +2 modifier to Arcana, indicating a good aptitude for understanding magical phenomena, and a +2 modifier to Perception, which allows it to be attentive to its surroundings. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, enhancing its ability to see in dim light and darkness, and has a passive Perception score of 12. It communicates in Common, Elvish, and Umbral languages.

The Shadow Fey has the special ability known as Fey Ancestry, granting it advantage on saving throws against being charmed and rendering it immune to magical sleep effects, which is very good for maintaining its presence in the chaotic encounters typical of combat. However, it suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, meaning that while in direct sunlight, it experiences disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sightâ€”this makes it very vulnerable in bright environments.

When taking actions, the Shadow Fey can employ a Shortsword for melee attacks, boasting a +4 to hit, with a hit resulting in 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. Similarly, it can utilize a Shortbow for ranged attacks, also with a +4 to hit, capable of striking targets up to 320 feet away, dealing the same damage as the shortsword.

Additionally, the Shadow Fey possesses a bonus action called Shadow Traveler, which it can use twice per day. This ability allows it to vanish into shadows, dim light, or darkness and reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet that it can see. When activating this ability, tendrils of inky smoke mark its origin and destination, enhancing its elusive nature in combat.
