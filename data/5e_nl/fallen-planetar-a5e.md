The Fallen Planetar is a large Celestial creature known for its exceptional combat prowess, powerful innate spells, and a strong knack for truth detection. With a high Armor Class of 19 and a formidable hit point pool of 250, it serves as a powerful protector in confrontations. The creature excels in both melee and ranged attacks, utilizing its flaming sword to deliver significant damage while also possessing healing abilities to support allies. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage, which can be a key exploit used against it. The Fallen Planetar's challenge rating of 16 signifies it is an advanced threat for mid to high-level adventurers, capable of turning the tide of battle with its impressive abilities.

The Fallen Planetar has the following attributes: Strength 22 (+6, very good), Dexterity 22 (+6, very good), Constitution 24 (+7, exceptional), Intelligence 22 (+6, very good), Wisdom 24 (+7, exceptional), and Charisma 24 (+7, exceptional). It has saving throw bonuses in Wisdom and Charisma of +12, indicating a very good ability to resist spells and effects targeting these attributes. Its athletic, insight, perception, and religion skills have bonuses ranging from +11 to +12, showing that it is well-rounded in both physical and mental pursuits.

In terms of damage capabilities, the Fallen Planetar is vulnerable to radiant damage while being immune to necrotic and poison damage. It also resists radiant damage from nonmagical sources and is immune to conditions like charmed, exhaustion, frightened, and poisoned. It has truesight up to 60 feet, allowing it to see through illusions and magical darkness, and a passive perception of 22, which makes it exceptionally aware of its surroundings. The creature can communicate across all languages and has telepathy with a range of 120 feet.

The Fallen Planetar has several special abilities. Its Champion of Truth ability allows it to automatically detect lies and prohibits it from lying, showcasing its inherently honest nature. With its innate spellcasting ability based on Charisma, it has a spell save DC of 20 and can cast commune, control weather, and raise dead once per day without the need for material components.

During combat, the Fallen Planetar uses its Multiattack action to strike with its flaming sword twice. The sword has a +11 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 20 slashing damage (from 4d6 + 6) plus an additional 21 ongoing fire or radiant damage (the planetar's choice). A creature can extinguish the flame by using an action either on itself or a nearby ally.

Additionally, the Heavenly Bolt action allows the Fallen Planetar to fire a lightning bolt that extends 100 feet in a line and is 5 feet wide. Any creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 56 lightning damage (from 16d6), suffering half damage on a successful save.

The Fallen Planetar can also use Heal two times a day, allowing it to touch an ally or itself to magically heal for 60 hit points while curing blindness, deafness, disease, or poison. Its Consume Life Energy ability, usable once per day, enables it to feed on the life energy of a humanoid that has died within the last hour, granting it temporary hit points equal to half the maximum hit points of the slain creature, lasting until depleted.

As a bonus action, it can invoke its Awe-Inspiring Gaze ability to target a creature within 90 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. Those who succeed are immune to this effect from that Fallen Planetar for the following 24 hours.

Lastly, the Fallen Planetar has a Protective Parry reaction that allows it to impose disadvantage on a melee attack roll against a creature within 5 feet, effectively protecting allies and itself from incoming strikes.
