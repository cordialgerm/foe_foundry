Its strengths lie in its high Strength (+10) and Dexterity (+7) scores, allowing it to inflict substantial damage and evade attacks effectively. Additionally, the Horned Devil possesses exceptional magical resilience, being immune to fire and poison damage, along with a variety of resistances that make it a tough adversary to take down. However, despite its impressive defenses, it could be vulnerable to weapons imbued with magic, especially those targeting its few weaknesses or exploiting its limitations in specific scenarios.

The Horned Devil has an Armor Class (AC) of 18, which provides good defense against attacks. It boasts 185 hit points, indicating that it can sustain a fair amount of damage before being defeated. Its speed is 20 feet on the ground, but it can fly at a speed of 60 feet, giving it excellent mobility around the battlefield. The devil possesses the following ability scores: Strength at +10 (exceptional), Dexterity at +7 (very good), Constitution at +5 (good), Intelligence at +1 (average), Wisdom at +7 (very good), and Charisma at +7 (very good). These scores highlight its physical prowess, agility, and significant influence in social interactions.

One of its noteworthy special abilities includes Devil’s Sight, which allows the Horned Devil to see through magical darkness, rendering conventional hiding tactics ineffective against it. Additionally, its Devilish Resilience grants it resistance to cold damage and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It is immune to fire and poison damage as well as the poisoned condition, making it a highly resilient opponent in extended encounters. Magic Resistance gives the Horned Devil advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further enhancing its durability.

In terms of actions, the Horned Devil can make a Multiattack, in which it can perform either two Fork attacks and one Tail attack or three Hurl Flame attacks during its turn. The Fork is a melee weapon attack that uses its Strength modifier, hitting with a +10 to attack and dealing an average of 19 piercing damage on a successful strike. Its Tail attack is equally deadly, also using the +10 modifier but dealing an average of 22 piercing damage. Furthermore, if the Tail hits a creature that isn’t a Construct or Undead, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer infernal wounds, leading to additional damage over time, making it quite devastating if it lands such a hit repeatedly.

Hurl Flame allows the Horned Devil to attack at range. This ranged spell attack has a +7 to hit, reaching out to 150 feet and dealing an average of 20 fire damage. If it targets a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried, that object catches fire, adding environmental hazards to the encounter. Moreover, as a bonus action, the Horned Devil can perform a Headbutt, which forces a creature within 5 feet to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw or take 7 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. This adds a tactical advantage, allowing the devil to disrupt enemy formations.

Overall, the Horned Devil combines high physical strength, impressive magical abilities, and a range of attacks, making it a versatile and dangerous opponent in Dungeons & Dragons. Its ability to inflict ongoing damage through wounds and manipulate the battlefield through magical attacks provides unique challenges for any adventuring party facing it.
