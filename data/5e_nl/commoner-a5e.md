The Commoner is a humble and unassuming creature within the Dungeons & Dragons universe, representing the everyday folk who are often swept up in the grand adventures of heroes. As a Medium humanoid with a very low challenge rating of 0, it represents an extremely weak opponent in combat with minimal offensive capabilities and very few hit points. It is primarily notable for its simplicity in rules and mechanics, making it an ideal character for players to use for role-playing or for Dungeon Masters to populate their worlds with flavor. The Commoner lacks any significant strengths and poses a negligible threat in encounters, making them excellent for non-combat scenarios or as background characters.

The Commoner has an Armor Class of 10, which is quite low and means it can be easily hit in combat. It has 4 hit points, derived from rolling a single eight-sided die, making it very fragile. The Commoner's speed allows it to walk up to 30 feet in a turn, which is standard for most humanoids. Attributes for the Commoner include a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, all set at 10 with a modifier of +0. This indicates an average capability in all areas, signifying that the Commoner has no real strengths or weaknesses in physical or mental abilities. 

In terms of skills, any of the Commoner's skills would similarly reflect a +0 modifier, indicating they do not excel in any particular area. They possess passive Perception of 10, which can increase to 14 if they are proficient, but this is still considered average. The Commoner can communicate in any one language, reflecting their ability to interact but providing no tactical advantage in gameplay.

The actions available to the Commoner include a Club melee attack and a Stone ranged attack. The Club allows the Commoner to make a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit against a single target within reach. On a successful hit, the attack deals 2 bludgeoning damage, based on a roll of 1d4. The Stone allows for a ranged attack with the same +2 to hit and has a range of 10 feet for close-range and 30 feet for long-range attacks, similarly dealing 2 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Both attacks are considered weak, with damage output being very low and contributing very little to combat dynamics. The overall combat profile of the Commoner is very poor, making them more suitable for flavor, storytelling, or setting than for direct engagement in battle.
