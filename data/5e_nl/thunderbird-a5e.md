The Thunderbird is a large monstrosity known for its powerful lightning abilities and impressive mobility, able to soar through the skies with speed and grace. Its Armor Class is relatively low at 12, making it vulnerable to attacks, but it possesses a solid pool of hit points, totaling 57, which provides it with a decent buffer in combat. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 3, indicating it can pose a significant threat to low to mid-level adventurers, and is proficient in perception, exemplifying its keen awareness in battle. The Thunderbird has exceptional strength and constitution, with scores of 18 (+4) in both, making it very good at dealing damage and resisting physical attacks. While its intelligence and charisma are notably low, the creature compensates with strong wisdom, which influences its perception and ability to notice threats. 

The Thunderbird has unique special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness: 

- Keen Sight allows the Thunderbird to have advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight, making it very good at spotting hidden foes or detecting incoming dangers.
- Storm Sight means that its vision is unaffected by adverse weather conditions, allowing it to function optimally even in storms that would hinder the visibility of others.

In combat, the Thunderbird can make a Multiattack, striking once with its beak and once with its talons in a single turn. The beak attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 9 piercing damage (2d4 + 4) on a hit. The talons attack also has a +6 to hit and can deal slashing damage depending on the circumstances; it normally deals 7 damage (1d6 + 4), but if the Thunderbird begins its turn 20 feet above the target and grapples it, it can inflict 11 damage (2d6 + 4) instead. While grappling, the Thunderbird cannot attack a different target with its talons until the grapple ends, with an escape DC of 14.

Additionally, the Thunderbird can unleash a powerful Lightning Strike attack, available for use after a recharge of 6 rounds. It exhales a blast of lightning at a target within 60 feet, requiring the target to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target suffers 28 damage (8d6) from the lightning, but successfully dodging it results in the target only taking half damage.

Overall, the Thunderbird serves as an aerial combatant and formidable threat on the battlefield, combining physical attacks with potent elemental damage. Its ability to maneuver quickly and strike from above can turn the tide in encounters, especially against less mobile foes.
