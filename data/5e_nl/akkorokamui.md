Its strengths lie in its impressive statistics, notably a high Strength score of 21 and a Wisdom score of 20, both contributing to its effectiveness in combat. The creature does have weaknesses, including vulnerability to physical attacks when it is unable to regenerate, but overall, it can be a tremendous asset in any encounter due to its unique abilities and magical capabilities.

Among its special abilities are Amphibious, allowing it to breathe underwater and air; Legendary Resistance, enabling it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw three times per day; and Magic Resistance, granting advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. Its weapon attacks are magical for overcoming resistance, and it features the unique Offering of Flesh ability, allowing it to detach parts of its tentacles, which then serve as magical healing food.

During its legendary actions, Akkorokamui can perform various functions: it can make a Wisdom check to discern its surroundings or insights, swim quickly without incurring opportunity attacks, cast spells, or use the Tentacle Sweep to strike multiple enemies. The Tentacle Sweep requires creatures to make a Dexterity saving throw or take significant bludgeoning damage and potentially be knocked prone, showcasing its ability to control the battlefield.
