The Mimic is a clever and deceptive creature known for its ability to take on the appearance of ordinary objects, creating a sense of trepidation among adventurers. As a Medium monstrosity and shapechanger, this creature relies on surprise and ambush tactics to overwhelm foes. Its notable strengths include a decent Armor Class of 12 and 58 hit points, allowing it to endure combat encounters of moderate difficulty. However, its challenge rating of 2 suggests that while it can be formidable in certain situations, it is not meant to be an overwhelming threat to experienced adventurers. The Mimic's unique abilities allow it to adhere to and grapple opponents, making it a challenging foe when engaged in close quarters. Its weaknesses lie primarily in its relatively low Dexterity, which affects its overall evasion capabilities.

The Mimic possesses the following attributes: Strength is +3, which is good for melee attacks; Dexterity is +1, which is average; Constitution is +2, resulting in good durability; Intelligence is -3, indicating a very bad capability for complex reasoning; Wisdom is +1, reflecting an average perceptiveness; and Charisma is -1, signifying a bad ability to influence others. Its senses include a keen sense of 60 feet, with a Perception score of 11, and it has a Stealth bonus of 13, allowing it to remain hidden effectively.

Among its special abilities, the Mimic showcases "Adhesive" when in its object form, allowing it to adhere to anything that comes in contact with it. A creature that becomes adhered is also grappled, with an escape difficulty of DC 13. Any checks made to escape this grapple suffer disadvantage. "False Appearance" means that while the Mimic is motionless and in object form, it becomes indistinguishable from regular objects, making it an excellent ambush predator. The "Grappler" ability provides the Mimic with an advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has grappled. Finally, its "Monstrosity Resilience" allows it to resist exhaustion and the frightened condition, providing durability in combat scenarios.

When engaging in combat, the Mimic can utilize a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two Pseudopod attacks. If it is grappling a creature, it can replace one of these with a "Bite" attack. The "Bite" is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, reaching 5 feet to hit a grappled creature, dealing 7 piercing damage plus an additional 7 acid damage, which can inflict significant harm. The "Pseudopod" attack also has a +5 to hit, dealing 10 bludgeoning damage. While in object form, hitting a target will also subject it to the Adhesive trait.

As a bonus action, the Mimic can use "Change Shape" to transform into a Large or smaller object or revert to its true form. It retains the same statistics in both forms, but any equipment it carries does not change. If it happens to die, it automatically reverts to its true form. 

One of its notable reactions is "Prey Shield," which allows the Mimic to strategically protect itself and utilize the grappled creature as a shield against incoming attacks. If a creature hits the Mimic while it is grappling another creature, it can roll that grappled creature into the line of fire, forcing it to take the damage instead. This adds a layer of tactical depth, making the Mimic not just a clever predator but also a liquid defender capable of manipulating its environment to its advantage.
