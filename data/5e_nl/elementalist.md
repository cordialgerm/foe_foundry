The Elementalist is a Medium humanoid creature, embodying a lawful neutral alignment. As a spellcaster with a focus on elemental magic, it can manipulate forces such as fire, lightning, cold, and poison. With an Armor Class of 15 provided by its studded leather armor, it has a moderately high defense, while its Hit Points total 45, offering decent sturdiness for its Challenge Rating of 2, which grants it 450 experience points when defeated. The Elementalist possesses strong Dexterity and Charisma, at +3 each, making it quite capable in both stealthy endeavors and magical attacks. However, its Strength is notably low at -1, representing a very bad physical prowess, which suggests it should rely on its magical abilities and critical thinking rather than brute force. 

The Elementalist has the following attributes: Strength 8 (-1), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 15 (+2), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 17 (+3). This combination allows the Elementalist to effectively utilize its spells while avoiding physical confrontations. It also has notable skills in arcana (+3) and stealth (+5), both valuable for a creature that relies on magic and the element of surprise. The creature exhibits resistance to one specific damage type based on its elemental focus, as well as passive perception senses rated at 10 and fluency in Common and Draconic languages.

The special abilities of the Elementalist are pivotal to its role in combat. Firstly, the Elemental Focus ability grants the Elementalist resistance to one damage type—fire, lightning, cold, or poison—determined by its subtype. Each element also allows the Elementalist to innately cast certain spells tied to that element: fire enables the use of the *produce flame* cantrip and the spells *heat metal* or *scorching ray* three times per day; lightning provides access to the *shocking grasp* cantrip and the spells *blur* or *gust of wind* three times per day; cold allows for *ray of frost* and *sleet storm* or *water breathing* (three times each per day); while poison gives access to *blade ward* and *meld into stone* or *shatter*, also three times per day. The spellcasting ability is Charisma, with a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 to hit with spell attacks, signifying a good capacity for spellcasting. 

The War Mage ability lets the Elementalist utilize spells instead of a melee weapon attack during opportunity attacks, allowing it to cast a spell with an action casting time. Importantly, if the spell requires a ranged attack roll, the Elementalist does not suffer disadvantage from being adjacent to a hostile creature, making it an exceptional opportunity to deal damage while avoiding direct melee combat.

In terms of actions, the Elementalist employs a Multiattack feature, enabling it to strike with two scimitar attacks during its turn. Each scimitar attack has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage. Additionally, the Fire Breath ability, which recharges after a short or long rest, allows the Elementalist to exhale an elemental wave in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in the area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) damage reflective of the Elementalist's elemental focus upon a failed save, or half damage on a successful save, adding a significant area-of-effect capability to its combat proficiency.
