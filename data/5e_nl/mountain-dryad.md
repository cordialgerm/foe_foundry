The Mountain Dryad is a formidable Huge creature within the Fey category, known for its neutrality and deeply ingrained connection to the earth. With a challenge rating of 11, it holds a considerable amount of power, thanks to its tough armor class of 17 and a substantial hit point pool of 172, which translates into exceptional durability in combat. This creature excels in both melee and ranged attacks, making it a versatile opponent. Although it possesses remarkable strength and is adept in various skills, its weaknesses lie primarily in its mobility and reliance on its environment. Notably, the Mountain Dryad can burrow through earth and stone, making it difficult to pin down in battle, while also utilizing its natural powers to manipulate terrain and charm adversaries.

The Mountain Dryad has the following ability scores: Strength of 29 (+9, which is exceptional), Dexterity of 12 (+1, which is average), Constitution of 20 (+5, which is very good), Intelligence of 14 (+2, which is average), Wisdom of 18 (+4, which is very good), and Charisma of 18 (+4, which is very good). The creature has advantageous saving throws in Constitution (+9, very good) and Charisma (+8, good). It exhibits remarkable skills, including athletics (+13, exceptional), intimidation (+8, good), perception (+8, good), and stealth (+5, average). The Mountain Dryad is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and unconscious, allowing it to remain effective in multi-faceted encounters.

In terms of special abilities, the Mountain Dryad can utilize Earth Glide, allowing it to burrow through nonmagical earth and stone seamlessly, without disturbing the material. With Magic Resistance, it gains advantage on saving throws against magical effects, significantly enhancing its survivability. Each day at sunrise, it can choose one from three aspects: Hardened Face (which provides resistance to a chosen damage type), Vaunted Peaks (granting advantage on Wisdom perception checks), or Rockslider (which allows it to create difficult terrain around it without using extra movement). Additionally, as a Siege Monster, the Mountain Dryad deals double damage to objects and structures, allowing it to be quite destructive in appropriate contexts.

During combat, the Mountain Dryad can make a Multiattack, allowing it to perform two slam attacks, with each slam having a +13 to hit and dealing an average of 27 bludgeoning damage (4d8 + 9). For ranged engagements, it can throw a rock, also with a +13 to hit and dealing a substantial 31 bludgeoning damage (4d10 + 9). Its signature action, Mountainâ€™s Awe, available once per day, emits a magical aura that impacts creatures within 30 feet. Those who fail a DC 16 Charisma saving throw become charmed for 1 minute, incapacitating them while drawing them near the dryad, leading to unique tactical interactions during battles and potentially chaotic encounters if not managed correctly. If within 5 feet of the Mountain Dryad, a Medium or smaller charmed creature must climb onto it and, after 20 feet, the dryad causes them to fall, resulting in further falling damage.

Overall, the Mountain Dryad is a versatile and imposing creature capable of manipulating its surroundings and charming foes, making it a strategic asset in any encounter where it appears.
