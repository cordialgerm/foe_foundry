The Starving Specter is a Medium Undead creature with a chaotic evil alignment that presents a formidable challenge in combat and encounters. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, especially due to its ability to inflict psychic damage and frighten its enemies. The specter's primary strengths include its decent armor class of 13, an impressive pool of 90 hit points, and an array of abilities that manipulate the battlefield and prey on the fears of its foes. However, it is vulnerable to psychic damage, making it susceptible to certain spells and attacks. Its ethereal nature allows it to move through objects, presenting unique challenges to those who confront it.

The Starving Specter has the following ability scores: Strength 10 (modifier +0, which is average), Dexterity 16 (modifier +3, considered good), Constitution 17 (modifier +3, good), Intelligence 11 (modifier +0, average), Wisdom 14 (modifier +2, average), and Charisma 13 (modifier +1, average). The specter possesses good Constitution saving throws (+6) and Wisdom saving throws (+5), making it resilient against effects that target these attributes. Its perception skill of +2 is above average, providing some capability to notice hidden or obscured creatures. 

This creature has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and thematic presence. The **Aura of the Forgotten** causes beasts and humanoids within a 10-foot radius of the specter to have disadvantage on their saving throws, making it easier for the specter to impose debilitating effects on its enemies. **Ethereal Sight** allows the specter to see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane, giving it insight into creatures that might be invisible or ethereal. Its **Life Hunger** ability grants the specter a powerful attack bonus; when a visible creature recovers hit points, the next Bite attack the specter makes will deal an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage on a hit, enhancing its damage output. The **Incorporeal Movement** ability enables the specter to move freely through other creatures and objects, treating them as difficult terrain; however, it suffers 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. Additionally, the **Undead Nature** trait means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without the limitations of living creatures. The **Unnerving Visage** is a particularly strong ability; creatures that start their turn within 30 feet of the specter and can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 14) or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage and become frightened until the start of their next turn. Creatures can avert their eyes to avoid this effect, but doing so makes them unable to see the specter until the start of their next turn.

In combat, the Starving Specter can perform a **Multiattack**, allowing it to make one Bite attack and one Bladed Arm attack in a single turn. The **Bite** attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 8 (2d4+3) piercing damage in addition to 3 (1d6) necrotic damage, showcasing the specterâ€™s ability to inflict both physical and necrotic damage. The **Bladed Arm** attack is also a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet, dealing 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage. This attack can target creatures on either the Ethereal Plane or the Material Plane, giving the specter flexibility in its targeting options.

This combination of abilities and attacks makes the Starving Specter a menacing adversary capable of psychological manipulation, physical attacks, and evasive maneuvers, making it a memorable encounter for adventurers.
