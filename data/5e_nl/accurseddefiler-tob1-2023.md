The Accursed Defiler is a medium undead creature embodying the malevolence of the wasteland. This neutral evil entity is known for its ability to blend into desert environments and re-form after death unless specific conditions are met. With a decent armor class of 12 and robust hit points of 75, it can endure quite a lot of punishment before going down. Its strengths lie in its formidable physical attributes, particularly a high Strength score of 19, which grants it a good ability to deal damage. It is resilient to several types of damage, including necrotic and nonmagical slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing, while being immune to conditions like exhaustion and poisoning. However, it is not without weaknesses; most notably, its Intelligence score of 6 indicates that it has a very bad ability to handle more complex tasks or strategies.

In terms of attributes, the Accursed Defiler has a Strength of 19, which corresponds to a modifier of +4, making its physical attacks quite strong. Its Dexterity of 14 provides a +2 modifier, giving it a good chance to evade some attacks. With a Constitution of 17 (+3), it has a solid resilience to damage. However, its Intelligence is very low at 6 (-2), which results in very poor cognitive abilities. Its Wisdom of 15 (+2) allows for decent perception and awareness, while a Charisma value of 14 (+2) gives it a good presence in interactions that require it.

The Accursed Defiler has several notable abilities. Its "Cursed Existence" special ability means that if it drops to zero hit points in desert terrain, it disintegrates into sand and re-forms at sundown unless certain conditions are met, making it quite difficult to eliminate permanently. This ability allows it to come back with relative ease if not dispatched in a specific manner. The "Sand Shroud" ability creates a constantly swirling miniature sandstorm around the creature, obscuring visibility and making it hard for others to track it. This ability imposes disadvantage on Survival checks made to follow tracks left within the sandstorm, which can greatly confuse pursuers. Additionally, the "Undead Nature" ability allows the Accursed Defiler to forego basic needs such as air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without rest.

For actions, the Accursed Defiler can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Slam attacks in one turn. Each Slam attack receives a +6 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a hit, which is considered good damage output. If it scores a critical hit, the target suffers an additional level of exhaustion, which can significantly impact a character's performance in subsequent rounds. The "Sandslash" action, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the defiler to intensify the surrounding sand vortex, forcing each creature within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 21 (6d6) slashing damage, or half damage on a success. This action is especially powerful due to the potential for area damage, making it a very effective offensive option in combat.
