The Sphinx is a powerful Large Monstrosity that serves as a guardian of knowledge and wisdom in many fantasy realms. With high armor class and hit points, this creature can withstand significant damage, boasting an exceptional combat capability alongside formidable spellcasting ability. It has very good attributes in Strength, Wisdom, and Intelligence, making it a versatile foe that excels both in melee combat and magical prowess. However, its challenges lie in the fact that it is not particularly quick and relies on its abilities and spells to control the battlefield. Overall, the Sphinx is a formidable opponent designed to test adventurers' strength and intellect.

The Sphinx has an Armor Class of 20, which is very good and makes it difficult for most attacks to hit. It has 142 hit points, equivalent to 15d10+60, indicating it can absorb a considerable amount of damage before being defeated. Its speed is 40 feet on the ground and 60 feet while flying, allowing for good maneuverability in combat situations. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 11, offering 7,200 experience points to those who manage to defeat it.

In terms of attributes, the Sphinx has the following scores: Strength 22 (+6; exceptional), Dexterity 14 (+2; average), Constitution 18 (+4; good), Intelligence 18 (+4; good), Wisdom 22 (+6; exceptional), and Charisma 20 (+5; very good). Its saving throw bonuses are as follows: Dexterity +6, Constitution +8, Intelligence +8, and Wisdom +10, which are all very good, making the Sphinx resilient against several forms of magic and effects. The creature is skilled in arcana, history, perception, and religion, all with a bonus of +8 or +10, reflecting its vast knowledge.

The Sphinx possesses immunity to psychic damage and damage from nonmagical weapons, making it a resilient combatant. It is also immune to being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned, effectively preventing control and influence effects that could hinder its actions in combat. The Sphinx has truesight up to 120 feet, allowing it to see through illusions and concealment, and it has a passive Perception score of 20. It can communicate in Celestial and Common languages as well as via telepathy up to 120 feet.

The Sphinx has a special ability called "Inscrutable," rendering it immune to any divination attempts and making insight checks to determine its intentions difficult, as attackers roll at disadvantage. This defines the creature as a mysterious being, hard to read and predict. Its "Innate Spellcasting" ability allows it to cast spells using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 18. The Sphinx can cast several spells requiring no material components: at will, it can cast detect evil and good, detect magic, minor illusion, spare the dying; three times a day, it can cast dispel magic, identify, lesser restoration, remove curse, scrying, tongues, zone of truth; and once per day, it can cast contact other plane, flame strike, freedom of movement, greater restoration, legend lore, and heroes feast.

For its actions, the Sphinx can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two claw attacks on its turn. Each claw attack rolls with a +10 to hit and inflicts 17 slashing damage on a hit, dealing 2d10 + 6 damage overall. 

Among its spell actions, "Dispel Magic" allows the Sphinx to remove magic from a creature or object within 120 feet. For spells cast at 3rd level or lower, the effect simply ends. For higher-level spells, the Sphinx makes a Wisdom ability check against the spell's level to determine if it can dispel it. The "Flame Strike" spell creates a column of divine fire in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder, requiring creatures in the area to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 fire damage and 14 radiant damage on a failure, or half that on a success.

As a bonus action, the Sphinx can use "Speed Time" once per day to double its speed and flying speed, make opportunity attacks against it come at disadvantage, and allow it to attack three times with its claw during a multiattack for one minute. Additionally, it can use "Planar Jaunt" once per day to transport up to eight willing creatures to a different location, plane, demiplane, or even back in time, providing strategic options for itself and its allies while allowing communication via telepathy throughout the duration.
