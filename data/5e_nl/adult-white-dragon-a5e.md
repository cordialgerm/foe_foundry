The Adult White Dragon is a formidable creature, being a huge dragon with both significant physical prowess and magical capabilities. It is known for its icy breath and adeptness in cold environments, allowing it to dominate during encounters in snowy or icy conditions. With impressive hit points totaling 250 and a high Armor Class of 18, this dragon can endure considerable damage while also inflicting it back with powerful melee attacks and cold-based abilities. Its strengths lie in its ability to freeze opponents, both in an offensive and defensive manner, and its skill in controlling the battlefield with various spells and legendary actions. However, it has a relatively low Intelligence score (8) and could be seen as easy to outsmart in social interactions. 

The Adult White Dragon has the following attributes: Strength 22 with a modifier of +6 (very good), Dexterity 12 with a +1 modifier (average), Constitution 22 with a +6 modifier (very good), Intelligence 8 with a -1 modifier (very bad), Wisdom 14 with a +2 modifier (good), and Charisma 14 with a +2 modifier (good). For saving throws, it has exceptional bonuses to Constitution (+11), Wisdom (+7), and Charisma (+7), while Dexterity (+6) is also strong. It possesses skills in intimidation (+7), perception (+7), and stealth (+6), making it an effective ambush predator. The dragon is immune to cold damage and has superior senses such as blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet. It can communicate in Common and Draconic.

Among its special abilities, the Cold Mastery allows the dragon to move and see without hindrance in extreme cold conditions, and it can burrow through snow and ice without leaving traces. Legendary Resistance, usable three times per day, allows the dragon to treat a failed saving throw as a success, although it will lose some scales in the process, causing its Armor Class to drop after its uses are expended. As an innate spellcaster, the dragon can cast spells like dominate beast, fire shield, animal friendship, and sleet storm thrice per day without needing material components. 

In terms of actions, it can perform a Multiattack, which consists of a bite attack (with +11 to hit, dealing 22 piercing damage plus 4 cold damage), and two claw attacks (dealing 19 slashing damage each). It can also use its tail to attack, hitting with a +14 penalty, which deals 15 bludgeoning damage and pushes the target away. The dragon can spit ice, forcing a target to succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 16 cold damage and being immobilized until the end of its next turn. The Cold Breath attack, which can be used after a recharge of 5-6, exhales frost in a 60-foot cone, potentially dealing 52 cold damage to all caught creatures unless they succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw.

The dragon also has reactions, such as the Tail Attack, permitting it to strike back at a creature that hits it with melee attacks within 10 feet. 

For legendary actions, it can take three actions between other creatures' turns, regaining spent actions at the start of its turn. It can emit a terrifying Roar that forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, causing fright for a minute on a failure. The Wing Attack allows it to push creatures away and gain aerial advantage, while Raging Storm, usable once per day, creates hazardous sleet around it that obscures vision and creates difficult terrain for a minute, potentially causing creatures to fall prone.

Overall, the Adult White Dragon is a powerful ice-based adversary capable of controlling fights and dealing significant cold damage, making it a dangerous and strategic foe.
