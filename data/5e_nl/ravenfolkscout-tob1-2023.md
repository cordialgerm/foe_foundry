The Ravenfolk Scout is a medium humanoid creature that serves a versatile role on the battlefield, often acting as a skirmisher or stealthy observer. This creature is neutral in alignment, which allows it to operate without a strict moral code. With a decent Armor Class of 14, thanks to its studded leather armor, and 27 hit points, the Ravenfolk Scout is reasonably resilient for its challenge rating of 1/2, indicating it is appropriate for low-level encounters. The creature excels in Dexterity-based tasks, indicated by its Dexterity score of 14, which provides a good modifier of +2, making it effective in ranged and stealth combat. However, its lack of significant offensive power or high durability makes it vulnerable when caught in direct confrontations. Notably, its special ability to mimic sounds can provide tactical advantages in various scenarios.

The attributes of the Ravenfolk Scout are as follows: 
- Strength: 10 (+0), which is average and indicates it is neither strong nor weak in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2), which is good and enhances its nimbleness and ability to avoid attacks.
- Constitution: 10 (+0), translating to an average health durability.
- Intelligence: 10 (+0), showing it possesses basic cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 15 (+2), which is good and enhances its perceptive abilities and resistance to certain mental effects.
- Charisma: 12 (+1), representing an average social capability but good enough for minor interactions.

For saving throws, the Ravenfolk Scout gets a +4 bonus to Wisdom saving throws, which is very good. In terms of skills, it is proficient in Deception (+3), Perception (+6), and Stealth (+6), making it exceptionally skilled at stealthy maneuvers and aware of its surroundings, useful for ambushing or avoiding encounters.

The Ravenfolk Scout possesses darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 120 feet, and it has a passive Perception score of 16, which is very good for noticing hidden dangers. It can communicate in Common, Feather Speech, and Ravenfolk languages, enabling it to interact and understand various creatures.

The Ravenfolk Scout has a notable special ability called Mimicry, which enables it to mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. Creatures that hear these sounds can discern them as imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against a DC of 13. This ability can lead to distractions or misleading encounters.

The Rangerfolk Scout can perform several actions in combat:
- Peck: This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit and reaches up to 5 feet, dealing an average of 7 piercing damage on a successful hit.
- Rapier: This melee attack also carries a +4 bonus to hit and deals an average of 6 piercing damage.
- Longbow: As a ranged weapon attack, it reaches up to 150 feet normally and 600 feet at disadvantage, similarly dealing an average of 6 piercing damage, making it a competent ranged attacker.
- Ghost Wings: This unique action allows the Ravenfolk Scout to create an illusionary set of wings, forcing all creatures within 5 feet to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw will be blinded until the start of its next turn, adding a potential control element to its capabilities in combat.
