The Kobold War Machine is a large, unaligned construct designed for battlefield dominance. With a formidable challenge rating of 9, it has a robust armor class and a substantial pool of hit points, making it a tough adversary. This war machine excels in dealing damage and can be highly effective when operated by skilled kobolds. While it has a few limitations, such as its low intelligence and lack of language, its special abilities significantly enhance its capabilities. Notably, it is immune to a variety of conditions and can withstand all nonmagical attacks better than most foes. However, it relies heavily on operators to maximize its potential, impacting its overall effectiveness.

The Kobold War Machine has the following attributes, which indicate its strengths and weaknesses: Strength is 21 (+5, exceptional), Dexterity is 14 (+2, good), Constitution is 19 (+4, very good), Intelligence is 2 (-4, very bad), Wisdom is 7 (-2, bad), and Charisma is 1 (-5, very bad). Its saving throws are strong with Dexterity at +6 (good) and Constitution at +8 (very good). It has a good athletics skill with a +9 modifier. The war machine is immune to poison and psychic damage, showing remarkable resilience. It also enjoys resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and is immune to a wide array of conditions, making it particularly difficult to disable.

The Kobold War Machine boasts several special abilities. It has an *Immutable Form*, making it immune to spells or effects that would change its form. The *Operators* ability allows the war machine to either act or move each turn, but not both, and it can carry up to three Small operators. If even one operator is present, the machine can function normally. However, if it takes a critical hit, the attack can target an operator insteadâ€”which means operators are generally safe from direct attacks while they operate the machine. 

The *Ram Them!* ability provides a tactical advantage; if the war machine moves at least 15 feet towards a target before making a spiked wheel attack, it deals extra damage and can knock the target prone if they fail a DC 16 Strength saving throw. Being a *Siege Monster*, it is capable of dealing double damage to objects and structures, making it especially useful in taking down fortifications. When operated by three or more kobolds, the *That Way!* ability allows the war machine to utilize the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action each turn, significantly increasing its mobility.

For its actions, the Kobold War Machine can engage in melee or ranged combat. Its *Multiattack* feature allows it to use either two spiked wheel attacks or three spit fire attacks during its turn. The *Spiked Wheel* attack applies a +9 to hit modifier, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage on a successful hit. Alternatively, its *Spit Fire* attack has a +6 to hit, with a range of 120 feet, dealing 14 (4d6) fire damage. Additionally, it can use *Fire Breath* (which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6), exhaling a cone of fire with a radius of 30 feet. Creatures in this area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 35 (10d6) fire damage, with half damage on a successful save. 

Combining its physical prowess with its unique abilities and special actions, the Kobold War Machine is a formidable presence on the battlefield, especially when well-operated by kobold allies.
