The Wererat is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the sneaky and cunning nature of a lycanthrope. It serves as both a formidable opponent and a stealthy infiltrator, making it a versatile threat in combat scenarios. With an Armor Class of 12 and 33 hit points, it is relatively resilient but can be easily taken down by characters that excel in dealing damage quickly. Its primary strengths lie in its Dexterity score of 14, granting it a good initiative and proficiency in stealth, allowing it to approach situations unnoticed. Furthermore, its Pack Tactics ability allows it to work effectively with allies, gaining advantage on attack rolls when near them. However, it is vulnerable to wolfsbane, which can incapacitate it and amplify damage done to it by non-silvered weapons. 

The Wererat has the following ability scores: Strength 10 (average), Dexterity 14 (good), Constitution 12 (average), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 10 (average), and Charisma 10 (average). It has advantage on perception checks relying on smell due to its Keen Smell ability, which improves its ability to detect threats or food. It is also skilled in stealth, with a +4 modifier, making it proficient in remaining hidden. Its damage resistances allow it to ignore damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, further enhancing its survivability in combat. Senses include darkvision up to 60 feet but only in rat or hybrid form, and it has a passive perception of 12. The creature can communicate in Common.

The Wererat has several significant special abilities. The Pack Tactics ability grants it advantage on attack rolls against opponents if one of its allies is close to the target, which can quickly stack damage in battle. The Wolfsbane ability creates a strong vulnerability for the Wererat; it becomes poisoned when within 10 feet of wolfsbane and can be harmed as if it were silvered if the flower is applied to weapons. This introduces a tactical element for opponents who know of its weaknesses.

In terms of actions, the Wererat can utilize its Shortsword or Hand Crossbow in humanoid or hybrid form, both with a +4 to hit. The Shortsword deals 5 piercing damage normally or 12 piercing damage when taking advantage from Pack Tactics. The Hand Crossbow has a range of 30/120 feet, also with the same damage output and advantage condition. In its rat or hybrid form, it can use its Bite attack, which also has a +4 to hit and deals 4 piercing damage. Notably, if it bites a humanoid, the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or they become cursed with wererat lycanthropy, spreading the curse to others.

For bonus actions, the Wererat has the Shapeshift ability, allowing it to transform between a giant rat, rat-humanoid hybrid, or its true humanoid form. While it canâ€™t speak in rat form, its statistics remain unchanged, providing tactical versatility depending on the situation. If bloodied in combat, the Wererat can make a Frenzied Bite attack, escalating its threat level as it becomes desperate in battle. Overall, the Wererat is an agile and tricky opponent with a mix of physical attacks and strategic capabilities, making it a challenging foe to confront or outsmart.
