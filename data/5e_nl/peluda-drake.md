The Peluda Drake is a large, chaotic neutral dragon creature known for its piercing attacks and unique defensive abilities. With an Armor Class of 15, it possesses good natural armor that helps protect it in combat. The creature has a substantial pool of hit points, totaling 68, making it resilient in battle. Notably, it has a Challenge Rating of 3, indicating it is a challenging foe for moderately experienced adventurers, providing 700 XP upon defeat. While the Peluda has high strength, constitution, and a dynamic tactical reach with its burrowing and walking speeds, its intelligence and charisma are below average, which may limit its ability to interact with other characters effectively.

The Peluda Drake's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength of 17, yielding a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee damage; Dexterity stands at 14 with a +2 modifier, providing average agility; Constitution is 16, also contributing a +3 modifier, showcasing very good stamina; Intelligence is low at 6 with a -2 modifier, resulting in very bad cognitive skills; Wisdom is decent at 14, giving a +2 modifier, representing an average awareness; and Charisma sits at 10, with no modifier, meaning its social interactions are very average. 

The creature's saving throws are particularly strong in Dexterity with a +4 bonus and Constitution with a +5 bonus, both of which are considered good. It also possesses skills that enhance its capabilities, notably Perception and Stealth, both with a +4 modifier, ranking as good in their effectiveness. 

The Peluda Drake is equipped with several special abilities. The Quill Regrowth ability allows it to use its large, spiny quills for attacks and defense; it has a total of 24 quills, which regenerate at the end of a long rest. Its Spiky Hide creates a defensive mechanism where any creature touching the drake or hitting it in melee range must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or suffer from 4 piercing damage along with 3 poison damage. This ability poses a strategic risk to melee fighters.

The actions available to the Peluda Drake include a Bite attack, which has a +5 to hit and deals a base damage of 8 piercing damage; a Tail attack that also has a +5 to hit and inflicts 7 piercing damage plus an additional 3 poison damage; and a Quill attack that is a ranged option with the same +5 to hit that inflicts 7 piercing damage and again includes 3 poison damage. Each of these attacks showcases the drakeâ€™s offensive prowess in both melee and ranged scenarios.

Moreover, the Peluda possesses powerful breath weapons, which recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. The first option is Steam Breath, which has a 15-foot cone effect, causing a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Creatures failing the save take 22 fire damage, while those succeeding take half damage. The second option is Acid Breath, a 15-foot line attack that requires a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; it deals the same damage as the Steam Breath under the same conditions. Each breath weapon can significantly impact the battlefield, making the Peluda Drake a formidable opponent in both close and ranged encounters.
