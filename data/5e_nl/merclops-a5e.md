The Merclops is a formidable Huge Giant, known for its immense strength and resilience in combat. With a significant hit point pool of 126, it can withstand substantial damage, making it a tough opponent. Its primary strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks, access to advantageous abilities when frightened, and its ability to operate underwater, which can catch opponents off guard. However, it has a substantial weakness in ranged combat due to poor depth perception, resulting in disadvantage on all ranged attacks. This creature operates effectively in close quarters and is a force to be reckoned with, particularly in aquatic environments.

The Merclops has the following attributes: Strength is exceptionally high at 20, granting it a +5 modifier, which makes its physical attacks very effective. Constitution is also very high at 20, providing it with a +5 modifier that contributes to its impressive durability. Dexterity is average at 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, which indicates neither a strength nor a weakness in speed or agility. Intelligence is low at 8, creating a -1 modifier, making it somewhat dim-witted. Wisdom is average at 10 (+0), indicating it has no particular insight or perception errors, while Charisma is also average at 10 (+0), suggesting it has no special social capabilities or presence.

In terms of skills, the Merclops has proficiency in survival with a +3 modifier but is not particularly adept in animal handling with a +0 modifier. It has passive perception set at 10, which is average, and it speaks Giant, allowing communication with other creatures that understand this language.

The Merclops has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. "Panicked Rage" allows it to make attack rolls with advantage when it is frightened and can see the source of its fear. This mechanic can lead to unexpected increases in its offensive capabilities in tense situations. However, due to its "Poor Depth Perception," it makes all ranged attacks with disadvantage, significantly reducing its effectiveness when engaging from a distance. Despite this, the Merclops is "Aquatic," enabling it to breathe underwater, giving it unique advantages in aquatic encounters.

In combat actions, the Merclops can utilize "Multiattack," allowing it to strike twice with its melee attacks in a single turn. Its primary melee attack is the "Club," which has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, delivering a strong blow that inflicts 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. It can also use the "Harpoon," which can be executed either as a melee or ranged attack, also with a +8 to hit. The harpoon inflicts a substantial 27 (4d10 + 5) piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. If the target fails, the Merclops can pull it up to 30 feet closer.

As a bonus action, the Merclops can use "Thick Skulled" once per day to end one condition imposed on it from a failed Wisdom saving throw, providing valuable tactical flexibility in combat.

As a reaction, the Merclops employs "Big Windup," which allows it to prepare a powerful counterattack when struck by a melee attack. It gains advantage on its next club attack against the attacker before the end of its next turn, increasing the likelihood of landing an impactful hit against foes that dare engage it in melee.
