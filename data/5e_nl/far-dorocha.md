The Far Dorocha is a cunning and malevolent creature from the Fey realm, particularly adept at manipulating shadows and influencing others with its dark powers. This medium-sized fey is classified as lawful evil and possesses a blend of stealth, spellcasting, and charm abilities that make it formidable in both combat and social situations. Its strong Dexterity and Charisma let it excel in stealth and deception, while its ability to resist damage from nonmagical attacks and immunity to certain conditions make it difficult to subdue. The Far Dorocha is especially potent in dim lighting or darkness, where it can enhance its defenses and abilities.

The Far Dorocha has an Armor Class of 14, which increases to 18 when in dim light or darkness, indicating good defensive capabilities. It has 82 hit points, providing it with average durability for a creature of its challenge rating, which is 5, making it worth 1,800 experience points. In terms of attributes, the creature has a Strength score of 10, which is average; a Dexterity of 18, reflecting exceptional agility; a Constitution of 13, which is average; an Intelligence of 14, indicating good knowledge; Wisdom of 10, marking average perception; and a Charisma of 18, demonstrating exceptional charm and influence.

The Far Dorocha's skill set enhances its effectiveness in social and stealth scenarios. It has a Deception skill of +7, a Perception skill of +3, and a Stealth skill of +7, all of which are very good. It is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks and is immune to being charmed or frightened. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 13, thus allowing it to detect threats effectively. The creature understands Common, Elvish, Sylvan, and Umbral languages, facilitating communication in various contexts.

The Far Dorocha possesses several notable special abilities. Its "Shadow Traveler" ability allows it to disappear into darkness as a bonus action, reappearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet, effectively granting it excellent mobility and escape potential. The "Traveler in Darkness" trait provides it advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks relating to shadow magic, making it particularly knowledgeable about relevant spells or items. Under the "Under the Cloak of Night" ability, it gains significant defense in dim light or darkness, including having its Charisma modifier added to its Armor Class and granting advantage on saving throws.

The innate spellcasting of the Far Dorocha, with its spell save DC of 15, includes cantrips like "disguise self" and "thaumaturgy," allowing it to alter its appearance or create minor magical effects. It can cast "command," allowing it to issue a one-word order that must be obeyed, and "phantom steed" to summon a spectral horse for mobility. Once per day, it can use "compulsion," which forces creatures to move in a direction of its choice, and "darkness," creating an area of magical darkness that can provide tactical advantages in combat.

In combat, the Far Dorocha can utilize its "Multiattack" action to make two attacks with its "Dirk," which can be used in melee with reach or ranged form. Each successful attack deals 7 piercing damage plus 14 poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned for one minute. The "Dark Invitation" ability allows it to charm a humanoid within 30 feet, compelling them to follow the Far Dorocha under the belief they are invited to meet its master. This charm can be resisted, but if it takes harm from the Far Dorocha or its allies, the target may attempt to break free. This ability highlights the Far Dorocha's manipulation and control over others, making it a strategic threat both in and out of combat.
