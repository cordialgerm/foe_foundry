The Sentinel in Darkness is a large, unaligned construct characteristic of its imposing size and formidable combat abilities. It is highly resilient with a significant pool of hit points, making it a robust adversary or guardian in any scenario. Notably, it has exceptional Strength and Wisdom, allowing it to excel in combat and perception, while its Intelligence and Charisma are remarkably low. The Sentinel possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness, specifically targeting opponents with darkvision, blindsight, or truesight. Additionally, it cleverly manipulates its environment to increase the challenge of navigating certain hidden pathways or illusions. This creature’s resilience to nonmagical damage and various conditions makes it a tough encounter, though its mobility is hindered by a low Dexterity score.

The Sentinel has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average for its challenge rating, and it has 127 hit points, representing strong durability in combat. It can walk at a speed of 30 feet. The construct’s Strength score of 20 provides it with a +5 modifier, which is evaluated as very good for its melee attacks, while its Dexterity score of 9 gives it a -1 modifier, categorized as bad, making it less effective at dodging. Its Constitution score of 16 grants a +3 modifier, which is good for maintaining its longevity in battle. Wisdom, vital for perception and saving throws, is high at 18, yielding a +4 modifier, which is very good, while its Intelligence of 6 incurs a -2 modifier (very bad) and its Charisma is extremely low at 1, presenting a -5 modifier, classified as very bad.

The Sentinel's skill in perception is enhanced, granting it a +7 bonus, making it exceptional at noticing hidden threats. It is immune to poison damage, resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and completely immune to several debilitating conditions, including being charmed and frightened, which allows it to remain a consistent threat in combat.

One of its special abilities, Scourge of the Seekers, provides the Sentinel advantage on attack rolls against creatures possessing darkvision, blindsight, or truesight, making it particularly lethal against those with enhanced vision. The Vault Keeper ability increases the difficulty for others to detect secret doors and illusory walls within a considerable range, showcasing the Sentinel's role as a guardian of knowledge or hidden paths.

In terms of its actions, the Sentinel can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two stone fist attacks. Each stone fist attack uses a +8 to hit (good) and has a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 18 bludgeoning damage (2d12 + 5) upon a hit. If both attacks successfully strike a Large or smaller creature, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become subjected to a unique mechanic where a non-weapon, non-armor item is teleported away, creating a strategic disruption in confrontation.

The Stone Fist attack is its primary melee option, characterized by the robust damage output against its foes. Additionally, the Sentinel can use its Curse of the Wanderer ability, which requires a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw from a target within 30 feet. If the target fails, they suffer a curse that halves their speed and prevents healing. Moreover, they incur psychic damage for not accessing new information over time, making this ability a potent strategy to debilitate an opponent’s effectiveness during encounters.

Overall, the Sentinel in Darkness offers formidable offensive and defensive capabilities, making it a challenging opponent for heroes that stumble upon it in a darkened domain.
