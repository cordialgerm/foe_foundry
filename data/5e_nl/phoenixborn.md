- Constitution: 13 (+1) - this is an average value, contributing to its moderate endurance.

The skills of the Phoenixborn include a perception score of +0, which is average, indicating it doesn't excel in noticing hidden threats or details. However, it has damage resistance to fire, making it less vulnerable to fiery spellcasters. Its passive perception score of 12 suggests it can sense its environment adequately. The Phoenixborn understands Common and Ignan, giving it the ability to communicate with a wide range of creatures.

As for its special abilities, the Phoenixborn has "Fiery Feathers," which allows it to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius with an additional 10 feet of dim light. This might be useful for illuminating dark areas during exploration. Its ability "Rebirth," occurring once per day, activates if it is reduced to 0 hit points. When this happens, it erupts in flames, dealing 3 (1d6) fire damage to each creature within a 10-foot radius, while the Phoenixborn regains health equal to the total amount of damage dealt. This can create a strategic advantage, punishing foes for defeating it while granting the Phoenixborn a chance to continue fighting.

Regarding its actions, the Phoenixborn can use its "Talon" melee attack, which involves rolling a d20 and adding +5 to the hit roll for a total of 6 (1d6+3) slashing damage if successful. It also possesses the "Hurl Flame" ranged spell attack, which functions similarly to the Talon attack but requires a d20 roll and adds +4 to hit, inflicting 5 (1d6+2) fire damage upon a successful hit. This diverse attack capability provides the Phoenixborn with options in combat, allowing it to engage enemies from a distance or in close quarters, adjusting its strategy based on the circumstances.
