The Bereginyas is a tiny, neutral evil fey creature that excels in stealth and evasive tactics, making it a formidable opponent despite its small size. With an Armor Class of 14 and 81 hit points, it has a decent level of durability for its Challenge Rating of 4, which offers a balanced threat level for adventurers. Possessing high Dexterity grants it exceptional stealth capabilities, and its speed allows it to quickly maneuver in and out of combat. However, its reliance on poison may be a double-edged sword, as creatures that can resist or circumvent its effects will diminish its effectiveness. Notably, the Bereginyas can attach to its prey, effectively smothering them, which can be devastating in the right circumstances.

The Bereginyas has the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2), Dexterity is 19 (+4), Constitution is 14 (+2), Intelligence is 13 (+1), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 11 (+0). Its Dexterity score means its saving throw modifier is good at +6, allowing it to avoid many attacks and effects. It has additional skills such as Perception at +5 and Stealth at +8, making its ability to remain undetected exceptional. It is immune to bludgeoning damage, which offers it good defensive capabilities against physical attacks. With a darkvision range of 60 feet and a passive Perception of 15, it can navigate well in low-light conditions and detect hidden creatures effectively. The Bereginyas can communicate in Common, Elvish, and Sylvan.

One of its special abilities, Foul Form, inflicts a toxic atmosphere around the Bereginyas. Any creature that begins its turn within five feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the creature becoming poisoned, which can severely debilitate opponents. However, if a creature succeeds on this saving throw by five or more, it gains immunity to the poison effect from the Bereginyas for the next 24 hours.

In combat, the Bereginyas can employ the Multiattack action, enabling it to perform two Claw attacks. Each attack has a +6 to hit and can deal 8 slashing damage plus an additional 4 poison damage if successful. If both Claw attacks strike the same target, the Bereginyas latches onto them, allowing it to maintain a hold during battle without expending movement.

When attached, the Bereginyas can initiate the Smother action against any non-Construct or non-Undead creature. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to resist the voracious attack of poisonous gas. On a failed save, the creature suffers 22 poison damage and begins suffocating, while a successful save results in half the damage with no other adverse effects. A creature suffers continual repercussions if it fails the saving throw while suffocating, reducing its remaining rounds of breath each round until the danger is resolved. The Smother action can turn the tide of battle, incapacitating foes through a combination of damage and the threat of suffocation, making the Bereginyas a particularly dangerous adversary when cornering weaker parties.
