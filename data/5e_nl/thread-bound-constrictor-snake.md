The Thread-Bound Constrictor Snake is a Huge Construct creature known for its formidable physical strength and unique abilities that make it a challenging opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 12 and a total of 60 hit points, this creature can endure a fair amount of damage before being defeated. It serves as a powerful guardian or combatant, boasting a good strength score of 19, which contributes to its ability to deal substantial bludgeoning damage with its constrict attack. However, it has very poor intelligence and charisma scores, indicating that it is not capable of complex thought or social interactions. The snake is immune to poison and has resistances to common physical attack types, making it difficult to inflict damage onto it using nonmagical means. Its weaknesses are highlighted by its susceptibility to antimagic fields which can incapacitate it, showcasing a notable reliance on magical enhancements.

The Thread-Bound Constrictor Snake has the following attributes: Strength 19 (+4), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 1 (-5, very bad), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 3 (-4, very bad). Its high Strength gives it a very good modifier for melee attacks, while its Dexterity is average, providing some agility. The Constitution score grants it a standard resilience, but its low Intelligence and Charisma limit its strategic capabilities.

This creature possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The Antimagic Susceptibility ability means that the snake becomes incapacitated if it enters an antimagic field, and if targeted by dispel magic, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC to avoid being forced back to its bound textile for one minute. This highlights its vulnerability to magic users. The Immutable Form ability grants it immunity against any spell or effect that could alter its physical form, further reinforcing its stability in battle. The Magic Weapons trait means that its attacks are considered magical, allowing it to bypass resistances of nonmagical creatures. Lastly, the Shifting Form ability allows it to move through very narrow spaces without restriction, enabling unique positioning in combat.

For its actions, the Thread-Bound Constrictor Snake can perform a Constrict attack, which involves a melee weapon attack modification of +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 13 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 2d8 plus its Strength modifier. Furthermore, the target of this attack is grappled, and they must succeed on an escape DC of 16 to break free. While grappled, the creature is restrained, preventing escape and making them vulnerable to further attacks from the snake, which is unable to constrict another target until the initial grapple ends. This ability makes the snake a formidable opponent in close quarters, effectively immobilizing its prey for additional attacks.
