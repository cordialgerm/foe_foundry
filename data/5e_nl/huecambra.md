The Huecambra is a large monstrosity that poses a significant threat in combat, with its formidable damage output and the ability to inflict debilitating curses. It has a strong defensive capability with an armor class of 17 and a substantial hit point total of 136, allowing it to withstand a considerable amount of damage. The creature excels in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, with a swimming speed of 30 feet and a walking speed of 40 feet. Its challenge rating of 8 indicates that it can provide a challenging encounter for mid-level adventurers. However, it has low intelligence and no associated languages, suggesting that it acts on instinct rather than strategy. Notably, it is immune to poison and thunder damage, and it is unaffected by being charmed, petrified, or poisoned.

The Huecambra has the following attributes: Strength of 18, Dexterity of 12, Constitution of 20, Intelligence of 8, Wisdom of 13, and Charisma of 17. Its high Constitution gives it an exceptional saving throw of +8, allowing it to resist effects that would require endurance. It possesses average Dexterity, making it slightly more stealthy than most creatures, while its above-average Strength, high Constitution, and impressive Charisma contribute to its effectiveness in melee combat.

In combat, the Huecambra utilizes a multiattack feature, allowing it to make three attacks per turn: one bite attack, one claw attack, and one tail attack. The bite attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 13 piercing damage. Additionally, if the bite attack hits, the target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become cursed. This curse manifests as gem-like growths on the target's body and has a damaging side effect; if the cursed creature takes damage that isn't poison or psychic, it and any creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 7 thunder damage.

The claw attack also has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 9 slashing damage, while the tail attack shares the same to-hit bonus but deals 11 bludgeoning damage. 

The Huecambra possesses a special ability called Gem Explosion, which can be used after a recharge period of 6 rounds. This ability allows it to detonate gem-like nodules on its body, requiring all creatures within 20 feet to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an impressive 24 thunder damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn; a successful save results in halved damage without the stun effect. Importantly, if a creature is cursed from the Huecambra's bite, it rolls with disadvantage on this saving throw, increasing the likelihood of being affected by the explosion. 

In summary, the Huecambra's blend of high damage potential, the ability to curse opponents, and an explosive area-effect attack establishes it as a dangerous adversary in battle.
