The Rimepacted Devil is a Medium fiend characterized by its lawful evil alignment. This creature possesses formidable combat abilities and unique traits that make it a significant threat in encounters. It has an Armor Class of 15, granting it decent protection through natural armor, and a substantial pool of 91 hit points. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it can effectively challenge players, dealing a mix of slashing and cold damage while utilizing its mobility and environmental control. Key strengths include its immunities to cold, fire, and poison damage, along with advantages on magic-related saving throws, making it a robust opponent against spellcasters. However, it has an average Dexterity score, which can be its downfall, particularly when it comes to stealth. 

The Rimepacted Devil has the following attributes: Strength 18, Dexterity 12, Constitution 15, Intelligence 9, Wisdom 13, and Charisma 16. Its Strength score is exceptionally high, providing a +4 modifier, which is very good for melee combat. Its Dexterity is average, granting a +1 modifier, while its Constitution provides a solid +2 modifier, contributing to its overall toughness. The creature's Intelligence is low, with a -1 modifier (very bad), but its Wisdom and Charisma modifiers are average (+1 and +3 respectively), allowing it to perform reasonably well in situations requiring perception and social interactions.

The Rimepacted Devil's special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness and utility. "Devil's Sight" allows it to see in magical darkness without obstruction, enabling it to maintain an advantage over foes dependent on light. Its "Frigid Vortex" ability creates a hazardous area around it, forcing creatures entering or starting their turn within the 15-foot radius to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. This nonmagical wind can also disperse areas of gas and extinguish unprotected flames, giving it control over the battlefield. However, while the vortex is active, it suffers from disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The "Magic Resistance" ability grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability against magical attacks. Additionally, the "Snow Burrower" trait permits it to burrow through nonmagical snow and ice, which adds to its mobility on icy terrain.

In terms of actions, the Rimepacted Devil can employ a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike twice with its "Icy Claw" melee attacks or three times with "Frostbolt" ranged attacks. The "Icy Claw" attack has a +7 to hit, dealing an average of 9 slashing damage combined with an additional 10 cold damage. The "Frostbolt," on the other hand, has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 13 cold damage while also reducing the target's speed by 10 feet until the end of its next turn, effectively hindering its mobility. The "Freezing Smite," which recharges on a 5-6, unleashes a wave of cold energy that deals 21 cold damage in a 30-foot radius, with a DC 15 Constitution saving throw for half damage. If a creature fails this save by 5 or more, it becomes restrained by ice until the end of its next turn, making it a powerful area control ability.

For reaction abilities, the "Fury of the Storm" allows the Rimepacted Devil to move up to half its speed towards a creature that it can see if that creature is knocked prone by its "Frigid Vortex." This reaction enables it to capitalize on opportunities, closing gaps to maintain pressure on opponents. Overall, the Rimepacted Devil is a well-rounded fiend with a mixture of mobility, control, and damage-dealing capabilities, making it a notable challenge for adventurers.
