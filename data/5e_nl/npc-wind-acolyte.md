The Wind Acolyte is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the essence of air and wind, capable of manipulating breezes and currents to its advantage. This neutral creature operates primarily as a spellcaster and ranged attacker, using its impressive dexterity and wisdom to outmaneuver opponents. With an Armor Class of 15, it can withstand moderate damage, while its 105 hit points, derived from 14d8+42, allow it to endure extended engagements. The Wind Acolyte boasts a flying speed of 50 feet, enabling high mobility, while its challenge rating of 5 indicates it is a formidable opponent, worth 1,800 XP to defeating adventurers. Though powerful in ranged combat and able to impose significant effects on its foes, it has no exceptional defenses against direct physical attacks.

The Wind Acolyte has the following attribute scores: Strength 10 (+0, average), Dexterity 20 (+5, exceptional), Constitution 16 (+3, good), Intelligence 12 (+1, average), Wisdom 18 (+4, very good), and Charisma 10 (+0, average). It possesses significant defensive capabilities with saving throws of Dexterity +8 (very good) and Wisdom +7 (good). The Acolyte has proficiency in the Perception skill with a score of +4, aiding its ability to detect threats. It has resistances to cold and lightning damage, making it less vulnerable to elemental attacks. With a blindsight range of 60 feet, it can perceive nearby creatures without the need for sight, although this ability does not function underwater or in airless environments. It can communicate in Auran and two additional languages of its choice.

The Wind Acolyte's special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness. Its "Air Senses" ability allows it to perceive its surroundings in unique ways due to its connection to air, while "Air Weapons" enables it to conjure weapons from the air that deal 2d6 damage appropriate to their form, effectively allowing it to act like a ranged or melee attacker without being encumbered by traditional weapon limitations. Notably, these attacks are magical, bypassing certain resistances.

In battle, the Wind Acolyte can make three attacks in a single turn, thanks to its "Multiattack" feature. If it successfully hits a single target with two of these attacks, the target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed back up to 15 feet, representing the forceful nature of wind. The damage inflicted by its "Air Weapon" is 12 (2d6+5) bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing, depending on the type of weapon it mimics.

The Wind Acolyte also possesses a formidable ability known as "Wind's Rebuke," which has a recharge time of 6 turns. This ability allows it to draw air from the lungs of a target within 60 feet, forcing that creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins suffocating for a duration of one minute or until it falls unconscious, presenting a serious threat to the target's survivability.

For defensive maneuvers, the Wind Acolyte can use "Buoying Wind" as a reaction, which allows it to slow the descent of up to five falling creatures within 60 feet. As a result, these creatures take no damage from falling if they land before the effect ends, highlighting the Acolyte's capacity for disruption and protection. Additionally, its "Drift" reaction enables it to gracefully evade threats; when a creature approaches within 15 feet, the Wind Acolyte can fly up to half of its flying speed, enhancing its mobility and positioning in combat.
