The Backup Holler Spider is a tiny beast with a chaotic neutral alignment, making it a creature that thrives on unpredictability. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it poses a minor threat to adventurers while also offering unique tactical advantages. While its Armor Class is relatively low at 12, its 14 hit points (derived from rolling 4d4 and adding 4) allow it to withstand some damage. This creature possesses a good Dexterity score of 15, providing it with a plus 2 modifier which makes its Dexterity saving throws also good at +4. However, its Strength and Charisma scores are notably low, rendering it very bad in melee combat situations and interactions that require persuasion or intimidation.

The holler spider has various abilities that enhance its survivability and effectiveness in combat. It can climb surfaces easily thanks to its Spider Climb ability, allowing it to traverse difficult terrain without hindrance. Additionally, its Vigilant ability provides it with enhanced senses when it remains still, granting it advantage on perception and stealth checks after a minute of being motionless. 

In combat, the Backup Holler Spider has access to two types of attacks: a melee bite and a ranged hoot attack. The bite is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing an average of 4 piercing damage from a roll of 1d4 plus 2. The hoot, a thunder damage attack, also has a +4 to hit with a range of 20 to 60 feet. It deals an average of 5 thunder damage on a hit, and if it scores a critical hit, the target is pushed away by 5 feet. Additionally, its Distressed Discharge ability acts as an area attack with a recharge mechanic, emanating a distressing sound in a 15-foot cone. Opponents caught in this area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 5 thunder damage; even on a successful save, they still take half damage. This effect pushes the holler spider away from its target, adding a layer of tactical movement during a battle.

The holler spider also has a reaction ability called Tune Up. This allows it to support allies as they cast thunder-damaging spells; it can impose disadvantage on one of the spell’s target’s saving throws. This can significantly increase the likelihood of spell success, making it a valuable partner in combat situations where thunder damage is involved. Overall, the Backup Holler Spider serves as a cunning little creature that can maneuver effectively on the battlefield, deal decent damage, and provide substantial assistive capabilities in a group setting.
