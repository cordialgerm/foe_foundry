The Mummy Lord is a Medium undead creature that stands as a formidable foe due to its potent mix of powerful attacks, magical capabilities, and resilience against death. With a Challenge Rating of 15, it presents a significant challenge to adventurers, effectively blending elements of melee combat with spellcasting and summoning abilities. The Mummy Lordâ€™s strengths lie in its high Hit Points of 270, strong defenses represented by an Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor, and its vast array of special abilities that allow it to manipulate the battlefield and summon allies. However, despite its prowess, it has weaknesses typical of undead: while it is immune to various conditions, it can still be affected by certain forms of damage and spells that do not require physical attacks. Its ability to rejuvenate from destruction adds to its challenge, making it a relentless adversary.

The Mummy Lord's attributes include a Strength score of +4, Dexterity of +0, Constitution of +8, Intelligence of +5, Wisdom of +9, and Charisma of +8. Its high Constitution indicates very good resilience, allowing it to absorb damage effectively. Its impressive Wisdom and Charisma scores also contribute to its abilities to resist magical effects and control the battlefield. The Mummy Lord has darkvision up to 60 feet, a high Perception skill of 19, and can speak the languages it knew in life. Its Stealth modifier of +10 is considered good, but as an undead creature, it often relies more on its other capabilities than on sneaking.

Special abilities of the Mummy Lord include Legendary Resistance, which allows it to succeed on a failed saving throw three times a day, providing it with very good survivability against spells and effects. Magic Resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells, which is exceptional for avoiding magical threats. The ability to rejuvenate means that if defeated, it can return to life within 24 hours if its heart remains intact, further complicating encounters with it. Turning Defiance grants advantage to itself and nearby undead allies against effects designed to turn them, promoting their united front in battle. With Undead Nature, it requires neither air, food, drink, nor sleep, and Undead Resilience grants it immunity to poison damage and effects.

In terms of actions, the Mummy Lord can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make two attacks with its Blessed Khopesh and one with its Rotting Fist, or it can choose to make four Divine Bolt spell attacks. The Blessed Khopesh attack has a +9 to hit and deals varying damage, with the option to mix slashing with necrotic or radiant damage, reflecting its versatility. The Rotting Fist attack also offers strong damage and can impose a curse called mummy rot, requiring a DC 17 Constitution saving throw to avoid. The Divine Bolt provides a ranged attack option with significant damage output, taking advantage of its spellcasting ability.

The Mummy Lord has significant spellcasting options that can impact gameplay dramatically. It can use spells like command and guidance at will, and it has access to powerful spells such as dispel magic, hold, silence (three times a day), and more impactful spells like contagion, divination, and insect plague once per day. Each of these spells can disrupt party strategies or hinder their capabilities significantly.

For bonus actions, the Mummy Lord can bolster nearby undead allies, enhancing their survivability while giving them an advantage on their next attack roll. The Dreadful Glare ability allows it to frighten and potentially paralyze adversaries, making it a tactical option to control the battlefield and limit enemy actions.

The Mummy Lord can also utilize legendary actions, which include options such as Detect Life to locate creatures nearby, Sandy Teleport for strategic repositioning, or calling servitors to increase its undead army. By unleashing divine energy, it can deal area damage and stun foes, further establishing itself as a commanding presence on the battlefield.

These attributes, actions, and abilities make the Mummy Lord a complex opponent requiring careful strategy and teamwork to overcome, presenting not only a physical threat but also a manipulative and magical powerhouse in encounters.
