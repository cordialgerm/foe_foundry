The warrior possesses the special ability of Shadow Elf Spellcasting, with Wisdom as its spellcasting ability and a spell save DC of 12. This allows the Shadow Elf Warrior to cast specific spells without needing material components, enhancing its combat capabilities and versatility.

In terms of actions, the Shadow Elf Warrior can use a shortsword, making a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit deals 4 piercing damage (1d6 + 1). Additionally, it can use a hand crossbow for ranged attacks, which also has a +3 to hit, with a range of 30 feet up to 120 feet. A successful hit from the hand crossbow also deals 4 piercing damage (1d6 + 1), but if the target is a creature, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in poisoning for 1 hour. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it falls unconscious until the poison is cured, takes damage, or a creature takes an action to wake it.

Overall, the Shadow Elf Warrior offers a blend of stealth, strategic positioning, and the potential to incapacitate foes, making it a notable encounter for adventurers.
