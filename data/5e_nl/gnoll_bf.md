The Gnoll is a Medium humanoid creature known for its feral and predatory nature. It serves as a low-level threat to adventurers, particularly due to its heightened senses and savage combat style. With an Armor Class of 15, the Gnoll can withstand a decent amount of damage but has relatively low hit points, totaling 22. It excels in close combat, utilizing its bite and spear attacks, and has a unique ability to taunt and manipulate opponents. While it mostly relies on physical prowess and intimidation, the Gnoll's combat effectiveness depends on its ability to position itself advantageously and exploit any weaknesses in its foes, making it a cunning adversary.

The Gnoll has the following ability scores: Strength is +2, which is considered good, allowing for decent melee attacks. Dexterity is +1, which is average, providing a fair defense and some agility. Constitution is at 0, deemed as average, indicating it has a typical resilience to damage. Intelligence is -2, classified as very bad, and reflects a lack of strategic thinking. Wisdom is +0, average, meaning it has an unremarkable insight, and Charisma is -2, very bad, showcasing poor social skills.

In terms of senses, the Gnoll possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, which allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception score is 10, which is average, making it moderately aware of its surroundings. However, thanks to its special ability, Heightened Smell, the Gnoll's Perception increases to 15 when utilizing its sense of smell, giving it a notable edge in tracking and detecting enemies.

The Gnoll can attack using its Bite, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 modifier to hit with a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 6 piercing damage (1d8 + 2). Alternatively, it can use a Spear in melee or ranged form, also with a +4 modifier to hit. The spear can achieve 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2) when used in one hand, or 6 piercing damage (1d8 + 2) if wielded in both hands for melee.

For bonus actions, the Gnoll can unleash a Taunting Bark, which allows it to taunt an enemy within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. If the target fails the save, it takes 2 psychic damage (1d4) and must spend its next turn moving toward the Gnoll, as well as making an attack against it. This ability can disrupt enemy formations and control the battlefield.

As a reaction, the Gnoll can use Rampage when it reduces an opponent to 0 hit points. The Gnoll can then move up to half its speed and make an additional Bite attack. If it uses Rampage, it gains advantage on attack rolls against it until the start of its next turn, reflecting its aggressive and relentless nature in combat.
