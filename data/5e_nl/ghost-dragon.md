The Ghost Dragon is a formidable large undead creature, presenting a challenging encounter for adventurers. With a Challenge Rating of 11, it has a good balance of offensive and defensive capabilities. Its high Dexterity score grants it an exceptional level of agility, making it difficult to hit and allowing for effective stealth. The creature possesses a range of immunities to various damage types, which significantly enhances its survivability in combat. However, its lack of mobility on the ground may be seen as a weakness, as it cannot walk but relies entirely on its ability to fly. The Ghost Dragon can be a terrifying opponent not only for its physical attacks but also for its special abilities, including its ability to instill fear and hinder opponents. 

The Ghost Dragon's Armor Class is 14, which is considered average for its Challenge Rating, providing it with a moderate level of protection. It has 126 hit points, derived from rolling 23d10, making it quite resilient in battle. It has a flight speed of 60 feet but cannot walk, limiting its movement options on the ground. In combat, it operates with a base Strength of 10, which is average, while its Dexterity is a notable 19, providing a very good +4 modifier. The Constitution score is average with a value of 10, while its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are strong at 14 (+2), 16 (+3), and 19 (+4) respectively, contributing to its effectiveness in combat and its capabilities with spells and abilities.

The Ghost Dragon has proficient saving throws in Dexterity and Wisdom, with bonuses of +8 and +7 respectively. These bonuses are very good, allowing it to evade many harmful effects. Its skill proficiencies include Perception (+7) and Stealth (+8), both of which are also very good, emphasizing its capabilities in surprise attacks and ambush situations. The creature benefits from damage immunities to cold, necrotic, and poison, as well as resistances to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage. It also resists physical damage from nonmagical sources. Notably, it is immune to multiple conditions, including frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned, which makes it harder to control or disable in encounters. The Ghost Dragon has darkvision up to 120 feet and possesses a passive Perception of 17, allowing it to perceive hidden foes more effectively. 

Among its special abilities, the Ghost Dragon has Ethereal Sight, enabling it to see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane, giving it a unique advantage in encounters involving ethereal creatures. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects, making it difficult to pin down during combat, though it incurs a small amount of damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

In terms of combat actions, the Ghost Dragon can perform a multiattack that includes one claw attack and one withering bite attack. The claw attack has a +8 to hit and can deal an average of 11 slashing damage on a hit. The withering bite has the same chance to hit but can be more devastating, dealing an average of 15 piercing damage along with a potential additional 18 necrotic damage if the target fails a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. 

The Ghost Dragon also possesses the ability to shift between planes through Etherealness, allowing it to move from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane and be visible on both sides while being untouchable. Its most fearsome action is the Horrifying Breath, which requires a recharge and can engulf living creatures in a 30-foot cone with icy terror. Affected creatures must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or suffer significant psychic damage and become frightened, lasting up to a minute unless they succeed on a saving throw at the end of their turns to end the fear condition. Overall, the Ghost Dragon stands as a daunting adversary, utilizing its unique abilities to manipulate the battlefield and instill dread in those who oppose it.
