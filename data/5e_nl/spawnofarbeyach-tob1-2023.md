The Spawn of Arbeyach is a Medium fiend that embodies lawful evil, making it a formidable adversary in combat. With an Armor Class of 17, it is defensively well-equipped due to its natural armor. It has considerable endurance with 78 hit points, derived from rolling 12d8 and adding 24, placing it above average in terms of survivability for its Challenge Rating of 5. This creature is especially potent in environments where it can utilize its special abilities and hive bonds, which enhance its capabilities significantly. While it possesses good physical attributes, such as a Strength score of 18 granting a +4 modifier which is very good, its weaknesses lie in its relatively low movement speed of 20 feet and lack of spellcasting. The Spawn of Arbeyach is particularly dangerous due to its poison abilities which can incapacitate foes. 

The Spawn has a Strength of 18 (+4), Dexterity of 15 (+2), Constitution of 15 (+2), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 13 (+1), and Charisma of 12 (+1). Its saving throw bonuses include a Wisdom modifier of +4, which is good. This creature is skilled in Perception with a modifier of +4, and its Stealth ability is even better, with a +5 modifier. It is immune to fire and poison damage and has resistance to cold damage, as well as to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, provided it is not inflicted with silvered weapons. Furthermore, it is immune to the poisoned condition. It has darkvision and tremorsense, each extendable to 60 feet, providing it with excellent sensory capabilities, and a passive Perception score of 14 that enhances its ability to detect threats. The Spawn of Arbeyach can communicate in Infernal and possesses unique abilities that enhance its capabilities in combat and interactions with the environment.

Special abilities of the Spawn include Devil's Sight, which allows it to see through magical darkness, ensuring visibility regardless of obscuring effects. The Hive Bond ability provides significant combat advantages, granting the Spawn of Arbeyach an advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks when within proximity to other hive members. This bond also prevents it from being surprised if at least one ally is aware of impending danger. Additionally, its Magic Resistance lets it have an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it exceptionally resilient against magical attacks. The ability to Speak with Insects enables it to communicate and command insects, potentially leading to strategic advantages in both combat and information gathering.

In combat, the Spawn employs a Multiattack strategy, making one Bite attack and one Stinger attack during its turn. The Bite attack uses a +7 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 11 damage from piercing (calculated as 2d6 + 4) and an additional 4 poison damage (1d8) upon a successful hit. The Stinger attack also has a +7 to hit and adds a poison aspect to its damage, inflicting 6 piercing damage (1d4 + 4) and 13 poison damage (3d8) if it hits. Additionally, the Stinger has the potential to poison the target, requiring them to succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute, which adds a layer of control over opponents as they must continuously roll to shake off the effect at the end of their turns.

As a special ability, the Spawn can invoke Children of Arbeyach once per day to call upon 1d4 swarms of insects. These summoned creatures arrive in a time frame of 1d4 rounds, assisting the Spawn and following its commands for a duration of 1 hour, until the Spawn is defeated, or until it dismisses them through a bonus action. This ability highlights the strategic resourcefulness of the Spawn of Arbeyach, as it can bolster its strength significantly in battles through additional allies.
