The Woodwose is a medium-sized humanoid creature known for its chaotic neutral alignment. It represents a nature-oriented being that possesses unique abilities allowing it to thrive in forested environments. Strong in terms of physical attributes, particularly in strength with a score of 16, it is capable of engaging in close combat effectively. However, it exhibits weak charisma, which hinders its social interactions. The Woodwose's dual speed of climbing and walking, alongside its capacity to perform innate spellcasting, make it an agile and versatile opponent. Its challenge rating of 1/2 indicates that it is a low-level creature, posing manageable difficulty for adventurers.

The Woodwose has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average, providing modest protection. It has 27 hit points, derived from rolling six eight-sided dice. With a movement speed of 30 feet when walking and 20 feet while climbing, it showcases good mobility in various terrains. With a very good strength modifier of +3, it excels in melee combat, while its average constitution (+0) does not offer significant resiliency. Its dexterity modifier of +1 contributes to its moderate agility. The Woodwose also has a good wisdom modifier of +2, enhancing its perception and survival skills, while its intelligence is average (+0), and its charisma is very bad (-1).

In terms of skills, the Woodwose is proficient in nature (+2), perception (+4), stealth (+3), and survival (+4).

The Woodwose benefits from several special abilities. Its Fey Touched ability grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed and renders it immune to sleep effects caused by magic, making it resilient against certain magical influences. It can speak with beasts and plants, allowing for effective communication with its surrounding environment. Its innate spellcasting, relying on wisdom with a spell save DC of 12, allows it to cast spells without the need for material components, showcasing its connection to nature.

The Woodwose can cast the spell Shillelagh at will. This spell enhances its club or its melee attack by changing the weapon from a d4 to a d8 for damage and allowing the spell caster to use their spellcasting ability modifier instead of strength. It can also cast Pass Without Trace three times a day, granting a bonus to stealth checks and making it harder to be detected for it and its companions. Finally, once per day, it can use Entangle, causing plants to restrain enemies in a specified area, providing a powerful control effect during combat.
