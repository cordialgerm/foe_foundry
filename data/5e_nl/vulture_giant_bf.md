The Giant Vulture is a large beast known for its scavenging abilities and proficiency in both aerial and ground mobility. With an Armor Class of 10 and 46 hit points, it relies on its speed, flying at 60 feet per round, to evade danger while lurking for carrion. At a Challenge Rating of 1, the Giant Vulture presents a modest threat to adventurers, primarily supporting its allies with its Pack Tactics ability. Although not particularly strong or charismatic, its strengths lie in survival and combat support rather than direct confrontation. The Giant Vultureâ€™s primary weaknesses include low armor class and limited combat focus, making it more suitable for ambush tactics rather than face-to-face encounters.

For its attributes, the Giant Vulture has a Strength of +3, making its physical attacks above average in effectiveness, enabling it to engage reasonably well in melee situations. Its Dexterity is +0, reflecting an average capability in dodging attacks and enhancing its initial position, while its Constitution of +2 provides good durability in fights. The Intelligence stat of -4 indicates that it lacks cognitive capabilities, which is very bad for problem-solving scenarios. The Wisdom modifier of +1 allows for decent perception checks, complemented by a perception score of 13 due to its heightened sensory abilities. Lastly, a Charisma of -2 reflects that its social influence is very bad, making interactions with other creatures less effective.

The Giant Vulture possesses special abilities enhancing its tracking and combat efficiency. Its Carrion Sense allows it to detect the smell of carrion, dead creatures, and Undead within 60 feet, making it highly efficient in tracking down prey. The Heightened Sight and Smell ability further boosts its Perception score to 18 for sight or scent-based checks, making it exceptional in identifying threats or targets in its vicinity. The Pack Tactics ability grants the vulture an advantage on attack rolls against foes in proximity to its allies, increasing its effectiveness in coordinated group attacks.

In terms of actions during combat, the Giant Vulture can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike an enemy with both its Beak and Talons in a single turn. The Beak attack has a +5 to hit, reaching 5 feet and dealing an average of 6 piercing damage on a successful hit. Its Talons attack also features a +5 to hit and deals an average of 7 slashing damage, making these attacks good options for dealing consistent damage in melee combat.

The vulture also possesses a Reaction called Defensive Bile. When hit by a melee attack within 5 feet, it can retaliate by spitting partially digested carrion at the attacker. The assailant must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or they will take 5 acid damage and become incapacitated until the end of their next turn. This ability makes the Giant Vulture more intimidating in close quarters, enabling it to deter attackers effectively, showcasing its role as both a melee threat and a surprisingly strategic creature in combat scenarios.
