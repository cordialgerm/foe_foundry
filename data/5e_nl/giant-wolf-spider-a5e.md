The Giant Wolf Spider is a Medium-sized beast known for its agility and stealth in combat. With an Armor Class of 13, it can withstand some damage but is not particularly tough, having only 13 hit points. Its primary strength lies in its dexterity, which is rated at 16, granting it a good +3 modifier that enhances its chances to hit opponents and dodge attacks. Additionally, it possesses useful abilities such as Spider Climb, allowing it to maneuver easily in various environments, and Web Sense, which grants it awareness of creatures in contact with webs. The spider can deal damage with its bite attack, which not only inflicts piercing damage but also has the potential to paralyze its target if the poison effect is successful. Its weak intelligence score indicates that it lacks strategic thinking, but its stealth capabilities and web-related features make it a dangerous ambush predator. Overall, the Giant Wolf Spider excels in surprise attacks, making it a formidable foe despite its relatively low durability.

- Intelligence: 2 (-4), very bad, indicating almost no cognitive abilities, limiting its interaction and tactical insight.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), average, providing decent perception and insight into its surroundings.

In terms of skills, the Giant Wolf Spider has a +3 modifier in perception, indicating a good awareness of its environment, and a +5 modifier in stealth, which is exceptional, allowing it to approach prey without being easily detected. Its senses include blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, which enable it to detect creatures even in darkness or through obstacles, enhancing its ambush capabilities. The spider has a passive Perception score of 13, indicating a good passive ability to notice hidden threats or approach predators.

The special abilities of the Giant Wolf Spider enhance its lethality:
- Spider Climb: The spider can traverse difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings. This makes it tricky to dislodge during combat, as it can attack from various angles.
- Web Sense: While in contact with webs, the spider can sense the location of creatures connected to those webs, giving it an edge in tracking prey or ambushing foes.
- Web Walker: The spider is unhindered by webbing, allowing it to move freely through areas filled with webs and avoid typical hindrances faced by other creatures.

The action available to the Giant Wolf Spider is its bite:
- Bite: This melee weapon attack allows the spider to strike at a 5-foot reach with a +3 modifier to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 3 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 5 poison damage, while success halves the damage. If the poison reduces the target's hit points to zero, that target becomes stable but remains poisoned for one hour. During this time, even if the target regains hit points, it remains paralyzed, making the bite attack incredibly dangerous in combat.
