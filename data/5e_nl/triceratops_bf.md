The Triceratops is a large dinosaur that serves as a formidable beast in combat situations. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat due to its high hit points of 126 and impressive speed of 50 feet. The creature is well-armored, having an armor class of 13, which is average for its size and role. The Triceratops has strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, with values of +6 and +3 respectively, which indicate very good physical power and durability. However, it has a poor Dexterity score of -1, making it vulnerable to effects that target speed or agility. Its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are also quite low, indicating that while it is a fearsome combatant, it lacks social and mental capabilities. The Triceratops's notable abilities allow it to withstand critical blows and trample over foes, making it an aggressive and threatening presence on the battlefield.

The Triceratops has the following attributes and modifiers: 
- Strength: +6 (very good)
- Dexterity: -1 (bad)
- Constitution: +3 (good)
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +0 (average)
- Charisma: -3 (very bad)

This creatureâ€™s senses and skills include:
- Perception: 10 (average)
- Stealth: 9 (average, but limited by its size)

The Triceratops has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness:
- **Hardy**: This ability allows the Triceratops to ignore the extra damage from critical hits, turning them into normal hits instead. This significantly increases its survivability in battle.
- **Trampling Charge**: If the Triceratops charges at least 20 feet toward a creature and successfully hits it with a Gore attack during that turn, the target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 14. If they fail, they are knocked prone. This ability also allows the Triceratops to execute a bonus action Stomp attack against the prone target, which can quickly diminish an opponent's health.

For its actions, the Triceratops can:
- **Multiattack**: With this action, it can make two melee attacks with its Gore ability.
- **Gore**: This melee weapon attack has a +9 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet against one target. A successful hit deals 19 piercing damage, which is considerable.
- **Stomp**: This melee weapon attack also has a +9 to hit but can only target a prone creature within 5 feet. If it hits, it deals 17 bludgeoning damage, which is effective against grounded foes.

Additionally, the Triceratops can perform a bonus action:
- **Warning Bugle**: It can emit a loud call in a 30-foot cone, forcing each creature in the area to make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 14. If they fail, they are frightened until the end of their next turn. If used before moving the requisite distance for the Trampling Charge, any target of that charge has disadvantage on this saving throw, and the Triceratops can follow up with a free Stomp attack against them if they are negated by the earlier charge's Strength save.

Overall, the Triceratops is a powerful creature ideal for aggressive tactics, capable of trampling over enemies and delivering devastating melee attacks bolstered by its special abilities. Its weaknesses mainly lie in its poor Dexterity and lack of non-combat skills.
