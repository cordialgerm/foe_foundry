The Windy Wailer is a large undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment and haunting abilities. This creature thrives on cold and necrotic energy, making it a formidable adversary in combat, especially against weaker foes. Its notable strengths include high dexterity, exceptional movement capabilities, and a suite of chilling attacks that can incapacitate and frighten its opponents. The Windy Wailer's weaknesses lie primarily in its reliance on the intimidation of its presence and its susceptibility to radiant damage, which is not mentioned as an immunity or resistance. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat, particularly to adventurers who may be unprepared for its psychological and physical tactics.

The Windy Wailer has an Armor Class (AC) of 14, which is average, allowing it to withstand moderate attacks. It possesses 75 hit points, indicative of good durability for a creature of its level. It can fly at a speed of 60 feet, with the ability to hover, giving it exceptional mobility during combat. The Windy Wailer boasts the following ability scores: Strength is 10 (+0), Dexterity is 18 (+4, good), Constitution is 15 (+2, average), Intelligence is 11 (+0), Wisdom is 14 (+2, average), and Charisma is 16 (+3, good). Its high dexterity contributes significantly to its saving throw bonuses, with a saving throw against Dexterity of +7, making it very effective at avoiding physical attacks. It also has an exceptional passive perception score of 15, allowing it to detect hidden foes easily.

The Windy Wailer has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. One of its key abilities is "Ghostlight," which enables it to mesmerize creatures that start their turns within 30 feet of it. Affected creatures must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; failing this causes them to become incapacitated and unable to move. However, creatures can avert their gaze to avoid this effect, providing a strategic aspect to encounters with the Windy Wailer. Additionally, its "Incorporeal Movement" allows it to pass through other creatures and objects, treating them as difficult terrain, though it incurs damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

In terms of actions, the Windy Wailer has several options. The "Chilling Touch" is a melee weapon attack that hits with a +7 modifier to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals a total of 15 damage consisting of 8 necrotic damage and 7 cold damage. "Wind Blast" is a ranged attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing 14 cold damage. If the target fails a DC 15 Strength saving throw, they are pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone, making it a strategic offensive move. The Windy Wailer can also use "Frightful Gale" as a powerful cone attack that recharges on a roll of 5-6. This ability requires creatures in a 30-foot cone to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, resulting in 14 cold damage on a failed save and frightening the target for one minute. Victims can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns. Notably, if a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this ability and later revived, they acquire a permanent mark characterized by a shock of white hair, a flavorful consequence that adds a lasting effect to their encounter with the Windy Wailer.
