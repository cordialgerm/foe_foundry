The Horde Demon Band is a large fiendish entity characterized by its malevolent nature and chaotic evil alignment. It possesses formidable strength and endurance, making it a significant threat in combat, particularly through its ability to attack as a collective unit. The creature averages 260 hit points, making it exceptionally durable. Its defense is marked by a moderate armor class of 13, which affords it some protection against attacks. While the band is resilient, it has vulnerability to area effects, which can double the damage it takes, making strategy important when facing this creature. The band can disperse into additional demons when brought to 0 hit points, potentially prolonging combat. 

The Horde Demon Band has attributes that enhance its combat effectiveness: Strength is at 16 (+3), providing good melee capabilities; Dexterity is average at 12 (+1), which influences its ability to evade attacks lightly; Constitution is also good at 14 (+2), contributing to its hit points; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all low, at 8 (-1), making it poor in mental interactions.

The creature has several noteworthy abilities. It is immune to poison damage and resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as damage from nonmagical weapons, which enhances its survival in combat scenarios. Additionally, it is immune to being poisoned, further increasing its resilience. The horde demon can see in the dark up to 120 feet and has a passive Perception score of 11, which allows it to detect nearby threats effectively. It communicates using the Abyssal language.

Special abilities of the Horde Demon Band include:
- **Area Vulnerability:** This makes the band susceptible to area-of-effect attacks, as they take double damage from such sources. This weakness can be exploited by tactical spellcasters or area-damaging abilities.
- **Chaotic Evil:** Its aura reinforces its alignment, making it known that the band thrives on chaos and malevolence.
- **Band:** Composed of five or more horde demons, this feature allows the band to effectively share space with smaller creatures, gaining tactical advantages in tighter spaces. When targeted by single-target effects, the band takes damage but ignores other effects, allowing it to continue functioning in combat.
- **Band Dispersal:** Upon reaching 0 hit points, the creature disperses into 1d4 horde demons, each with 26 hit points, giving the band the ability to fight on even after being seemingly defeated.

In terms of actions, the band has the following:
- **Multiattack:** This ability allows the band to attack twice in a turn, increasing its potential damage output and posing a large threat to any single-target adversaries.
- **Mob Attack:** This melee weapon attack has a +8 modifier to hit and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to target creatures within range. The attack deals a substantial 50 (10d6 + 15) slashing damage, or half damage if the band is bloodied, which can significantly impact a foe's health and positioning.
