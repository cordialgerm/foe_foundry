The Ancient Blue Dragon is a formidable and majestic creature, recognized as one of the most powerful dragons in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. This gargantuan dragon typically serves as a high-level antagonist or a challenging boss in a campaign. Its impressive statistics, including a very high Armor Class of 22 and a massive Hit Point total of 407, make it tough to hit and capable of sustaining heavy damage. It has exceptional Strength and Constitution scores of 28 and 26, respectively, which allow it to deal significant melee damage and serve as a tank in battle. Additionally, it possesses formidable spellcasting abilities and a variety of powerful abilities that can manipulate the battlefield, control enemies, and devastate groups with area attacks. However, its relatively low Dexterity score of 10 might make it vulnerable to ranged attacks, especially from agile opponents.

The Ancient Blue Dragon has a total of 6 attributes: 
- Strength (STR): 28 (+9) - Exceptionally strong, it can deal substantial damage in melee combat. 
- Dexterity (DEX): 10 (+0) - Average, provides no bonuses to its initiative or ranged attacks. 
- Constitution (CON): 26 (+8) - Very good, contributes to its high hit points, making it resilient in battle. 
- Intelligence (INT): 18 (+4) - Good, allowing for effective spellcasting and strategy. 
- Wisdom (WIS): 16 (+3) - Good, enhancing its perception and making it more difficult to deceive. 
- Charisma (CHA): 20 (+5) - Very good, bolstering its spellcasting abilities and presence.

In terms of saving throws, the Ancient Blue Dragon has strong capabilities:
- Dexterity: +8 (good), 
- Constitution: +16 (exceptional), 
- Wisdom: +11 (good), 
- Charisma: +13 (good). 

This makes it quite resilient against a variety of effects and spells that target these attributes.

The dragon has several notable abilities:
- **Desert Farer**: This ability allows the dragon to completely ignore difficult terrain and obscurement in sandy environments, enabling it to traverse deserts without obstacles. It is also immune to extreme heat.
- **Dune Splitter**: The dragon can hide beneath the sand or gravel for up to 4 hours, gaining advantage on Stealth checks while doing so. When it emerges, creatures nearby must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded, which can significantly hinder opponents.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**: This allows the dragon to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw instead of failing, providing it with a major advantage in critical moments. However, using this ability also weakens its defenses temporarily.
- **Innate Spellcasting**: The dragon can cast spells using its Charisma as its spellcasting ability, with a save DC of 21. It can cast spells such as "blur," which makes it harder to hit; "silent image," which creates various illusions; "blight," dealing damage to targets; and "hypnotic pattern," which can incapacitate foes. It is especially powerful as it can cast certain spells multiple times per day without needing components.

In combat, the Ancient Blue Dragon can take multiple actions thanks to its Multiattack feature, attacking once with its bite, twice with its claws, or using its Arc Lightning attack in place of a bite attack. The specifics of its attacks include:
- **Bite**: +17 to hit, with a reach of 15 feet, dealing average 40 total damage (31 piercing plus 9 lightning).
- **Claw**: +17 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 22 slashing damage.
- **Tail**: +17 to hit, with a reach of 20 feet, inflicting 22 bludgeoning damage and pushing the target away.
- **Arc Lightning**: A long-range lightning attack allowing the dragon to target a creature within 60 feet. If they fail a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, they take 22 lightning damage, and the dragon can jump the effect to another creature, potentially chaining damage.
- **Lightning Breath**: A powerful area-of-effect ability that can target multiple creatures in a line up to 120 feet long, dealing an average of 94 lightning damage if they fail a DC 24 save.
- **Quake**: An area attack that can knock opponents prone and additionally restrain those on sand, providing strategic control over the battlefield.

As a reaction, the dragon can make a **Tail Attack** when struck by a melee attack, giving it the opportunity to counterattack.

The dragon also possesses legendary actions, which include:
- **Roar**: This frightening ability can incapacitate nearby creatures for a turn unless they succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
- **Wing Attack**: A powerful sweeping action that can push and knock foes prone while allowing the dragon to reposition.
- **Quake (Costs 2 Actions)**: Similar to its main action but used as a legendary action to create battlefield control more frequently. 

In summary, the Ancient Blue Dragon is an incredibly powerful entity, able to dominate both in melee and from a distance with its spells and stunning abilities. These features enable it to be a centerpiece in any high-level campaign, presenting a formidable challenge to any adventuring party.
