The Bandit is a medium humanoid character that primarily serves as an enemy in combat encounters, particularly in scenarios involving theft or ambush. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, they are relatively weak opponents, offering limited experience points and presenting challenges suitable for lower-level adventurers. Their strengths lie in their ability to engage in both melee and ranged combat using a scimitar and a light crossbow, respectively. However, their lack of high hit points and poor defensive capabilities make them vulnerable in direct confrontations. Bandits are typically driven by a code of violence, varying from common highway robbers to principled freedom fighters, which adds depth and narrative potential to their encounters.

The Bandit has the following attributes: Strength is 12, giving them a modifier of +1, which is considered average. Dexterity is 10, resulting in no modifier, which is bad for avoiding attacks. Constitution is also 10, translating to no modifier, indicating a bad resilience against damage. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all at 10 as well, with modifiers of +0, making them average in social interactions and perception.

The Bandit has an Armor Class (AC) of 12, which is considered average, making them moderately easy to hit in combat. With hit points totaling 9 (2d8), they are quite fragile and can be defeated quickly with a few successful attacks, suggesting a very bad survivability in extended encounters. Their speed is a walking distance of 30 feet, allowing them to move at a normal pace, which is good for tactical positioning.

In terms of actions, the Bandit can perform two types of attacks. The first is a melee weapon attack using a scimitar, which has a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. When they succeed, they deal 4 slashing damage (1d6 + 1). The second action available is a ranged weapon attack with a light crossbow, which has a +2 to hit with a range of 80 feet for normal distance and 320 feet for disadvantage. This attack deals 4 piercing damage (1d8) upon a successful hit.

Overall, Bandits are straightforward adversaries suitable for introducing players to combat mechanics. Their simplicity allows novice players to engage without overwhelming complexity while providing seasoned players an opportunity to role-play against varying moral backgrounds.
