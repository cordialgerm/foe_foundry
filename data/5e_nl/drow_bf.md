The drow is a Medium humanoid known for its cunning and agility, often found in subterranean environments. With an Armor Class of 15 and only 12 hit points, the drow relies heavily on its dexterity and stealth to evade attacks rather than absorbing damage. Its challenge rating of 1/4 indicates that it is suitable for low-level encounters, making it a staple adversary in early adventures. Notable for its darkvision, the drow can see in complete darkness up to 120 feet, giving it a significant tactical advantage in dimly lit areas. However, it possesses a weakness to sunlight, which imposes disadvantages on its attack rolls and perception checks when exposed. Drow combatants excel with their ranged and melee attacks, enhanced by their ability to use poisons strategically, making them formidable foes despite their lower resilience.

The drow's attributes include a Dexterity score of +2, resulting in a good modifier for attack and damage rolls. Its Strength, Constitution, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores are average at +0, while it has a Charisma score of +1, which is also average. The drow has a good Stealth score of 14, allowing it to sneak effectively. The drow understands Elvish and Undercommon, facilitating communication in the dark realms it often inhabits.

The drow has two special abilities: Fey Ancestry and Sunlight Sensitivity. Fey Ancestry grants the drow a very good resistance to being charmed and immunity to being put to sleep through magical means, allowing it to remain alert and dangerous in combat situations. In contrast, Sunlight Sensitivity is a significant drawback, rendering the drow effective only in dark environments; when in sunlight, it suffers from disadvantage on attack rolls and has a perception score effectively reduced to 7.

During combat, the drow can make melee attacks with a shortsword, which has a +4 bonus to hit and deals an average of 5 piercing damage. It can also fire a hand crossbow, which has the same bonus to hit and damage output, allowing for versatility in its attack methods. 

As a bonus action, the drow can use the Poison Weapon ability, which allows it to coat one of its weapons with a type of poison. If the drow hits an enemy with this weapon, the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they suffer effects based on the poison used, which can range from being blinded, frightened, or even unconscious. The poison remains effective until the start of the drow's next turn, encouraging rapid and tactical play in combat scenarios. This adds a strong element of strategy to the drow's encounters, as it can choose the most advantageous poison based on the situation.
