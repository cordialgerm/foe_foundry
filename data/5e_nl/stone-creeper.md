The Stone Creeper is a Medium-sized plant creature that functions effectively as a cunning ambush predator in its environment. Not aligned to any particular cause, it relies on its deceptive abilities and climbing skills to outmaneuver foes. With a modest armor class of 12, it is somewhat resilient, boasting 30 hit points thanks to its constitution score of 16, which grants it a good level of durability. The Stone Creeper's movement capabilities are notable; it can walk at a speed of 30 feet and climb at 20 feet, allowing it to navigate both ground and vertical spaces with ease. Despite its lower intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores, it compensates with advantages in dexterity and constitution, giving it a good foundational ability for evasion and survival. It has a challenge rating of 1, providing 200 experience points upon defeat, marking it as a suitable encounter for lower-level adventurers.

The ability scores for the Stone Creeper are as follows: Strength of 12 (+1), Dexterity of 15 (+2 - good), Constitution of 16 (+3 - very good), Intelligence of 4 (-3 - very bad), Wisdom of 6 (-2 - bad), and Charisma of 4 (-3 - very bad). It is immune to acid and poison damage and resistant to bludgeoning damage, making it resilient against physical attacks. The Stone Creeper is also immune to the poisoned condition. With a passive perception of 8, it has limited awareness and is capable of sensing vibrations through its tremorsense within a 60-foot radius, though it is blind beyond this range.

The Stone Creeper has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and survivability. It has the "False Appearance" ability which allows it to remain completely undetectable when motionless, blending seamlessly with its surroundings as an ordinary vine. Its "Mass of Vines" ability permits it to navigate through very narrow spaces without the need for squeezing, making it versatile in confined areas. Additionally, the "Spider Climb" ability enables it to effortlessly climb difficult surfaces, including upside-down on ceilings, without requiring any checks.

In terms of actions, the Stone Creeper employs two primary attack methods. The "Thorned Vine" allows for a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 5 piercing damage plus additional acid damage (5 acid damage from 2d4). For ranged engagements, it can utilize the "Acid-coated Thorn," which has a +4 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet, inflicting 4 piercing damage alongside 2 acid damage (1d4). 

The Stone Creeper also possesses the "Weaken Stone" ability, which is particularly effective against structures made of worked stone. While climbing on such surfaces, it injects acid into the mortar, creating dangerous hazards for nearby creatures. Any creature within 10 feet of the wall or in a 10-foot cube beneath the ceiling must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail suffer 7 bludgeoning damage (2d6) and, if they are beneath the ceiling, are knocked prone and buried. A buried creature is restrained and cannot breathe or stand. Meanwhile, other creatures can attempt to remove the rubble and free them by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check, adding a layer of strategic consideration during combat.
