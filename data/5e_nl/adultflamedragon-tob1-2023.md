The Adult Flame Dragon is a formidable creature that embodies chaos and destruction with its chaotic evil alignment. As a Huge Dragon, it boasts incredible strength, resilience, and a fierce array of abilities that make it a significant threat in any encounter. With a Challenge Rating of 16, it poses a serious challenge to adventurers, boasting high hit points at 275 and a robust Armor Class of 19 thanks to its natural armor. The dragon's capability to fly, coupled with its fire-based powers, allows it to dominate the battlefield both physically and psychologically. Its special abilities, such as being immune to fire damage while still being able to deal it without restriction, make it an extraordinary foe. However, its primary weakness lies in its susceptibility to certain forms of non-magical attacks since it lacks immunity beyond fire.

The Adult Flame Dragon has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 19, which translates to a +4 modifier, indicating a good effectiveness in physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 14, with a +2 modifier, considered average, making it somewhat nimble but not exceptionally so.
- Constitution: 23, providing a +6 modifier that is very good, enabling it to endure significant damage.
- Intelligence: 17, granting a +3 modifier that reflects good cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, indicating average perceptiveness and insight.
- Charisma: 20, with a +5 modifier, offering exceptional abilities in manipulation and presence. 

The dragon has saving throw proficiencies in Dexterity (+7), Constitution (+11), Wisdom (+7), and Charisma (+10). These values convey that the dragon is quite adept at evading traps and magical effects that rely on these stats, with very good to exceptional effectiveness.

In terms of skills, it excels in Deception (+10), Persuasion (+10), and has exceptional Perception (+12). Stealth is at a more average level (+7). The dragon possesses damage immunity to fire, making it highly resistant to fire-based attacks, while it has keen senses including blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet, enhancing its ability to engage foes even in low visibility.

The Adult Flame Dragon possesses several special abilities:
- **Fire Incarnate** allows it to bypass resistances to fire damage that other creatures might have, though those immune to fire sustain their immunity.
- **Heated Body** inflicts 10 (3d6) fire damage to any creature that comes into contact with the dragon or strikes it with melee attacks while within 5 feet, making close combat risky.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)** lets the dragon succeed on saving throws even when it fails, enhancing its durability against spells and abilities that require saving throws.

During combat, the dragon can take a multiattack action, beginning with its **Frightful Presence**, which forces nearby foes to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. This powerful ability limits opponents' actions and control during engagements. The dragon then can make one **Bite** attack, dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage and an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage, alongside two **Claw** attacks, each inflicting 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, and a **Tail** attack that deals 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

The dragon's **Fire Breath** ability is particularly devastating; it can exhale fire in a 60-foot cone once per recharge. Creatures caught must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 56 (16d6) fire damage. Additionally, those affected must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or go on a rampage for a minute, forcing them to attack the nearest creature on their turn.

For bonus actions, the dragon can use **Shifting Flames** to transform into a fire-based elemental form, impacting its flying capabilities while maintaining its statistics otherwise. It can also make a **Tail Attack** or utilize **Wing Attack**, which knocks creatures within 10 feet prone and allows the dragon to reposition itself in the air.

Lastly, the dragon can utilize legendary actions, allowing it to make additional attacks or perform actions with the same conditions of limited usage at the end of another creature's turn. These actions include detection checks, tail strikes, or wing assaults, making it a highly mobile and tactically flexible adversary in combat scenarios.
