Xing Tian is a formidable Huge Giant known for its exceptional combat prowess and impressive durability. As a neutral creature, it does not align with good or evil motives, making it a potentially unpredictable challenge for adventurers. With a strong Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor and shield, paired with a substantial pool of 168 hit points, it can endure prolonged encounters. The creature excels in melee combat, capable of dealing significant damage with its Multiattack, utilizing both a battleaxe and a shield slam. However, its lower Dexterity and Intelligence scores indicate that it may struggle with agility and mental tasks. Its condition immunities to fear and special abilities like Indomitable grant it remarkable resilience against debilitating effects, while Sure-Footed enhances its stability against attempts to knock it over.

In terms of attributes, Xing Tian boasts a Strength of 23 with a modifier of +6, indicating exceptional physical power. It has a Constitution of 18 (+4), which contributes to its high hit points and makes it tough to take down. Its Dexterity is relatively average at 12 (+1), providing only basic agility. The Wisdom of 15 (+2) suggests a reasonable level of insight and perception, while a Charisma of 14 (+2) allows for moderate intimidation skills. With an Intelligence of 10 (+0), it is neither particularly smart nor foolish.

Xing Tian's saving throws include a +8 for Constitution, which is very good, enabling it to resist physical effects and damage, and a +6 for Wisdom, also very good for resisting mental effects. In terms of skills, it can effectively intimidate foes with a +6 bonus and has a perception score of +6, allowing it to notice hidden threats well. It has an immunity to the frightened condition, making it undaunted in the face of terror effects. Its darkvision extends 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light, while its passive perception is noteworthy at 16, enabling it to be aware of its surroundings.

Xing Tian possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Indomitable feature means that spells or effects that would paralyze, restrain, or stun it disappear at the end of its next turn, making it extremely resilient by breaking free from controlling effects. The Sure-Footed ability grants it advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws against being knocked prone, reinforcing its ability to remain standing in battles.

In combat, Xing Tian can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks in total: one with its shield slam and two with its battleaxe. Each attack uses a +10 to hit, a good modifier for a creature of its level, and has a reach of 5 feet. The shield slam can deal 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and if the attack is successful, it forces the target to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone, which can dramatically affect the battlefield dynamics. The battleaxe is a powerful weapon, capable of dealing 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage with one hand and 22 (3d10 + 6) damage if wielded with two hands, exemplifying its dangerous melee capabilities.

Xing Tian can also perform a unique action called Dance of the Unyielding. In this martial display, it regains 10 hit points immediately and continues to regain that amount at the start of each of its turns while it maintains the dance. During this time, enemy melee attacks against it have disadvantage, making it even harder to hit. The xing tian must use a bonus action on its subsequent turns to keep the dance going and can stop at any time, providing flexibility in its strategy. However, if it becomes incapacitated, the dance ends, cutting off its healing effect and lowering its defenses.

Overall, Xing Tian is a tough and resilient adversary with strong offensive capabilities and the ability to recover in combat, making it a challenging foe for any adventurers who cross its path.
