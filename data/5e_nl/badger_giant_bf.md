The Giant Badger is a medium-sized beast known for its ferocity and tenacity in combat. With an armor class of 10 and 15 hit points, it presents a relatively low defensive capability, but its challenge rating of 1/4 indicates that it can still provide a decent challenge to low-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its burrowing capability, allowing it to navigate underground, and its notable special abilities. However, its intelligence is very low, signifying that it operates mostly on instinct. The Giant Badger is adept at sensing its surroundings through heightened smell and reacts aggressively to threats, making it a formidable foe despite its small stature.

The Giant Badger has the following attributes: Strength of +1 (average), Dexterity of +0 (bad), Constitution of +2 (good), Intelligence of -4 (very bad), Wisdom of +1 (average), and Charisma of -3 (very bad). The badger's Constitution provides it with some robustness in battle, while its poor intelligence and charisma suggest it is not capable of complex thought or social interaction.

In terms of special abilities, the Giant Badger possesses "Grumpy," a feature that dictates its combat behavior. When attacked, it will target the creature that last damaged it, provided the target is within reach or could be approached without provoking an opportunity attack. This makes the badger aggressive and focused in its responses. Additionally, its "Heightened Smell" ability enhances its perception to a total of 16 when detecting by smell, making it particularly effective at noticing hidden or unseen creatures.

The Giant Badger can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make one Bite attack and one Claws attack on its turn. For the Bite attack, it rolls at a +3 to hit and can target one creature within 5 feet, dealing 4 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Claws attack similarly uses the same bonus to hit and also reaches 5 feet, inflicting 3 slashing damage if it lands. This combination of attacks makes it a capable combatant for its size, able to deal respectable damage to opponents that come too close.
