Mortifera is a large aberration characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment. This creature is often found lurking underwater or in flower-laden swamps, where it blends seamlessly into its surroundings. It possesses significant strengths in combat, with impressive hit points and the ability to grapple and poison its enemies using its unique tendrils. However, its low Intelligence and Charisma scores suggest it may not excel in social situations or clever tactics. Overall, Mortifera serves as a formidable opponent, especially in aquatic environments, where it can utilize its amphibious nature to great effect.

The Mortifera has an Armor Class of 16, which offers a good defense against attacks. It boasts 135 hit points, making it resilient in battle. The creature has a speed of 30 feet both on land and in water, allowing for versatile movement in different terrains. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it is considered a significant threat, yielding 2,300 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, Mortifera has a Strength score of 18, providing a good modifier of +4, which indicates very good physical power for grappling and melee attacks. Its Dexterity is 16, yielding a +3 modifier, enabling average agility. The Constitution score of 15 results in a +2 modifier, giving it a decent level of vitality. However, it has a very low Intelligence of 8 (-1), which limits its cognitive abilities, and a Wisdom score of 10 (+0), indicating average perceptiveness. Its Charisma is particularly weak at 5 (-3), suggesting that it is very bad at influencing other creatures.

Mortifera is immune to conditions such as being blinded, deafened, exhaustively, and poisoned, making it exceptionally difficult to incapacitate. It has blindsight for 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures in this range even when it cannot see, and a passive Perception score of 13. Mortifera does not communicate in any known languages.

The creature possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. It is amphibious, enabling it to breathe both air and water, which is vital for its survival in diverse ecosystems. Its False Appearance allows it to remain motionless and appear as part of a natural bed of lotus flowers, making it hard for enemies to detect it until it's too late. With Magic Resistance, it has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, providing a significant defensive boon. Additionally, its Poisonous Tendrils ability forces creatures grappled by it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) or become poisoned for a minute, allowing them to retry the save at the end of each of their turns.

In combat, Mortifera can engage in a Multiattack, which consists of either one Fanged Tentacles attack and two Slam attacks or three Slam attacks. The Fanged Tentacles attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, targeting one creature within 10 feet. It deals 9 piercing damage plus 9 poison damage and grapples the target, making it restrained as long as the grapple holds. The Slam attack, also with a +7 to hit, allows Mortifera to deal 10 bludgeoning damage to a target within 5 feet. 

Mortifera can utilize its Chomp action against one creature it has grappled, pulling the target closer to its central maw. This includes a melee attack that deals 10 piercing damage and an additional 13 poison damage, with a Strength saving throw (DC 15) to potentially half the poison damage. Additionally, it can unleash a Poison Spray (Recharge 5-6), which sprays poison from its central maw in a 30-foot cone, dealing 27 poison damage (with a Dexterity saving throw of DC 15 for half damage) to all creatures caught in the area. This ability emphasizes Mortifera's role as a hazardous opponent, capable of inflicting significant area damage while maintaining pressure on individuals that get too close.
