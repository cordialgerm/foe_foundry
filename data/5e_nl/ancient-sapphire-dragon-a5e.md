The Ancient Sapphire Dragon has several special abilities:
- Legendary Resistance allows it to succeed on failed saving throws three times per day, though doing so limits other abilities temporarily.
- Predictive Harmonics grants the dragon immunity to surprise and the ability to roll normally even when faced with disadvantage.
- Its psionic powers encompass both magical and psionic traits, making them versatile in nature.
- With Far Thoughts, the dragon can psionically observe creatures and locations within 100 miles, rendering it blind and deaf to its physical surroundings but allowing for unlimited observation.
- The dragon's Innate Spellcasting permits it to cast spells using its Charisma attribute, with a save DC of 20. It can cast spells like comprehend languages and detect thoughts three times a day, and mind blank and etherealness once a day.

In combat, the dragon can employ a Multiattack feature, allowing it to strike with its bite and claws or use its Psionic Wave. The Bite attack scores a +14 to hit and deals 29 piercing damage plus 9 psychic damage. Its Claws attacks also have a +14 bonus and deal 20 slashing damage. The Psionic Wave acts as a close-range psionic attack that requires enemies to make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, inflicting psychic damage and imposing disadvantage on ongoing psychic damage targets. 

One of its most devastating abilities is the Discognitive Breath, which can be used every 5-6 rounds. It creates a large area of psychic energy, requiring a DC 21 Intelligence saving throw. Those who fail take 66 psychic damage and suffer 22 ongoing psychic damage, while successful saves halve the damage and negate ongoing effects.

Prognosticate, usable three times a day, allows the dragon to predict events up to 300 years in the future with a high degree of accuracy or grants it truesight for a short duration.

In reaction to damage, Prophesy Doom triggers when the dragon is bloodied. It can telepathically instill a sense of doom in a language-using attacker, compelling them to make a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the attacker learns they will face death due to some unforeseen circumstance within the next several hours.

The Ancient Sapphire Dragon possesses legendary actions that allow it to expand its tactical options:
- Foretell enables it to predict results of upcoming actions, influencing the outcome of dice rolls.
- Psionic Wave can be used as a legendary action for a powerful attack.
- Shatter Mind targets a creature and inflicts ongoing psychic damage with a high DC requirement to overcome.

This dragon is not just a brute but a cunning combatant that leverages its psychic abilities and foresight to dominate encounters and outmaneuver its enemies.
