The Apau Perape is a large fiend characterized by its chaotic evil nature. It possesses a robust melee attack profile and a suite of powerful magical abilities, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an AC of 16 and 95 hit points, it is quite durable. The creature excels with a strength score of 21, giving it a very good modifier of +5 for physical attacks, while its dexterity and constitution scores, both at 18 and 19 respectively, provide additional advantages in agility and resilience. However, the Apau Perape is vulnerable to cold damage and cannot withstand poison, despite its immunity to poisonous conditions. Its fanciful nature is further emphasized by its abilities which focus on area control and summoning, allowing it to manipulate combat conditions in its favor.

The Apau Perape has an armor class of 16, which translates to a good defense against most attacks. It has a total of 95 hit points, representing it as a moderately tough opponent, and it has a walking speed of 30 feet. With a challenge rating of 6, it is considered a suitable encounter for mid-level adventurers.

In terms of abilities, the Apau Perape's strength is exceptionally high at 21, granting it a +5 to melee attacks. Its dexterity of 18 provides a +4 modifier, contributing to its agility and stealth, making its dexterity saving throw effectiveness good. Its constitution of 19 gives it a +4 modifier, enabling strong resistance to effects that require a constitution saving throw. The intelligence score is average at 10, resulting in no modifier, while wisdom and charisma scores of 12 and 15 yield modest bonuses of +1 and +2, respectively.

For saving throws, the Apau Perape has a dexterity saving throw of +7, a very good constitution saving throw of +7, and an average wisdom saving throw of +4. It excels in stealth with a +7 modifier, suitable for ambush strategies, while intimidation and perception skills are at +5 and +4, respectively.

Among its resistances, the Apau Perape has damage resistances to fire and lightning, as well as to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks, which makes it tougher against physical confrontations. It is immune to the frightened and poisoned conditions. With darkvision reaching up to 120 feet, the Apau Perape can see in darkness effectively. Furthermore, it communicates in Abyssal and through telepathy over a range of 120 feet.

One of its notable special abilities, Diseased Ichor, triggers when the Apau Perape takes piercing or slashing damage, spraying caustic blood that forces nearby creatures to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail become poisoned with a disease that can reduce their hit point maximum. Each day that passes without a successful saving throw further diminishes their health until cured, potentially resulting in death if the hit point maximum drops to zero. This ability marks the Apau Perape as dangerous not only in direct combat but also in ongoing character interactions after the encounter.

Magic Resistance provides the Apau Perape with an advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it a resilient adversary in magical combat scenarios.

In combat, the Apau Perape can utilize Multiattack to deliver one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, ensuring it can deal damage effectively. Bite attacks have a +8 to hit and deal an average of 12 piercing damage, whereas its Claw attacks also have a +8 to hit and deal an average of 14 slashing damage, making it a solid threat in melee ranges.

Additionally, the Fiery Roar ability, which recharges on a six, unleashes a wave of flame in a 30-foot cone that forces creatures to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Failing this save results in a substantial 31 fire damage and instills the frightened condition until the affected creature’s next turn. Those who succeed take half damage and remain unfrightened, allowing for some tactical counterplay in combat scenarios.

Finally, once per day, the Apau Perape can use Summon Demon to call forth 1d4 apes that share its damage resistances and immunities. There’s also a chance (50%) to summon an additional Apau Perape, creating the potential for overwhelming numbers in battle. These summoned creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds and follow the commands of the Apau Perape, providing significant reinforcement for strategic combat advantages.
