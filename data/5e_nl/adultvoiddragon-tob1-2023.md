The Adult Void Dragon is a formidable and chaotic neutral creature that embodies chaos and the mysterious nature of the void. This massive dragon is characterized by its impressive armor class of 19 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 229, making it a tough opponent in combat scenarios. With a challenging rating of 16, it poses a considerable threat, rewarding those who defeat it with 15,000 experience points. The dragon's blend of physical prowess and powerful magical abilities allows it to command the battlefield with tactical strikes and area control. However, its weaknesses lie in its limited mobility when not airborne and its dependency on effective saving throws to mitigate damage. Notably, the void dragon also exhibits traits related to cold damage and madness, providing unique challenges for any adventurers who encounter it.

The Adult Void Dragon possesses an impressive set of attributes. Its Strength is 24, which translates to a very good modifier of +7, making its physical attacks particularly potent. Constitutional resilience is exceptional with a score of 25 and a +7 modifier, ensuring high survivability. With Intelligence at 16 (+3), Wisdom at 13 (+1), and Charisma at a remarkable 21 (+5), the dragon is not only a fearsome combatant but also possesses strong magical capabilities. Its Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), indicating limited agility. The dragon also has advantageous saving throws, particularly in Constitution (+12) and Charisma (+10), representing its robust defenses against various types of magic and attacks.

Among its special abilities, the Adult Void Dragon features the "Chill of the Void," allowing its cold damage to bypass resistance and providing a distinct advantage over opponents that might typically withstand such attacks. The "Expert Void Traveler" ability highlights the dragon's ability to traverse immense distances without the need for sustenance or rest. Additionally, its "Legendary Resistance" (3/Day) enables the dragon to negate failures on saving throws, allowing it to maintain its momentum and dominance in combat.

In terms of actions, the dragon's "Multiattack" ability allows it to initiate its "Aura of Madness" followed by a comprehensive physical assault, which includes one Bite attack, dealing an average of 28 damage, and two Claw attacks, each capable of dealing around 14 damage. The "Aura of Madness" forces nearby creatures to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw to avoid suffering from short-term madness for up to a minute, creating significant disruption in enemy ranks. 

The breath weapon options are exceptionally powerful; "Gravitic Breath" inflicts damage based on falling distance and restrains enemies in a designated area, while "Stellar Breath" unleashes devastating dual-type fire and radiant damage within a 60-foot cone, demanding a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw to mitigate damage.

The dragon's defensive capabilities are enhanced by the "Void Twist" reaction, enabling it to increase its AC in response to an incoming attack while potentially redirecting that blow to another target, demonstrating its ability to manipulate the battlefield and maintain its edge.

Finally, the Adult Void Dragon can also employ legendary actions, including "Detect" for perception checks, a "Tail Attack," or the more impactful "Void Slip," allowing it to reposition itself while inflicting cold damage on nearby creatures and knocking them prone. This blend of powerful abilities and tactical options makes the Adult Void Dragon an intimidating foe in any encounter.
