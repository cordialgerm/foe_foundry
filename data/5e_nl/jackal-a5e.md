The jackal is a small beast often found in various terrains, known for its keen senses and agility. With an armor class of 12, it has a relatively low defensive capacity, making it vulnerable to stronger attacks. It has a minimal hit point total of only 3, which means that it can be easily defeated in combat. The creature’s primary strengths lie in its dexterity and perception, allowing it to avoid attacks and detect threats effectively. However, its challenge rating of 0 indicates that it presents little challenge to experienced adventurers. The jackal is primarily a scavenger and opportunist, utilizing its keen senses to locate food and avoid danger rather than engaging in direct confrontation.

In terms of attributes, the jackal possesses 8 strength, which results in a very bad modifier of -1, meaning it is not strong enough to perform heavy physical tasks. Its dexterity is 14, resulting in a good modifier of +2, providing it with a decent ability to dodge attacks and execute nimble maneuvers. The jackal has an average constitution of 10, with no modifier, reflecting its standard resilience. Intelligence is extremely low at 2, giving it a very bad modifier of -4, highlighting its lack of problem-solving abilities. Wisdom is decent at 12, resulting in an average +1 modifier, allowing it to perceive its surroundings satisfactorily. Lastly, its charisma is notably low at 4, leading to a very bad modifier of -3, meaning it struggles to interact socially or influence other creatures.

The jackal has proficiency in the perception skill, giving it a +3 bonus due to its wisdom modifier. This allows it to notice threats or other creatures more easily, contributing to its survival. Its passive perception score of 13 reflects its attentive nature, making it difficult to sneak up on this creature without prior preparation.

One notable special ability of the jackal is its keen hearing and smell, which grants it advantage on perception checks that rely on these senses. This means that when rolling for perception related to hearing or smell, the jackal can roll two 20-sided dice and take the higher result, increasing its chances of success significantly.

In terms of actions, the jackal can perform a bite attack as a melee weapon attack. This attack has a +2 to hit, which is a good modifier, allowing it to effectively strike a target within 5 feet. When it successfully hits, it deals 1 piercing damage. This damage output is minimal, but it can be useful in certain scenarios, especially against non-armored or weakened creatures. 

Overall, while the jackal is not a formidable opponent, its keen senses and agility allow it to play a supportive role in its environment, often aiding in predation or defense through awareness rather than direct confrontation.
