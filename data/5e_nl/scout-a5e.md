The Scout is a Medium humanoid creature designed for stealth and reconnaissance. With its notable agility and keen senses, it excels in situations requiring stealthy movement and perception. Its strengths lie in high Dexterity and decent Constitution, allowing it to be nimble and somewhat resilient in combat. However, it lacks notable strength and charisma, making it less effective in direct confrontations or social interactions. The Scout's role often involves gathering information or ambushing foes, making it a valuable addition to any team that requires subtlety and strategy.

The Scout has an Armor Class of 15, which indicates a good defense against physical attacks, making it harder for opponents to successfully hit. With hit points totaling 19, derived from rolling 3d8 and adding 6, this creature has a relatively low health pool, marking it as somewhat fragile. The challenge rating of 1/2 indicates that the Scout is suitable for lower-level encounters, providing 100 experience points upon defeat.

The attribute scores for the Scout are as follows: Strength is 10, indicating average physical power; Dexterity is 16, which is very good and enhances its agility, impacting its armor class and attack rolls; Constitution is 14, which is good and improves its resilience; Intelligence is 10, which is average; Wisdom is 14, which is good and boosts its perceptiveness; and Charisma is 10, indicating average social influence. The Scout has a saving throw modifier of +5 for Dexterity, a very good reflex to avoid threats.

The Scout possesses several skills: it has a +2 modifier in nature, which is average for recalling information about the natural world; a +4 modifier in perception, which is good for noticing hidden dangers; a +5 modifier in stealth, allowing it to move unnoticed effectively, demonstrating exceptional skills in this area; and a +4 modifier in survival, again indicating good capability in wilderness scenarios. Its passive perception is 16, which can detect hidden creatures or traps fairly reliably. The Scout can communicate in any one chosen language.

A special ability of the Scout is Keen Hearing and Sight. This ability grants the Scout advantage on Perception checks related to hearing or sight, making it exceptional at detecting threats or subtle movements.

On a successful hit, it deals 6 piercing damage, calculated as 1d6 plus a 3 modifier.
