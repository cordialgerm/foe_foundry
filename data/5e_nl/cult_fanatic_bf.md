The Cult Fanatic is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the fervor of dark devotion in a twisted and dangerous way. Known for its resilience against mental manipulations and its ability to deal both fire and necrotic damage, the Cult Fanatic poses a significant threat on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 14, it is reasonably durable, while its 60 Hit Points allow it to withstand moderate damage before falling. The Cult Fanatic operates at Challenge Rating 2, making it a solid opponent for lower-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its ability to strike hard with both melee and ranged attacks, synergizing well with its spellcasting abilities. However, its weaknesses include relatively low physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, which constrain its effectiveness in melee combat beyond its special abilities.

The Cult Fanatic has the following ability scores: Strength of +0 (average), Dexterity of +2 (good), Constitution of +1 (average), Intelligence of +0 (average), Wisdom of +3 (very good), and Charisma of +3 (very good). The Dexterity allows for decent aptitude in ranged attacks and Stealth, while the high Wisdom and Charisma significantly enhance its spellcasting and the effectiveness of its social interactions and mental resilience.

The Cult Fanatic possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. **Dark Devotion** grants it resistance to being charmed or frightened, making it more challenging to disrupt its focus during encounters. **Unholy Weapons** allows the fanatic's attacks to deal an additional 2d6 damage of either fire or necrotic type, making each blow it lands significantly more damaging.

In terms of actions, the Cult Fanatic can execute a **Multiattack**, performing two attacks with either its **Sacrificial Dagger** or **Unholy Bolt**. The **Sacrificial Dagger** is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and deals 4 slashing damage plus an additional 7 damage from either fire or necrotic sources, totaling 11 under normal circumstances. It inflicts extra damage if the target is already incapacitated. The **Unholy Bolt** is a ranged spell attack that has a +5 to hit, dealing 10 damage of fire or necrotic type upon a successful hit.

As a spellcaster, the Cult Fanatic can use its Wisdom (spell save DC 13) to cast a variety of spells. It can cast **light** and **thaumaturgy** at will, providing utility and enhancing its performance in social situations. It has a limited number of powerful spells, casting **bane** and **command** three times per day each, and **hold** twice per day. The **bane** spell hinders enemies by imposing penalties on their attack rolls and ability checks, while **command** allows the fanatic to issue a one-word command that the target must attempt to follow. The **hold** spell can incapacitate a target if they fail a saving throw, making it a potent tool for controlling the battlefield.

As a bonus action, the fanatics can use **Unholy Brand** (recharge on a roll of 5-6), marking a target within 30 feet. If the target fails a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, they remain branded until the start of the fanatic's next turn, making them easier targets for attacks from fiends and cultists, enhancing the overall threat level of encounters involving the Cult Fanatic.
