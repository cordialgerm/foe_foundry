The Mummy Lord is a formidable undead creature with a medium size classification, embodying the horrors of ancient curses and necromancy. With an impressive Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 221, the Mummy Lord stands as a resilient adversary. Its challenge rating of 15 indicates that it is intended for high-level encounters, rewarding players with 13,000 experience points upon defeat. The creature excels in ranged and melee combat with abilities that cause severe status effects like the Mummy Rot curse, making it a significant threat in both combat and strategy. However, like many undead, it has its vulnerabilities, particularly to fire damage, which can cause it to ignite.

The Mummy Lord has the following ability scores: Strength at 18 (modifier +4, which is very good), Dexterity at 10 (modifier +0, which is average), Constitution at 18 (modifier +4, very good), Intelligence at 12 (modifier +1, which is average), Wisdom at 18 (modifier +4, very good), and Charisma at 16 (modifier +3, good). Its saving throws add to its durability, with strong bonuses in Constitution (+9), Intelligence (+6), Wisdom (+9), and Charisma (+8). It possesses skills in history (+6) and religion (+6), allowing it to engage knowledgeably about lore and divine matters.

In terms of damage resistance, the Mummy Lord is immune to necrotic and poison damage, as well as attacks from nonmagical weapons. Its condition immunities grant it protection from being charmed, fatigued, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned, making it a difficult target to incapacitate. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet, and it has a passive perception score of 14. The Mummy Lord can communicate in the languages it knew in life.

The Mummy Lord's special abilities enhance its lethality: 

1. **Curse: Mummy Rot** - When the Mummy Lord touches a creature, it imposes a curse that prevents the target from regaining hit points, while simultaneously decreasing their maximum hit points daily until the target's maximum reaches zero, at which point they die and crumble to dust. 
2. **Flammable** - After taking fire damage, it catches fire, suffering ongoing damage each turn until extinguished, which can be done by an action from any creature. 
3. **Legendary Resistance (1/Day)** - Once per day, if it fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead, though this causes its scarab amulet to shatter. 
4. **Magic Resistance** - The Mummy Lord has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it resistant to magical influences. 
5. **Rejuvenation** - If the Mummy Lordâ€™s heart remains intact after being destroyed, it can regenerate a new body in 1d4 days at a location near the heart.

As an 11th-level spellcaster, the Mummy Lord utilizes spells with a Wisdom-based spellcasting ability, featuring a spell save DC of 17 and a +9 modifier for spell attacks. It has an array of spells prepared that it can cast without needing material components:

- **Cantrips** (available at will): *guidance* (provides a bonus to ability checks) and *thaumaturgy* (allowing for minor magical effects).
- **1st-Level Spells** (4 slots): *create or destroy water* (manipulates water elements) and *detect magic* (senses magical auras).
- **2nd-Level Spells** (3 slots): *augury* (forecasts outcomes of actions) and *gentle repose* (preserves corpses against decay).
- **3rd-Level Spells** (3 slots): *animate dead* (raises undead creatures as allies) and *dispel magic* (ends magical effects).
- **4th-Level Spells** (3 slots): *divination* (reveals answers and predictions) and *guardian of faith* (summons a protective guardian).
- **5th-Level Spell** (2 slots): *contagion* (imposes debilitating diseases).
- **6th-Level Spell** (1 slot): *harm* (deals significant necrotic damage and reduces hit point maximum).

In combat, the Mummy Lord can deliver two actions through its **Multiattack** ability, utilizing **Dreadful Glare** to frighten an opponent before slamming them with a **Rotting Fist**. The **Dreadful Glare** requires the target to make a Wisdom saving throw; failure results in fright, and a critical fail leads to paralysis for a turn. The **Rotting Fist** attack combines bludgeoning and necrotic damage, with the potential to inflict the Mummy Rot curse if the target fails a Constitution saving throw.

The Mummy Lord can react to spells through **Blasphemous Counterspell**, causing attackers to possibly waste their spell if they fail a Constitution saving throw. It also has access to legendary actions, which include **Channel Negative Energy** (preventing healing in a radius), **Whirlwind of Sand** (allowing mobility without provoking attacks), and the ability to use **Dreadful Glare** or **Dispel Magic** at a significant cost of action economy.

With its broad array of damaging physical attacks, debilitating curses, and powerful spells, the Mummy Lord is a prime example of how ancient evils can persist in their wrath, making it a significant home for adventurers seeking both challenge and retribution.
