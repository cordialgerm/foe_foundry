The Catonoctrix is a formidable Large-sized Aberration that embodies the essence of neutral evil. With its impressive mobility, boasting a walking speed of 40 feet and the ability to fly at 80 feet, it can maneuver effectively in combat. It possesses a high Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, making it quite resilient against attacks. With 168 hit points, derived from a roll of 16d10 plus 80, it can endure substantial damage before falling in battle. The creature's challenge rating of 10 signifies that it is a challenging opponent, granting 5,900 experience points upon defeat. Characters facing the Catonoctrix need to be cautious of its strong physical and psychic attacks, while also being wary of its ability to extract secrets and manipulate minds.

The Catonoctrix has a Strength score of 21, which translates to a very good +5 modifier, enabling it to deliver powerful melee attacks. Its Dexterity and Constitution scores are average, sitting at 12 and 21 respectively, giving it good defensive capabilities. It possesses intelligence and charisma scores of 18 and 19, respectively, with modifiers of +4, which highlights its potency in mental and magical abilities. The saving throws are notable, with proficiency bonuses making it exceptional in Constitution (+9) and Charisma (+8), and good in Intelligence (+8). However, it has only average perceptive skills, with a +2 modifier to perception checks.

One of the creature's defining features is its psychic immunity, which protects it from mental attacks. It also has keen senses enhanced by darkvision up to 120 feet and truesight up to 30 feet, allowing it to perceive foes even in darkness and see through illusions. Furthermore, the Catonoctrix can communicate in Common, Draconic, Deep Speech, and through telepathy within a range of 120 feet.

The Catonoctrix employs several powerful abilities during combat. Its special ability, "Pierce the Veil," allows it to learn a secret from a stunned creature that it can see after using its "Mind Ravage" attack. The creature's multi-attack capability lets it make either one bite and two claws or three psychic bolts, providing versatility in its offensive strategies. The bite attack has a +9 to hit and deals significant damage, combining piercing damage of 18 (3d8+5) with additional 7 (2d6) psychic damage, while its claws deliver slashing damage of 15 (3d6+5). The ranged "Psychic Bolt" attack also has a +8 to hit, dealing 18 (4d6+4) psychic damage if successful.

A powerful feature of the Catonoctrix is "Mind Ravage," which, upon recharging, unleashes a devastating attack that deals 45 (10d8) psychic damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius. Additionally, affected creatures are stunned for one minute unless they succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw, providing a significant advantage in combat by incapacitating foes.

The creature's spellcasting ability further enhances its threat level, allowing it to perform psionic spells without the need for components. It can use "Detect Thoughts" at will, and once per day, it can cast spells such as "Confusion," "Scrying," and "Suggestion," all of which can disrupt opponents' plans and manipulate their actions.

Finally, the Catonoctrix can react to attacks with "Precognitive Dodge," which increases its AC by 4 against a single attack that it can see, providing it an additional defensive layer when under threat. This combination of mobility, combat prowess, mind manipulation, and damage immunity makes the Catonoctrix a versatile and dangerous adversary that adventurers must approach with caution.
