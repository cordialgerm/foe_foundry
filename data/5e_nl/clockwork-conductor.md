The Clockwork Conductor is a small construct known for its lawful neutral alignment and mechanical precision. This creature serves as a support figure on the battlefield, enhancing the abilities of its allies through its unique skills and special features. Its strengths lie in its ability to confer advantages to allies, both by providing bonuses to attacks and helping them resist magical effects. However, its physical capabilities are fairly limited, with low scores in strength and constitution, making it vulnerable in direct combat. The Clockwork Conductor is a handy ally for parties looking to maximize their efficiency in combat through strategic support from a distance.

The Clockwork Conductor has an armor class of 13, which is considered average, giving it a decent level of protection. With 28 hit points, derived from rolling eight six-sided dice (8d6), it has below-average durability for combat situations. Its movement speed is a standard 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver reasonably well on the battlefield. It is rated at a challenge rating of 1/2, corresponding to 100 experience points for its defeat.

The ability scores for the Clockwork Conductor highlight its strengths and weaknesses. It has a strength score of 7, which translates to a modifier of -2, making it very bad at physical attacks. Its dexterity score is 12 (+1), allowing it to perform actions that require agility at an average level. The constitution score of 10 (+0) shows that it has average resilience. It is intelligence deficient with a score of 9 (-1), indicating a very bad capacity for tasks requiring intellect. However, the conductor has a wisdom score of 12 (+1) and a charisma score of 16 (+3), which are good and exceptional respectively, allowing it to perform well in tasks related to perception and social interactions.

The Clockwork Conductor possesses several special abilities that enhance its role in combat. Its construct nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, which allows it to operate in various environments without the need for sustenance. The immutable form ability renders it immune to form-altering spells and effects, making it resilient against such magical influences. Its magic resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, further solidifying its role as a supportive ally. The metronomic aura creates a field around it, enhancing the performance of all friendly creatures within 20 feet. When such a creature makes an attack or a performance check, it can treat its d20 roll as a 10, significantly increasing the chances of success.

In terms of actions, the Clockwork Conductor can use its conductive baton with a melee weapon attack that has a +3 to hit. It has a range of 5 feet and deals 3 (1d4+1) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) lightning damage. The target of this attack cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn, effectively limiting its options during the following round. Additionally, the overclocked finale action can be utilized after a short or long rest; it enhances the abilities of all friendly creatures within 30 feet, providing them with a +5 bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and ability checks until the end of the conductor's next turn. This powerful ability comes with a risk, as failing a roll on a d6 may temporarily incapacitate the Clockwork Conductor’s other abilities.

For bonus actions, the Clockwork Conductor can employ concerted effort to inspire itself or a visible friendly creature within 30 feet until the start of its next turn. This grants the target the ability to add a d4 to either an attack roll or a constitution saving throw made to maintain concentration on a spell, thereby enhancing their effectiveness and survivability in combat.

In summary, the Clockwork Conductor excels in supporting its allies through enhanced attacks and magical resilience but is limited in direct combat prowess due to its low offensive capabilities. Its unique abilities make it an invaluable member of a party looking to optimize their collective strength.
