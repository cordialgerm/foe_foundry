The Trickster Priest excels in Wisdom and offers strong spellcasting capabilities, making it a versatile opponent or ally in various situations.

The Trickster Priest possesses several special abilities that enhance its gameplay. As a 5th level spellcaster, it has a spell save DC of 13 and can make spell attack rolls with a +5 bonus. The following cleric spells are prepared: 

- Cantrips (available at will): Sacred Flame, which deals radiant damage to a creature that fails its DC 13 Dexterity saving throw and ignores cover; Thaumaturgy, a versatile cantrip for minor magical effects; and Minor Illusion, allowing the creation of a sound or image to deceive others.
- 1st-level spells (four slots available): Ceremony, which can facilitate a variety of ceremonial preparations; Detect Evil and Good, used to sense aberrations, celestials, fiends, and more; Healing Word, allowing a creature to regain hit points as a bonus action; and Disguise Self, enabling the priest or another creature to appear as someone else.
- 2nd-level spells (three slots available): Lesser Restoration, which removes certain conditions from a creature; Invisibility, making the priest or a touched creature invisible for one hour; and Spirit Guardians, which summons spectral allies that protect the priest and damage foes in the area.
- 3rd-level spells (two slots available): Spirit Guardians (repeated here because it is a 3rd-level spell) and Major Image, which creates a detailed illusion that can significantly impact the battlefield.

In terms of actions, the Trickster Priest can attack with a Mace, wielding a +3 to hit, dealing an average of 4 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Additionally, when the mace hits, the priest can expend a spell slot to deal extra radiant damage, significantly increasing its damage output, particularly effective against vulnerable foes.
