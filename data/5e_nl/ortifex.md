The Ortifex is a Medium-sized undead creature known for its neutral evil alignment, making it a formidable adversary in any combat encounter. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it poses a substantial threat to lower-level parties, offering 1,100 XP upon defeat. It has an Armor Class of 12, which is average and can result in some hits getting through, but it compensates with a substantial pool of 78 hit points, representing good durability thanks to its natural armor. The Ortifex’s speed is unique as it cannot walk but can fly at a speed of 30 feet and hover, giving it excellent mobility in the air. However, its attributes show certain weaknesses; it has very poor intelligence and average dexterity, making it less effective in situations requiring cleverness or agility, though it boasts very good strength and good constitution, enhancing its melee combat capabilities. 

The Ortifex has the ability to resist poison and is immune to a variety of conditions including being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, poisoned, and prone. This makes it a difficult opponent to debilitate. It possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect nearby creatures while being blind beyond that range. Though it cannot speak, it understands the languages of its creator, making it possible for it to follow complex commands or instructions.

Among its special abilities, the "Blood Bearer" feature allows it to serve as a source of blood for nearby blood-sucking creatures, such as vampires, enabling them to drain its temporary hit points for healing. The "Blood Sense" ability enhances its tracking capabilities, allowing it to locate creatures within 60 feet that are not constructs or undead and sense their general direction from up to a mile away. The most notable is the "Hypnotic Heartbeat," where creatures within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed, rendering them incapacitated and drawn toward the Ortifex. This ability can be countered by plugging one’s ears but comes with the risk of becoming deafened in the process. 

In terms of actions, the Ortifex can deliver a melee attack with its slam action, making a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. The attack does 7 bludgeoning damage alongside an additional 7 necrotic damage, combining physical and magical assaults effectively. Its "Blood Siphon" attack, which can be used again after recharging, targets all creatures within 20 feet, requiring them to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail take an average of 14 necrotic damage while the Ortifex gains temporary hit points equal to the highest damage dealt. This ability synergizes well with its other powers, as it can build up temporary hit points while inflicting damage on multiple foes. Overall, the Ortifex presents itself as a powerful foe with a unique set of abilities that can control the battlefield and sustain itself in prolonged engagements.
