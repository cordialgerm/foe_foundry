The Hippogriff is a large monstrosity that serves as a formidable creature in the wild. With its impressive flying capabilities and powerful melee attacks, it acts as both a guardian and predator within its territory. Its strengths lie in its decent Armor Class of 12 and a moderate pool of hit points totalling 39, derived from rolling six ten-sided dice plus an additional six hit points. The creature's challenge rating of 1 makes it a manageable foe for low-level adventurers. Notably, its ability to fly at a speed of 60 feet allows it to engage in combat from the air, making it a versatile opponent despite its low intelligence and charisma scores.
