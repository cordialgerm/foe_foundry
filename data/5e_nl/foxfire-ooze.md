The Foxfire Ooze is a formidable ooze creature with unique mobility and combat abilities. It presents a significant challenge at Challenge Rating 10 and can absorb and deal considerable damage, especially with its special Lightning Storm ability. This creature is exceptionally durable, boasting high hit points and various immunities that make it resistant to many forms of damage. However, its low Armor Class makes it vulnerable to attacks if it can be engaged effectively. The ooze is particularly dangerous in close quarters, where it can surprise foes and unleash devastating attacks.

- Constitution: 20 (+5), which is exceptional, giving it a high amount of hit points and resilience in battle.
- Intelligence: 2 (-4), which is very bad; it is not capable of complex thought or strategy.

Special abilities of the Foxfire Ooze include:
- **Ambusher:** This ability provides the ooze with advantage on attack rolls against surprised creatures, making it a lethal threat when it can catch its opponents off guard.
- **Amorphous:** The ooze can move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without restriction, allowing it to navigate tight areas easily and possibly escape or reposition in combat.
- **Lightning Storm:** When a creature touches the ooze while wearing metal or attacks it with a metal weapon, that creature takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage, triggering a subsequent lightning storm that affects others within a 20-foot radius. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same lightning damage, making this ability a serious threat in melee encounters.
- **Spider Climb:** This ability allows the ooze to traverse difficult surfaces and ceilings without needing to check its abilities, granting it substantial maneuverability during combat.

In terms of actions during combat, the Foxfire Ooze can:
- **Multiattack:** It makes three pseudopod attacks during its turn, allowing it to threaten multiple foes or deal significant damage to a single target.
- **Pseudopod:** This melee weapon attack has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. Each hit does 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage and an additional 4 (1d8) lightning damage, making its attacks potentially lethal, especially when combined with lightning damage.
