The Song Angel is a powerful celestial creature embodying lawful good, standing large among its peers. It possesses notable strengths such as a high Charisma, which enhances its spellcasting and ability to support allies, as well as exceptional resistances to nonmagical attacks and certain conditions. With a solid Armor Class of 15 and a generous pool of hit points totaling 76, it can sustain itself in combat while also dealing substantial damage with its magical attacks. Moreover, its ability to cast spells innately and support allies with its special abilities makes it a formidable presence on the battlefield, although it is somewhat reliant on its saving throws and the efficacy of its spells, requiring careful positioning and planning.

The Song Angel has the following attributes: Strength of 12 with a modifier of +1 (average), Dexterity of 16 with a modifier of +3 (good), Constitution of 16 with a modifier of +3 (good), Intelligence of 18 with a modifier of +4 (very good), Wisdom of 18 with a modifier of +4 (very good), and Charisma of 21 with a modifier of +5 (exceptional). It excels in Wisdom saving throws, providing a +7 modifier, and Charisma saving throws, granting an +8 modifier. In skill checks, it has proficiency in Insight (+7) and Performance (+11), making it very effective in social and interpretative roles.

The Song Angel resists radiant damage and takes reduced damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks from nonmagical sources. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, or frightened. It possesses darkvision up to 120 feet and has a passive Perception of 14, offering it considerable awareness of its surroundings. This angelic creature can communicate in all languages and has telepathy up to 120 feet, allowing for silent, direct communication.

One of the Song Angelâ€™s special abilities is Angelic Weapons, which allows its weapon attacks to deal an extra 4d8 radiant damage, ensuring that its attacks are significantly more powerful than typical weapons. Its innate spellcasting relies on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 16. The angel can cast spells like "Alter Self," allowing it to change its physical form; "Calm Emotions," which suppresses strong emotions in a group; "Charm Person," which can turn an enemy into an ally temporarily; "Create Food and Water," providing sustenance; and "Detect Evil and Good," helping to identify malevolent creatures. It can cast "Enthrall," "Silence," and "Zone of Truth" three times a day each, which can greatly influence social encounters and control a battlefield. Once per day, it can invoke "Irresistible Dance," which compels a creature to dance, making it unable to act, and "Mass Cure Wounds," enabling it to heal allies simultaneously.

In combat, the Song Angel can attack with a Scimitar, using a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 10 slashing damage, augmented by an additional 18 radiant damage thanks to its Angelic Weapons trait. The Horn of Blasting ability, which recharges on rolls of 5-6, enables the angel to produce a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone, potentially deafening foes and dealing significant thunder damage while inflicting additional effects on fragile objects. The Horn of Spirits ability allows the angel to summon warrior spirits to aid it in battle, which can provide both tactical advantages and additional strength in numbers. The Change Shape ability grants the Song Angel versatility by allowing it to polymorph into a humanoid form of equal challenge rating, retaining its statistics and the ability to communicate, thus facilitating various social interactions or stealth scenarios.

As a reaction, the Song Angel can use Heavenly Inspiration to assist allies. If it sees a creature fail an ability check, saving throw, or miss an attack, it can sing a divine melody enabling the creature to reroll the check with advantage, enhancing the chances of success and supporting team dynamics effectively. This feature reinforces the Song Angel's role as a protector and supporter in any adventuring party.
