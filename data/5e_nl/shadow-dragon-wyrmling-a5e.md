The Shadow Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon that embodies traits of darkness and malevolence. It serves as a formidable adversary in combat, leveraging its speed, ability to fly, and powerful breath weapon to challenge adventurers. With an Armor Class of 16, it can take a decent amount of damage, sustained by its 52 hit points, which are notably average for its challenge rating of 3. This creature excels in stealth and deception, making it an effective ambusher, but has limitations against magical weaponry. Its connections to the essence of specific areas grant it unique abilities that can complicate encounters for players, especially in terms of long rests and environmental features.

The Shadow Dragon Wyrmling possesses the following attributes: 

- Strength: 14 (+2), which provides good capabilities for physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2), giving it a good initiative and improving its stealth.
- Constitution: 14 (+2), enhancing its durability with solid hit points.
- Intelligence: 10 (+0), signifying average cognitive abilities.

The creature's skills list includes deception at +4, insight at +2, nature at +2, perception at +2, and stealth at +4, showcasing its strengths in sneaky tactics and manipulation. It is immunized from necrotic and poison damage, meaning it cannot be harmed by these types, while showing resistance to common damage types such as acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder, plus any damage dealt by nonmagical attacks, providing a good level of survivability. It is also immune to a variety of conditions, including fatigue, being frightened, and being incapacitated, making it exceptionally resilient in combat.

The creature has impressive sensory abilities, including darkvision at 120 feet, enhancing its effectiveness in low-light environments. It understands Draconic, allowing communication with other creatures of its kind.

Special abilities:

- **Evil:** This dragon radiates an aura of evil, affecting nearby creatures and potentially influencing their actions or morale.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** This ability allows the dragon to move through creatures and objects. However, it incurs 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object, allowing it to bypass obstacles with good mobility but at a minor risk.
- **Essence Link:** The dragon is spiritually tied to a specific area, which restricts its benefits from long rests if it moves more than one mile away from that location. If this dragon perishes, the area loses its vital energy until a new essence dragon forms, a process that can take centuries. Creatures entering this area while it is drained may experience fatigue and strife that can only be alleviated by resting outside the area. This ability introduces a strategic component to encounters, impacting how players approach areas connected to this dragon.

For actions, the Shadow Dragon Wyrmling can perform the following:

- **Bite:** This melee attack allows the dragon to make a +4 to hit attack with a 5-foot reach, dealing 18 (3d10 + 2) piercing damage on a successful hit. This attack is very good for inflicting damage at close range.
  
- **Anguished Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The breath weapon launches a 15-foot cone of shadowy energy. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or suffer 22 (4d8) necrotic damage, taking half damage on a successful save. This ability, with a recharge mechanic, can turn the tide in battle, being especially devastating to unprepared foes. 

The combination of these attributes and abilities makes the Shadow Dragon Wyrmling a noteworthy encounter for adventurers, requiring careful strategy and coordination to overcome its challenges.
