The bat is a tiny beast often found in dark environments, serving primarily as a minor nuisance or a source of food for larger predators. Its small size and ability to fly make it agile, though it possesses low hit points and armor class, rendering it quite vulnerable in combat. A challenge rating of 0 indicates that it poses little threat to adventurers. Notably, the bat has enhanced perception capabilities, particularly through its keen sense of hearing. However, its lack of intelligence, wisdom, and charisma means it has no remarkable natural abilities beyond its physical attributes.

The bat has a low armor class of 11, which is considered average, making it easier for attackers to hit it in combat. With only 8 hit points, it is very vulnerable and can be easily defeated. Its movement speed is limited to 5 feet on the ground but improves significantly when flying, allowing it to travel up to 30 feet. The bat's ability scores reflect its physical attributes; it has a Strength of -4 (very bad), a Dexterity of +1 (average), and a Constitution of -1 (bad), indicating its frailty. Its Intelligence is also very low at -4 (very bad), while it has a Wisdom of +1 (average) and a Charisma of -3 (very bad).

In terms of senses, the bat has a special ability called echolocation, which allows it to navigate and perceive its surroundings using sound when not deafened. Its heightened hearing improves its perception score to 16 when relying on its sense of hearing, making it very good at detecting sounds in its environment.

In combat, the bat can use a bite attack as its primary action. This melee weapon attack has a +3 modifier to hit, which is considered good, given its low challenge rating. The bite has a reach of 5 feet and, upon a successful hit, inflicts 3 piercing damage, represented by rolling 1d4 plus 1. While the damage is low, the bat can contribute to combat encounters, especially when swarming targets or challenging lower-level characters.
