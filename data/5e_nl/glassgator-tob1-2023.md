The Glass Gator is a Large beast that embodies the perfect blend of agility and cunning in aquatic environments. With an Armor Class of 15, it possesses a reasonable level of defense due to its natural armor. Its Hit Points total 45, derived from rolling seven ten-sided dice and adding seven, making it fairly resilient for a challenge rating of 1, which awards 200 experience points to those who defeat it in combat. The Glass Gator's key strengths are its impressive speed of 50 feet on land and its amphibious nature, allowing it to thrive both in water and on land. However, it has a low Intelligence score of 4 and a Charisma score of 5, marking it as a creature with poor social skills and minimal cognitive ability. Its various abilities make it a formidable hunter that relies on stealth, concealment, and powerful physical attacks to overpower its targets.

The Glass Gator has the following attributes: Strength is 15 with a modifier of +2, which is considered good, allowing it to deal significant melee damage. Dexterity is 14, also with a +2 modifier, making its ability to dodge attacks above average. Constitution stands at 12 (+1), which translates to average durability. Intelligence is very low at 4 (-3), indicating that it will struggle with tasks requiring mental skill or understanding. Wisdom is average at 10 (+0), suggesting it has basic awareness of its environment. Charisma is also very low at 5 (-3), reflecting its ineffectiveness in social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Glass Gator has a Perception skill modifier of +2, indicating it has an average ability to notice its surroundings. It also boasts a Stealth modifier of +4, considering it very good in hiding, particularly due to its special ability called Transparent, which provides advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while underwater or in dim light. Its blindsight allows it to perceive its surroundings within a 60-foot radius, but it is blind beyond that range.

The Glass Gator has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Amphibious trait enables it to breathe air and water, providing versatility in various environments. The Constricting Lunge ability allows it to jump at least 10 feet straight toward a target; if it lands a Claw attack in conjunction, it can potentially knock the target prone with a DC 12 Strength saving throw. If successful, the gator can execute a Constrict attack as a bonus action against the prone target, increasing its threat level significantly. Additionally, its Standing Leap ability grants it a long jump of up to 15 feet and a high jump of up to 10 feet, making it a formidable opponent in both land and aquatic combat scenarios.

When it comes to Actions, the Glass Gator can use its Claw attack, with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully strikes a target, it deals an average 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage. Its Constrict action also has a +4 to hit, and if successful, it deals 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage, grazes the target, and imposes a grapple on it, which has an escape DC of 12. While grappled, the target is restrained and suffers an additional 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of its turns.

In terms of reactions, the Glass Gator can activate a Silt Cloud ability, which recharges after a short or long rest. When it takes damage while underwater, it can stir up a 10-foot-radius sphere of silt that heavily obscures the area for 1 minute, affecting visibility and potential maneuvers during combat. The gator can then swim up to half its speed, utilizing the temporary cover to reposition itself or evade further attacks.
