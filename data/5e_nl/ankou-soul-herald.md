The Ankou Soul Herald boasts several special abilities. Its *Aura of Necromancy’s Bane* prohibits necromancy spells from being cast within 120 feet, while forcing undead creatures that enter a 30-foot radius to make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in significant radiant damage, making the Ankou a deadly foe against such creatures. The *Cloak of Ghostly Shadows* ability allows it to become invisible in dim light or darkness, granting the Ankou several resistances and immunity to various conditions. This not only enhances its survivability but also allows the creature to phase through obstacles, showcasing its ghostly nature. 

In terms of actions, the Ankou can make three attacks as part of its *Multiattack*, including a powerful bite that deals both piercing and cold damage and two claws attacks that inflict slashing damage. Its *Horrifying Presence* ability forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw, potentially frightening them or paralyzing them upon failure. The *Reaper’s Breath* is a devastating line attack with a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, capable of imposing significant cold or radiant damage depending on the creature type, making it incredibly effective against both living and undead foes. Additionally, its *Change Shape* ability allows it to polymorph into various forms, providing versatility in combat and exploration. Lastly, the *Usher of Souls* ability enables the Ankou to transport itself and other creatures to different planes of existence, adding a layer of complexity to encounters.

For its legendary actions, the Ankou can use *Detect* to sense the location of living or undead creatures, a useful strategic advantage in combat. The *Tail Attack* action allows it to inflict damage without using its regular action, maintaining constant pressure on its opponents. Lastly, *Envelope in Shadow* lets the Ankou move stealthily and deal necrotic damage to foes it crosses, supplementing its already fearsome arsenal of tactics and enhancing its threat level in combat scenarios.
