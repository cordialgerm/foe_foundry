The Dwarf Angler is a medium humanoid creature with a neutral evil alignment that embodies a cunning and treacherous demeanor. This creature has a challenge rating of 4, allowing it to pose a significant threat to adventurers. With a total of 65 hit points, it has a solid foundation for sustaining damage in battle. One of its notable strengths is its ability to manipulate light, using it to charm and incapacitate foes, while also possessing decent physical capabilities. However, it has weaknesses in its lower Dexterity and Charisma scores, which can impact its agility and social interactions. The Dwarf Angler thrives in rocky underground terrains, utilizing camouflage to gain advantages in stealth, making it a formidable ambusher in its preferred environment.

The Dwarf Angler's attributes are as follows: Strength is 16, resulting in a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee attacks; Dexterity is 11, giving it an average modifier of +0, indicating standard agility; Constitution is 15, yielding a +2 modifier, which is good for overall health and resilience; Intelligence is 9, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, showing it is not intellectually adept; Wisdom stands at 14, providing a +2 modifier, which is good for perception and insight; and Charisma is 7, translating to a bad -2 modifier, indicating a lack of charm and influence.

The Dwarf Angler has a few notable abilities that enhance its combat efficiency. Underworld Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in rocky underground terrain, making it very effective at ambushing unsuspecting intruders. 

In terms of actions, the Dwarf Angler can execute a Multiattack which allows it to strike twice with its Bite attack or perform one Bite and use its Blazing Beacon ability. The Bite attack functions as a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and deals 17 piercing damage (calculated as 4d6 + 3) to a targeted enemy within 5 feet. 

The Alluring Light special ability causes an orb at the end of its lure to glow brightly. As a bonus action, the angler can extinguish this light. When this light is on, any creature that enters a space within 90 feet of the angler for the first time on a turn or begins its turn there must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the Dwarf Angler until the light is extinguished. While charmed, the creature is incapacitated and ignores the lights of other anglers, made to move toward the angler by the most direct route. Charmed creatures do not avoid opportunity attacks but must re-save if they take damage from sources other than the angler or when moving near hazardous terrain. Successful saving throws will end the effect and grant immunity to Alluring Light from all angler dwarves for the next 24 hours.

The Blazing Beacon ability allows the angler to summon a burst of bright light, causing 9 radiant damage (2d8) to all creatures within a 20-foot radius who are not angler dwarves. In addition, affected creatures become blinded until the end of their next turn unless they can succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, which halves the damage and avoids the blinding effect. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield by inflicting damage and impairing vision, allowing the angler and any allies to take advantage of disoriented foes.
