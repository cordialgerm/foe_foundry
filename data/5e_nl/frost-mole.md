The Frost Mole is a small beast that thrives in cold environments and is not aligned with any particular faction or entity. It is a creature adept at both burrowing and stealth, making it an effective ambusher in snowy terrain. With a good Armor Class of 14 and a significant pool of 71 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, making it a competent opponent for low-level adventurers. Its challenge rating of 3 indicates that it poses a moderate threat. While it is physically robust and has considerable stealth capabilities, it lacks intelligence and charisma, making it predictable in social situations. Notably, its abilities allow it to manipulate the terrain to its advantage, creating strategic opportunities in combat.

The Frost Mole has the following attributes: 

- Strength: 16 with a modifier of +3, which is considered good, allowing it to perform physical tasks effectively. 
- Dexterity: 15 with a modifier of +2, rated as average, providing decent agility but not remarkable speed. 
- Constitution: 16 with a modifier of +3, which is also good, contributing to its resilience and ability to withstand damage. 
- Intelligence: 3 with a modifier of -4, which is very bad, indicating limited capacity for cognitive processes. 
- Wisdom: 13 with a modifier of +1, rated as average, reflecting its basic perception and insight. 
- Charisma: 6 with a modifier of -2, considered bad, revealing a lack of social presence or influence.

In terms of skills, the Frost Mole has athletics at +5, which is good, indicating its ability to climb, jump, or swim effectively. Its stealth skill is at +4, rated as good, allowing it to hide successfully in various environments, particularly in snow. Its perception is at +3, also considered good, enabling it to notice subtle details in its surroundings.

The creature has resistances to cold damage, making it more durable in frigid encounters. Its senses include blindsight with a range of 60 feet, meaning it cannot perceive beyond this distance, but is aware of its nearby environment without using sight. With a passive perception of 13, it can notice hidden threats reasonably well.

Frost Moles possess several special abilities:

- Keen Smell grants the mole advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, making it particularly skilled at detecting creatures or things through scent.
- Snow Burrower allows it to burrow through nonmagical snow and ice, enhancing its mobility and the ability to traverse snowy landscapes.
- Snow Camouflage gives it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in snowy terrain, making it effectively invisible to potential threats.
- Snow Pit is an offensive ability that enables the Frost Mole to dig a pit under a creature if it moves at least 20 feet towards it. A target that is Medium or smaller must pass a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit and land prone, suffering damage from the fall. Larger targets must also succeed on the saving throw to avoid being restrained. This ability provides tactical advantages in combat, particularly when catching enemies off guard.

In combat, the Frost Mole can take one primary action:

- Claw: This is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. It has a reach of 5 feet and can strike one creature at a time. On a successful hit, the claw inflicts 8 slashing damage, calculated as 2d4 plus its Strength modifier.

Overall, the Frost Mole is a cunning creature that uses its environment to outmaneuver foes while posing a moderate physical threat in direct confrontations.
