The Steam Golem is a formidable large construct known for its powerful physical attacks and resistance to a wide range of damage types. With an Armor Class of 18 and a significant pool of 171 hit points, it possesses excellent defenses against physical threats. Its high Strength score of 26 grants it enhanced melee capabilities, making its attacks particularly damaging. However, it is vulnerable to water-based attacks that can extinguish its inner fire, causing it to become dormant. This unique characteristic requires opponents to strategize carefully to either exploit this weakness or to avoid direct confrontation with the creature. Overall, the Steam Golem is a challenging enemy with the potential to deal substantial damage while being resistant to many forms of attack.

The Steam Golem has the following attributes: Strength is 26 with a modifier of +8, making it exceptionally powerful in melee combat. Dexterity is 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average agility. Constitution is 18 with a +4 modifier, granting it very good resilience. Intelligence is 3 with a -4 modifier, indicating it is not very intelligent. Wisdom stands at 10 with a modifier of +0, showing average perception. Charisma is 1 with a -5 modifier, suggesting it is very bad at being charismatic or influencing others.

Regarding its special abilities, the Steam Golem's Boiler Weakness presents a critical gameplay factor. If it starts its turn in water or is drenched with at least 20 gallons of water, it may lose its steam pressure unless it succeeds on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On failure, its speed is halved, its Armor Class decreases by 2, and it must continuously make saving throws each turn to avoid becoming dormant. The ability to relight its internal fire is vital for its continued effectiveness in combat. The Construct Nature ability means the golem does not require sustenance or rest, allowing it to endlessly serve its purpose. Its Heated Weapons ability makes all of its attacks magical and adds extra fire damage (4d8) to its already substantial slashing damage. The Immutable Form ability provides immunity to effects that could alter its physical state, while Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against magical effects, making it a resilient foe.

In terms of actions, the Steam Golem can make two attacks during its turn with the Multiattack capability. The Axe Arm attack rolls with a +13 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 22 slashing damage plus an additional 18 fire damage upon a successful hit. Its Long Axe attack also rolls with a +13 to hit but has a reach of 10 feet, dealing 26 slashing damage and the same 18 fire damage, making it dangerous at a greater distance. The Steam Blast ability is a powerful area attack that can be used after recharging, releasing a blast of steam in a cone or cloud. Creatures within the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful save.

For reactions, the Whistle ability allows the Steam Golem to disrupt spellcasting. If it sees a creature casting a spell within 30 feet, it can emit a shriek from its steam whistles. The caster must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw to avoid their spell failing completely. This ability provides a tactical advantage against magic users, forcing them to pay attention to the golem's presence in combat scenarios.
