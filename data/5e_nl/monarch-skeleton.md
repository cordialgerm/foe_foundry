The Monarch Skeleton is a formidable undead creature with a neutral evil alignment. Serving as a tactical leader for other skeletons, it possesses strengths in combat through its high strength and constitution scores, as well as its ability to coordinate attacks with allies. With an armor class of 16 and a substantial pool of 142 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of punishment. The skeleton is particularly frightening due to its potent necrotic attacks, which can not only deal damage but also reduce the maximum hit points of its victims, making it a prime threat in battle. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage and has no offensive capabilities against magical attacks made with silver. Its challenge rating of 9 indicates that it can pose a significant challenge to a well-prepared party.

The Monarch Skeleton has a Strength score of 21, which provides a +5 modifier, making it very good at performing physical feats and melee attacks. Its Dexterity score of 14 grants a +2 modifier, offering it an average agility and ability to dodge attacks. With a Constitution score of 20, it gains an exceptional +5 modifier, resulting in high durability and hit points. Intelligence is an average score of 12 (+1), while Wisdom, at 14 (+2), allows it to succeed in wisdom saving throws. Its Charisma is low at 8 (-1), indicating that it is not adept in social interactions or magical effects requiring Charisma.

The Monarch Skeleton has a notable advantage with its saving throws; it has a +6 modifier to Wisdom saving throws, which is good, reflecting its resilience against mind-affecting effects. In terms of skills, it has damage immunities to necrotic and poison damage, making it resistant to various forms of attack. Additionally, it resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks unless they are made with silver. The creature is immune to multiple conditions, including being charmed, exhausted, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. Its darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 120 feet, which can be crucial during low-light encounters.

The Monarch Skeleton has several unique special abilities. The "Master Tactician" ability grants both the Monarch and nearby skeletons advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of their allies is engaged with that target and is not incapacitated, enhancing their coordinated attacks. "Sovereign's Command" lets it use a bonus action to command any skeleton within 30 feet to make a single attack against a target the Monarch has already attacked that round, effectively allowing it to increase their offensive output. Lastly, "Turning Defiance" gives the Monarch and nearby skeletons advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, reinforcing their presence on the battlefield.

In terms of actions, the Monarch Skeleton can execute a "Multiattack," making two separate attacks with its dreadblade weapon. The "Dreadblade" attack features a +9 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet and dealing 14 slashing damage accompanied by an additional 7 necrotic damage on a hit. If the target suffers from necrotic damage, they must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, or their maximum hit points will be decreased by the necrotic damage taken for the duration until they finish a long rest, potentially leading to devastating consequences if their maximum reaches zero. 

The "Grasp of the Grave" is a special attack that requires a recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. Any non-skeleton creature within 30 feet must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they become restrained by ghostly hands for one minute, suffering 10 necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. The restrained target can break free from the grasp by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check, allowing for strategic encounters where players must weigh their options to escape while simultaneously facing the continual danger of damage.
