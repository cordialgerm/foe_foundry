The Goblin is a small humanoid creature commonly found in various fantasy settings. It is often portrayed as a sneaky and cunning adversary, making it a favored choice for low-level encounters. With an Armor Class of 13 and 10 hit points, the Goblin has decent defensive capabilities for its challenge rating of 1/4, meaning it presents a minor threat to adventurers. Its most notable strengths lie in its agility, indicated by a Dexterity score of 12, which gives it a good ability to evade attacks and enhances its effectiveness in stealth. However, its physical strength is subpar, with a Strength score of 8 that results in a very bad modifier. The Goblin can use a variety of actions in combat, including melee and ranged attacks, and it benefits from its racial trait, Nimble Escape, allowing it to retreat or hide effectively in battle.

The Goblin has the following attributes: Strength 8 (very bad), Dexterity 12 (good), Constitution 10 (average), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 10 (average), and Charisma 10 (average). Its skill in Stealth is notable as it has a +3 modifier, which gives it a good chance to remain undetected by characters, influencing surprise attacks or strategic retreats. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, enhancing its effectiveness in nocturnal operations.

In combat, the Goblin can perform the following actions: 

- Shortsword: This is a melee weapon attack that has a +3 to hit, meaning it is fairly effective against less armored opponents. It has a reach of 5 feet and deals 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage on a hit, representing a decent threat in close-quarter encounters.

- Shortbow: As a ranged weapon attack, the Goblin can use this weapon with a +3 to hit, making it a good option for attacking from a distance. It has a range of 80 feet for normal range and 320 feet at disadvantage, still allowing it to effectively strike targets without engaging them in melee. Like the shortsword, it also deals 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage on a hit.

In addition to its actions, the Goblin has a useful bonus action called Nimble Escape. This ability allows the Goblin to take the Disengage or Hide action, which is particularly advantageous for evading stronger opponents or launching ambushes from the shadows. Overall, the Goblin is a nimble and tactically clever creature that excels at hit-and-run tactics and stealth, making it a valuable asset for any low-level encounter.
