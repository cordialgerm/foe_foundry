The Baleful Miasma is a medium elemental creature with a neutral evil alignment, embodying both stealth and danger through its poisonous presence. With an armor class of 13 and a total of 52 hit points, it poses a moderate challenge, particularly due to its unique ability to fly freely while its walk speed is reduced to zero. Its challenge rating is 2, making it an engaging encounter for adventurers who may underestimate its ability to manipulate space and deliver potent area-of-effect damage. The creature's strengths lie in its immunities to various conditions and damage types, particularly its complete immunity to poison damage, while maintaining a good defense against lightning and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attacks. However, its low intelligence, charisma, and modest wisdom indicate a lack of tactical awareness or social skills.

The Baleful Miasma has a Strength score of 13, granting it a modifier of +1, which is considered average. Its Dexterity is 17, leading to an exceptional +3 modifier, enhancing its evasiveness and acrobatic capabilities. With a Constitution score of 14, it receives a good +2 modifier, which supports its toughness. The creature has minimal intellectual and charismatic capabilities with scores of 6, resulting in bad -2 modifiers in both Intelligence and Charisma. Its Wisdom score is average at 11, imparting no modifier.

Among the creature's skills, it has a passive perception rate of 10, which is average in detecting threats. The Baleful Miasma has several damage immunities; it is immune to poison damage entirely and resistant to lightning damage and all nonmagical forms of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. Its condition immunities include exhaustion, being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious, giving it considerable resilience in combat situations. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and communicates in the Auran language.

One of the notable special abilities of the Baleful Miasma is its Air Form, which allows it to occupy a hostile creature's space, moving through extremely narrow areas without any obstruction. The Asphyxiate ability imposes a serious hazard for any creature that breathes air; if such a creature starts its turn within the Miasma's space, it must pass a Constitution saving throw against a difficulty of 12. Failing this save results in the creature suffocating as it inhales the poisonous miasma, a condition that lasts until the creature exits the Miasma's space or the Miasma is defeated. Furthermore, once the suffocation ends, the creature remains poisoned until the end of its next turn. The Elemental Nature ability signifies that the Baleful Miasma does not require air, food, water, or sleep, allowing it to remain active and threatening indefinitely.

In terms of actions, the Baleful Miasma is capable of executing a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Slam attacks in a single turn. Each Slam attack is a melee weapon attack that employs a +5 to hit, designed for a 5-foot range targeting a single opponent. Each successful Slam deals a base damage of 6 bludgeoning (1d6+3) and an additional 3 poison damage (1d6). 

The creature's reaction, known as Swift Advance, enables it to instantly adjust its position whenever a creature moves within the same space. The Baleful Miasma can move up to its speed, following the creature’s movement without provoking attacks of opportunity, as long as it ends its movement within or adjacent to the same space occupied by the creature. This ability allows the Miasma to maintain pressure on its targets and complicate tactical movement for its opponents.
