The cockatrice is a small, monstrous creature that possesses a blend of both aerial mobility and petrifying abilities. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it serves as a formidable enemy for low-level adventurers, potentially incapacitating them through its unique attack mechanics. The cockatrice is designed to be agile with a flying speed of 40 feet, enhancing its evasion capabilities. Its primary strength lies in its ability to restrain and potentially petrify opponents, making it a dangerous adversary. However, its armor class of 11 and relatively low hit points make it vulnerable to sustained attacks, requiring strategic caution from players.

The attributes of the cockatrice are as follows: it has a Strength of -2, which is very bad for melee combat; Dexterity of +1, indicating an average level of agility; Constitution of +1, providing average resilience; Intelligence of -4, which is very bad and shows it has low cunning; Wisdom of +1, reflecting average awareness; and Charisma of -3, indicating a very bad ability to interact socially. With darkvision extending to 60 feet, the cockatrice can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, although it cannot discern color in darkness. It has a perception score of 11 and a stealth score of 11, both deemed average, depicting its competency in hiding and locating threats. Notably, the cockatrice does not have any language skills.

The cockatrice possesses the special ability known as Monstrosity Resilience, granting resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, which allows it to endure challenging situations better than most creatures.

In combat, the cockatrice utilizes its action called Serrated Beak, a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, which is considered good for its level. The reach of this attack is 5 feet, and it can target one creature. On a hit, it inflicts 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage. Furthermore, if the target fails to succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, it becomes restrained as it starts to petrify. The target must then repeat this saving throw at the end of its next turn. Success means the effect ends, but failure results in petrification lasting for 24 hours, significantly impacting the target's capabilities in the game.

The cockatrice can also react with a special ability called Shrieking Crow. This ability triggers when an attacker within 30 feet of the cockatrice makes an attack against it. The cockatrice can emit a startling crow, forcing the attacker to make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. If the attacker fails, they suffer disadvantage on their attack roll, which can turn the tide during combat, allowing the cockatrice to evade deadly attacks more effectively.
