The Chaos Creeper is a Medium-sized chaotic neutral plant creature that epitomizes the unpredictable nature of chaos. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it poses a significant threat in combat, boasting a solid Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor and a substantial hit point total of 150. This creature is known for its magical fruit, which produces various effects when consumed or triggered, allowing it to influence the battlefield dynamically. While its Dexterity score of 18 (+4) enables it to act quickly and evade attacks, its average strength (13, +1) means it is not particularly adept in physical confrontations. The Chaos Creeper is immune to poison damage and conditions such as being blinded or poisoned, making it resilient in specific situations, but its reliance on chaotic effects may lead to inconsistencies in combat outcomes.

The creature's attributes comprise a Strength of 13 (+1), Dexterity of 18 (+4), Constitution of 16 (+3), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 17 (+3). The Dexterity modifier is particularly good, indicating high agility, critical for avoiding damage and making effective attacks. Its Constitution modifier is good, contributing to its hit points and making it more resilient. The Wisdom modifier is average, which means it has a decent perception, while Intelligence is average too, suggesting a lack of strategic thinking. Charisma, however, is very good, making it effective in interactions that rely on charm or presence, including its telepathy ability, which extends to 60 feet.

The Chaos Creeper has several special abilities that contribute to its chaotic nature. One of its notable abilities is the Pandemonium Fruit, which allows the creature to produce a magical pitcher-shaped fruit. When a creature picks this fruit, it activates the Wondrous Cornucopia, a set of chaotic effects determined by a dice roll. If the creature expends a spell slot of 3rd level or higher or sacrifices hit dice while picking the fruit, it can choose the effect rather than leave it to chance. The Wondrous Cornucopia has several potential outcomes: the Butterfly Cloud effect creates a heavily obscured area filled with butterflies, Restoration can heal conditions or reduce exhaustion, Poison Gas produces a damaging cloud that obscures vision, Healing restores health, Swarming Insects releases swarms of insects, and Squirrel Transformation temporarily changes the eater into a squirrel. Finally, Cleansing can remove curses and diseases from the eater.

In terms of actions, the Chaos Creeper can make a Multiattack, allowing it to either strike with three Vine Whip attacks or launch two Fruit Bombs. The Vine Whip attack uses a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, has a range of 10 feet, and deals an impressive 18 (4d6+4) bludgeoning damage on a hit. The Fruit Bomb attack is a ranged weapon attack, also with a +8 to hit, effective at ranges of 30 or 120 feet, dealing 31 (5d10+4) damage from one of five damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder, at the creeper's discretion. Alternatively, the Fruit Bomb can trigger the Wondrous Cornucopia effects as if the target had eaten the magical fruit, making it a versatile and strategic attack choice in combat scenarios.
