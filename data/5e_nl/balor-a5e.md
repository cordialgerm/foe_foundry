The Balor is a formidable and overwhelming creature that embodies chaos and destruction, classified as a Huge Fiend. With a substantial Armor Class of 19 and a massive total of 299 hit points, this creature is built to withstand heavy assaults and inflict devastating damage. Its Challenge Rating of 19 signifies its potency, presenting a significant threat to even experienced adventurers, and it grants 22,000 experience points upon defeat. The Balor's impressive physical and magical capabilities make it an exceptional adversary in combat. It possesses a mix of high attributes, particularly in Strength with a value of 26, which translates to a modifier of +8, representing exceptional effectiveness in physical confrontations. However, it has a few vulnerabilities, such as susceptibility to damage from nonmagical weapons and contingent to its fire and poison immunities.

In terms of attributes, the Balor's Strength (26) provides it with a very good modifier of +8, enabling it to excel in melee attacks. Its Dexterity (18) grants a good modifier of +4 for agility and reflex, while its Constitution (20) offers a very good +5, contributing to its resilience. The intelligence, wisdom, and charisma attributes, each rated at 20 (all with a +5 modifier), demonstrate its formidable presence both in intelligence and persuasive abilities. The Balor is skilled at intimidation (+12) and has a high perception (+11), making it difficult to deceive or surprise in any setting.

The Balor possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities and strategic options. Its aura of chaotic evil affects those nearby, creating an atmosphere of dread. Upon its death, it unleashes a catastrophic explosion known as Death Throes, affecting all creatures within 30 feet who must attempt a difficult DC 19 Dexterity saving throw to avoid or mitigate substantial fire damage (52 fire damage on a fail, half on success). The Fire Aura ability causes each creature within 10 feet at the start of the Balor's turn to take 10 fire damage, and any creature making melee attacks against it or touching it suffers the same fiery punishment. Magic Resistance grants advantage on saving throws against spells, making the Balor a challenging opponent against spellcasters.

For its actions, the Balor performs a Multiattack, employing both its Lightning Sword and Fire Whip to inflict massive damage in a single turn. The Lightning Sword attack, equipped with a +14 to hit, delivers a damaging strike of 21 slashing damage alongside 18 lightning damage, demonstrating lethal efficiency. Its Fire Whip extends to 45 feet and similarly employs a +14 to hit; it deals 18 slashing damage plus 14 fire damage and can pull the struck target up to 40 feet closer with a failed DC 19 Strength saving throw. Once per day, it can unleash the Whip Crack, a thunderous 90-foot cone attack inflicting potent area damage with both fire (28) and thunder (28) that may knock enemies prone on a failed DC 19 Constitution saving throw. Additionally, the Balor has a teleportation ability, allowing it to vanish and reappear within a 120-foot radius, making it highly mobile and difficult to pin down during combat.

In terms of reactions, after sustaining damage, the Balor can instinctively use Teleport, enhancing its survivability and strategic positioning in battle, ensuring it remains a constant threat throughout the encounter.
