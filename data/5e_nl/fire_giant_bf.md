The Fire Giant is a formidable foe, categorized as a Huge giant with a challenge rating of 9. It possesses a robust armor class of 18, bolstered by its plate armor, and boasts a high pool of hit points at 175, making it a resilient opponent in battle. The Fire Giant has strong physical attributes, particularly with a very good strength score of +7 and an exceptional constitution score of +10, indicating its high durability and offensive potential. With a decent dexterity score of +3, it also poses a moderate degree of agility. However, despite its strengths, the creature has a low intelligence score of +0, and its wisdom and charisma scores are average at +2 and +8, respectively. It has resistance to the stunned condition, which makes it less vulnerable to certain debilitating effects, while being prone to the prone condition—indicating that knocking it down could significantly hamper its effectiveness in combat.

The Fire Giant's ability to execute multiple attacks is one of its defining characteristics. Using its Multiattack action, it can perform two attacks per turn either with its Flaming Greatsword or throw a Lava Boulder. When attacking with the Flaming Greatsword, it rolls with a +11 to hit and can strike at a reach of 10 feet, dealing significant slashing damage of 28 (calculated as 6d6 + 7) along with additional fire damage of 4 (from 1d8). Alternatively, with the Lava Boulder, it can attack from a distance, rolling with a +7 to hit over ranges of 60 feet to 240 feet, delivering 19 bludgeoning damage (3d10 + 3) and a higher fire damage of 13 (3d8). Both attacks emphasize the Fire Giant's dual nature as a melee and ranged combatant.

Additionally, it can unleash its Volcanic Burst, an enhanced area-of-effect attack that requires creatures within 15 feet to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A failure results in substantial fire damage of 36 (8d8) and knocks the target prone, while success halves the damage without the prone effect. Notably, creatures that fail this save suffer disadvantage on their next saving throw against the giant's Pyroclastic Surge, which can create a further strategic advantage for the Fire Giant in subsequent turns.

As a bonus action, the Fire Giant can employ its Pyroclastic Surge, which sends a line of volcanic gas and rock fragments extending 60 feet in a 5-foot-wide line. Creatures caught in this line must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity save or become poisoned until the end of their next turn while also being pushed away from the giant. Those who fail the save by 5 or more become petrified in volcanic ash for a duration of one hour or until they are soaked in cool water by another creature. This ability adds an additional layer of tactical complexity to its combat style, allowing it to control battlefield positioning and debilitate multiple opponents at once.

Overall, the Fire Giant represents a powerful and imposing challenge, capable of delivering devastating damage while controlling the fight with strategic area-of-effect abilities.
