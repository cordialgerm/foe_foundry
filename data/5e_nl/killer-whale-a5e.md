The Killer Whale is a powerful and sizable creature that falls into the category of Huge Beasts, making it a formidable opponent in aquatic environments. Its strengths lie in its impressive grappling capabilities and its proficiency in swimming, allowing it to maneuver adeptly in water. With an Armor Class of 12, the Killer Whale has a moderate defense, but its significant hit point total of 75 provides a sturdy buffer against attacks. The creature possesses a good Strength score of 18, which enhances its melee combat effectiveness, while its Dexterity is average, resulting in a less impressive agility in combat. Although the Killer Whale's Intelligence and Charisma scores are very low, its Wisdom is decent which means it's perceptive to its surroundings, particularly through sound. However, its Challenge Rating of 3 indicates that while it is capable, it might not be an overwhelming threat in a diverse party of adventurers.

The attributes of the Killer Whale are as follows: it has a Strength score of 18, providing a modifier of +4, categorizing it as very good for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is 10, translating to a +0 modifier, which is considered average and reflects the creature's lack of agility. The Constitution score of 12 grants a +1 modifier; this is good, ensuring it can withstand physical hits relatively well. Intelligence is notably low at 3, giving it a -4 modifier, which is very bad, indicating it's not capable of complex thoughts or strategies. Wisdom scores well at 14, leading to a +2 modifier, which is good, showcasing its ability to perceive its environment effectively. Lastly, its Charisma score of 6 results in a -2 modifier, marking it as very bad in social interactions.

The Killer Whale has several noteworthy abilities that enhance its effectiveness in its environment. The special ability of Echolocation allows the whale to perceive its surroundings using sound, but it cannot rely on this ability if it is deafened. The Hold Breath ability is particularly advantageous, allowing the Killer Whale to stay submerged for up to 30 minutes, which can significantly extend its time hunting or exploring underwater. Additionally, its Keen Hearing grants the whale an advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing, allowing it to detect enemies and threats more reliably.

In terms of actions, the Killer Whale can perform a Bite attack, making a melee weapon attack that has a +6 to hit, which is considered good and reflects its strong physical capabilities. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and targets one creature, dealing an average of 14 piercing damage on a hit; this damage output is substantial in comparison to many creatures. If the Bite attack hits a creature, it grapples that target, requiring the target to succeed on an escape DC of 14 to break free. While grappling, the Killer Whale cannot bite another target, but it gains advantage on its bite attacks against the creature it is grappling, making it a highly effective predator underwater.
