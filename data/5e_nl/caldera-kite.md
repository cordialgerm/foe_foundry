The Caldera Kite is a large monstrosity that serves as a formidable adversary in combat, characterized by its ability to fly gracefully while emanating toxic effects around it. With an impressive Armor Class of 17 and 119 hit points, it is quite resilient and can inflict significant damage with its attacks. The creature’s strength lies in its exceptional mobility thanks to a flying speed of 60 feet and its ability to avoid opportunity attacks when it moves. It utilizes its poisonous haze to debilitate enemies while simultaneously constraining them through its probing attacks. However, its intelligence and charisma scores are very low, making it ineffective in strategies that require reasoning or social interactions. 

The Caldera Kite has the following attributes: Strength 18 (modifier +4, very good), Dexterity 19 (modifier +4, very good), Constitution 16 (modifier +3, good), Intelligence 3 (modifier -4, very bad), Wisdom 12 (modifier +1, average), and Charisma 4 (modifier -3, bad). It also has a skill in perception with a modifier of +1, which is average. 

It possesses immunities to acid, fire, and poison damage, as well as conditions like exhaustion and being poisoned. Its senses allow for a passive perception score of 14, and it does not communicate in any known language.

The Caldera Kite features several notable special abilities. Its Firesight enables it to see through smoke and fog created by fire without any penalty. The Flyby ability allows it to evade opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach, making it harder for opponents to retaliate. The Sulfuric Haze creates a toxic cloud within 10 feet of the kite. Any creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 7 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the end of its next turn unless they succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, which would halve the damage and negate the poisoned condition. A successful save also grants immunity to the Sulfuric Haze of all Caldera Kites for one minute.

When it comes to actions, the Caldera Kite can perform a Multiattack, making either two Wing attacks or one Wing attack combined with one Proboscis attack. The Proboscis attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, targeting a creature within 10 feet. It deals 11 piercing damage and can grapple the target if it is medium or smaller, imposing a DC of 17 to escape. While grappled, the creature is restrained, allowing the kite to automatically hit it with the Proboscis but preventing attacks on other targets. The Wings are another melee weapon attack that also has a +7 to hit and can strike from 5 feet away. This attack deals 11 slashing damage and 7 poison damage.

Additionally, the kite can use its Dust Cloud ability, which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6. When activated, it thrashes its body to release toxic gases, affecting every creature within a 20-foot radius. Each creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, suffering 28 poison damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success. Creatures that fail the save also can't speak and are considered to be suffocating until they move out of the vicinity of the Caldera Kite. 

Overall, the combination of mobility, poison effects, and grappling capabilities makes the Caldera Kite a challenging opponent that requires strategic planning to defeat.
