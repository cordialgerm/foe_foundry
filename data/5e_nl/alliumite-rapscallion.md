The Alliumite, referred to as the Rapscallion, is a small chaotic neutral plant creature noted for its cunningness and unique abilities, making it an intriguing opponent in combat. It possesses a decent Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, and with 38 hit points, it can sustain moderate damage before going down. The Rapscallion has a good Dexterity score of 18, granting it a +4 modifier, which enhances its mobility and evasiveness. It has a moderate Constitution score of 14, giving it an average resilience to physical damage, but its other attributes, particularly its high Charisma score of 18, reflect its ability to manipulate situations and affect its foes. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 2, making it a suitable encounter for lower-level adventurers, with its ability to blend into natural environments and utilize a mix of physical and emotional attacks to subdue its adversaries.

In terms of attributes, the Alliumite has a Strength of 6, resulting in a very bad modifier of -2, significantly limiting its physical attacks. Its Dexterity of 18 allows it to excel in stealth and agility, leading to good performance in evading attacks and navigating its environment. With a Constitution of 14, it enjoys a +2 modifier, which is average, allowing it to weather some damage. Its Intelligence is a low 9, translating to a bad modifier of -1, indicating limited problem-solving capability. The Wisdom of 12 provides an average +1 modifier, reflecting its modest perception abilities, while an exceptional Charisma of 18 enhances its natural charm and proficiency in social interactions.

The Rapscallion has skills in perception with a +1 modifier, and it has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, making it effective in dimly lit environments. Its passive perception is 13, indicating a reasonable ability to notice hidden creatures or objects. The creature can communicate in Common and Sylvan, giving it access to both general and nature-related conversations.

One of the Alliumite's special abilities is Plant Camouflage, allowing it to gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in areas rich with plant life, making it adept at hiding from potential threats. The Tearful Stench is another unsettling ability: when it takes damage, any creature other than another Alliumite within 5 feet must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn. If they succeed, they become immune to this effect from all Alliumites for one minute.

In combat, the Rapscallion can perform a Multiattack that consists of either two attacks with its Thorny Rapiers or one attack with a Thorny Rapier and another with its Grapplevine Whip. The Thorny Rapier is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 8 piercing damage plus an additional 3 slashing damage on a hit. The Grapplevine Whip also has a +6 to hit and can strike from a distance of 10 feet, dealing 9 slashing damage. Additionally, if the target is holding a weapon, they must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or drop their weapon, creating tactical advantages during combat.

The creature's reactions further enhance its combat effectiveness. The Grapplevine Escape allows the Rapscallion to swing up to 20 feet away from an attacker after being hit, provided there is a suitable terrain feature nearby. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, enabling it to reposition itself strategically. The Pungent Retort is a particularly insidious ability; when a creature within 60 feet starts its turn or casts a spell, the Rapscallion can unleash a barrage of insults, requiring the target to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they will sob uncontrollably until the start of the Rapscallion’s next turn, suffering from disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls, and must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to cast a spell, adding substantial pressure on spellcasters.

Overall, the Alliumite Rapscallion is a highly versatile creature that combines stealth, mobility, and psychological warfare, making it a formidable and entertaining adversary for adventurers encountering it in their quests.
