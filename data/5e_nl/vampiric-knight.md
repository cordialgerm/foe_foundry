The Vampiric Knight is a formidable Medium undead creature with a neutral evil alignment that serves as both an elite warrior and a potent spellcaster in combat. Its impressive armor class of 20, coupled with 127 hit points, makes it a robust foe that can withstand a significant amount of damage. With a Challenge Rating of 11, this creature poses a considerable threat, providing an intense challenge for adventurers. The vampiric knight's strengths include its high strength and constitution scores, exceptional regeneration ability, and powerful melee attacks, while its vulnerabilities—such as weaknesses to radiant damage, running water, and wooden stakes—require strategic combat consideration.

The Vampiric Knight has the following ability scores: Strength at 20, which provides a +5 modifier (very good), Dexterity at 14 with a +2 modifier (good), Constitution at 18 with a +4 modifier (very good), Intelligence at 13 with a +1 modifier (average), Wisdom at 17 with a +3 modifier (good), and Charisma at 14 with a +2 modifier (good). Its saving throws show impressive resilience, particularly in Dexterity (+6), Constitution (+8), and Wisdom (+7), allowing it to avoid various harmful effects effectively. 

In terms of skills, the creature excels in athletics with a +9 modifier (exceptional), meaning it can perform physical feats very successfully, and perception with a +7 modifier (good), making it adept at noticing hidden threats or opportunities. It possesses damage resistances to necrotic damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, which enhances its survivability in battle. The vampiric knight also has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 17, allowing it to see in darkness and be alert to its surroundings. It can communicate in the languages it knew in life, often including common or other regional languages.

The creature's special abilities heighten its danger in combat. Regeneration allows the vampiric knight to recover 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and is not in running water. This powerful trait can significantly prolong its presence in battle, although it is hampered by radiant damage or holy water, which disables this ability until the start of the knight's next turn. The vampiric knight also faces several classic vampire weaknesses, including the forbiddance that prevents it from entering residences without invitation, a harm from running water that deals 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in it, and the stake to the heart condition that paralyzes it when a wooden stake is driven into its heart while incapacitated in its resting place.

In combat, the Vampiric Knight can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks with its impaling longsword. When performing this melee attack, it has a +9 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, inflicting either 9 slashing damage or 10 slashing damage if wielded with two hands, in addition to 9 necrotic damage (2d8). If the target is Medium or smaller, it can grapple them, restraining the target and causing 9 necrotic damage at the beginning of each of their turns until the grapple ends, restricting their freedom and focusing the knight's attacks on one adversary.

In addition to its melee capabilities, the vampiric knight possesses a powerful ability called Channel Corruption. This ability has a recharge time of 5-6, requiring all living creatures within 20 feet to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 42 necrotic damage (12d6) on a failure, or half that on a successful save. This devastating area effect can drastically thin the ranks of its enemies, making the vampiric knight a dangerous adversary when surrounded.

Finally, as a reaction, the Vampiric Knight can use its Shield ability. This grants a +3 bonus to AC for an allied vampire when an attack is directed at them, provided the knight is within 5 feet. This reaction underscores the vampiric knight's role in protecting its allies and influencing the dynamic of combat in its favor. Overall, the Vampiric Knight is a challenging foe that requires careful coordination and strategy to overcome due to its various powerful attacks, regenerative capabilities, and unique vulnerabilities.
