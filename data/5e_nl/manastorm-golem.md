The Manastorm Golem is a formidable medium-sized construct that operates independently without alignment. It presents a challenge rating of 8, making it a significant adversary, especially for parties with lower levels. With an armor class of 14, it offers a decent level of protection, aided by its 90 hit points, which reflect its robust nature. The golem's ability to fly and walk at a speed of 60 feet allows it to maneuver effectively in combat scenarios. It is equipped with a variety of resistances and immunities that make it particularly resilient against numerous damage types and conditions, showcasing its strengths in magical combat. However, it suffers from low strength and charisma, which can limit its physical interactions and social engagements. 

The statistics of the Manastorm Golem are as follows: it has a Strength score of 6, giving it a very bad modifier of -2; a Dexterity of 14, resulting in a good modifier of +2; a Constitution of 14, also contributing a good modifier of +2; an Intelligence of 16, leading to a very good modifier of +3; a Wisdom of 8, which yields a bad modifier of -1; and a Charisma of 1, resulting in a very bad modifier of -5. It possesses skills that make it effective in magical encounters: it is immune to damage types such as acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and thunder, and it resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from magical weapons. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. With truesight extending to 120 feet and a passive perception of 9, the golem is highly aware of its surroundings, but it lacks the ability to speak, only understanding the languages of its creator.

The Manastorm Golem has several special abilities. It can pass through tight spaces, which demonstrates its Amorphous trait, allowing it to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. Its Limited Mutability ability means that any spell or effect that might change its physical form lasts only for a single round before it reverts to its original shape. Furthermore, it benefits from Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its durability in combat. Its weapon attacks are classified as magical, making them effective against creatures that are resistant or immune to non-magical attacks. Lastly, the Mystic Messages ability enables the golem to communicate telepathically with its creator within a range of 120 feet, allowing for strategic coordination in battle. However, this communication can be obstructed by materials like stone, magical silence, or lead.

In combat, the Manastorm Golem can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two slam attacks in one turn. When both attacks successfully hit a single target, that creature is stunned until the end of its next turn, significantly hindering its ability to act. Each slam attack is made with a +6 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 14 force damage on a successful hit. Additionally, the golem can unleash a Force Bolt as a ranged spell attack, which has a range of 120 feet. The Force Bolt attack also has a +6 to hit and deals a substantial average of 25 force damage if it connects with its target, further amplifying the golem's offensive capabilities. This combination of abilities and attacks makes the Manastorm Golem a versatile and dangerous opponent in any encounter.
