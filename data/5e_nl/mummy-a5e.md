The Mummy is a Medium undead creature that serves as an intimidating foe in D&D encounters, often found in ancient tombs or cursed places. It boasts a modest Armor Class of 11 and a respectable 67 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being defeated. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it is considered a formidable enemy, offering a challenge to parties composed of lower-level adventurers, rewarding them with 700 experience points upon its defeat. Mummies are known for their unique abilities, particularly the dreaded Mummy Rot curse, which can significantly weaken and potentially eliminate characters if they fail to evade its effects. While they possess average Dexterity and poor mobility—only capable of walking at 20 feet per round—they exhibit strength in their Constitution and Strength, giving them good durability in combat. However, they are significantly hindered by their very low Dexterity, making them vulnerable to ranged attacks and nimble opponents.

The Mummy's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength score of 16, which grants it a +3 modifier—this is considered a good bonus for making physical attacks. With a Dexterity score of 8, it has a -1 modifier, which is very bad, affecting its initiative and ranged attack rolls. Its Constitution score of 16 provides another good +3 modifier, enhancing its hit points and overall resilience. Intelligence and Wisdom are both average at a score of 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, and its Charisma is slightly above average with a score of 12, granting a +1 modifier that is useful for any Charisma-based interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Mummy is particularly resilient against Wisdom saves, with a +2 modifier, making its chances to withstand effects relying on this ability average. It has damage immunities to necrotic and poison damage, and it resists damage from nonmagical weapons, showcasing a good resilience against both physical and magical attacks. The Mummy is immune to a range of conditions including charm, fatigue, fright, paralysis, and poison, giving it exceptional durability against effects that would incapacitate or debilitate other creatures. Senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 10, allowing it to detect creatures within its range adequately. Mummies can communicate in the languages they knew in life, though their interaction is typically limited to combat scenarios.

Key special abilities of the Mummy include its Flammable trait, where it catches fire after taking fire damage and suffers ongoing damage if not extinguished. This introduces an interesting dynamic in combat where players can strategically use fire to weaken the Mummy further. The Mummy Rot curse is one of its most dangerous abilities; upon touching a target, it curses them, preventing any regained hit points and lowering their hit point maximum over time, which can ultimately lead to death if not removed by magic like Remove Curse.

When it comes to actions in combat, the Mummy can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to use its Dreadful Glare ability followed by a melee attack with its rotting fist. The Dreadful Glare can instill fear or even paralysis into a target within 60 feet, relying on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. Failure renders the target frightened, while a significant failure (by 5 or more) leads to paralysis, significantly hindering their ability to act in combat. A successful saving throw grants the target immunity to this frightening gaze for 24 hours. Lastly, its Rotting Fist is a melee weapon attack that applies excellent damage, dealing 10 bludgeoning damage alongside 10 necrotic damage, and placing anyone hit at risk of the Mummy Rot curse if they fail a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Overall, the Mummy can be a devastating adversary if players do not adequately prepare for its potent abilities and curses.
