The Firegeist is a small, neutral evil elemental creature that embodies the essence of fire, using its abilities to inflict fear and flame-based damage. With an Armor Class of 14 and 82 hit points, it falls into the challenge rating 2 category, presenting a moderate threat to adventurers. The Firegeist exhibits distinctive strengths such as high Dexterity and Wisdom, allowing it to be agile and perceptive, while being immune to fire and poison damage. However, it is weaker in terms of Strength and Intelligence, making it less effective in physical combat and problem-solving scenarios. Notable traits of the Firegeist include its ability to thrive in fiery environments, its sensitivity to magical light, and its vulnerability to water.

The Firegeist has the following attributes: Strength is 7 with a modifier of -2, which is considered very bad and limits its physical attacks. Dexterity is 18 with a modifier of +4, resulting in a very good capacity for agility and stealth. Constitution is 14, giving it a +2 modifier which is evaluated as average for endurance. Intelligence is low at 4, marked by a -3 modifier that is very bad, indicating poor cognitive abilities. Wisdom stands at 16 with a +3 modifier, which is good, enhancing its perception skills. Finally, Charisma is 6 with a -2 modifier, which is also very bad, indicating lack of social influence or magical capability.

Among the Firegeist’s special abilities, its Elemental Nature allows it to function without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep, thus making it highly resilient in hostile environments. It can hide effectively in fire or bright light, thanks to its Hide By Firelight ability, granting it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in those situations. However, the Magical Light Sensitivity ability causes the Firegeist to suffer disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks in the presence of magical light, which can hinder its effectiveness in lit areas. The Variable Illumination feature allows it to emit dim light in a range from 5 to 20 feet, which it can adjust as a bonus action, potentially revealing or obscuring it during skirmishes. Finally, its Water Susceptibility means that every 5 feet moved in water, or each gallon splashed, inflicts 1 cold damage upon it, making it cautious around water.

In terms of actions, the Firegeist can make a Burning Slam, a melee attack that has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 bludgeoning damage plus 7 fire damage on a hit. This attack can ignite flammable objects, and if it strikes a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid catching fire. Creatures that catch fire sustain additional fire damage until they take action to extinguish the flames. The Firegeist also possesses a frightening ability known as Burning Terror, which can be used to attack the mind of one creature within 30 feet. This attacks with a painful memory, requiring the target to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they take 14 fire damage and are frightened for 1 minute, taking further fire damage each turn while frightened. They can attempt to break free of this fear at the end of each of their turns by repeating the saving throw.
