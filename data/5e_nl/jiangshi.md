The Jiangshi is a Medium undead creature defined by its chaotic evil alignment. As a formidable opponent, it combines a durable physical presence with a range of special abilities that make it a dangerous adversary in combat. The Jiangshi has strong melee capabilities, can instill fear in its enemies, and possesses the ability to drain life. However, it has notable weaknesses, such as vulnerability to fire damage and a low speed of only 20 feet, which can limit its mobility and tactics during encounters.

The Jiangshi has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good and provides it with a decent defense against attacks. It possesses 117 hit points, which translates to an above-average resilience in battle. Its physical attributes showcase a strong strength score of 17 (+3), which allows it to deal significant damage and grapple opponents effectively. Its dexterity is average at 10 (+0), while its constitution is good at 14 (+2), enhancing its durability. However, its intelligence is very bad at 6 (-2), indicating a lack of mental capability. Its wisdom is average at 12 (+1), and charisma is good at 14 (+2), making it effective in interactions that require presence or fear.

The Jiangshi has several noteworthy skills, including athletics with a +6 modifier, which is very good and aids in physical feats, and perception with a +4 modifier, which is good for detecting enemies. In terms of damage vulnerabilities, it is vulnerable to fire, while it has immunities to poison damage, making it resistant to certain attacks. Additionally, it has resistances to necrotic damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, further bolstering its defenses. The creature is immune to conditions such as blindness, exhaustion, and being poisoned. Its senses include blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures without relying on sight—though this ability is negated if deafened. It understands any languages it spoke in life but cannot communicate verbally.

The Jiangshi's special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness significantly. With Blind Senses, the Jiangshi cannot use its blindsight if it is deafened, which can constrain its abilities in certain situations. Its Keen Hearing grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to auditory cues, making it more aware of its surroundings. The Prayer of Magic Resistance provides the Jiangshi with an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, though this trait can be removed if a creature succeeds in a DC 16 Strength check to rip the prayer scroll from it. The Standing Leap ability enables it to jump considerable distances, both horizontally and vertically, giving it excellent mobility despite its slow movement speed. The Terrifying Appearance ability allows it to frighten creatures within 30 feet unless they succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, introducing a fear factor in combat and potentially impacting enemy actions.

In terms of actions, the Jiangshi can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two claw attacks or use its Life Drain feature in place of one claw attack. The Claw attack has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage, which can also grapple a target if it is Medium or smaller. The Life Drain attack, which also has a +6 to hit, targets those that are grappled, incapacitated, or restrained, dealing an average of 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. It also forces the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; failing this means the target's hit point maximum is reduced by the necrotic damage taken until it finishes a long rest. Furthermore, if an opponent dies from Life Drain, it rises as a Jiangshi in 24 hours unless specific conditions negate this transformation.

Overall, the Jiangshi is a potent foe that can dominate the battlefield through its combination of fear, resilience, and life-draining attacks, making it a significant threat to any adventuring party.
