The Fleshdreg is a huge plant creature classified as neutral good, known for its resilience and regenerative abilities. With an impressive Armor Class of 15, this monster can withstand a fair amount of damage. It has a hefty pool of 115 hit points, providing a solid buffer in combat. The Fleshdreg excels in constitution, having a constitutional modifier of +5, which makes its saving throw against constitution checks exceptionally strong at +8. However, its dexterity is low, with a modifier of -2, making its reflexes and agility very bad. This creature plays a role as a defender and damage absorber in battles, utilizing its strong melee attacks and unique abilities to hinder and damage enemies while sustaining itself over prolonged encounters.

In terms of attributes, the Fleshdreg has a Strength score of 19, giving it a +4 modifier, which is very good for melee combat. Its Intelligence score of 13 results in a +1 modifier, marking it as average in terms of mental acuity, while its Wisdom score of 16 gives it a +3 modifier, which is good for perception and insight checks. Charisma is low at -2, indicating that it has a very bad ability to influence others socially. The creature possesses immunity to acid damage, resistance to fire damage, and is immune to the exhaustion and unconscious conditions, making it particularly tough to deal with on the battlefield. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and can communicate in Common, Deep Speech, and Sylvan.

The Fleshdreg's special ability, Regeneration, allows it to regain 5 hit points at the start of its turn as long as it has at least 1 hit point remaining. This regenerative power provides exceptional sustainability, but it is temporarily disabled for one turn if it uses its Disgorge Innards action.

In terms of actions, the Fleshdreg can make multiple attacks in its turn due to its Multiattack feature, allowing it to perform two slam attacks. Each slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, delivering an average of 14 bludgeoning damage per hit (3d6 + 4). Additionally, it can throw rocks with a reach of 60 feet for more ranged attacks, dealing an average of 20 bludgeoning damage (3d10 + 4).

The Disgorge Innards action is particularly powerful, needing a recharge of 6 rounds. It allows the Fleshdreg to unleash a 30-foot line of acidic sludge that is 5 feet wide, forcing each creature in that area to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that fail the save take an average of 18 acid damage (4d8), while successful saves reduce the damage by half. Moreover, failing creatures continue to suffer damage from the sludge, taking an additional 9 acid damage (2d8) at the end of their next turn unless they or an ally removes it, adding a layer of strategic importance to positioning and rescue in combat scenarios.
