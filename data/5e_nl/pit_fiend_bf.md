The Pit Fiend has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness:

Hostile creatures that start their turn within this area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw of DC 21 or be frightened until the start of their next turn. Friendly devils within this aura are immune to being charmed and frightened, and they gain an advantage on their first attack roll each turn, enhancing their offensive capabilities. 

- **Devilish Resilience:** The Pit Fiend possesses several resistances and immunities. It is resistant to cold damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to fire and poison damage, as well as the poisoned condition, making it very durable.

- **Flaming Weapons:** All weapon attacks made by the Pit Fiend are treated as magical. Moreover, when it successfully hits with a weapon attack, it deals an additional 4d6 fire damage, significantly increasing its offensive potential.

- **Magic Resistance:** The Pit Fiend has an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, allowing it to resist a wide range of magical attacks effectively.

In terms of combat actions, the Pit Fiend can execute a **Multiattack**, which allows it to deliver one Bite, one Gore, one Mace, and one Tail attack, or alternatively, it can perform four Hurl Flame attacks against a target. When using Hurl Flame, if two of these attacks hit the same creature, nearby foes within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw of DC 21, suffering 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful one.

- **Bite:** The Bite attack is a melee strike that involves +14 to hit, reaching 5 feet. It deals 22 piercing damage plus 14 fire damage and an additional 13 poison damage. A successful Constitution saving throw of DC 21 is required to avoid being poisoned, which prevents the target from regaining hit points until they succeed in a save at the end of their turns.

- **Gore:** This melee attack has a reach of 10 feet and also has a +14 to hit. It deals 17 piercing damage along with 14 fire damage.

- **Mace:** Similar to the Gore attack, the Mace can strike from 10 feet away with a +14 to hit. It inflicts 15 bludgeoning damage and adds 14 fire damage.

- **Hurl Flame:** The Pit Fiend can also use a ranged spell attack with +10 to hit and a range of 120 feet, inflicting 25 fire damage on a successful hit.
