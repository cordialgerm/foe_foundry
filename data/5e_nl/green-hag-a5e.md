The Green Hag is a Medium Fey creature renowned for its cunning and malevolent nature. It serves as a formidable opponent in encounters where trickery, manipulation, and fear are afoot. With a challenge rating of 3, the Green Hag possesses a solid mix of offensive capabilities and spellcasting, allowing it to control the battlefield and sway outcomes to its favor. Its strengths lie in its innate spellcasting, ability to deceive, and the potential to inflict debilitating curses on unsuspecting foes, while its weaknesses may include vulnerability to certain damage types and reliance on its spells to maintain an advantage.

The Green Hag has the following attributes: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, which is considered good for melee combat; Dexterity is 14 with a +2 modifier, average for dodging attacks; Constitution is also 14 with a +2 modifier, providing good endurance; Intelligence stands at 14 with a +2 modifier, average for knowledge-related tasks; Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier, average for perception checks; and Charisma is 16 with a +3 modifier, exceptional for spellcasting and social interactions. The hag has saving throw bonuses of +4 in Constitution and +4 in Wisdom. Its skills include arcana at +4, deception at +5, insight at +4, perception at +4, and stealth at +4, reflecting its varied capabilities and expertise in both combat and subterfuge. The Green Hag has darkvision up to 60 feet, granting it the ability to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, though only in shades of gray; its passive perception is 14, indicating a good awareness of its surroundings. It can communicate in Common, Draconic, and Sylvan.

Among its special abilities, the Green Hag has an Amphibious trait allowing it to breathe both air and water, giving it a unique edge in aquatic encounters. Its innate spellcasting ability, based on its Charisma (spell save DC 13), allows it to cast several spells without needing material components. The spells it can cast at will include dancing lights, disguise self, invisibility, and minor illusion, all of which enhance its capacity for mischief and deception. Additionally, once per day, it can cast geas, a spell that can compel obedience from an individual.

In combat, the Green Hag can make multiple attacks with its Multiattack feature, clawing at foes while simultaneously casting Hex. The Claws attack has a +5 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing an average of 12 slashing damage on a successful hit. Hex, initiated through a gaze at a target within 60 feet that is not already cursed, requires a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If the target is under an obligation to the hag, they automatically fail this save. A creature that fails the saving throw is cursed for 30 days, with the hex ending if the hag harms the target or cancels it as an action. The nature of the curse is determined by rolling a d4, resulting in different effects such as charming the target, frightening them, causing ill fortune that disrupts their activities, or putting them to sleep—a debilitating effect that makes them unconscious until they take damage or are awakened by another creature.

The ability to become invisible for up to an hour through its Invisibility spell, which requires concentration, further emphasizes the Green Hag’s deceptive tactics. The invisibility ends if it attacks, uses Hex, or casts another spell, making it a strategic choice for ambushes and escape. Overall, the Green Hag is a crafty cause of chaos in any encounter, using a blend of physical attacks, cunning spells, and debilitating hexes to turn the tide of battle in its favor.
