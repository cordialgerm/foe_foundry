The Assassin is a dangerous and highly skilled entity, categorized as a Medium humanoid with a challenge rating of 8. Known for its mastery in stealth and precision strikes, it possesses a formidable set of attributes that make it a significant threat in combat. With a high Dexterity score of +6, the Assassin excels in agile maneuvers and evasive actions, while its Intelligence of +4 allows for tactically advantageous decisions during engagements. It has a moderate Constitution of +2, granting it a decent pool of hit points totaling 157, making it resilient enough to withstand a few hits. The Assassin's primary strengths lie in its ability to deal massive combined damage through poisoned weapons, alongside exceptional stealth capabilities, making it a terrifying opponent in any encounter. However, its lack of strength and low saving throws against some effects could be seen as weaknesses.

The Assassin has an Armor Class of 15 due to studded leather armor, which provides an above-average level of protection. Its Speed is standard at 30 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. The creature's Perception score of 13 indicates a good awareness of its surroundings, while its Stealth score of 19 is exceptional, allowing it to remain undetected in most situations.

The Assassin's special abilities include Evasion, which allows it to avoid damage entirely from effects that would normally allow a Dexterity saving throw for half damage; this is an exceptional trait that significantly increases its survivability. Its Poisoned Weapons ability enhances its attacks, adding an extra 3d8 poison damage to each strike. Additionally, the Assassin can choose which poison to apply to its weapons at the start of its turn, providing strategic versatility in combat.

In terms of attacks, the Assassin can engage in a Multiattack, allowing it to make up to three attacks with either a Shortsword or a Hand Crossbow on its turn. The Shortsword attack has a +6 to hit and, upon a successful strike, deals a total of 19 damage comprised of 6 piercing and 13 poison damage, alongside a potential DC 14 Constitution saving throw for the target to avoid being poisoned for one minute. The same mechanics apply to the Hand Crossbow, which has a range of 30/120 feet.

As a bonus action, the Assassin can utilize its Hidden Step ability, which allows it to magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space, while also taking the Hide action. This ability enhances its stealth capabilities further, allowing it to reposition and remain elusive during encounters. Overall, the Assassin's combination of high mobility, stealth, and damage potential makes it a formidable opponent in any campaign.
