The hyena is a medium-sized beast known for its cunning and pack behavior, making it a formidable presence in the wild and in combat when working with its packmates. With a challenge rating of 0, its combat effectiveness is limited, yet it possesses unique abilities that can create advantages when multiple hyenas coordinate their actions. Notably, the hyena has good mobility with a speed of 50 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat. Its weaknesses include low hit points, only 8 in total, and poor armor class, which makes it vulnerable to attacks. Nevertheless, its strengths lie in its special abilities that enhance its combat capability when in groups.

The hyena has the following attributes: Strength and Dexterity are both at +0, which is average; Constitution is +1, representing a slightly above-average resilience; Intelligence, at -4, is very bad, indicating a lack of cunning compared to the average creature; Wisdom is +1, showing an average level of perception and insight; and Charisma is -3, which is very bad and reflects a lack of social presence. 

In terms of special abilities, the hyena possesses two notable ones. Firstly, the Cackling Chorus ability requires at least three hyenas to be within 30 feet of each other, allowing them to create a deafening noise that can potentially cause deafness to nearby creatures. Creatures beginning their turn within 10 feet of the hyenas must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid being deafened until the start of their next turn. The saving throw difficulty increases with the number of participating hyenas, making this ability very potent in groups. Secondly, the Pack Tactics ability provides the hyena with advantage on attack rolls against a creature if it has at least one ally within 5 feet of that creature who isn't incapacitated. This greatly improves its chances of hitting targets, as attacks made with advantage allow rolling two d20s and taking the higher result.

For its actions, the hyena can execute a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit. The reach of the bite is 5 feet, and if successful, it deals 3 piercing damage. 

Overall, while a solitary hyena may not pose a significant threat, when working in concert with others, they can utilize their special abilities and Pack Tactics to become a dangerous adversary despite their otherwise minor stats.
