The Thripper is a Medium humanoid with a chaotic neutral alignment, characterized by its cunning and agile nature. Possessing a notable armor class of 15 due to its natural armor, it significantly excels in Dexterity with a modifier of +4, making it very good at landing attacks and avoiding damage. With a healthy pool of hit points totaling 104, derived from rolling 16d8 and adding 32, the Thripper can withstand considerable punishment in battle, giving it a solid presence on the battlefield. It specializes in combat against fey creatures, leveraging its unique abilities and weaponry to gain the upper hand. However, it is vulnerable to cold damage and primarily resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. 

The Thripper has the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2, good), Dexterity is 19 (+4, very good), Constitution is 15 (+2, good), Intelligence is 11 (+0, average), Wisdom is 16 (+3, good), and Charisma is 9 (-1, bad). It boasts a skill in Perception, granting it a +3 modifier, which is important for noticing hidden threats or obscure details in its environment. The creature has truesight up to 60 feet, allowing it to see through illusions and the true forms of creatures, and it has a passive perception score of 16.

In terms of special abilities, the Thripper possesses Feybane Weapons, meaning its weapons are considered magical when used against fey. Any damage dealt to a fey is treated as force damage, a type that bypasses many resistances. The Frenzy Sense ability allows the Thripper to detect fey creatures within 60 feet by scent and sense the general direction of fey up to 1 mile away, giving it a tactical advantage in fey-dominated environments. Additionally, with its Soft Wings ability, it can fly up to 40 feet during its turn but must start and end on a solid surface; if flying at the end of its turn, it will fall and take fall damage.

Regarding actions in combat, the Thripper can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks using either Extractor Spear or Disorienting Chitter. The Extractor Spear is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, inflicting 13 piercing damage along with an additional 7 necrotic damage. Notably, the necrotic damage reduces the target's maximum hit points by half the amount taken until they finish a short or long rest, allowing the Thripper to regain hit points equal to this reduction. If this ability reduces the target's maximum hit points to 0, it results in the target's death. The Disorienting Chitter is a ranged spell attack that allows the Thripper to target an opponent within 60 feet. It has a +6 to hit, deals 16 thunder damage, and forces the target to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone due to disorientation.

In reaction to certain spells, the Thripper can use a Glamour Counter when it sees a creature casting an enchantment or illusion spell within 30 feet. This reaction functions like the counterspell ability but requires a +6 spellcasting ability check, making it a tactical option for interrupting enemy spellcasters.

Overall, the Thripper is a formidable foe, especially against fey enemies, leveraging its unique abilities, actions, and resistances to dominate in combat while remaining agile and dangerous.
