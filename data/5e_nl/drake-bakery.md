The Bakery Drake is a small dragon with a lawful neutral alignment, known for its unique abilities that blend culinary traits with combat prowess. It serves as both a quirky encounter in a D&D campaign and a resourceful ally for those who can appreciate its skills. With an Armor Class of 14, and a robust 82 hit points, this creature is relatively durable. It combines agility and strength, utilizing its fly speed of 60 feet for mobility, while its fire damage resistance and specific condition immunities make it a formidable opponent. However, its fire weakness can leave it vulnerable to fire-based attacks, with a Challenge Rating of 3 that signifies a moderate threat, being capable of dealing significant damage while also providing beneficial effects.

In terms of attributes, the Bakery Drake has a Strength score of 13, which translates to a modifier of +1, indicating average physical strength for a dragon. Its Dexterity is 16, granting it a +3 modifier which is good for evasion and attack accuracy. With a Constitution of 18 (+4), it exhibits very good resilience, contributing to its hit points. Intelligence, at 11 (+0), is average, while Wisdom at 14 (+2) reflects a good level of awareness. Its Charisma is strong at 17 (+3), making it effective in social interactions, particularly when using its skills.

The Bakery Drake's saving throws include a +5 modifier to Charisma saves, which is considered good, improving its chances of resisting magical effects that target charisma. Its perception skill score of +2 indicates average capability in detecting surroundings, supported by its keen sense of smell, which provides it with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

The creature has notable damage resistances to fire, which enhances its survivability against non-magical attacks, and it is immune to being paralyzed and unconscious, making it resilient to certain effects. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and it has a passive perception of 12.

The Bakery Drake's special abilities include a trait known as Fire Weakness, which hampers its combat effectiveness when exposed to fire. If it takes fire damage, it loses its ability to use its Yeast Slurry attack on its next turn and risks becoming poisoned for a limited duration if it fails a saving throw against fire-related spells or effects. The creature also has the Keen Smell ability, further enhancing its perceptive capabilities during encounters.

In combat, the Bakery Drake can utilize its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make one Bite and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 7 piercing damage, while the Claw attacks have the same attack bonus and deal an average of 6 slashing damage each.

One of its most interesting abilities is the Breath Weapon, which can be used every 5 to 6 turns. It can choose to exhale a Purifying Breath, which enhances the flavors of food and drink in a 15-foot cone while purifying it of poisons and diseases for one hour. Alternatively, it can use the Yeast Slurry attack, which expels a sticky substance over a 15-foot cone, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage and restraining affected creatures for one minute. Creatures caught in this attack can attempt to free themselves or others by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check, adding an element of strategy to combat and character interactions.
