The Death Dog is a medium monstrosity known for its formidable dual-headed appearance and its role as a threatening combatant. With an armor class of 12 and a decent amount of hit points totaling 32, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers. The creature excels in both agility and strength, sporting a Strength score of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 14 (+2), and Constitution of 14 (+2), which indicates it can hold its own in physical confrontations. Its dual heads grant it unique advantages in combat, making it a dangerous foe capable of inflicting disease on its victims. However, its Intelligence score is very low at 2 (-4), rendering it poor in cognitive tasks. Overall, the Death Dog possesses good offensive capabilities but can be vulnerable if not taken seriously.

The Death Dog has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 2 (-4, very bad), Wisdom 12 (+1, average), and Charisma 6 (-2, bad). Its offensive capabilities are bolstered by the ability to make multiple attacks per turn, while its dual heads enhance its sensory perception and protection against various debilitating conditions.

In terms of special abilities, the Death Dog possesses "Two Heads," which grants it advantage on Perception checks and on saving throws against effects like being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. Additionally, it cannot be flanked, making it a tougher opponent in tactical situations.

For actions, the Death Dog can use "Multiattack" to make two attacks with its bite in a single turn. The "Bite" attack utilizes a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. When it successfully bites a target, it inflicts 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage. Furthermore, upon hitting, the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failure to do so results in the target becoming infected with a disease, which has significant consequences: while infected, the victim is poisoned, and must make additional Constitution saving throws every 24 hours. A failure on these saves results in a reduction of the target’s hit point maximum by 5 (1d10), and should the maximum hit points drop to 0, the target dies.

In summary, the Death Dog is a potent adversary in combat with the ability to inflict debilitating conditions on its foes, requiring careful tactical consideration to confront effectively.
