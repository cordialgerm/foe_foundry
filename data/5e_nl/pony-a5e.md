The Pony is a Medium beast known for its charm and utility in various settings. With an Armor Class of 10 and 11 hit points, it is relatively easy to hit and can withstand a limited amount of damage in combat. Its speed of 40 feet allows it to maneuver quite effectively, making it adept at traveling short to moderate distances. However, its overall combat abilities are limited; it has low hit points and basic offensive capabilities. The Pony has a Challenge Rating of 1/8, denoting it as a creature that poses minor challenges to adventurers. While it lacks intelligence and charisma, its strength and constitution allow it to perform well in physical situations. Notably, it may serve as a companion or mount for players, enhancing the adventure experience.

The attributes of the Pony are as follows: 

- Strength (STR) is 14 with a modifier of +2, indicating a good physical capability for lifting and melee attacks. 
- Dexterity (DEX) is 10 with a modifier of +0, showing average agility and reflexes. 
- Constitution (CON) is 12 with a +1 modifier, revealing a slightly above-average resilience to physical distress. 
- Intelligence (INT) is 2 with a -4 modifier, demonstrating very poor cognitive abilities, making it incapable of complex thought. 
- Wisdom (WIS) is 10 with a +0 modifier, indicating average awareness and perception. 
- Charisma (CHA) is 6 with a -2 modifier, reflecting its very low social influence or appeal.

In terms of skills, the Pony does not exhibit any specialized proficiencies. Its senses include a passive Perception score of 10, suggesting average awareness of its surroundings. It cannot communicate in spoken languages, limiting its interaction to basic animal-like responses.

Regarding actions, the Pony can make a Hooves melee weapon attack. This attack has a +2 to hit, which is considered average; however, given the Pony’s Strength, it is capable of dealing 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. The attack’s reach is 5 feet, allowing it to target opponents directly in front of it, though it is not likely to be the primary source of damage in any encounter. Overall, the Pony is a modest creature with practical applications in gameplay as a supportive companion rather than a front-line combatant.
