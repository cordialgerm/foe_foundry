The Magma Octopus is a large elemental being that thrives in volcanic environments. With an impressive hit point total of 147 and a challenge rating of 8, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. Its natural armor grants it an Armor Class of 16, making it fairly difficult to hit. The Magma Octopus excels in close combat, utilizing its powerful tentacles, while also harnessing the elemental power of fire. It is immune to fire damage, rendering most fire-based attacks ineffective against it. However, its reliance on lava for survival can be considered a weakness, as it becomes vulnerable to cold damage when it is forced to spend too long outside of lava. Adventurers must be cautious of its ability to grapple multiple foes and the devastating area damage from its magma blast.

The Magma Octopus has the following attributes: Strength 21 (+5), Dexterity 17 (+3), Constitution 21 (+5), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 8 (-1), and Charisma 7 (-2). Its high Strength and Constitution scores make it exceptionally powerful in physical combat and resilient to damage, while its Dexterity provides it with good agility. Its Intelligence and Charisma scores are very bad, indicating a lack of mental prowess or charm.

In terms of skills, the Magma Octopus has a +8 modifier in Athletics, which is exceptional for grappling opponents, and a +6 in Stealth, which is good for allowing it to surprise unsuspecting adventurers. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, providing it with the ability to see in low-light conditions, and a passive Perception score of 9, which is average, allowing it to perceive threats that may not be immediately obvious.

The creature has two significant special abilities: Lava Bound and Lava Swimmer. The Lava Bound ability allows the Magma Octopus to exist outside of lava for up to one hour each day. If it remains outside for longer than one minute, it begins to dry out, reducing its speed and increasing its Armor Class to 18 while also making it vulnerable to cold damage. If it stays out for longer than an hour, it becomes petrified. The Lava Swimmer ability grants it a swimming speed of 60 feet when in lava, allowing it to move through this environment with great ease.

In terms of actions, the Magma Octopus uses its Multiattack to make up to four tentacle attacks in one turn. Each tentacle attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, has a reach of 15 feet, and deals 8 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 2 fire damage on a hit. If it hits a creature, that creature is grappled, needing to escape with a DC 16 check while also being restrained and taking fire damage until the grapple ends. Additionally, the Magma Octopus can unleash a powerful Magma Blast as an area attack. This ability has a recharge time of 6, spraying magma in a 30-foot cone and dealing 28 fire damage (8d6) on a failed Dexterity saving throw (DC 16), with half damage on a successful save. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it will catch fire and take ongoing fire damage until someone extinguishes the flames.

Overall, the Magma Octopus is a formidable opponent with high combat potential, especially when in its natural lava habitat. Players need to devise strategies to counteract its strengths while mitigating the dangers posed by both its tentacles and its fiery blasts.
