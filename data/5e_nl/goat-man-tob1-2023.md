The Goat-Man is a chaotic evil medium monstrosity that embodies a blend of ferocity and cunning. With strong physical attributes and agility, it excels in combat with a robust toolkit that allows it to deal substantial damage while maneuvering effectively around opponents. Notable for its ability to knock down foes and stun them, the Goat-Man is particularly dangerous when it can charge at its target, delivering extra damage and potentially incapacitating them. Its reliable defenses and condition immunities make it a formidable adversary, although it does have a weak mental capacity and can be susceptible to magical attacks that require mental fortitude.

The Goat-Man has an armor class of 14, which is considered good for a creature of its challenge rating, and it possesses 65 hit points, calculated as 10d8 plus 20, representing a solid endurance in battles. It has a walking speed of 40 feet, which allows it to quickly engage foes. The Goat-Man is rated as a challenge level of 3, offering 700 XP upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Goat-Man has the following statistics:
- Strength: 19 (+4) - Exceptional for melee combat and grappling.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2) - Good agility that supports its stealth and acrobatics.

- Intelligence: 10 (+0) - Average intelligence, not particularly clever.

The Goat-Man has a saving throw modifier of +4 for Dexterity, considered good for avoiding area attacks and similar effects, and possesses proficiencies in skills such as Acrobatics (+4), Athletics (+6), and Stealth (+6), indicating a very good ability to sneak and navigate physical challenges. It is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions, making it resilient against manipulation and intimidation effects. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light and darkness within a range of 60 feet, and it has a passive perception score of 11.

The Goat-Man understands common, giant, and trollkin languages but cannot speak, limiting its ability to communicate effectively.

The special ability known as Charge allows the Goat-Man to deliver devastating attacks when it moves swiftly towards a target. If it covers at least 20 feet in a straight line and strikes with a Slam attack, the target not only takes additional bludgeoning damage but must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, setting it up for further attacks.

Its action economy is quite potent, as it can make multiple attacks. The Multiattack ability allows it to make one Bite attack and two Slam attacks. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals 7 piercing damage (1d6 + 4). Each Slam attack also has a +6 to hit, dealing 8 bludgeoning damage (1d8 + 4). Notably, if both Slam attacks connect against the same target, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of its next turn, which can significantly shift the dynamics of a combat encounter.
