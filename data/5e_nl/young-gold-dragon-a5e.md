The Young Gold Dragon is a formidable creature known for its intelligence, charisma, and prowess in battle. As a large dragon of the gold variety, it exudes both strength and majesty. With an Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 157, it can withstand considerable damage. The dragon possesses high Strength and Constitution scores, rated at 22 and 20 respectively, allowing it to deal significant damage and maintain its health in combat. Its Charisma of 20 makes it not only a strong combatant but also a persuasive figure in social situations. With a Challenge Rating of 10, this dragon presents a serious threat to adventurers aiming to confront it.

The attributes of the Young Gold Dragon include Strength at 22 (+6 modifier, which is exceptional), Dexterity at 14 (+2, considered average), Constitution at 20 (+5, which is very good), Intelligence at 16 (+3, which is good), Wisdom at 12 (+1, average), and Charisma at 20 (+5, which is very good). The dragon's saving throws are strong, with bonuses of +6 in Dexterity, +9 in Constitution, +5 in Wisdom, and +9 in Charisma, all of which enhance its resilience against various effects.

This creature possesses several special abilities. The first is Valor, which grants allies within a 30-foot radius a +1 bonus to saving throws and renders them immune to being charmed or frightened, promoting greater longevity in battles. Additionally, its innate spellcasting allows it to cast spells relying on its Charisma, with a save DC of 17. The spells it can cast include Bless and Healing Word, both available three times per day without the need for material components. Bless can enhance the abilities of its allies, while Healing Word provides essential healing during combat.

In terms of actions, the Young Gold Dragon is capable of performing a Multiattack, where it strikes with its bite and claws. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and inflicts 22 piercing damage plus an additional 4 fire damage. The Claw attack also has a +10 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, causing 15 slashing damage. Finally, the dragon can utilize its Breath Weapons, which recharge every 5 to 6 turns. 

The Molten Breath is a powerful option where the dragon exhales molten gold in a cone that spans 30 feet, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 49 fire damage, or half as much on a successful save. The second option, Weakening Breath, has a different tactical use. It releases a gas in a 30-foot cone, forcing creatures to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Affected creatures suffer disadvantage on weapon attack rolls for one minute if they fail, but they can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to end the effect on a success. This ability can significantly weaken enemies during combat, allowing the dragon to dominate the battlefield.
