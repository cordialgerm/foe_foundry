The Crab is a tiny beast that resides in aquatic environments, possessing the capability to function both on land and underwater. It has a low challenge rating of 0, making it a non-threatening creature in the game world. While it has limited combat abilities and low hit points, it can offer a unique element in certain encounters due to its amphibious nature, allowing it to traverse land and water with ease. The Crab's physical attributes are quite poor, particularly its strength and intelligence, making it vulnerable in combat situations. However, it can still create minor challenges for inexperienced characters.

In terms of attributes, the Crab features the following statistics: Strength is 2 with a modifier of -4, which is very bad; Dexterity is 10 with a modifier of +0, considered average; Constitution is also 10 with a +0 modifier, also average; Intelligence is 1 with a modifier of -5, which is very bad; Wisdom is 8 with a modifier of -1, making it bad; and Charisma is 4 with a -3 modifier, classified as very bad. The Crab has an armor class of 12, which offers a fair amount of defense against low-level attacks. With just 2 hit points (1d4), it is easily defeated in combat and poses a minimal threat to adventurers.

The Crab's special ability is Amphibious, which allows it to breathe in both air and water, enabling it to survive in diverse environments. This ability enhances its mobility and adaptability, but it does not significantly impact its combat effectiveness.

In terms of actions available to the Crab, it has one primary attack: Claws. This melee weapon attack has a +2 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet targeting one creature. When it successfully hits, it deals 1 bludgeoning damage. However, if this damage would reduce a target of Small size or larger to 0 hit points, that target instead suffers no damage. This unique aspect helps mitigate the potential lethality of the Crab's attack, reinforcing its role as a non-threatening creature rather than a formidable opponent.
