The Jeholopterus is a small, aerial dinosaur that serves as a nimble and elusive threat in encounters. It boasts good flying speed, allowing it to engage targets from the air while minimizing the risk of retaliation due to its Flyby ability, which prevents it from provoking opportunity attacks. With a reasonable armor class of 14, the Jeholopterus can sustain a few hits but primarily relies on its agility and cleverness to evade danger. It has low hit points, making it fragile in direct combat; however, its ability to attach to creatures and drain blood can be strategically devastating, allowing it to sap the strength of foes over time. The creature possesses keen senses and can excel in roles that take advantage of its perception skills, even though its intelligence is notably low.

The Jeholopterus has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 10, which is average and suggests it is not particularly strong.
- Dexterity: 16, which is good, enhancing its agility and making it harder to hit.
- Constitution: 10, which is average and indicates no exceptional resilience.
- Intelligence: 2, which is very bad, revealing a complete lack of reasoning abilities.
- Wisdom: 12, which is average, suggesting some capability in awareness and perception.
- Charisma: 4, which is very bad, demonstrating an incapacity to engage in social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Jeholopterus has a +1 modifier to perception, considered average, and possesses a passive perception score of 13. It does not communicate in any language, making it a beast of instinct rather than intellect.

The Jeholopterus has two special abilities:
- Flyby: This ability allows the Jeholopterus to fly out of an enemy's reach without provoking opportunity attacks, making it highly mobile and difficult to pin down in combat.
- Keen Sight: This ability grants the Jeholopterus advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, allowing it to spot hidden creatures or hazards more effectively.

The actions available to the Jeholopterus include:
- Blood Drain: This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit and can affect creatures within a 5-foot range. On a successful hit, the Jeholopterus deals 8 (2d4+3) piercing damage. More importantly, once it attaches to its target, it does not attack again but instead drains 8 (2d4+3) hit points from the foe at the start of each of its turns. The Jeholopterus can detach itself easily, or it can be removed by the target or another creature succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check. This action can significantly weaken a foe if not dealt with quickly.
- Claw: This is another melee weapon attack, also with a +5 to hit and affecting creatures within 5 feet. It deals 7 (1d6+3) slashing damage if it hits. This attack provides a direct, albeit less impactful, means of inflicting damage compared to its blood-draining ability.

Overall, the Jeholopterus acts as a strategic creature, using its mobility and unique attack to drain the life from adversaries while staying out of harm's way.
