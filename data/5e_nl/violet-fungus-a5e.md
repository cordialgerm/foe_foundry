The Violet Fungus is a medium-sized plant creature that serves as an unsettling and hazardous presence in the environments it inhabits. With very low mobility, moving only 5 feet, it relies on stealth and deception to ambush unsuspecting creatures. The Violet Fungus has an Armor Class of 5, which makes it exceptionally vulnerable in combat, and its Hit Points stand at 18, calculated from 4d8. This creature has a low Challenge Rating of 1/4, which signifies that it is relatively weak compared to other monsters in the game, rewarding players with 50 experience points upon defeat. Its most notable characteristics include being able to blend in with its surroundings and inflict necrotic damage through its attacks, despite its poor physical attributes.

The Violet Fungus has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 1 (-5 modifier, very bad)
- Dexterity: 1 (-5 modifier, very bad)
- Constitution: 10 (+0 modifier, average)
- Intelligence: 1 (-5 modifier, very bad)
- Wisdom: 2 (-4 modifier, bad)
- Charisma: 1 (-5 modifier, very bad)

The creature possesses damage vulnerabilities to fire, which means it will take double damage from fire-based attacks. Additionally, it enjoys immunities to various conditions, including being blinded, charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, prone, restrained, and stunned, making it resilient to a range of debilitating effects that might affect other creatures.

In terms of senses, the Violet Fungus has blindsight with a range of 30 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on vision, but it is blind beyond this distance. Its passive Perception score is 6, indicating that it has average awareness of its immediate environment.

One special ability of the Violet Fungus is its False Appearance. When it remains motionless, it can perfectly mimic normal fungus, thus becoming indistinguishable from its environment. This makes it particularly effective at hiding until it decides to attack.

In terms of actions, the Violet Fungus can make a Multiattack, which allows it to execute a rotting touch attack against two different creatures during its turn. The rotting touch is a melee weapon attack that has a +2 to hit, with a reach of 15 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 5 points of necrotic damage, rolled as 1d10. This attack can pose a significant threat, especially if the creature targets multiple adventurers in one turn.
