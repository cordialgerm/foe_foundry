The Bloodsapper is a medium-sized aberration characterized by its chaotic evil nature, making it a vicious and cunning adversary. With a challenge rating of 3, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, presenting both physical and magical dangers. Its strengths lie in its capacity for mobility, with a walking speed of 40 feet and climbing speed of 20 feet, as well as its impressive hit points of 90, granting it good durability in combat. The creature excels in tracking wounded foes using its remarkable sense of blood. However, it has low intelligence and charisma, making it somewhat limited in magical interaction and strategy beyond its instincts. 

The Bloodsapper possesses a robust Armor Class of 14, derived from its natural armor, indicating a very good ability to avoid hits in combat. Its physical attributes include a Strength of 16 with a +3 modifier, which is considered good for melee attacks, and a Dexterity of 14, granting it a +2 modifier that is average. The Constitution also stands out at 16 with a +3 modifier, allowing strong saving throws and contributing to its hefty hit points. The creature's Wisdom is average at +1, while its low Intelligence and Charisma result in very bad modifiers of -3 and -2 respectively.

In terms of defensive capabilities, the Bloodsapper has a +5 modifier to Constitution saving throws, an effective measure against effects that could diminish its hit points. Its skills include Perception at +3 and Stealth at +4—also deemed good—which enhances its ability to ambush and track prey effectively, alongside a +3 modifier in Survival checks. The Bloodsapper has darkvision that allows it to see in the dark up to 60 feet and holds a passive perception score of 13.

One special ability, Blood Scent, enables the Bloodsapper to detect blood within a staggering range of 240 feet. It can discern the freshness and type of blood, which can aid it in hunting down weakened foes. The creature gains advantage on Wisdom checks related to Perception and Survival when tracking injured creatures.

The Bloodsapper has several actions it can take during combat. The Claw attack allows it to make a melee weapon attack at +5 to hit, reaching out to target foes within 5 feet. On a hit, this claw inflicts 6 slashing damage, contributing to its melee combat effectiveness.

The Draining Tongue attack permits the Bloodsapper to lash out at targets up to 15 feet away with a +5 to hit. On a successful connection, it deals 12 piercing damage and attaches itself to the target. Instead of further attacking, it drains life each turn, inflicting 12 hit points of damage until it has drained a total of 25 hp or the target dies. The target can attempt to detach the Bloodsapper’s tongue with a successful DC 14 Strength check, or the tongue can be severed by attacking it directly.

The Bloodsapper can also utilize its Bloody Breath ability, recharging after it has consumed at least 25 hp from a target. This powerful move allows it to exhale a 15-foot cone of corrosive gas and blood, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail suffer 14 (4d6) acid damage and become poisoned for a minute, while passing the save halves the damage and negates the poison. Notably, poisoned creatures can attempt to save again at the end of their turns to remove the effect.

In combat, the Bloodsapper’s mix of melee attacks and debilitating abilities makes it a formidable foe. Its capacity for draining health maintains pressure on opponents, while its tracking capability ensures it can capitalize on any weaknesses shown by its prey.
