The Half-Shadow Dragon Assassin has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Assassinate ability gives it advantage on attacks against creatures that have not yet acted in combat. When it hits, it can affect nearby opponents by rattling them until the end of its next turn. The Dangerous Poison ability allows the assassin to apply a potent poison, which causes an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage on successful attacks. The assassin comes equipped with three doses of this poison that can be used on melee weapons or ammunition. Evasion provides the assassin with exceptional mobility, allowing it to take no damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw against area effects. Finally, its Sneak Attack ability grants the assassin an extra 21 (6d6) damage once per turn when it has advantage or when its target is within 5 feet of an ally.

In terms of actions, the Half-Shadow Dragon Assassin has two main weapon attacks. Its Shortsword attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage on a hit. Its Hand Crossbow attack is a ranged option with the same +6 attack bonus and a range of 30 to 120 feet, inflicting the same damage as the Shortsword. The Anguished Breath is a unique ability that requires a recharge on rolls of 5 or 6; when used, it unleashes a cone of shadowy energy that forces creatures to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, targets take 22 (4d8) necrotic damage, and on a successful save, they take half damage.

For bonus actions, the assassin has access to Cunning Action, enabling it to quickly Dash, Disengage, Hide, or use an object. Additionally, it can perform a Rapid Attack with its shortsword, demonstrating its swiftness and lethal capability in combat.
