The Bilge Bosun Gremlin is a cunning and malevolent small fey creature known for creating chaos and misfortune wherever it goes. Its role in combat is primarily disruptive, utilizing its unique abilities to hinder the effectiveness of opponents and their equipment. With a challenge rating of 2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly due to its ability to affect nonmagical devices and its cunning multiattack capabilities. The gremlin has good Dexterity and Intelligence, which allow for nimble movements and clever strategies, but its average physical strength and wisdom make it weaker in direct confrontations. It excels in environments where moisture is present, and takes advantage of its amphibious nature to navigate both aquatic and terrestrial landscapes effectively.

The Bilge Bosun Gremlin has an Armor Class of 15, indicating it is somewhat difficult to hit but not excessively so, and has 60 hit points, giving it a moderate chance to withstand attacks before being defeated. Its speed includes a walking distance of 30 feet, a climbing speed of 20 feet, and a swimming speed of 30 feet, allowing for versatile movement options. The creature's attribute scores are as follows: Strength is at 10, which denotes a very bad modifier of +0; Dexterity is at 18, giving it a very good modifier of +4; Constitution is 14, allowing for a good modifier of +2; Intelligence is 14, providing a good modifier of +2; Wisdom is average at 11, leading to a +0 modifier; and Charisma is at 14 with a +2 modifier. 

In terms of special abilities, the Bilge Bosun Gremlin has several noteworthy features. Its Amphibious ability allows it to breathe both air and water, granting it excellent adaptability in different environments. The Aura of Mechanical Mishap is particularly menacing, as it creates a 20-foot radius around the gremlin where nonmagical objects with moving parts malfunction. If a creature uses such an object within this aura, the player must roll a d6 to determine if their weapon misfires or their object ceases to function, providing an exceptional tactical advantage by creating chaos among its foes' gear. A creature can spend its action to attempt to repair a malfunctioning object by succeeding on a DC 13 Intelligence check. Additionally, the Filth Dweller ability grants the gremlin immunity to disease, making it tough against biological threats.

In terms of combat actions, the Bilge Bosun Gremlin can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to bite once and make two attacks with its Makeshift Weapon. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 6 piercing damage plus an additional 5 poison damage, and requiring the target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid contracting the sewer plague disease. The Makeshift Weapon can be utilized either as a melee or ranged attack, also yielding a +6 to hit and inflicting 6 bludgeoning damage on a successful strike.

Overall, the Bilge Bosun Gremlin thrives on confusion and disruption, utilizing its abilities to render enemies ineffective while striking with its own attacks, making it a clever adversary in any encounter.
