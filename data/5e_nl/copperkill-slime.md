The Copperkill Slime is a formidable Huge ooze known for its resilience, high damage output, and unique mobility characteristics. With an Armor Class of 10 and a substantial 142 hit points, it presents a durable challenge for adventurers. This creature's Challenge Rating of 8 signifies that it can provide a significant encounter for characters of that level, yielding 3,900 experience points. While it possesses a strong Strength score of 18, enhancing its grappling ability, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are notably low, meaning it lacks advanced tactical thinking and social interaction capabilities. The Copperkill Slime can effectively immobilize opponents and deal substantial ongoing poison damage, but it is vulnerable to damage types that are not resisted, especially if struck by non-piercing or non-slashing attacks.

The attributes of the Copperkill Slime include a Strength score of 18, which grants a +4 modifier that is classified as good, making it effective in melee combat. It has a Dexterity score of 10 with a +0 modifier, which is average and reflects its lack of speed and agility. It has a Constitution score of 17, yielding a +3 modifier, classified as good, contributing to its impressive hit points and durability. Conversely, its Intelligence is a meager 4 (-3 modifier, very bad), its Wisdom is 8 (-1 modifier, bad), and its Charisma is 2 (-4, very bad), indicating it is incapable of complex thought and ineffective in social situations.

The Copperkill Slime is immune to acid and poison damage and resists piercing and slashing attacks, showcasing its adaptability to combat scenarios. Additionally, it is immune to several conditions, such as being blinded or prone, which allows it to maintain its threat level in combat. The creature has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, but it can be considered blind beyond that range. It has a passive perception score of 9, which might be considered low.

Its special abilities enhance its functionality in combat. The Amorphous ability allows the Copperkill Slime to move through tight spaces with ease, while its Ooze Nature means it does not require sleep, making it an ever-present threat. The Patinated Appearance allows it to blend in with the environment when motionless, making it difficult for characters to detect. Spider Climb also grants it the ability to traverse difficult surfaces and ceilings without any checks, making it a versatile opponent in various terrains.

In terms of actions, the Copperkill Slime can perform several powerful attacks. It can execute a multiattack using three Pseudopods. If it successfully hits with two Pseudopods against a single creature, that creature is grappled, with an escape DC of 15. While grappled, the target is restrained and suffers 9 (2d8) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. Each Pseudopod attack has a +7 to hit and deals 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage alongside the poison damage. 

One of its most potent abilities is the Poisonous Snap, which can be used when the slime is spread over an object. This attack allows the Copperkill Slime to collapse back to its normal form, spraying poison in a 10-foot radius. Creatures in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 15 or take 27 (6d8) poison damage, becoming coated in poisonous slime. Those coated also take an additional 9 (2d8) poison damage at the start of their turns unless they take an action to clean it off.

Lastly, the Copperkill Slime can use a bonus action to Stretch Body, allowing it to occupy the surface of a large object or structure. This versatility enables it to adapt its position strategically on the battlefield, placing it in prime locations to ambush unsuspecting adventurers.
