The Pech Stonemaster is a small elemental creature known for its neutral good alignment. This being is designed for both combat and utility, making it a valuable ally with unique abilities. With a strong Constitution score of 16, it can absorb damage effectively, and its impressive Strength of 18 allows it to deal considerable damage in melee combat. The Pech Stonemaster is uniquely adept at working with stone, drawing power from its environment. However, it suffers from light sensitivity, which can limit its effectiveness in brightly lit areas. With a challenge rating of 4, it can pose a substantial threat to lower-level adventurers but also has mechanisms to protect itself and its allies through innate spellcasting and special abilities.

The Pech Stonemaster has an Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, making it fairly difficult to hit in combat. It has 65 hit points, reflecting a good degree of durability on the battlefield. Its speed is 20 feet when walking and 10 feet when climbing, indicating its affinity for vertical movement but limiting its ability to dart around quickly. 

In terms of attributes, the Pech Stonemaster has a Strength of 18, granting a modifier of +4, which is very good for melee attacks. It has an average Dexterity of 11, with no modifier, making it neither agile nor clumsy. The Constitution score of 16 gives it a +3 modifier, meaning its ability to withstand blows is good. Intelligence sits at 11, representing average cognitive abilities with no modifier, while Wisdom is strong at 16, allowing for a +3 modifier. This translates to good perception and insight. Lastly, Charisma is average at 11, also without a modifier, implying limited influence in social interactions.

The Pech Stonemaster possesses several special abilities, most notably "One with the Stone." This ability can be activated as a bonus action after a short or long rest. While in contact with stone, it gains resistance to piercing and slashing damage until the end of its next turn, providing it significant protection in melee scenarios. 

Additionally, the creature has light sensitivity, which creates a disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks performed in bright light. This can hamper its effectiveness in well-lit encounters, making it more strategic for the Pech to operate in dim lighting or shadows.

In terms of innate spellcasting, the Pech Stonemaster can use its Wisdom as a Spellcasting Ability with a spell save DC of 13. It can cast the spell "Thunderwave" at will, which creates a wave of thunderous force that can push enemies away and deal damage in a 15-foot cube. This helps control the battlefield and disrupt enemy formations. Additionally, it can cast "Shatter" three times a day, which causes high damage in a 10-foot radius, affecting multiple foes and potentially shattering non-magical objects in the area. 

For its actions, the Pech Stonemaster can perform a multiattack, making two strikes against a targetâ€”one with its pick and one with its hammer. Each weapon has a +6 to hit, with the pick dealing 8 piercing damage and the hammer dealing 7 bludgeoning damage. Notably, if both attacks hit the same target, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the start of its next turn. This ability makes the Pech Stonemaster a formidable enemy when it can land both attacks in a single round, as stunning an opponent can significantly shift the dynamics of any combat encounter.
