The Zeitgeist is a medium humanoid creature with a chaotic neutral alignment. It serves as a swift and unpredictable foe on the battlefield, utilizing its unique ability to alternate between two forms: Darting and Sluggish. This versatility allows it to adapt to different combat scenarios, making it a formidable opponent. Its strengths lie in its high Dexterity and Constitution, granting it good mobility and resilience. However, it has a very low Charisma and an unremarkable Wisdom score, indicating that it may struggle in social encounters or against certain mental effects. With damage immunities to psychic damage and resistances that vary with its form, the Zeitgeist presents a unique challenge for adventurers.

The Zeitgeist has an Armor Class of 14, which increases to 16 while in Darting Form due to its agile constitution. It has 82 hit points, calculated from rolling 11d8 plus an additional 33 points from its Constitution modifier, making its durability average for its challenge rating. Its movement speed is 20 feet on foot, but this increases significantly to 40 feet while in Darting Form, allowing it to outmaneuver opponents effectively.

The Zeitgeist's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength of 17, giving it a good modifier of +3; Dexterity of 18, which offers an exceptional +4 modifier, enhancing its attack rolls and Armor Class; Constitution of 16 providing a good +3 modifier which strengthens its hit point total; Intelligence of 12 reflecting an average +1 modifier; Wisdom of 10 indicating an average modifier of +0; and Charisma of 6 resulting in a very bad -2 modifier, making it weak in social interactions.

The Zeitgeist has several notable special abilities. In Darting Escape, it can use the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each of its turns, greatly enhancing its mobility. The Timewarped Body ability dictates that at the beginning of each turn, the Zeitgeist rolls a die to determine its form. An even result brings it into Darting Form, increasing its Armor Class to 16 and speed to 40 feet, thus enhancing its agility and defense. An odd roll puts it into Sluggish Form, where it is more robust against physical attacks due to its resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, boosting its overall survivability in combat by providing a defensive advantage.

When it comes to actions, the Zeitgeist can perform a Multiattack that varies based on its form. In Darting Form, it makes three attacks with Darting Rend, which has a +7 to hit with a reach of 10 feet. Each successful hit deals 6 slashing damage plus an additional 7 force damage, making it a solid offensive choice. In its Sluggish Form, it makes two Slam attacks with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, resulting in 12 bludgeoning damage plus the same 7 force damage. Notably, if it scores a critical hit with a Slam, it can also knock the target prone, giving it a strategic advantage in combat.

The Tormented Scream is a special attack that can be used after a recharge of 5 to 6 turns. It emits a psychic scream in a 30-foot cone that forces creatures within the area to make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. Failure results in 21 psychic damage, while success halves the damage. This ability can significantly impact combat by inflicting area damage and potentially incapacitating foes who fail to save, showcasing the Zeitgeistâ€™s ability to manipulate the battlefield.

Finally, the Rewind reaction allows the Zeitgeist to negate damage it has taken or undo a condition afflicting it, including instances of being paralyzed or stunned. This powerful ability activates when it either takes damage or starts its turn under a condition, effectively allowing it to escape situations that could hinder its performance in combat, making the Zeitgeist a highly challenging enemy to face.
