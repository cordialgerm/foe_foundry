The Abominable Beauty is a powerful and sinister fey creature characterized by its mix of enchanting allure and deadly capabilities. As a Medium-sized being, it wields significant charisma, making it exceptional at manipulation and deception. With armor class 18, it is well-protected thanks to its natural armor, and it boasts a hefty pool of hit points at 187, giving it good durability in combat. The creature is classified as neutral evil, demonstrating its willingness to harm others for its gain. It exhibits high physical abilities with a strength of 17, dexterity of 18, and constitution of 18, all of which provide it with good combat capabilities and resilience. However, its intelligence, wisdom, and exceptional charisma scores of 17, 16, and 26 respectively further amplify its effectiveness in social interactions and spellcasting. The combination of its damage immunities and high saving throws in dexterity, constitution, and especially charisma makes it a formidable opponent who can entice and overwhelm foes with both beauty and power.

The Abominable Beauty has a challenge rating of 11, indicating that it presents a significant threat to parties of lower levels, as it can deal out substantial damage while being difficult to overcome. Its saving throws include a very good +8 modifier for Dexterity, good +8 for Constitution, and an exceptional +12 for Charisma, indicating that it excels in dodging attacks and resisting effects that require these attributes. The creature can perform a multiattack, allowing it to utilize its Blinding Gaze ability followed by two slam attacks in one turn. This makes it a potentially devastating opponent as it can both impair vision and deal damage in a single round.

The Abominable Beauty's primary melee attack is Slam, with a +8 to hit. This attack can reach 5 feet and deals average bludgeoning damage of 8 (1d8 + 4) along with a substantial 21 (6d6) fire damage, showcasing its capacity to inflict heavy damage. In addition, its special ability, Burning Touch, ensures that any melee attacks against it will deal 10 (3d6) fire damage to the attacker, further punishing close-range combatants.

The Blinding Gaze ability is particularly effective as it can incapacitate opponents; targets within 30 feet that meet its gaze must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute, with a chance to repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns. This can significantly reduce the threat level of opponents, allowing the Abominable Beauty to control the battlefield. If a target succeeds on the saving throw, they become immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.

Another fearsome ability, Deafening Voice, has a recharge mechanism, meaning it can be used every five to six rounds. When activated, each creature within 30 feet that can hear the beauty must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Upon failure, the creature suffers heavy thunder damage of 31 (9d6) and becomes deafened for an hour, which can potentially negate their ability to communicate or hear. Successful saves result in half damage and no deafening effect, but they also grant immunity for 24 hours against this ability.

In summary, the Abominable Beauty combines high charisma with wide-ranging offensive and defensive capabilities, making it an effective manipulator and lethal combatant. Its strategic use of blinding and deafening abilities allows it to control engagements while dealing considerable damage to those who dare to confront it.
