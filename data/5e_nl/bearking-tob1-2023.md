The Bear King is a formidable fey creature that embodies the power of nature with a regal presence. It serves as a guardian of the wild, capable of both brute strength and magical prowess. Known for its exceptional melee attacks enhanced by radiant damage, the Bear King can be a daunting opponent in combat. It has a high Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, which, combined with 133 hit points, allows it to withstand significant damage. The Bear King's prowess is further elevated by its resistance to cold damage and immunity to poison and nonmagical physical attacks, provided they are not made with cold iron weapons. Its most notable abilities grant it magical attacks, regeneration, and advantages in perception, making it an outstanding adversary that requires strategic planning to confront effectively.

The Bear King's attributes are robust, featuring a Strength score of 21, which translates to a +5 modifier, making physical attacks very effective. Its Constitution is 20 (+5), contributing to its high hit points and resilience. The creature possesses average Dex at 10 (+0), offering no particular advantages or shortcomings to agility-related tasks. Its Wisdom of 18 (+4) provides a good modifier, enhancing its perceptual capabilities. It also has a Charisma score of 16 (+3), which is above average, allowing it to be more commanding in social interactions. Conversely, its Intelligence of 12 (+1) is relatively low, indicating limited strategic thinking.

The Bear King's saving throws reflect its strengths: it has a +9 modifier on Strength checks, making it very good at resisting physical effects, a +4 on Dexterity saving throws, which is average, and an exceptional +8 on Wisdom saving throws. In terms of skills, it excels in Athletics (+9), Intimidation (+7), and Perception (+8), reinforcing its role as a powerful presence in both combat and social scenarios.

The Bear King has several special abilities that enhance its combat performance. Its ability, Honeyed Weapons, ensures that its weapon attacks count as magical and deal an additional 3d8 radiant damage, making its hits particularly devastating. The Keen Smell ability grants the Bear King advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on scent, aiding in tracking and awareness. With Legendary Resistance (3/Day), the Bear King can choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, making it more difficult to control in combat situations. Additionally, the Regeneration ability allows it to recover 10 hit points at the start of its turn while in its bear or hybrid forms, providing excellent sustainability.

In combat, the Bear King utilizes a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks or three Maul or Honey Bolt attacks. A successful Bite attack deals 10 piercing damage plus 13 radiant damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take additional radiant damage at the beginning of its turns due to the honey sticking to the wound. The Claw attack similarly deals damage with a total of 12 slashing damage and 13 radiant damage, while the Maul attack delivers bludgeoning damage with the same radiant damage bonus. Additionally, the Honey Bolt ranged attack can deal 22 radiant damage and has a range of 120 feet.

For bonus actions, the Bear King can change shape, transforming into a Large brown bear, a Large bear-humanoid hybrid, or reverting back to its true Fey form without losing its statistics. It can also utilize the Honey Toss action to restrain a target with magical honey, demanding a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to escape the sticky substance. The Frightful Roar, which consumes two actions, forces nearby hostile creatures to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened, potentially disrupting enemy strategies.

The Bear King can also take legendary actions, including moving without provoking opportunity attacks, tossing honey, or unleashing its frightful roar to maintain a tactical advantage during battle. These legendary actions allow the Bear King to remain active and threatening even outside its turn, cementing it as a challenging adversary in any encounter.
