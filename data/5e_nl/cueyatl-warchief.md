The Warchief possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat and survival capabilities. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe in both air and water. With its Insect Affinity, it can communicate basic ideas to insectoid creatures, effectively gaining their favor during interactions, while also receiving advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks related to these Beasts. The Jungle Camouflage ability grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in jungle terrain, facilitating its ability to ambush or evade enemies. A significant advantage comes from the Locked Saddle ability, safeguarding the Warchief from being knocked prone while mounted—this is complemented by the Mounted Warrior ability, which prevents its mount from being charmed or frightened. The Warchief’s Slippery ability allows it to escape grapples more easily, providing it with an advantage on saving throws and ability checks related to such situations. 

When it comes to combat, the Spirited Charge ability enables the Warchief to make a powerful attack when it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target while mounted. After hitting with a lance attack, it can command its mount to make an additional melee weapon attack against that target as a bonus action. The Standing Leap ability allows the Warchief to jump long distances, up to 20 feet horizontally and 10 feet vertically, further enhancing its mobility.

Its Javelin attack, which can be made either in melee or at range, also has a +7 to hit, dealing 7 piercing damage and the same 7 poison damage. 

When reacting to threats, the Warchief can utilize the Mounted Parry reaction. This ability allows it to add 3 to either its own Armor Class or that of its mount against a single melee attack that would hit, but it must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon at the time of the reaction. This showcases its tactical prowess and ability to protect its mount during combat scenarios.
