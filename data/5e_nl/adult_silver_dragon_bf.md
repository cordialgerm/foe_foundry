The Adult Silver Dragon is a massive and powerful creature, embodying both elegance and ferocity typical of its kind. With a challenge rating of 16, it presents a considerable threat to any adventurers who confront it. This dragon boasts formidable defenses, including a high Armor Class of 19 and an impressive pool of Hit Points totaling 267. It possesses exceptional physical and magical capabilities, making it a versatile opponent in combat. Its strengths lie in its ability to deal devastating damage with powerful attacks and its access to potent spells and abilities that can control the battlefield. While it is a fierce combatant, its challenges come from its reliance on powerful actions and the need to recharge certain abilities, which can limit its options in prolonged engagements.

The Adult Silver Dragon has the following attributes: Strength +8 (very good), Dexterity +5 (good), Constitution +12 (exceptional), Intelligence +3 (average), Wisdom +7 (very good), and Charisma +9 (exceptional). Its keen senses are represented by darkvision that extends to 120 feet and a keensense ability that allows it to enhance its perception up to 60 feet. Additionally, it has a Perception score of 22 (very good) and a Stealth score of 15 (average). The dragon can communicate using Common and Draconic languages.

Among its formidable capabilities is the Freezing Fog ability, which creates a chilling mist that affects creatures within a 20-foot radius of the dragon, requiring them to succeed on a DC 20 saving throw. The dragon also benefits from Legendary Resistance, allowing it to opt for a success on a failed save three times per day.

In combat, the Adult Silver Dragon makes use of its Multiattack action, which permits it to unleash its Frightful Presence to instill fear in its foes, followed by a bite attack and two claw attacks. It can substitute its bite with a Paralyzing Breath if it has that ability available. The Bite attack has a +13 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 19 piercing damage on a hit. Each Claw attack also has a +13 to hit, a 5-foot reach, and inflicts 15 slashing damage. The Tail attack, with the same +13 to hit and a 15-foot reach, deals 17 bludgeoning damage.

The Frightful Presence ability targets creatures within 120 feet of the dragon, compelling them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. Affected creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to end the effect, but if they succeed, they become immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. The Cold Breath ability (Recharge 5–6) allows the dragon to unleash a powerful icy blast in a 60-foot cone, forcing creatures in the area to make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, suffering 58 cold damage on a failure or half that on a success. The Paralyzing Breath ability, which recharges on a 6, functions similarly but also requires a DC 20 saving throw.

As a bonus action, the Adult Silver Dragon can Change Shape, transforming into a Beast or Humanoid with a challenge rating no higher than its own. In this form, it retains its Legendary Resistance, Hit Points, ability to speak, proficiencies, and mental abilities, while adopting the statistics and capabilities of the new form.

The dragon also possesses legendary actions, allowing it to take three actions at the end of others' turns. It can use Detect to pinpoint nearby creatures and traps, make a Tail attack, or, at the cost of two actions, execute an Elemental Roar that makes targets vulnerable to cold damage. Alternatively, it can perform a Wing Attack, which deals damage to creatures nearby and allows the dragon to fly away without provoking opportunity attacks.

In the event of the dragon's death, regional effects will dissipate over the course of 1d10 days.
