The Bonepowder Ghoul is a menacing undead creature, classified as small and possessing a neutral evil alignment. Its formidable role in combat is reinforced by a strong mix of physical and magical abilities, allowing it to inflict both direct damage and debilitating effects on its targets. With a high armor class of 18, robust hit points totaling 180, and impressive dexterity and charisma, the Bonepowder Ghoul is a threat that combines agility with potent magical capabilities. However, it remains vulnerable to radiant damage, meaning it needs to be careful when facing divine or holy entities. Notably, the Bonepowder Ghoul can shape itself into a nearly immaterial form, allowing it to pass through tight spaces effortlessly, which adds a layer of tactical versatility to its encounters.

The creature has the following attributes: Strength 10 (modifier +0 - average), Dexterity 20 (modifier +5 - very good), Constitution 18 (modifier +4 - good), Intelligence 19 (modifier +4 - good), Wisdom 15 (modifier +2 - average), and Charisma 18 (modifier +4 - good). These scores reflect a creature that is not physically strong but excels in agility and magical presence. The Bonepowder Ghoul benefits from saving throw bonuses of Dexterity +9 (very good), Constitution +8 (good), Wisdom +6 (good), and Charisma +8 (good), plus it possesses skills such as Perception +6 (good) and Stealth +9 (very good). 

This undead creature has several damage immunities, such as necrotic and poison damage, and it also resists cold and lightning damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It is completely immune to several conditions including charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned, making it quite resilient in many combat situations. Its darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 16 further enhance its capabilities as a stealthy predator. This ghoul can communicate in Common, Darakhul, Draconic, and Dwarvish languages.

The Bonepowder Ghoul features a unique set of special abilities. The Amorphous ability allows it to move through gaps as narrow as 1 inch without tightening itself, which can be extremely advantageous in evasive maneuvers. Its Hungry Dead Nature necessitates no air or sleep, ensuring it can operate without the typical biological needs of living creatures. The Turning Defiance ability grants it and nearby ghouls an advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, making it more challenging to control or banish in encounters.

During combat, the Bonepowder Ghoul primarily employs its Bite action, which is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit. When it successfully strikes, it deals 18 piercing damage, augmented by an additional 9 necrotic damage. It can reduce the target's Strength score by a roll of 1d4, which is impactful in combat scenarios since reducing a target's Strength to zero results in instant death. If the target is humanoid, it risks contracting darakhul fever unless it passes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

The Gravedust action is a ranged attack that projects an area of necrotic damage in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within this zone must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or face 13 necrotic damage and, if they are humanoid, must also pass a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be infected with darakhul fever. 

The Whirlwind action can only be used when in Dust Form and requires a recharge of 5–6. It creates a damaging whirlwind within a 20-foot cube, where all creatures must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 55 slashing damage and a reduction in Strength by 1d6, with the same death penalty if the Strength score drops to zero. Successful saving throws reduce damage by half without any effects on Strength.

If using its Coalesced Form, the Bonepowder Ghoul can cast spells using Charisma as its spellcasting ability. At will, it can cast dispel magic, mage hand, and ray of enfeeblement. Three times per day, it can cast blindness/deafness and fear, while once per day it can use phantasmal killer. Each spell impacts the battlefield significantly, such as dispel magic affecting ongoing magical effects or phantasmal killer inducing fear and psychological distress.

In combat, the ghoul can trigger the Coalesce reaction, allowing it to change from its dusty form to a more substantial form after dealing necrotic damage with its Gravedust ability. This transformation allows it to speak audibly, and it lasts for a duration equal to the total necrotic damage dealt to non-undead targets or until it chooses to end the effect as a bonus action. The Bonepowder Ghoul encompasses a range of tactical abilities that enforce its formidable role as a nightmare on the battlefield, striking fear and physical harm in equal measure.
