It features unique abilities that allow it to manipulate shadows and impair the movement of adversaries, although it is vulnerable to area effects due to its lesser durability.

The Pounce ability enables it to dash toward an enemy, potentially knocking them prone if they fail a DC 13 Strength saving throw, followed by an opportunity for an additional bite attack.
