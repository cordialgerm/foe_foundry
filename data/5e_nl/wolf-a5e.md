The Wolf is a medium-sized beast commonly found in wild and forested areas, often recognized for its keen senses and pack mentality. As a creature with a Challenge Rating of 1/4, the Wolf can be a formidable adversary when encountered in groups, leveraging its special abilities to outmaneuver and overpower its foes. It boasts a moderate Armor Class of 12, providing it with basic protection, and it possesses 11 hit points, making it somewhat resilient for its tier. The Wolf excels in stealth and perception, allowing it to effectively ambush prey or evade detection. Its primary weaknesses lie in its lower intelligence and charisma, making it less capable in social situations or complex strategies.

The Wolf has the following attributes: Strength at 12 (+1 modifier, which is considered average), Dexterity at 14 (+2 modifier, which is good), Constitution at 12 (+1 modifier, also average), Intelligence at 3 (-4 modifier, categorized as very bad), Wisdom at 12 (+1 modifier, average), and Charisma at 6 (-2 modifier, bad). The skill bonuses for the Wolf include a +3 modifier in perception, which is good, and a +4 modifier in stealth, also considered good, enabling it to effectively blend into its surroundings and notice potential threats. With darkvision up to 30 feet and a passive perception of 13, the Wolf can function well in dim light and has a heightened awareness of its environment.

The Wolf's special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness. The Keen Hearing and Smell ability grants the Wolf advantage on perception checks related to these senses, making it exceptionally capable of detecting nearby creatures and threats. Meanwhile, Pack Tactics allows the Wolf to gain advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one ally is within 5 feet of that target and not incapacitated. This ability significantly increases the Wolf’s chances of successfully landing attacks when working with a group.

In terms of actions, the Wolf can perform a melee attack known as Bite. This attack has a +4 to hit, reaching out 5 feet to target one creature. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 5 piercing damage calculated from a roll of 1d6+2. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or become prone. This can potentially turn the tide of battle by removing an opponent’s ability to stand, allowing the Wolf and its allies to continue their assault with advantage. Overall, the Wolf exemplifies the traits of a cunning and agile predator, capable of delivering a solid threat in both solitary and pack encounters.
