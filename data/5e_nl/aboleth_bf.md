The Aboleth is a large aberration known for its powerful psionic abilities and manipulative nature. Residing in dark, aquatic environments, it possesses significant strength and resilience, making it a formidable opponent. With a Challenge Rating of 10, it presents a considerable threat, especially due to its capacity to inflict disease and mental manipulation. The Aboleth's strengths lie in its resistance to various conditions, exceptional intelligence, and horrifying psychic attacks. However, its relatively low mobility on land, with a speed of only 10 feet, makes it vulnerable when confronted outside of water. 

The Aboleth has an Armor Class of 17, indicating it has good protection thanks to its natural armor. With 165 hit points, it can endure a substantial amount of damage before being defeated. Its attributes include a Strength of +5 (good), Dexterity of -1 (very bad), Constitution of +6 (very good), Intelligence of +8 (exceptional), Wisdom of +6 (very good), and Charisma of +4 (good). The Aboleth has darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness, and a Perception score of 20, which is exceptional and gives it a high awareness of its surroundings. Additionally, it has a Stealth score of 9, which is bad, meaning it is not adept at moving silently. The creature communicates in Deep Speech and has telepathy that works within 120 feet of it, allowing it to interact mentally with others.

The Aboleth has several special abilities that enhance its threat level. Its Aberrant Resilience grants it resistance to conditions like being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned, while also giving it an advantage on saves against spells that would change its form. Being Amphibious enables it to breathe both air and water, making it capable of navigating between different environments. The Legendary Resistance ability allows the Aboleth to succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail, up to three times per day, which is very good for maintaining its survivability in combat.

Probing Telepathy is a unique ability that lets the Aboleth uncover a creature's greatest desires through telepathic communication. The Slime Pox disease causes infected creatures to suffer from debilitating effects, including the ability to regain hit points only while underwater and taking acid damage if they remain dry. In addition, failing a DC 16 Charisma save over time can turn infected creatures into thralls of the Aboleth if they fail three times, which adds a strong element of control to the Aboleth's repertoire. Finally, the Slimy Skin trait causes creatures that come in contact with the Aboleth to risk infection with Slime Pox, placing further pressure on its enemies.

In combat, the Aboleth can make a Multiattack, which consists of three attacks either with its Tentacles or Psychic Bolt. Its Tentacle attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The Psychic Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +8 to hit, able to target creatures up to 120 feet away, dealing 14 (3d6 + 4) psychic damage. Its Psychic Torrent ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, can affect up to three creatures within 60 feet, forcing them to make a DC 16 Wisdom save or take 49 (14d6) psychic damage while also becoming incapacitated. This move can severely hinder opponents, making it extremely useful in battles against groups.

The Aboleth can also use legendary actions to enhance its versatility. It can automatically detect creatures and traps within 60 feet with the Detect action, swim up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, or unleash its Slime Drain ability to drain life from a creature infected with slime pox, dealing 10 (3d6) acid damage while restoring its own health.

Overall, the Aboleth is a cunning and terrifying foe, capable of manipulating its prey and dealing devastating psychic damage, while also having tactical advantages through its resistance and unique abilities.
