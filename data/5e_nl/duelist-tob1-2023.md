The Duelist is a Medium humanoid of lawful evil alignment that excels in combat through agility and cunning. With an Armor Class of 17, this creature is quite difficult to hit, and its 117 hit points allow it to endure a fair amount of damage before being taken down. The Duelist utilizes its exceptional Dexterity, boasting a +5 modifier that significantly enhances its attacks and evasion tactics, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. However, it is hampered by its Sunlight Sensitivity, giving it disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks when exposed to sunlight. Overall, the Duelist is adept at maneuvering around the battlefield, delivering swift strikes, and employing evasive tactics to remain a step ahead of its foes.

The Duelist has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 13 (+1), which is considered average for physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 20 (+5), making its agility and attack effectiveness very good.
- Constitution: 14 (+2), which is good for maintaining hit points and fortitude.
- Intelligence: 13 (+1), also regarded as average for any required mental checks.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), slightly below average but still useful.
- Charisma: 16 (+3), which is very good and aids in social interactions.

The Duelist's saving throws include a +8 modifier to Dexterity saves (very good) and a +6 modifier to Charisma saves (good). Their skills feature proficiency in Acrobatics (+8, very good), Deception (+6, good), Perception (+4, average), and Stealth (+8, very good). With darkvision for 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 14, the Duelist can effectively see in low-light situations.

Notable special abilities include:
- Duelist's Mobility, which grants disadvantage on opportunity attacks made against the Duelist and allows it to stand up without using movement if prone at the beginning of its turn. This ability is exceptionally useful for maintaining position in combat.
- Fey Ancestry gives the Duelist advantage on saving throws against being charmed and immunity to magical sleep effects, making it resilient against many control spells.
- Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based perception while in sunlight, is a significant weakness.

For actions, the Duelist can perform a Multiattack consisting of two Rapier attacks and one Dagger attack. 
- The Dagger is a melee or ranged attack with a +8 to hit, capable of dealing 7 piercing damage plus an additional 14 poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute, which can severely impair their effectiveness in combat.
- The Rapier attack also carries a +8 to hit and deals 9 piercing damage per hit.

The Duelist can also perform the following bonus and reaction actions:
- Shadow Traveler allows it to vanish into shadows or darkness and reappear within 30 feet, utilizing this ability three times per day. This provides significant tactical flexibility in combat.
- As a reaction, the Duelist can use Parry to add 3 to its AC against one melee attack, a useful defensive maneuver when anticipating an enemy's strike. This ability requires the Duelist to see the attacker and wield a melee weapon.

Overall, the Duelist is a clever and agile foe, using its abilities and skills to outmaneuver and outwit opponents, while also posing a direct threat with its potent melee attacks and poison capabilities.
