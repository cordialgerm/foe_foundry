The Giant Rat is a small beast often found in urban landscapes and rural settings. Despite its tiny stature, it possesses a surprising amount of agility and cunning in combat situations, making it a nuisance for adventurers and townsfolk alike. With an Armor Class of 12 and only 7 hit points, it is relatively weak and can be easily dispatched by most characters. However, its advantages lie in its Keen Smell special ability and Pack Tactics, enabling it to effectively coordinate attacks with allies. This makes the Giant Rat a more formidable opponent when in groups, posing a challenge primarily to lower-level characters.

The Giant Rat has the following attributes: Strength of 6, which is very bad, Dexterity of 14, which is good, Constitution of 10, which is average, Intelligence of 2, which is very bad, Wisdom of 10, which is average, and Charisma of 4, which is very bad. Its low Strength means it is not adept at physical feats, while its above-average Dexterity allows it to evade attacks and strike quickly. The Giant Rat relies largely on its agility, making it capable of surprising opponents.

The Giant Rat has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell, allowing the rat to detect hidden or stealthy characters more easily. This is especially useful in situations involving stealth or ambush. The Pack Tactics ability gives the rat advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of that target, making it significantly more dangerous in groups. This encourages tactical play where Giant Rats can flank and swarm their opponents, making it a more challenging adversary than it would be when encountered singly.

In terms of its offensive capabilities, the Giant Rat has a Bite action, which is a melee weapon attack. It has a +4 to hit with this attack, meaning it is likely to land hits against targets with low Armor Classes. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 4 piercing damage on a successful hit, which is enough to threaten weaker characters while relying on its pack for support in combat scenarios. Overall, the Giant Rat exemplifies the dangers that can come in swarms, combining speed and tactical advantages to compensate for its individual weaknesses.
