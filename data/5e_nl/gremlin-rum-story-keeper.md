The Rum Story Keeper is a tiny fey creature with chaotic evil tendencies, embodying both mischief and a penchant for intoxicating fun. With its unique powers revolving around the effects of drunkenness and storytelling, it can debilitate foes or enhance the capabilities of its allies. While it has strong magical resilience and can deliver potent poison attacks, the Rum Story Keeper can be frail due to its low hit points and armor class. Its most notable feature is its ability to manipulate the battlefield with its storytelling and drunken aura, making it both a supportive ally to fellow Rum Gremlins and a tricky foe.

The Rum Story Keeper has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average for its Challenge Rating of 2, meaning it can take a moderate amount of damage before falling in battle. It possesses 38 hit points, calculated from rolling 7d4 and adding 21; this indicates a decent level of survivability for a creature of its size and type. The creature's movement capabilities include walking at a speed of 20 feet, climbing at 10 feet, and swimming at 10 feet, providing it with versatile mobility options during encounters.

In terms of attributes, the Rum Story Keeper has a Strength score of 12 (+1 modifier, average effectiveness), Dexterity of 16 (+3 modifier, good effectiveness), Constitution of 16 (+3 modifier, good effectiveness), Intelligence of 12 (+1 modifier, average effectiveness), Wisdom of 9 (-1 modifier, bad effectiveness), and Charisma of 16 (+3 modifier, good effectiveness). The creature has a weak spot in Wisdom, making it susceptible to effects that rely on that attribute.

The Rum Story Keeper is immune to the poisoned condition and has darkvision up to 120 feet, granting it good visibility in dark environments. Its passive Perception score is 11, while it can communicate in Common.

Special abilities of the Rum Story Keeper include the Aura of Drunkenness, which creates a 20-foot radius around the creature that forces each creature starting its turn there to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes poisoned for an hour, with additional penalties for those who have consumed alcohol in the last hour. If successful, the creature gains immunity to this aura for 24 hours. Additionally, the Rum Story Keeper has Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its defensive capabilities against spellcasters.

In terms of actions, it can perform a Mug Slap melee weapon attack, with a +5 to hit, targeting within 5 feet to deal 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage. This damaging combination makes it dangerous in close quarters. Its Rum Splash ranged weapon attack allows it to strike a target within 40 feet (or up to 80 feet with disadvantage) with a +5 to hit and deal 7 (2d6) poison damage.

One of its signature actions, Drinking Stories, allows the Rum Story Keeper to weave a narrative that can empower its allies or grant additional effects. By taking a bonus action, it can continue its storytelling on subsequent turns, choosing from various tales. The Tale of Liquid Courage grants temporary hit points and advantage against being frightened to nearby rum gremlins. The Tale of the Bar Room Rush allows nearby gremlins to use their reactions to move immediately and provides them with enhanced movement options. The Tale of the Great Shindig lets gremlins shove larger creatures and gives them advantage on Strength checks for the duration of the tale.

Moreover, the Rum Story Keeper can cast spells as part of its abilities, using Charisma for spellcasting with a DC of 13. It can perform prestidigitation at will, which allows for minor magical effects, and it can cast charm person and mirror image three times per day each. These spells further enhance its capability to manipulate situations and evade threats, making the Rum Story Keeper a formidable opponent on the battlefield.
