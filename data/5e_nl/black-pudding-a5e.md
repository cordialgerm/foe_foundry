The Black Pudding is a formidable Large ooze creature designed to present a considerable challenge to adventurers. With an Armor Class of 7 and a notable total of 85 hit points, this creature is resilient but does not rely on typical forms of defense. The unique challenge lies in its powerful and corrosive nature, allowing it to deal significant acid damage both on contact and through melee attacks. However, its low Dexterity makes it somewhat clumsy, affecting its ability to dodge attacks effectively. Its traits allow it to move seamlessly through various terrains, including climbing and swimming, giving it an advantage in environments where it can maneuver through obstacles. Adventurers need to be cautious, as nonmagical weapons and armor can degrade rapidly upon contact with the Black Pudding, leading to potentially disastrous consequences in prolonged encounters.

The Black Pudding has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 4 (-3), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 6 (-2), and Charisma 1 (-5). Its Strength score is good, making it a substantial threat in melee combat, although its Dexterity is very bad, making it slow and easier to hit. The Constitution score of 16 (+3) provides an exceptional level of durability, allowing the pudding to absorb damage effectively. Intelligence is very bad, rendering it unable to think or strategize like more sentient beings, and its Wisdom is bad, limiting its perception. The creature's Charisma is also very bad, indicating a lack of personal charm or presence.

The Black Pudding is immune to acid, cold, lightning, and slashing damage, making it particularly resilient against certain attack types. It is also immune to various conditions, including being blinded, charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, and prone, which makes it difficult to control in combat. Its sensory capabilities include blindsight within 60 feet, meaning it can detect creatures even while blind, but beyond that range, it cannot see. 

One of the Black Pudding's most notable special abilities is Amorphous, which allows it to pass through openings as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. This ability enables it to infiltrate spaces that would typically be inaccessible to larger creatures. The Corrosive Body ability is particularly feared, as it deals 9 (2d8) acid damage to any creature that touches it or attacks with a melee attack while within 5 feet. Furthermore, nonmagical weapons made of metal or wood that hit the Black Pudding suffer a permanent -1 penalty to their damage rolls for each hit, up to a maximum of -5, at which point the weapon is destroyed. This ability makes engaging the creature in melee combat especially dangerous for adventurers who rely on conventional weapons. The Spider Climb trait allows it to traverse difficult surfaces and ceilings effectively, enhancing its mobility during encounters. Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on attack rolls while in sunlight, which is a notable weakness that clever adventurers can exploit. Lastly, the Ooze Nature ability indicates that it does not require air or sleep, granting it exceptional endurance in lengthy engagements.

In terms of actions, the Black Pudding can perform a Pseudopod attack, which involves a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 9 (2d8) acid damage. Furthermore, any nonmagical armor worn by the target suffers a permanent -1 penalty to its AC protection with each hit, and if its AC is reduced to 10, the armor is destroyed. 

As a reaction, the Black Pudding can utilize its Split ability when subjected to lightning or slashing damage. If the creature takes these types of damage and has at least 10 hit points remaining, it splits into two smaller puddings, each one size smaller, and each new pudding has half of the original's hit points, rounded down. This ability can complicate combat significantly, as defeating one pudding can lead to the emergence of two more, increasing the challenge for any adventurers facing the creature.
