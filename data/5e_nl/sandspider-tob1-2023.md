The Sand Spider is a formidable Large beast with a distinct predatory role in combat, leveraging its ability to ambush and grapple opponents. With a challenge rating of 7, it stands as a significant threat to adventurers, possessing a robust set of physical attributes and special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Sand Spider has a high Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, and its hit points, totaling 135, make it quite durable in battle. Its strengths lie in its powerful attacks, speed through burrowing, and camouflage in sandy environments, making it a very good ambusher. However, its weaknesses include low intelligence, charisma, and a lack of verbal communication, limiting its tactical depth.

The Sand Spider has a Strength of 20, providing a +5 modifier, which is exceptional in combat for melee attacks. Its Dexterity score of 17 grants a +3 modifier, resulting in good capabilities in stealth and initiative rolls. The Constitution of 14 gives it a +2 modifier, contributing to its average resilience and hit points. Its Intelligence of 4 results in a -3 modifier, making it very bad at tasks requiring intellect. With a Wisdom of 12 (+1 modifier), it has average perception skills, and a Charisma score of 4 (-3 modifier) indicates it is very bad at social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Sand Spider excels at Perception with a +4, allowing it to effectively notice hidden creatures or traps, and has excellent Stealth with a +6, benefiting greatly from its Sand Camouflage ability. With darkvision and tremorsense, it can sense its environment and prey within a 60-foot range, giving it formidable awareness in dark or obscured spaces.

The Sand Spiderâ€™s primary abilities include Sand Camouflage, allowing it to gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in sandy terrain, making it exceptionally adept at hiding and ambushing. The Sand Spider can execute a Multiattack, using one Bite and two Impaling Legs in a single action. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit that deals 10 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage on a successful hit. The Impaling Leg attacks also have a +8 to hit, reaching 10 feet and dealing 12 piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become grappled, inflicting additional piercing damage every turn while restrained.

In terms of reactions, the Sand Spider can perform a Trapdoor Ambush, where it strikes at a creature entering its burrowed space, making an Impaling Leg attack. This attack is particularly deadly as the target is at a disadvantage for the saving throw to escape the grapple, allowing the Sand Spider to potentially incapacitate its prey quickly. Overall, this monster represents a cunning and powerful threat in combat scenarios, particularly in sandy areas where it can fully utilize its ambushing skills.
