The Kelp Eel is a huge plant creature that embodies the merging of plant and aquatic characteristics. It presents a unique challenge to adventurers due to its formidable defensive capabilities, high hit points, and ability to control the battlefield through grappling mechanics. With an Armor Class of 17, it offers good protection from attacks, and with 157 hit points, it can withstand considerable amounts of damage. However, the Kelp Eel's intelligence is very low, which limits its tactical options in combat. It is primarily defensive and has a high ability to resist damage types of acid, bludgeoning, and piercing, providing it with good durability. Its ability to form into ordinary kelp gives it a cunning edge in ambush play, and its grappling capacity can restrict opponents effectively. Nevertheless, parties might exploit its vulnerability if they can remove enough of its dispersed components from water, leading to its permanent destruction.

The Kelp Eel possesses the following attribute values: Strength at 18 with a +4 modifier, which is exceptional for physical attacks; Dexterity at 14 with a +2 modifier, classified as good, enabling it to evade some attacks; Constitution at 19 with a +4 modifier, also exceptional, contributing to its high hit points; Intelligence at 3 with a -4 modifier, a very bad score, indicating a lack of mental capabilities; Wisdom at 15 with a +2 modifier, which is good, providing it with some perceptual abilities; and Charisma at 5 with a -3 modifier, which is very bad, indicating a lack of social influence. 

In addition to its strong attributes, the Kelp Eel has some notable special abilities. "Disperse" allows the creature, when reduced to 0 hit points, to dissolve into kelp for an hour, creating difficult terrain that can hinder enemy movement. After an hour, the Kelp Eel can reform with half its original hit points unless too much of its component kelp is removed from the water. The "False Appearance" ability enables the Kelp Eel to blend in with ordinary kelp while motionless, granting it an exceptional ability to ambush unsuspecting creatures.

The Kelp Eelâ€™s actions in combat include a "Multiattack," which permits it to make two attacks with its kelp tendrils, use its "Reel" action, and then make two slam attacks. The "Slam" attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 modifier, capable of dealing 31 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. As for the "Kelp Tendril" action, it also has a +8 attack modifier and allows the Kelp Eel to grapple a target from a distance of 50 feet. This action not only restrains the target but also initiates a suffocation effect on the target at the start of its next turn, adding a layer of urgency to escape. The "Reel" action enables the Kelp Eel to pull grappling targets closer, potentially providing additional tactical opportunities in combat interactions. Overall, the Kelp Eel offers a complex set of strengths and tactical advantages that can create complications for adventurers who encounter it.
