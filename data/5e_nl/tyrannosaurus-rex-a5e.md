The T. rex's greatest strengths lie in its high Strength score of 22 and Constitution score of 20, allowing it to deal substantial damage and endure a great deal of punishment.

On a successful hit, it deals an impressive 25 piercing damage (3d12 + 6) and can grapple the target, imposing an escape DC of 17, meaning the target must make a successful Strength check to break free. This grapple grants the T. rex advantage on its bite attacks against the trapped creature, making it particularly dangerous.
