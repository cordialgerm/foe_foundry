The Corrupted Unicorn is a large celestial creature, known for its elegance and power, but now twisted by dark influences. It features a decent armor class of 14 and possesses 85 hit points, making it reasonably resilient in combat situations. With a challenge rating of 5, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, offering 1,800 experience points upon defeat. The unicorn can move swiftly, with a speed of 80 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. Its high attributes make it an exceptional combatant: it has a strength score of 20 (+5), dexterity of 18 (+4), constitution of 18 (+4), intelligence of 16 (+3), wisdom of 20 (+5), and charisma of 20 (+5). This means its physical strikes and magical resistance make it a formidable opponent, while its high wisdom and charisma render it effective in interactions and spellcasting.

The Corrupted Unicorn has the unique ability of Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which is very good for its survivability against spellcasting foes. It can engage enemies through multiple attacks, striking once with its Hooves, which has a +8 to hit and deals an average of 9 bludgeoning damage, and once with its Horn, which also has a +8 to hit. The horn attack not only deals 9 piercing damage but also an additional 10 radiant damage, and if the unicorn charges at least 20 feet toward its target, it can inflict an extra 9 bludgeoning damage along with a chance to knock the target prone if they fail a DC 16 Strength saving throw.

In addition, it features a powerful action called Trample, allowing it to attack creatures that are already prone. One of its notable special abilities is the Darkness Aura, which can be used once per day. This ability creates a 15-foot radius of magical darkness that obscures vision and dispels weaker light sources, significantly affecting the battlefield dynamics. It is also immune to the effects of this darkness, allowing it to maintain a tactical advantage.

Furthermore, the unicorn has the capacity to grant boons to itself or willing creatures up to three times per day. These include Healing, which restores 21 hit points and cures diseases; Luck, which allows the beneficiary to add a d12 to a crucial roll; Protection, providing a glowing mote of light that can be used to succeed on a failed saving throw; and Resolution, which grants immunity to being charmed or frightened for 24 hours. These abilities emphasize its role not only as a combatant but also as a potential ally to aid adventurers in desperate situations.
