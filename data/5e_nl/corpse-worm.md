The Corpse Worm is a large monstrosity that presents a formidable challenge to adventurers, especially given its unique abilities and combat style. With a robust hit point pool, a decent armor class, and the capacity to grapple and swallow its prey, it becomes a significant threat on the battlefield. Primarily, its strength lies in its melee attack, which not only deals piercing damage but also has the potential to inflict a debilitating disease on its victims. However, it has a low intelligence and charisma, which limits its strategic options outside direct combat. The Corpse Worm is best approached carefully, given its capacity to restrain and poison foes while remaining resilient against poison damage itself.

The Corpse Worm has an armor class of 14, indicating good natural armor that provides a solid defense against attacks. It possesses 76 hit points, calculated from 8d10 + 32, making it quite durable in combat. The creature has a walking and climbing speed of 30 feet, allowing it to navigate various terrains effectively. It has a challenge rating of 3, translating to a reward of 700 experience points for defeating it.

The Corpse Worm's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 16 (+3), which is good and enhances its physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), which is average and gives it some agility.
- Constitution: 19 (+4), which is very good and increases its durability.
- Intelligence: 1 (-5), which is very bad and indicates it does not engage in complex strategies.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), which is average and allows for some perceptive abilities.
- Charisma: 5 (-3), which is very bad, making it ineffective in social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Corpse Worm has a perception score of +3, making it reasonably aware of its surroundings. It is immune to poison damage and cannot be poisoned, granting it an edge against certain types of attacks. It has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive perception score of 13.

The Corpse Worm has a special ability called Keen Smell, allowing it to have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. This enhances its ability to detect hidden or stealthy creatures.

In combat, the Corpse Worm can perform two primary actions: Bite and Swallow. The Bite action is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. When it hits, it deals an average of 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage and grapples the target, which must escape with a DC of 13. The grappled target faces restraint and must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against a disease; failure results in being poisoned until the disease is cured, while each day of being diseased reduces their hit point maximum by 5. This reduction can be deadly if not addressed quickly.

The Swallow action allows the Corpse Worm to make a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it has grappled. If successful, the target is swallowed, becoming blinded and restrained with total cover from external attacks. While inside, the swallowed creature receives 10 (3d6) acid damage at the beginning of each of the Corpse Worm's turns. The Worm can only swallow one creature at a time, and if it sustains 20 or more damage in one turn, it might regurgitate the creature, which then falls prone within 10 feet of the Worm.

Additionally, the Corpse Worm has a reaction called Regurgitate, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability activates when it is hit by an attack while the attacker is within 10 feet. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned for one minute. If the Corpse Worm has a swallowed target at that time, it also makes a saving throw to potentially regurgitate the swallowed creature, causing it to fall prone and take acid damage alongside the attacker. 

Overall, the Corpse Worm is a dangerous foe, particularly due to its ability to control the battlefield through grappling and swallowing, potentially leading to swift character incapacitation if not handled properly.
