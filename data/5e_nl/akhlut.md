With a challenge rating of 6, it possesses notable physical strength and speed, making it a dangerous opponent in both water and on land. Its key attributes include high strength and good agility, allowing it to deliver significant damage through its multiattack features. While it is resistant to cold damage, it lacks the ability to communicate with languages, making it somewhat limited in social interactions. Overall, the Akhlut is an exceptional threat in combat, especially when it operates in a pack.

The Akhlut has an Armor Class of 14, which is considered average for its challenge rating. With 120 hit points, its durability is good, allowing it to withstand several rounds of combat before succumbing to defeat. The creature's Strength score is 19 (+4 modifier), enabling it to excel in melee attacks. Its Dexterity is 15 (+2 modifier), providing decent agility and helping with skills like stealth. The Constitution is also at 15 (+2 modifier), contributing to its overall resilience. However, its Intelligence is notably low at 4 (-3 modifier), which indicates a lack of cognitive ability. The Wisdom score is 12 (+1 modifier), giving it an average perception of its surroundings, and its Charisma is 10 (+0 modifier), indicating it has no special personal presence or influence.

In terms of skills, the Akhlut has a perception bonus of +4, which is good, and it also benefits from a stealth bonus of +5, making it quite stealthy in its natural environment. It has damage resistance to cold, which is beneficial against cold-based attacks. The Akhlut possesses blindsight out to a range of 120 feet, allowing it to sense its environment without relying on sight, as long as it is not deafened. The creature’s passive Perception is 14, providing a good baseline awareness of its surroundings.

The Akhlut has several notable special abilities. Its Echolocation ability signifies that if it is deafened, it loses the advantage of its blindsight. With the Hold Breath ability, the Akhlut can remain submerged for up to 30 minutes, a significant advantage in aquatic settings. The Keen Hearing and Smell ability gives the creature advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on these senses, making it adept at tracking prey. Finally, Pack Tactics allows the Akhlut to gain advantage on its attack rolls against a creature if an ally is near, significantly increasing its effectiveness in group encounters.

For combat, the Akhlut can utilize a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two attacks in one turn: one with its bite and another with its tail slam. It is important to note that it cannot target the same opponent with both attacks. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 18 piercing damage on a successful hit, rolling 4d6 + 4 for damage. The Tail Slam attack also has a +7 to hit but has a longer reach of 10 feet, causing 22 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, rolling 4d8 + 4 for damage. These attacks make the Akhlut a peerless adversary in close-quarters combat, capable of delivering devastating blows to its targets.
