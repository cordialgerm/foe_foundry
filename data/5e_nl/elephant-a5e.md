The Elephant is a massive beast characterized by its enormous size and significant physical power, making it an impressive presence on the battlefield. As a creature with a challenge rating of 4, it offers a moderate level of threat to adventurers, making it suitable for encounters with mid-level parties. It excels in physical combat with high strength and considerable hit points, allowing it to absorb damage while delivering devastating attacks. However, its dexterity is notably low, indicating that it is not particularly quick or agile. This makes it vulnerable to characters that rely on speed and tactical positioning. Overall, the Elephant serves as a formidable and intimidating combatant that can easily disrupt enemy formations with its charge and stomping attacks.

The Elephant has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for creatures of its challenge level, representing a moderate defense against attacks. It possesses hit points totaling 76, calculated by rolling 8d12 and adding 24, giving it above-average durability for its tier.

In terms of attributes, the Elephant has a Strength score of 22, providing it with a +6 modifier that is exceptional for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is low at 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, indicating poor agility and reflexes. The Constitution score of 16 grants it a +3 modifier, contributing to its resilience. Intelligence is very low at 4 with a -3 modifier, reflecting a lack of cognitive ability, while its Wisdom is average at 10, resulting in a +0 modifier. Lastly, its Charisma is low at 6, giving it a -2 modifier, showing that it lacks social effectiveness.

In combat, the Elephant has access to several actions. The first is the Gore action, which is a melee weapon attack that utilizes a +8 to hit, reaching 5 feet to target a single opponent. If successful, the attack deals 19 piercing damage, calculated from 3d8 plus a 6 modifier. Notably, if the Elephant charges at least 20 feet straight towards a target before executing this attack, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can significantly impact the dynamics of the encounter.

The second primary action is Stomp, which also offers a +8 to hit and deals more damage. This attack delivers a substantial 22 bludgeoning damage, resulting from rolling 3d10 plus the same 6 modifier. This action is less conditional than Gore, making it a reliable option during combat.

As a bonus action, the Elephant can utilize Trample Underfoot, allowing it to make a stomp attack specifically against a creature that is already prone. This ability can capitalize on the opportunity created by its Gore attack, allowing the Elephant to deal additional damage to foes that have been knocked down.

Overall, the Elephant stands as a powerful and straightforward combatant, leveraging its size and strength to impose its will upon the battlefield while presenting certain vulnerabilities due to its lack of speed and tactical options relative to more agile opponents.
