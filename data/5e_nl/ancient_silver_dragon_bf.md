The Ancient Silver Dragon is a gargantuan creature known for its exceptional power and role as a formidable opponent in Dungeons & Dragons. With an impressive challenge rating of 20, it embodies agility, resilience, and intelligence. The dragon's notable abilities include its potent breath attacks that can inflict massive cold damage and paralyze foes, as well as its capacity to frighten and manipulate its enemies in battle. This dragon possesses extraordinary defensive and offensive capabilities, enhanced by its formidable natural armor class of 21 and a staggering 355 hit points. Despite its strengths, it is still susceptible to strong magical attacks and clever tactics devised by players. Its ability to shape-shift into other forms adds a layer of unpredictability in encounters. 

The Ancient Silver Dragon has the following attributes: Strength of +10, Dexterity of +6, Constitution of +15, Intelligence of +4, Wisdom of +9, and Charisma of +11. These values signify that the dragon has exceptional physical toughness and a notably high Charisma, indicating strong social influence. Its Dexterity is good, making it relatively nimble for its size, while its Wisdom and Intelligence scores provide it with advantages in perception and tactical decision-making.

The dragon possesses special abilities such as Freezing Fog, which affects creatures within a 30-foot radius, requiring them to make a DC 23 saving throw to avoid being negatively impacted. Additionally, it boasts Legendary Resistance, which allows it to choose to succeed on saving throws a total of three times per day, providing an exceptional defensive advantage.

In terms of actions, the Ancient Silver Dragon can make multiple attacks per turn through its Multiattack ability, allowing it to use Frightful Presence to instill fear, followed by its Bite attack, Claw attacks, or deploy its potent Paralyzing Breath if it is available. The Bite has a +17 to hit and deals an average of 21 piercing damage, the Claw attack also has a +17 to hit and deals an average of 17 slashing damage, and the Tail attack pays a +17 to hit with an average damaging of 19 bludgeoning damage. 

The Frightful Presence ability can cause targets within 120 feet to become frightened for one minute on a failed DC 19 Wisdom saving throw, although the effects can end if the creature succeeds on subsequent turns. The Cold Breath attack can deal massive area damage, where targets within a 90-foot cone must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or suffer a staggering 99 cold damage (22d8), with half damage on a success. The Paralyzing Breath, similar to its young counterpart, also functions in a 90-foot cone, demanding a DC 23 saving throw from affected targets.

As a bonus action, the dragon can use Change Shape to transform into a Beast or Humanoid of an equal challenge rating or revert to its true dragon form. This ability allows the dragon to maintain its legendary traits and statistics while adopting the capabilities of its new form.

In combat, the dragon can utilize legendary actions, allowing it to take three actions per turn only at the end of another creature's turn. Options include the Detect action for pinpointing nearby creatures and traps, a Tail Attack, and more complex actions like Elemental Roar, which can make creatures vulnerable to cold damage, and Wing Attack, enabling it to deal damage and reposition itself effectively without provoking opportunity attacks.

Lastly, the Ancient Silver Dragon has regional effects that may manifest if it is present in an area, but these effects diminish and fade if the dragon is slain, further amplifying the threat it poses in any campaign.
