The special abilities of the Zombie, Smokeplume are particularly significant. "Firesight" allows it to see through smoke and fog without any penalties, enhancing its tactical options when in obscured areas. Upon its demise, the "Smoldering Death" ability triggers; its body turns into smoldering coals, releasing a cloud of smoke that creates heavily obscured terrain for a 15-foot radius around its corpse. This smoke lasts for one minute or until dispersed by wind, causing poison damage to creatures that enter or start their turn within it. The "Undead Fortitude" ability provides a sturdy defense mechanism, allowing the zombie to potentially stay in the fight even when reduced to 0 hit points, unless the damage was from radiant sources or critical hits. Lastly, "Undead Nature" emphasizes its lack of biological needs; it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.

In combat, the Zombie, Smokeplume has several actions. Its primary attack is "Slam," a melee weapon attack that has a +6 to hit.

Additionally, it can unleash "Smoke Breath," a powerful ability that generates a cloud of smoke in a 15-foot cone. This action deals significant fire and poison damage (9 fire and 7 poison) to all creatures caught in the area and creates heavily obscured terrain, adding strategic complexity to encounters. The smoke from this breath weapon lingers until the start of the zombieâ€™s next turn, further obstructing visibility and complicating maneuverability for opponents.
