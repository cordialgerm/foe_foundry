The Eonic Drifter is a Medium-sized humanoid creature that operates within the realm of chaotic neutrality. It possesses a unique combination of magical and physical capabilities, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 13, it wears leather armor, providing average protection. The Drifter has a total of 65 hit points, calculated from rolling ten 8-sided dice plus an additional 20, offering it good durability in encounters. It has a challenge rating of 1, providing 200 experience points upon defeat. 

In terms of its attributes, the Eonic Drifter has a Strength score of 9 with a modifier of -1, which is poor and indicates it is physically weak. However, it possesses a Dexterity score of 14, granting a +2 modifier, which is good and aids its agility in combat. It also has a Constitution score of 14, leading to another +2 modifier, which is also good and contributes to its hit point total. The Drifter has an impressive Intelligence score of 18, resulting in a +4 modifier, which is exceptional for knowledge-based tasks. Its Wisdom is average, at 11 with no modifier, and it has a Charisma score of 13 with a +1 modifier, allowing for decent interactions with other characters.

The Eonic Drifter excels in Arcana and History skills, both at +6, indicating very good proficiency in these knowledge areas. Its passive perception is low at 10, so it might be less aware of surroundings compared to more perceptive creatures. The Drifter can communicate in several languages, including Common, Eonic, Giant, and Sylvan, enabling a variety of interactions.

In terms of actions, the Eonic Drifter has the ability called Time-Warping Staff, which allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit at a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 5 bludgeoning damage, with an additional 3 force damage. This combination can effectively deal a good amount of damage in combat.

The Drifter’s special ability, Drift Forward, has a recharge time of 5 to 6. It targets a creature it can see within 5 feet of its future self, who must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in 7 psychic damage and the target being pulled forward in time, disappearing along with the future self. Success halves the damage and negates the temporal displacement. This ability can significantly confuse and disrupt opponents as they reappear with disadvantage on their attack rolls, hampering their effectiveness in the following turn.

As a bonus action, the Eonic Drifter can use Call to the Future once per day. This summons a future version of itself to an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The future self can make one Time-Warping Staff attack or assist the Drifter each turn. Its stats make it somewhat durable, with an Armor Class of 13 and 30 hit points, alongside resistances to various damage types. If this future self is destroyed, the Eonic Drifter must pass a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or suffer being stunned on its next turn, adding a layer of risk to using this ability.
