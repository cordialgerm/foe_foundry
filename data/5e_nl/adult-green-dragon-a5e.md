The Adult Green Dragon is a formidable creature known for its cunning intelligence and vast powers, making it a significant threat in any encounter. This huge dragon is particularly adept at stealth and manipulation, often taking advantage of forested environments where it can blend in and surprise its foes. With a challenge rating of 18, it has a high degree of resilience, backed by its 287 hit points and strong defensive capabilities, including a solid armor class of 18. The dragon's strengths lie in its array of special abilities and high damage output, alongside its capacity to control the battlefield using spells and fright tactics. However, despite its exceptional abilities, it has a relatively low Dexterity score, making it less agile than some opponents. 

The Adult Green Dragon possesses the following attributes: Strength 20 (+5, very good), Dexterity 12 (+1, average), Constitution 20 (+5, very good), Intelligence 18 (+4, very good), Wisdom 14 (+2, good), and Charisma 16 (+3, good). The dragon's saving throw bonuses are: Dexterity +7, Constitution +11, Wisdom +8, and Charisma +9, reflecting its strengths in Constitution and Charisma, which are very good.

This dragon is immune to poison damage and immune to the poisoned condition. It has sensory capabilities that include blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive Perception score of 21, allowing it to perceive its surroundings with exceptional clarity. The dragon can communicate in Common, Draconic, and two additional languages, enhancing its ability to engage or manipulate others.

The Adult Green Dragon has several special abilities. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water. It possesses Legendary Resistance, allowing it to succeed on a saving throw three times per day that it would have otherwise failed, albeit at the cost of shedding some scales. The Woodland Stalker ability grants it advantage on Stealth checks in forested areas and enables it to project its voice, making it difficult for adversaries to pinpoint its location while it speaks. Its innate spellcasting ability, using Charisma as the spellcasting modifier, lets it cast spells such as animal messenger, tongues, modify memory, and scrying up to three times each per day, requiring no material components.

The dragon's Multiattack capability allows it to deliver a combination of bite and claw attacks. The Bite deals 22 piercing damage and an additional 4 poison damage on a hit, with a +12 to hit. It can alternatively use Spit Poison, targeting a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw against 22 poison damage on a failure, and imposing a poisoned condition for one minute. Additionally, its claws can deal 19 slashing damage on a hit, while its Tail can deal 15 bludgeoning damage and push a target 10 feet away. 

The Poison Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of a 5 or 6, allows the dragon to exhale poisonous gas in a 60-foot cone, requiring creatures in the area to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw for potentially 63 poison damage, halved on a success. It is also noteworthy that creatures immune to poison damage do not take damage on a failed save but have their immunity temporarily reduced to resistance. 

The Honeyed Words ability can manipulate foes within 60 feet, compelling them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw; a failure results in them making an attack against a target of the dragon's choosing. 

In reaction to being struck, it can make a Tail Attack against a creature that hits it.

The dragon also has legendary actions, allowing it to take actions at the end of other creatures' turns. It can use its Honeyed Words, unleash a frightening Roar (requiring a DC 17 Charisma saving throw), or perform a Wing Attack, which can push nearby creatures back and knock them prone, while allowing the dragon to reposition itself in combat.
