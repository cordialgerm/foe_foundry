The Invisible Stalker is a Medium elemental creature known for its exceptional stealth and tracking abilities, making it a formidable foe in combat. With a challenge rating of 6, this creature has a high Armor Class of 14 and possesses 121 hit points, giving it a good level of durability. Its speed of 50 feet combined with its ability to fly at the same speed provides it with mobility that is above average, allowing it to navigate the battlefield with ease. The stalker’s strengths lie in its high Dexterity and Wisdom, which contribute to its outstanding Stealth score of 22, making it very difficult to detect. However, it is somewhat limited in its offensive capabilities, relying on its multiattack for damage output and needing to succeed in stealth checks to remain effective. 

In terms of attributes, the Invisible Stalker has a Strength of 13 (+3 modifier, which is average), Dexterity of 18 (+4 modifier, which is good), Constitution of 14 (+2 modifier, which is average), Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier, which is very bad), Wisdom of 20 (+5 modifier, which is very good), and a Charisma of 10 (+0 modifier, which is very bad). The stalker has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in the dark, and has a Perception score of 18, indicating good awareness of its surroundings. The creature also understands Common but cannot speak it, communicating instead through the Auran language.

The Invisible Stalker possesses several special abilities that enhance its gameplay mechanics. Its Elemental Nature grants it independence from air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without regular needs. The Elemental Resilience provides it with resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, along with immunity to poison damage and many negative conditions like exhaustion and paralysis. The Faultless Tracker ability enables the stalker to designate a quarry after a long rest, allowing it to track that creature's location as long as it is on the same plane. Additionally, its Invisibility allows it to remain undetected, contributing to its already high Stealth score.

In combat, the Invisible Stalker uses its Multiattack to make two Slam attacks with a +7 to hit. Each Slam deals an average of 13 bludgeoning damage plus 9 cold damage, bringing the total potential damage to approximately 22 on a successful hit. If the target is the stalker's designated quarry, they must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or their speed is halved until the end of their next turn.

As a bonus action, the stalker can use Steal Breath, targeting a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose the ability to speak or cast spells that require verbal components until the end of their next turn. Should the target fail the save by 5 or more, they become incapacitated and suffocating, adding a devastating layer of control and disruption to the stalker's tactical options in combat.
