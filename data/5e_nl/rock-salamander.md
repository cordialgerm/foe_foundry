The Rock Salamander is a tiny elemental creature that serves as a challenging adversary for low-level adventurers. With a modest Armor Class of 13 and a total of 27 hit points, it is equipped to withstand some damage, but its strengths lie primarily in its agility and stealth. It has a good Dexterity score of 17, allowing it to evade attacks efficiently, and it can move through rocky environments with ease. Its ability to manipulate its surroundings using stone-related actions provides tactical advantages in combat, although it suffers from low Strength and Charisma scores, which limits its effectiveness in direct melee confrontations and social interactions. The Rock Salamander is immune to poison damage and several debilitating conditions, making it a resilient foe in certain circumstances.

The Rock Salamander has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 8, which is a very bad score, indicating its physical power in combat is limited. 
- Dexterity: 17, a good score that enhances its ability to dodge attacks and improves its stealth capabilities. 
- Constitution: 14, a good score reflecting its moderate resilience to physical damage. 
- Intelligence: 5, a very bad score, means it isn't capable of complex thought or strategizing. 
- Wisdom: 13, an average score indicating a basic awareness of its surroundings. 
- Charisma: 8, a very bad score that implies difficulty in social situations.

In terms of skills, the Rock Salamander has a perception skill modifier of +1, which is an average level of awareness. The creature is immune to poison damage and is not affected by exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, poisoning, or unconsciousness, thus presenting a challenge for adventurers relying on these forms of control. It possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and tremorsense, giving it awareness of vibrations in the ground within the same distance. The Rock Salamander can understand Terran but lacks the ability to speak.

The Rock Salamander has several notable special abilities:
- Earth Glide allows it to burrow through nonmagical earth or stone without creating noise or disturbing the material. This ability provides excellent tactical options for ambushes or retreating.
- Stone Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in rocky terrain, enhancing its effectiveness in hiding from opponents.
- Stone Spider Climb enables it to traverse difficult stone surfaces, including climbing upside down, with no need for an ability check, making it incredibly versatile in rocky environments.

For actions, the Rock Salamander can perform a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 bonus to hit and deals 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage. This attack mechanism allows it to inflict reasonable damage to targets within a 5-foot range.

Additionally, the Rock Salamander can manipulate stone while touching it, which includes three distinct options:
1. Rumbling Earth: This ability forces one creature in contact with stone within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail are knocked prone, potentially leaving them vulnerable to subsequent attacks.
2. Softened Earth: Another option allows the salamander to restrain one creature touching stone within the same radius in a mud-like stone, requiring a DC 12 Strength saving throw to resist. The restrained target suffers movement restrictions until the end of its next turn.
3. Stone Armor: As a defensive tactic, the salamander can increase its Armor Class by 2 until the start of its next turn, improving its durability in combat.

Through these abilities and characteristics, the Rock Salamander proves to be a formidable, adaptable creature, particularly in rocky terrains where it can fully utilize its skills.
