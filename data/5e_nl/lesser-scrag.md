The Lesser Scrag is a Medium-sized Monstrosity characterized by its chaotic evil nature. This aquatic creature, primarily dwelling in water, is known for its formidable melee combat abilities complemented by its regeneration skill, which allows it to recover health when in contact with water. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, boasting decent physical strength and resilience. However, its limited mobility on land and vulnerability to acid or fire make it susceptible to specific strategies, thereby offering opportunities for clever tactics against it.

The Lesser Scrag has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average defense for creatures within its challenge rating. It possesses 45 hit points, derived from rolling seven eight-sided dice plus an additional 14 points, indicating that it can endure a fair amount of damage. This monster has a swim speed of 40 feet, which is very good for maneuverability in water, but its walking speed is limited to 10 feet, which is very bad for land traversal.

In terms of attributes, the Lesser Scrag displays the following scores: Strength at 18 (+4) which is exceptional and showcases its physical prowess; Dexterity at 10 (+0), indicating an average agility; Constitution at 15 (+2), which is good for sustaining combat; Intelligence at 8 (-1), classified as very bad; Wisdom at 10 (+0), average; and Charisma at 9 (-1), also very bad. The Lesser Scrag has a darkvision capacity of 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 10, granting it average sensory capabilities in dim light, as well as understanding two languages: Abyssal and Aquan.

The Lesser Scrag has a special ability called Amphibious, which allows it to breathe both air and water, making it equally formidable both in and out of water. Its Regeneration ability is potent; it recovers 5 hit points at the start of its turn while in water. However, if it receives acid or fire damage, it temporarily loses this regenerative capability until it can recover adequately. The creature is not considered dead until it begins its turn with 0 hit points and can no longer regenerate.

Regarding actions, the Lesser Scrag can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike with both its bite and claws in one turn. For its Bite attack, it makes a melee weapon attack roll with a +6 modifier to hit, which translates to a good chance of landing its strike. If successful, it delivers an average damage of 8 points, calculated as 1d8 plus 4. Its Claws attack also uses the same +6 to hit modifier, reaching out to attack a target within 5 feet. Upon hitting, it inflicts an average damage of 9 points, determined by rolling 2d4 plus 4. 

Overall, the Lesser Scrag combines solid melee attacks with reasonable survivability in water, making it a challenging opponent for unprepared adventurers.
