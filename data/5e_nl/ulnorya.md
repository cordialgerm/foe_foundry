The Ulnorya is a large aberration known for its neutral evil alignment. This creature thrives in combat, showcasing a solid Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 119, which provides it with considerable longevity in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, rewarding those who defeat it with 2,900 experience points. The Ulnorya is particularly adept at both melee and stealth attacks, benefiting from exceptional Dexterity and good Constitution. Its resistances to bludgeoning damage, immunities to poison damage, and the ability to become invisible provide it with unique tactical advantages in encounters, although it is not without its weaknesses.

The Ulnorya possesses the following key attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 18 (+4), Constitution 17 (+3), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 14 (+2). Its Dexterity gives it a very good modifier that enhances its ability to dodge attacks and perform acrobatic feats. The Ulnorya excels in saving throws for Dexterity (+7) and Constitution (+6), making it resilient against many attacks and effects. Its skills include Acrobatics (+7), Athletics (+5), Perception (+6), and Stealth (+10), with the latter two providing it with great capacities for sensing threats and remaining hidden.

The creature's special abilities contribute to its effectiveness in combat. Its Immutable Form makes it immune to any spell or effect that could change its physical shape, ensuring it remains a consistent threat. The Photoadaptive Hide ability allows the Ulnorya to become invisible if it doesnâ€™t move on its previous turn, potentially ambushing unsuspecting foes.

In combat, the Ulnorya can unleash a Multiattack, allowing it to make four attacks: one Bite, one Claw, and two with Tentacles. The Bite attack employs a +7 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 piercing damage, while also forcing the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 7 poison damage and could leave the target paralyzed for an hour, making the Bite a significant threat. The Claw attack also has a +7 to hit and inflicts 11 piercing damage. Its Tentacle attack, with a reach of 10 feet, inflicts 5 bludgeoning damage. 

The Ulnorya has a powerful Replicate ability, usable once per day, which allows it to split into two identical copies that share the original's hit points (divided by two). Both copies can act independently, complicating combat strategies for opponents. The copies are also subject to the same conditions and magical effects as the original. Notably, if they come within 5 feet of each other, they can use their reactions to recombine, thereby restoring their original hit points. This mechanic enables the Ulnorya to engage in tactical deception and resilience, continuing its threat to adventurers, especially if left unchecked for the duration of its replication.
