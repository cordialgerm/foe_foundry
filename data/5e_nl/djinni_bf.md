The Djinni is a formidable large elemental creature that embodies the power of the winds and sky. As an outsider, it possesses unique attributes and abilities that make it a potent force in combat and a valuable ally. With strong physical attributes, including a notable Strength of +5 and Dexterity of +6, the Djinni excels in both melee and ranged attacks. It boasts a high Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor, alongside an impressive pool of 216 Hit Points, allowing it to endure prolonged engagements. Although it is considered a Challenge Rating 11 creature, it has a high damage output and versatility, making it challenging for adventurers. Its weaknesses lie in its reliance on action economy, as its abilities can be quite complex in their execution. 

The Djinni has a Strength score of +5, which translates to good effectiveness in melee combat, and a Dexterity of +6, providing it with good agility. It also boasts a Constitution score of +6, granting it good stamina. Furthermore, it has a high Wisdom score of +7, making it exceptionally perceptive, with a Perception skill of 17. Its Charisma of +9 allows for exceptional social interactions and spellcasting abilities. The Djinni understands both Auran and Common languages and benefits from darkvision, enabling it to see in darkness up to 120 feet.

The Djinni possesses a unique special ability called "Nebulous," which allows it to assume a cloud form. While in this form, its Stealth modifier boosts to 21, allowing it to evade detection effectively. In this state, it can hover and is capable of passing through spaces that air can, but it cannot manipulate objects or attack. It can also hide within any container that is Tiny or larger, making it elusive in various environments.

In addition to its special abilities, the Djinni can perform several actions during its turn. It can use the Multiattack action to make three attacks with either its Scimitar or its Storm Bolt. Its Scimitar attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 12 slashing damage plus an additional 14 lightning or thunder damage, depending on the Djinni's choice. The Storm Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing a significant 18 lightning damage and an additional 7 thunder damage.

The Djinni also has the ability to create an air elemental once per day. This ability allows the Djinni to summon an air elemental of Challenge Rating 5 or lower within 30 feet, providing it with an ally that obeys its commands. Furthermore, it can travel to a different plane of existence once per day, functioning similarly to the plane shift spell, but only affecting itself.

As a bonus action, the Djinni can create whirlwinds around up to two creatures within 60 feet. Each target must make a DC 17 Strength check or be restrained by the whirlwind, adding battlefield control capabilities to its arsenal. Additionally, the Djinni has a "Genie Shape" ability that lets it transform into a Medium cloud of sparkling blue air or revert back to its bipedal form, retaining its statistics and transforming any equipment it carries along with it. This transformation provides both mobility and versatility in combat situations.
