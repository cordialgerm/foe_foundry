The Star-Nosed Diopsid is a formidable large aberration known for its lawful evil nature and its deep-rooted ties to magical venoms. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it serves as a potent adversary in combat, leveraging its varied abilities to control, poison, and physically dominate its foes. One of the most notable features of the Star-Nosed Diopsid is its ability to transform humanoids into new diopsids, creating a cycle of horror that can turn the tide of battle. It boasts strong physical stats, particularly in Strength (19) and Constitution (17), granting it great resilience and dealing significant damage. While it excels in melee combat, it is less effective against magical attacks, making it vulnerable to powerful spells and abilities.

In terms of attributes, the Star-Nosed Diopsid has the following statistics: Strength is 19, providing a good modifier of +4, which signifies its exceptional physical power. Dexterity is 14 with a +2 modifier, showing it has average agility. Constitution stands at 17 with a +3 modifier, representing its good endurance. Intelligence and Wisdom are both at 17 and 16 respectively, both with +3 and +3 modifiers, showcasing its balanced mental faculties. Finally, Charisma is 15 with a +2 modifier, indicating it has average social potential. The creature's saving throws are exceptional in Constitution (+7), Intelligence (+7), and Wisdom (+7), allowing it to resist effects that target these attributes effectively. Its passive perception of 17 indicates good awareness of its surroundings.

The Star-Nosed Diopsid possesses several notable special abilities. Its **Mutagenic Venom** creates a potent poison that envenoms humanoid victims, charming them and causing gradual health reduction. Each day the victim remains envenomed, they must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid having their maximum hit points reduced by 5. If their maximum HP drops to zero, they die and are horrifically transformed into a new diopsid, losing all memories of their former life. The only way to remove the poison is through spells like Greater Restoration, making it a deeply dangerous ability.

In combat, the Star-Nosed Diopsid can use **Multiattack** to make one Stinger attack and two Tentacle attacks. The **Stinger** attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, dealing an average of 26 piercing damage (4d10+4). If a humanoid is struck, they must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw against the diopsid’s venom. The **Tentacle** attack also has a +8 to hit, dealing 17 bludgeoning damage (3d8+4) and can grapple targets up to Large size with an escape DC of 16, hindering their movement.

Additionally, the Star-Nosed Diopsid can utilize **Share Senses** to see and hear through an envenomed humanoid's senses within 300 feet, gaining any benefits of the target’s special senses. The duration of this effect can be extended as a bonus action on subsequent turns. Finally, the diopsid has access to **Control Envenomed** up to three times a day, allowing it to telepathically suggest actions to an envenomed humanoid within 300 feet. The humanoid must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in pursuing the suggested activity. A successful save inflicts 11 (2d10) psychic damage and gives disadvantage on their next saving throw against this effect, demonstrating the diopsid's capacity for manipulation and control.
