The Zimwi is a medium-sized giant characterized by its chaotic evil nature, making it a formidable threat in combat. With an armor class of 16 thanks to its natural armor, and a significant pool of hit points totaling 110, the Zimwi is adept at sustaining damage. It is particularly rapid, able to walk at a speed of 60 feet. The challenge rating of 5 indicates that it is a moderately challenging adversary for adventurers, offering 1,800 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the Zimwi possesses high dexterity and constitution scores, which enhance its agility and hit point endurance, but lacks mental acuity, as reflected in its low intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Its unique ability, Desperate Hunger, allows it to become especially dangerous when its health dips below half, granting it an advantage on melee attack rolls against non-construct creatures, making it a tenacious opponent when weakened.

The Zimwi's attribute scores are as follows: Strength is 13, which provides a bad modifier for strength-based checks; Dexterity is 18, granting a very good modifier of +4 that enhances its agility and attack accuracy; Constitution is 19, resulting in a good +4 modifier that bolsters its hit points; Intelligence is low at 6 with a very bad -2 modifier, indicating it has poor reasoning abilities; Wisdom is 9, giving it a bad -1 modifier, affecting perception; and Charisma is 7, translating to a very bad -2 modifier in social interactions. It has a Perception skill bonus of +2, utilizing its passive perception of 12 to detect hidden creatures and objects, while having darkvision that allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light.

The Zimwi's combat abilities include Multiattack, which enables it to make one Bite and one Claw attack during its turn, increasing its threat in combat. The Bite attack uses a melee weapon attack roll with a +7 modifier to hit, capable of dealing 13 piercing damage on a successful hit. Its Claw attack also uses a +7 modifier to hit and deals 11 slashing damage. On a successful hit, it can grapple a Medium or smaller creature with its claws, and the target must make an escape check against a difficulty of 12 to break free. 

Additionally, the Zimwi can utilize its Swallow ability to consume a creature it has grappled, inflicting a Bite attack against it. If this attack connects, the target is swallowed, becoming blinded and restrained while suffering ongoing acid damage of 10 (3d6) at the start of each of the Zimwi's turns. Notably, the Zimwi can swallow up to two creatures at once, allowing it to effectively neutralize multiple opponents and provide itself with protection while they are inside.

Overall, the Zimwi's combination of high dexterity, mighty constitution, multi-attack capabilities, and its ability to swallow foes make it a formidable and fearsome giant in any encounter, especially when wounded and driven by desperate hunger.
