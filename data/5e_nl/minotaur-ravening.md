The Ravening Minotaur is a large monstrosity with a chaotic evil alignment, notorious for its brutal and relentless nature. It possesses a formidable armor class of 14 due to its natural armor and has a significant pool of hit points totaling 85, making it a tough adversary in combat. With a movement speed of 40 feet, it can close the distance to its enemies quickly, enhancing its role as a powerful melee combatant. This creature has a challenge rating of 3, which indicates it is a moderate threat, yielding 700 experience points upon defeat. 

The Minotaur's physical abilities are quite impressive, with a Strength score of 18 (+4), classifying it as having very good physical power, and a Constitution score of 16 (+3), providing it with a robust health pool and resilience. However, its Dexterity is average at 11 (+0), indicating it lacks agility. Intellectually, it is quite poor, with an Intelligence score of 6 (-2), and its Charisma of 9 (-1) means it does not possess significant social skills. The Minotaurâ€™s Wisdom score of 16 (+3) provides it with a good understanding of its surroundings, enhancing its perception abilities.

In terms of special abilities, the Minotaur's Charge allows it to deal extra damage when it moves straight toward a target and successfully strikes it. If the target is a creature, they must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed back and knocked prone. Its Keen Smell grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, which can help it track opponents. Through Labyrinthine Recall, the Minotaur can perfectly remember any path it has traveled, making it exceptionally difficult to escape once engaged. The Ravening Hunger ability enables it to consume the hearts of its fallen foes, increasing its maximum hit points, which can make it more challenging as the fight goes on. 

Ravening Madness represents a double-edged sword, imposing disadvantages on Intelligence checks and saving throws while causing the Minotaur to view all creatures as hostile. This makes its interactions with allies nearly impossible, aside from magical healing. Its Reckless ability provides an opportunity to gain an advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls for the turn, at the cost of having all attack rolls against it gaining an advantage until the start of its next turn, encouraging aggressive play.

For actions, the Minotaur executes a Multiattack, which allows it to perform one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit and can deal 8 piercing damage, while also providing the Minotaur with temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt if it successfully hits. Targets hit by the Bite must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected with a ravening condition. The Claw attack also has a +6 to hit, dealing 7 slashing damage. Lastly, the Gore attack can also be executed with a +6 to hit, inflicting significant damage of 13 piercing damage.

Overall, the Ravening Minotaur is a fierce opponent that thrives in close-quarters combat, using its strength and unique abilities to inflict damage while sustaining itself through its gruesome consumption of enemies.
