The Empyrean is immune to radiant damage and damage from nonmagical weapons, making it a formidable opponent in battle – its truesight ability allows it to see through normal and magical darkness, giving it an edge in combat and tactical situations. Its passive perception of 17 underscores its keen awareness of its surroundings.

The Empyrean possesses remarkable special abilities:

- **Divine Grace**: This ability allows the Empyrean to negate damage from effects that deal half damage on a successful saving throw, and instead take no damage if it succeeds. While wearing medium armor, its high Dexterity bonus is added to its Armor Class, enhancing its already high defensive capability.

- **Innate Spellcasting**: The Empyrean’s spellcasting ability is based on Charisma, with a spell save DC of 23. It can cast several powerful spells at will, including charm person, command, and telekinesis, as well as more devastating spells like flame strike and hold monster three times per day. Once per day, it can cast commune, greater restoration, heroes feast, and plane shift (self-only). This diverse spellcasting allows it to interact effectively both in and out of combat.

In terms of its actions, the Empyrean has a range of potent offensive capabilities:

- **Maul**: This melee weapon attack has a +17 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. If successful, it deals 38 bludgeoning damage (8d6 + 10) plus an additional 14 radiant damage (4d6) to the target, which then must make a DC 25 Strength saving throw. Failure results in being pushed back up to 30 feet and knocked prone, significantly affecting positioning in combat.

- **Lightning Bolt**: This spell creates a 5-foot-wide and 100-foot-long bolt of lightning that deals 28 lightning damage (8d6) on a failed DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or half damage on a success.

- **Flame Strike**: When casting this spell, the Empyrean causes a column of divine fire to fill a 10-foot-radius area within 60 feet of it. Creatures must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 14 fire damage and 14 radiant damage (4d6 each) on a failure or half damage on a success.

- **Hold Monster**: The Empyrean can paralyze one visible creature within 60 feet by forcing it to make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails, it remains paralyzed for 1 minute, repeating the save at the end of its turns.

The Empyrean can also utilize bonus actions:

- **Immortal Form**: This ability allows the Empyrean to shift its size between Gargantuan and Medium. While in Medium form, it suffers disadvantage on Strength checks, yet retains all other statistics.

Additionally, the Empyrean has a suite of legendary actions that can be utilized after another creature's turn:

- It can make a weapon attack or cast a spell, provided it hasn't cast a spell since the start of its last turn.
- It can fly up to half its fly speed.
- **Shout (Recharge 5-6)**: This legendary action affects all creatures within a 120-foot radius that can hear the Empyrean, forcing a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. On failure, a creature takes 24 thunder damage (7d6) and is stunned until the end of the Empyrean's next turn, while success halves the damage.

Overall, the Empyrean embodies celestial might, able to deliver physical destruction and manipulate the battlefield with its potent spells and abilities. It stands as a formidable encounter for any adventuring party.
