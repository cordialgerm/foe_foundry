The Lindwurm is a formidable Large Dragon with a neutral evil alignment, often lurking in icy terrain. This creature boasts a sturdy armor class of 15 and a total of 136 hit points, giving it a fair amount of resilience in combat. With a challenge rating of 6, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, capable of dealing considerable damage with its bite and claw attacks. The Lindwurm excels in environments that are snowy or icy, leveraging its special abilities which allow it to move effortlessly across such terrain. However, it has notable weaknesses, particularly its vulnerability to fire damage and an average intelligence score that limits its capacity for strategic combat. 

In terms of its abilities, the Lindwurm has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4, which is very good), Dexterity 20 (+5, exceptional), Constitution 16 (+3, good), Intelligence 6 (-2, very bad), Wisdom 12 (+1, average), and Charisma 8 (-1, bad). Its save modifiers include Strength +7 (good), Dexterity +8 (very good), and Constitution +6 (good). The creature is skilled in Acrobatics +8 (very good), Athletics +7 (good), Perception +4 (average), and Stealth +8 (very good). The Lindwurm has damage vulnerabilities to fire and is immune to cold damage, as well as to being paralyzed and unconscious.

The Lindwurm also possesses several notable special abilities. Its Ice Walk ability allows it to traverse icy surfaces without difficulty, meaning it can ignore the usual challenges of moving through such terrain. Additionally, under the Sure-Footed Skater ability while on ice or snow, it gains advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws that would otherwise knock it prone, making it difficult to take down in its preferred habitat.

In terms of combat actions, the Lindwurm can perform a Multiattack, making one Bite attack and two Claw attacks or substituting a Bite with a Constrict attack. With its Bite attack, it has a +8 to hit, reaches 10 feet, and deals 16 piercing damage (2d10 + 5). Additionally, if it successfully strikes a creature, that target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with a disease, leading to potential poisoning until cured. If the infected creature fails at least once during its long rests, it suffers exhaustion levels. The Claw attack, also with a +8 to hit reaching out 5 feet, deals 12 slashing damage (2d6 + 5). Lastly, its Constrict attack similarly has +8 to hit and reaches 10 feet, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 5). This attack also grapples the target, restraining it until it escapes, adding layers of difficulty for the opponents.

Overall, the Lindwurm is a dangerous foe, particularly adept at exploiting its icy environment while simultaneously presenting a series of threats through its disease-inflicting bite and grappling ability.
