The Brass Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon known for its fiery breath and magical abilities, serving as both a formidable opponent and a cunning trickster. This young dragon possesses a good level of power, with an Armor Class of 16 and hit points totaling 38, making it a tough adversary for lower-level adventurers. Its challenge rating of 2 reflects its capabilities in combat, allowing it to deal significant damage, especially with its ranged breath attacks. However, its physical attributes, while respectable, are not exceptionally high, giving it some vulnerabilities. Notably, it is immune to fire damage, which grants it a strategic advantage against foes relying on fire-based attacks. The brass dragon's ability to easily sustain itself with minimal food and water also highlights its resilience in prolonged encounters.

In terms of senses, the brass dragon has blindsight up to 10 feet, darkvision extending 60 feet, and a passive perception score of 13; all of these contribute to its awareness in various environments. It communicates in Draconic, showcasing its intelligence and cultured nature. Its special ability, Self-Sufficient, allows it to thrive on just a quart of water and a pound of food each day, emphasizing its efficiency in survival.

When it comes to actions, the Brass Dragon Wyrmling can make a Bite melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 piercing damage (2d10 + 2) upon a successful hit. It can unleash its breath weapons, which recharge on a roll of 5-6. 

The first breath weapon is called Molten Breath, where the dragon exhales molten glass in a line that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in this area must make a DC 11 saving throw, suffering 10 fire damage (3d6) on a failed save and half damage on a successful one. The second breath weapon is Sleep Breath, where the dragon exhales a gas in a 15-foot cone. Creatures within the cone must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw; failure results in the creature falling unconscious for 10 minutes or until they take damage or are awakened by another creature's action. These breath weapons provide the dragon with powerful crowd control options, making it a versatile foe in combat.
