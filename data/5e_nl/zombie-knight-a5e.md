The Zombie Knight is a medium undead creature that embodies a fearsome and relentless force of decay. With a solid Armor Class of 16 and 52 hit points, it presents a moderate threat on the battlefield, especially with its high Strength modifier and resistance to certain conditions. Its primary role in combat is as a frontline brawler, using its melee attacks to disrupt and damage enemies. The Zombie Knight possesses some notable strengths, including abilities that allow it to continue fighting even after taking lethal damage, and it is immune to poison and fatigue. However, it has weaknesses as well, such as low Dexterity and Intelligence scores, making it rather slow and not particularly clever in battle.

The Zombie Knight has Strength at 16 (+3), making its melee attacks effective and formidable; this is considered good. Dexterity is low at 6 (-2), which is very bad, affecting its speed and defenses against ranged attacks. Constitution is decent at 14 (+2), leading to average durability. Intelligence is very low at 3 (-4), which is very bad as it limits its understanding and tactics. Wisdom at 8 (-1) is bad, affecting its perception and willpower. Finally, Charisma is also very low at 4 (-3), indicating a lack of social influence or presence.

In terms of special abilities, the Zombie Knight has **Undead Fortitude** which can be used once per day. This ability allows the Zombie Knight to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0 when it receives damage that is not radiant or from a critical hit, after which it falls prone and is stunned until the end of its next turn. This mechanic can turn the tides of battle, allowing the Zombie Knight to continue functioning as a threat even when it appears to be defeated. Additionally, its **Undead Nature** grants it immunity to the need for air, food, or sleep, enhancing its resilience during extended engagements.

In combat, the Zombie Knight utilizes **Multiattack**, allowing it to make two melee attacks in one turn, significantly increasing its potential output per round. Its primary weapon is a **Greatsword**, which it attacks with, using a +5 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 10 slashing damage (2d6 + 3). This damage is considered good for a level 3 challenge. The Zombie Knight can also use **Grab**, making another melee attack with a +5 to hit; if it succeeds, it deals 6 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 3) and grapples the target if it is Medium or smaller, limiting its ability to attack until it escapes (Escape DC 13). Lastly, it has a **Bite** attack, which can only be used against creatures it has grappled. This attack also has a +5 to hit, and on a successful strike, it deals 8 piercing damage (1d10 + 3), allowing the Zombie Knight to regain hit points equal to the damage dealt, which can make it quite difficult to take down over time. 

The combination of these abilities and attacks makes the Zombie Knight a formidable undead foe that can endure substantial punishment while still presenting a lethal threat in close combat scenarios.
