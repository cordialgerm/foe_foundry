The orca is a formidable and intelligent huge beast, often found in aquatic environments. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who venture into its territory. Orcas have strong physical capabilities, reflected in their solid Strength score of +4, allowing for powerful melee attacks. Though their Dexterity and Constitution are average, their impressive swimming speed of 60 feet enables them to navigate swiftly through water. However, they have low Intelligence and Charisma, making them less capable in social interactions or complex strategies. Notable abilities include echolocation, which helps them navigate underwater, and a remarkable capability to hold their breath for extended periods. Despite their strength, they have limitations, particularly on land where their speed drops to 0 feet.

The orca has an Armor Class of 12 due to natural armor, providing a below-average defense. With 80 hit points, they can withstand a fair amount of damage during encounters. Their solid physical attributes make them good at dealing and absorbing damage, while their keen senses allow them to be aware of their surroundings.

Now looking into the orca's attributes, it has the following abilities ranked by effectiveness: Strength +4 (good), Dexterity +0 (average), Constitution +1 (average), Intelligence -4 (very bad), Wisdom +1 (average), and Charisma -2 (bad). Its keen sense perception reaches 120 feet, allowing it to detect movement and distinguish between sound sources effectively, although it cannot utilize this ability while deafened.

In terms of actions, the orca can perform a Multiattack and make two Bite attacks, each with a melee weapon attack bonus of +6 to hit. On a successful hit, the Bite attack deals an average of 14 piercing damage, calculated as 3d6 + 4. This offers a very good offensive option against weaker opponents.

The orca also has a powerful Tail Slap as a bonus action. This involves slapping a target within 15 feet, requiring the target to make a Strength saving throw with a DC of 14. On a failed save, the target is pushed away up to 15 feet and is knocked prone. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, they are stunned until the end of their next turn, making the Tail Slap a devastating ability that can change the dynamics of combat considerably.

Overall, the orca's unique abilities and physical prowess make it a dangerous creature in aquatic settings, with its capacity to deal significant damage and control its enemies effectively.
