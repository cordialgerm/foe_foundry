The Clacker Soldier is a small beast that thrives in battle with its unique abilities and resilient nature. With an Armor Class of 15 and 18 hit points, these creatures exhibit decent durability for their size. They have a Challenge Rating of 1, making them a manageable adversary for lower-level parties. Their strengths come from their ability to deal significant piercing damage and create a disruptive thunderous noise that affects multiple enemies, making them a tactical threat despite their low intelligence and charisma. They possess immunities to thunder damage and resistance to slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, highlighting their resilience in combat. However, their low strength and poor mental attributes make them vulnerable to strategies that exploit these weaknesses.

The Clacker Soldier's ability scores include a strength of 8, which is considered very bad and results in a -1 modifier, indicating limited physical prowess. Dexterity is at 14, granting a good +2 modifier, which improves its ability to evade attacks and enhances its dexterity-based skills. Constitution is decent at 13, providing a +1 modifier for a reasonable level of durability. Intelligence is very low at 1 with a -5 modifier, meaning the creature is not capable of understanding or performing complex tasks. Wisdom stands at 7, resulting in a bad -2 modifier, which reflects its limited perception beyond its physical senses. Charisma is also very low at 3, translating to a -4 modifier, so it has little to no social presence or influence.

The Clacker Soldier has proficiency in the Perception skill, with a total of -2 to its modifier, making its passive perception score 8, which allows it to notice ambushes or hidden creatures to a limited degree. Its unique trait, Compact, allows it to occupy the same space as another Clacker Soldier, enabling strategic positioning during battles. 

In combat scenarios, the Clacker Soldier can attack using its Bite action. It performs a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, meaning it has a good chance of successfully landing a strike against an opponent. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts an average of 11 piercing damage due to rolling 2d8+2.

Another significant ability is Clack, where the Clacker Soldier clacks its mandibles to generate a thunderous sound that affects all creatures within a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area takes an average of 5 thunder damage, with a Constitution saving throw (DC 13) allowing targets to take half damage on a success. An important tactical aspect of this ability is that if multiple Clacker Soldiers use Clack simultaneously and their cones overlap, affected creatures make a single saving throw at disadvantage against the combined damage from all overlapping attacks. This feature allows the Clacker Soldiers to coordinate effectively, potentially overwhelming their opponents with sound damage if they act in concert.
