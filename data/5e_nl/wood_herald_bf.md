The Wood Herald is a small plant creature that embodies the essence of nature and acts as a guardian of the woods. With a moderate Armor Class of 13 and 27 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, particularly considering its resistances to exhaustion and various debilitating conditions. While it moves slowly with a speed of 20 feet, it can climb with the same efficiency. The Wood Herald is a Challenge Rating of 1/2, making it a manageable foe for lower-level adventurers. It excels in environments that offer cover, thanks to its Plant Camouflage ability, allowing it to become significantly harder to detect when surrounded by foliage. It can attack using physical strikes or ranged thorns, and its special reactions can punish melee attackers.

The Wood Herald has the following attributes: Strength is +2 (good), Dexterity is +1 (average), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is +0 (very bad), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is +0 (very bad). Its sensory capabilities include darkvision up to 60 feet, and with a Perception score of 11 and Stealth skill of 13, it can maneuver effectively in its natural surroundings. The Wood Herald can communicate in Common and Sylvan.

Special abilities enhance the Wood Herald’s survivability and combat effectiveness. With Plant Camouflage, it has a Stealth score of 18 when in areas with plenty of plant life, making it exceptionally sneaky. Plant Resilience grants it immunity to exhaustion and resistance against being paralyzed, petrified, or rendered unconscious, which is very good for maintaining its presence in battle. The Woodland Walk ability allows the Wood Herald to navigate difficult terrain made of nonmagical plants without penalty, and it can move through such plants unharmed.

In terms of actions, the Wood Herald can perform the Slam attack with a +4 to hit, delivering 7 bludgeoning damage on a successful strike, which is a solid melee option. It also wields a Wooden Greataxe, which has the same +4 attack bonus, inflicting 8 slashing damage—this makes it a good choice for two-handed melee combat. For ranged attacks, the Wood Herald can use Hurl Thorn, rolling a +3 to hit for 6 piercing damage, which allows it to engage opponents from afar in a tactical manner.

As a reaction, when a creature successfully hits the Wood Herald with a melee attack while they are within 5 feet, it can activate Brambly Bark. This ability enables the Wood Herald to retaliate by dealing 2 piercing damage to the attacker, providing it with an effective deterrent against close combat threats.
