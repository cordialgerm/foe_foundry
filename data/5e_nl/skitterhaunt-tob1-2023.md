The Skitterhaunt is a Large ooze creature that operates unaligned in nature. This monster is particularly known for its ability to infest other creatures, making it dangerous to any large or smaller beasts it encounters. Its relatively good Armor Class of 14 and solid Hit Points totaling 95 give it respectable durability in combat. The Skitterhaunt excels at delivering acid damage, boasting a combination of natural attacks and special abilities that can severely debilitate its opponents. However, it suffers from rather low Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, which make it less effective in initiating interactions or avoiding detection. Its unique abilities, like Vermin Encasement, allow it to persist even when reduced to zero hit points, transforming into a smaller, but still threatening ooze form.

The attributes of the Skitterhaunt are as follows: Strength is 15, granting it a good +2 modifier that allows it to hit hard in melee combat. Dexterity is average at 11, yielding no modifier, indicating it lacks nimbleness. Constitution is particularly high at 19, giving a very good +4 modifier which contributes significantly to its Hit Points. Intelligence is very low at 3 with a -4 modifier, meaning it struggles with tasks that require thought and reasoning. Wisdom is also poor at 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, causing it to be vulnerable to perception challenges. Charisma is extremely low at 1 with a -5 modifier, making social interactions almost impossible for the creature.

The Skitterhaunt possesses several remarkable special abilities. **Broken Shell** causes any creature that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet to incur 4 (1d8) acid damage, acting as a deterrent to close-range attackers. With **Ooze Nature**, it is immune to the need for sleep, allowing it to remain vigilant indefinitely. The **Vermin Encasement** ability allows the Skitterhaunt to survive in a host's exoskeleton, becoming a Small ooze when reduced to 0 hit points, with lower armor class and hit points but increased mobility.

In combat, the Skitterhaunt uses a **Multiattack** to either deliver one Mandibles attack and one Sting attack, or two Sting attacks. The **Mandibles** attack has a +4 to hit, and it deals 5 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage along with 9 (2d8) acid damage, and it can grapple Medium or smaller creatures with an escape DC of 12, effectively restraining them. The **Sting** attack also has a +4 to hit, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage, presenting a formidable risk for opponents.

The most sinister ability, **Infest Vermin**, allows the Skitterhaunt to invade the body of a large or smaller beast, requiring a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to resist its poison. Failure to save leads to taking 7 (2d6) acid damage daily and a reduction in hit point maximum until a long rest is completed. If the target acquires the fortunate circumstance of succeeding two consecutive saves, it can force the Skitterhaunt out, gaining immunity to further infestations for 24 hours.

Finally, the Skitterhaunt demonstrates its offensive prowess with **Acid Spray** (Recharge 6), an attack that involves spitting acid in a 30-foot long and 5-foot wide line. Creatures within this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) acid damage if they fail, or half as much damage on a success. This ability allows it to strike multiple foes at once, amplifying its threat on the battlefield.
