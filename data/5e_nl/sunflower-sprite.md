The Sunflower Sprite is a small fey creature embodying a neutral good alignment, known for its connection to nature and its radiant abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it is suitable for low-level encounters, providing utility and support to its allies rather than acting as a frontline fighter. This sprite has a moderate armor class of 12 and possesses 14 hit points, making it relatively fragile in combat. However, its dexterity and charisma make it agile and capable of charm or influence. Notably, this creature thrives in sunlight, which enhances its abilities, but it suffers when deprived of natural light. The Sunflower Sprite stands out due to its magic resistance, making it resilient against spell effects and its ability to communicate with plants.

The creature has the following ability scores: 
- Strength: 8, which is very bad, indicating it is not physically strong.
- Dexterity: 14, providing a good modifier of +2 for agility and reflexes.

- Intelligence: 10, also average, suggesting a basic level of comprehension.
- Wisdom: 14, reflecting a good +2 modifier for insights and perception.
- Charisma: 16, with a very good +3 modifier, making it effective in interactions and enchantments.

It possesses the following skills: it has a perception skill with a +2 modifier, providing an average advantage in noticing hidden details.

The Sunflower Sprite can converse in Sylvan, the language of the fey and nature, allowing for niche communication.

Special abilities of the Sunflower Sprite include:
- Diurnal: This ability means that during nighttime or underground, the sprite has disadvantage on its initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks, making it less effective in those situations.
- Magic Resistance: This grants the sprite an advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, enhancing its survivability against arcane threats.
- Speak with Plants: The sprite can communicate with plants, allowing for unique interactions in nature-rich environments.
- Variable Illumination: The sprite can emit bright light over a range from 5 to 20 feet and dim light for additional distance equal to the chosen radius. It can adjust the radius as a bonus action but can only use this ability if it has been exposed to sunlight in the last 24 hours.

In combat, the Sunflower Sprite can perform several actions:
- Radiant Leaf: The sprite makes a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing 4 slashing damage plus an additional 5 radiant damage on a hit, making it a decent option for dealing damage in close-range situations.
- Light Ray: This is a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, effectively hitting targets at a distance of 60 feet and dealing 8 radiant damage, allowing it to support allies from afar.
- Healing Radiance: This action, which recharges after a short or long rest, emits a warm light that allows each friendly creature within 10 feet to regain 5 hit points. However, it cannot be used if the sprite has not been exposed to sunlight in the past 24 hours, limiting its healing capability in prolonged underground encounters or during the night.
