The Young Copper Dragon is a formidable creature in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, known for its intelligence and cunning in combat. This large dragon boasts an impressive Armor Class of 17, providing it with strong defense due to its natural armor. With a total of 144 hit points, it can endure a significant amount of damage before succumbing. The copper dragon is quite agile, facilitated by a movement speed of 40 feet, and possesses the ability to climb and fly at similar speeds, giving it excellent mobility in various environments. Rated with a Challenge Rating of 7, it is suitable for mid-level parties, presenting a substantial challenge. The dragon excels with its acid-based attacks, particularly its Acid Breath ability, which can cause wide-ranging damage. However, its weaknesses lie primarily in its reliance on its breath weapon, with a recharge mechanic that may limit its effectiveness during prolonged encounters.

The Young Copper Dragon has the following attributes: Strength +4 (good), Dexterity +4 (good), Constitution +6 (very good), Intelligence +3 (average), Wisdom +4 (good), and Charisma +5 (very good). With such impressive Constitution and Charisma, it maintains high hit points and effectiveness in social interactions. Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet and keen senses, enhancing its ability to perceive threats. The dragon has a skill of 17 in Perception (very good) and can hide effectively with a Stealth skill of 14 (average). It understands Common and Draconic languages, enabling it to communicate with a variety of entities.

One of its notable special abilities is Corrosive Scales. This ability causes any metal weapon that strikes the copper dragon to corrode, reducing its effectiveness with a cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls each time it hits. If a nonmagical weapon's penalty reaches −5, it is destroyed. Furthermore, any nonmagical metal ammunition that impacts the dragon is also destroyed. Magic weapons are more resilient, suffering no greater than a −5 penalty and recovering after a long rest.

The Young Copper Dragon can utilize several actions in combat:
- **Multiattack:** This allows the dragon to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it can substitute a Bite attack for a use of Slowing Breath when available.
- **Bite:** A melee attack with a +7 to hit against a single target, causing 15 piercing damage on a successful hit.
- **Claw:** Similar to the Bite, this melee attack also has a +7 to hit but deals 11 slashing damage.
- **Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales a destructive line of acid, stretching 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures caught in this area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 40 acid damage (calculated as 9d8) on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.
- **Slowing Breath (Recharge 6):** This ability creates a 30-foot cone that can impede the movements of creatures caught within it. The affected creatures must also succeed on a DC 14 saving throw to avoid the effect.

Additionally, the dragon has a **Change Shape** bonus action, allowing it to transform into any beast or humanoid with a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or revert back to its true dragon form. In this new form, the Young Copper Dragon retains its hit points and ability to speak, while adopting the statistics and capabilities of the new form, fostering versatility in both combat and social situations.
