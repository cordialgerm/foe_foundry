The Wraith is a Medium Undead creature that embodies fear and death, often serving as a formidable opponent for adventurers. It has a significant challenge rating of 5, reflecting its potency and the threat it poses to any who cross its path. Wraiths are known for their incorporeal nature, allowing them to move freely through obstacles, and their ability to sap life from their victims. With an Armor Class of 13 and 67 hit points, they can withstand a moderate amount of damage but should not be underestimated due to their unique abilities and resistances. Notably, they are immune to necrotic and poison damage, making them especially dangerous in encounters with characters relying on such attack types. Wraiths excel in dealing necrotic damage and controlling the battlefield with fear, but their Light Sensitivity makes them vulnerable when exposed to bright light.

The Wraith has a Strength of 8, giving it a very bad modifier of -1, which means it is physically weak and not adept in melee combat. Its Dexterity is 16, providing it with a good +3 modifier, granting it good agility and a better chance to evade attacks. With a Constitution score of 16, the Wraith has a good +3 modifier, which contributes positively to its hit points and resilience. The Intelligence score is 12, resulting in an average +1 modifier, which indicates basic understanding but not exceptional cunning. Wisdom is at 16 with a good +3 modifier, helping it resist certain effects and contributing to its fear aura. Finally, Charisma is 14, giving it a good +2 modifier, which is reflected in its ability to instill fear and manipulate the battlefield.

The Wraith possesses several special abilities that impact gameplay significantly. Its "Aura of Fear" causes creatures that start their turn within 10 feet to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in being frightened until the start of their next turn. Creatures that succeed or have the effect end for them become immune to this feat for 24 hours. The Wraithâ€™s "Evil" aura radiates an unsettling presence that can influence interactions and weaken opponents. The "Incorporeal" trait allows the Wraith to pass through other creatures and objects, although it incurs damage if it ends its turn inside an object. However, it loses this ability when it takes radiant damage until the end of its next turn. "Light Sensitivity" imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks when in bright light. Lastly, the "Undead Nature" ability allows the Wraith to function without air, food, drink, or sleep, making it tireless and relentless.

In terms of actions, the Wraith has the "Life Drain" attack, which targets a creature within 5 feet and forces the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, or 21 (6d6) if it is frightened or surprised, along with a reduction in its hit point maximum by an amount equal to the damage taken until it finishes a long rest. If this reduction reduces the creature's maximum hit points to 0, it dies. The Wraith also has the ability "Create Specter," which allows it to touch a humanoid corpse it killed within the last day, causing the spirit to rise as a specter under the Wraith's control, thus expanding its undead influence over the battlefield.
