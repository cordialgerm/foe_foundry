The Herald of Darkness is a formidable Large Fiend that embodies malevolence and cunning. With a neutral evil alignment, it revels in causing fear and chaos, making it a dangerous adversary in combat scenarios. Its strengths lie in its high physical and magical defenses, notably its immunity to necrotic and poison damage, alongside various resistances, rendering it durable in battle. Offensively, it can deal substantial necrotic damage while also possessing the ability to paralyze its foes, showcasing its control over the battlefield. However, it is relatively vulnerable to radiant damage and any abilities that exploit its lower Intelligence. In summary, the Herald of Darkness stands as a threatening creature that combines resilience with potent offensive capabilities.

The Herald has an Armor Class (AC) of 15, which is considered good for a creature of this size, allowing it to withstand moderate attacks. It has a total of 105 hit points, calculated as 10d10 plus a generous 50, indicating a solid level of endurance in prolonged encounters. The creature has a movement speed of 30 feet on the ground and can fly at the same speed, providing mobility both on land and in the air.

The Herald’s ability scores are impressive, with a Strength of 20 (+5 modifier), which is exceptional, allowing it to excel in physical contests. Its Dexterity of 14 (+2) is good, while its Constitution of 20 (+5) is also exceptional, contributing significantly to its durability and effectiveness in resisting physical and magical attacks. The Intelligence score of 12 (+1) is average, not particularly notable, while Wisdom at 15 (+2) is good, aiding in perception checks. Finally, its Charisma, a crucial score for its abilities, is at 19 (+4), which is very good, allowing it to manipulate and affect enemies effectively.

For saving throws, the Herald has a Strength modifier of +8, a Constitution modifier of +8, and a Charisma modifier of +7, all of which are exceptional and bolster its ability to resist various effects. Its skills include Athletics (+8), Deception (+7), Perception (+5), and Stealth (+5), showing a well-rounded capability for both physical challenges and subterfuge.

Regarding immunities, the Herald of Darkness is immune to necrotic and poison damage, which protects it significantly against many common attacks. It also has resistance to bludgeoning, cold, and lightning damage, further enhancing its survivability. In terms of condition immunities, the creature is unaffected by exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it a highly resilient foe. With darkvision that extends to 240 feet and a passive Perception score of 15, the Herald has excellent capabilities for detection in low-light conditions.

The Herald possesses two special abilities crucial for its combat style. The "Made of Shadows" ability grants it resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage while in shadow form. It can also move through narrow spaces without restriction, allowing it to surprise enemies strategically. The "Shadow’s Sight" ability ensures that magical darkness does not hinder its enhanced vision.

In terms of actions, the Herald can execute a multiattack, allowing it to make two separate attacks using either its Embrace Darkness or Shadow Sword abilities. The Embrace Darkness is a melee spell attack that targets a creature occupying the same space, with a +7 attack bonus. On a successful hit, it deals 18 necrotic damage and forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; failure results in paralysis until the end of the creature’s next turn. The Shadow Sword is a melee weapon attack, with a +8 to hit, and has a reach of 10 feet. A successful hit inflicts 14 slashing damage plus an additional 9 necrotic damage.

The "Majesty of the Abyss" ability can be used after a recharge period of 5–6. When activated, it emits a wave of infernal power that requires each creature within 15 feet to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail take 27 necrotic damage and are blinded for one minute, while successful saves halve the damage and avoid blindness. Creatures that roll poorly may also find themselves paralyzed for a turn, showing the devastating impact this ability can have.

As a bonus action, the Herald can use "Shadow Shape" to change its form into a Large shadow or revert to its Fiend form. This transformation does not affect its statistics and any carried equipment undergoes a similar transformation, making it a versatile option in battle. If the Herald dies, it automatically returns to its Fiend form.
