The Ley Wanderer is a huge aberration known for its mastery over magic and psychic abilities. This creature melds physical presence with extraordinary magical capabilities, making it a formidable opponent in combat. It boasts a high number of hit points at 136, allowing it to absorb damage effectively, while its mixed-use attack options and unique abilities enable it to disrupt magic, dealing significant psychic damage. However, it has average dexterity, making its physical defenses somewhat lacking. Its strength lies in its ability to sense magic and manipulate it, reflecting its role as a magical predator in the D&D universe.

The Ley Wanderer has the following attributes: Strength of 14, Dexterity of 9, Constitution of 14, Intelligence of 19, Wisdom of 11, and Charisma of 10. Its Strength modifier is good, providing it effective capabilities in melee combat, while its low Dexterity results in a very bad modifier, affecting its agility and ability to avoid attacks. The Constitution modifier is good, contributing to its hit points, but it has a very high Intelligence modifier of +4, which enhances its spellcasting and magical abilities. Wisdom is average, while Charisma is also average, affecting its social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Ley Wanderer has a +5 in Strength, +2 in Dexterity, and exceptional +7 in Intelligence, indicating a very strong ability to resist spells and effects targeting its intelligence. It possesses no notable bonuses in Wisdom or Charisma. Its skill in perception is average with a +0 modifier. The Ley Wanderer is immune to psychic damage and resistant to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, enhancing its survivability in battle. It has darkvision limited to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 13, allowing it to detect approaches in dim light. It understands all languages and communicates telepathically within a range of 120 feet.

The Ley Wanderer has several special abilities and actions that make it a unique threat in combat. It can sense magic at will within a range of 120 feet, functioning similarly to the detect magic spell but without being magical itself. 

In combat, it can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks using either Slam or Psychic Lash. The Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 bonus to hit, dealing 6 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 9 psychic damage when it successfully hits a target. The Psychic Lash is a ranged spell attack with a +7 bonus to hit. It can be used at close range or from up to 120 feet away, dealing 17 psychic damage to the target. 

Additionally, the Ley Wanderer can unleash a powerful ability called Dispelling Burst (Recharge 5–6). It releases a psychic burst that affects a 30-foot radius around it, dealing 27 psychic damage to each creature within that area. Targets can make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw for half damage. This burst also instantly ends any spells of 3rd level or lower in the area, and for each spell that ends, the Ley Wanderer gains 5 temporary hit points. 

The Teleport action allows the Ley Wanderer to move itself and up to six willing creatures with it to any location it is familiar with, up to 100 miles away. If the destination is rich in magical energy, such as a ley line, it can teleport up to 300 miles.

As a bonus action, it can use Drain Magic Item to drain the magic from an item it is holding. This ability can deplete a magic item’s charges or uses, or it can destroy single-use magical items like potions or spell scrolls. Each time it drains a magic item, it gains 5 temporary hit points. A drained item will regain its magical properties after 24 hours.

In response to enemy spells, it can use the Absorb Spell reaction. When it detects a creature casting a spell within 30 feet, it can attempt to absorb the spell's energy as a counterspell, making an ability check with a +7 modifier. If successful, it counters the spell and gains 5 temporary hit points for each level of the spell canceled.
