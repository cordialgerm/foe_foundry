The griffon is a large monstrosity that embodies the fierce traits of both birds and felines. With its ability to soar through the skies and engage in powerful melee attacks, it serves as a formidable opponent in combat. The griffon possesses a strong physical presence with a respectable Challenge Rating of 2, making it a capable adversary for low to mid-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its exceptional mobility, both on the ground and in the air, and the advantage it gains from Pack Tactics, which enhances its combat effectiveness when fighting alongside allies. However, its relatively low Armor Class and lack of magical abilities make it susceptible in direct confrontations with well-coordinated enemy tactics.

The griffon has the following attributes: Strength +4 (very good), Dexterity +2 (average), Constitution +3 (good), Intelligence -4 (very bad), Wisdom +1 (average), and Charisma -1 (bad). These modifiers reflect its physical prowess and resilience but highlight its deficiencies in mental acuity and charm. 

In terms of senses, the griffon has darkvision extending 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and can perceive creatures in darkness as shades. Its Perception score is 13 (average), which helps it notice hidden objects or creatures, with heightened sight increasing this to 18 when observing visually. Its Stealth score of 12 (average) allows it to move quietly, contributing to its capacity to surprise prey.

The griffon boasts several special abilities. Heightened Sight improves its visual perception, enhancing its ability to detect threats. Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance against exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it a resilient combatant. Pack Tactics provides the griffon with advantage on attack rolls against an enemy if comrades are nearby, synergizing effectively in group encounters. Additionally, the Pounce ability allows the griffon to execute a tactical strike: if it charges at least 20 feet toward a target and hits with its Claws attack, the target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or become prone. If prone, the griffon can utilize a Beak attack as a bonus action to capitalize on the target's vulnerability.

For actions, the griffon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Beak attack and one Claws attack in a single turn. The Beak attack makes a melee weapon attack with a +6 bonus, reaching 5 feet and dealing 8 piercing damage (1d8 + 4). The Claws attack also has a +6 bonus, with the same reach, inflicting 11 slashing damage (2d6 + 4).

Overall, the griffon is a formidable beast combining aerial prowess and powerful physical attacks, making it an exciting challenge for adventurers who encounter it in their journeys.
