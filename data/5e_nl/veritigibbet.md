The Veritigibbet is a small, chaotic neutral fey creature, known for its cunning and trickery. With an Armor Class of 14 and 63 hit points, it is moderately resilient in combat. Its flying speed of 60 feet allows it to maneuver effectively, making it difficult for opponents to pin down. With a challenge rating of 4, it provides a good experience reward of 1,100 XP when defeated. This creature specializes in psychological manipulation and deceit, with unique abilities that make it a troublesome adversary or a tricky ally. Notable traits include its high dexterity and charisma, contributing to its effectiveness in dodging attacks and influencing other creatures. However, its weakness lies in its low strength and modest constitution, making it less effective in direct physical confrontations.

The Veritigibbet has the following attributes: Strength of 9, which is very bad for melee attacks; Dexterity of 19, which is exceptional for evasion and ranged attacks; Constitution of 12, which is average for maintaining hit points; Intelligence of 14, which is good for tactical thinking; Wisdom of 11, indicating average perception; and Charisma of 19, which is exceptional for social interactions and spellcasting. This creature can also resist non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, provided those attacks are not made with cold iron weapons. It is immune to conditions like charm and fear, offering it an edge in contests of will.

In terms of abilities, the Veritigibbet possesses Fortissimo Fibber, which ensures that it cannot be magically silenced or compelled to tell the truth. Additionally, it knows if it hears a lie, allowing it to maintain a deceptive advantage over others. Its Ventriloquist ability lets it project its voice from any visible point within 60 feet, facilitating misdirection.

The Veritigibbet can perform multiple attacks in a turn with its Multiattack action, executing two Repartee attacks. The Repartee is a spell attack that can be delivered either melee or ranged, with a +6 to hit, dealing an average of 14 psychic damage on a successful hit. 

One of its standout actions is Blather, which allows it to ask a question to a creature within 30 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 14. If it fails, the creature must answer truthfully or suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for the next hour. The penalties increase if the target fails successive saves. Should the target successfully answer the question, it must do so without any deceit. Success on the save inadvertently causes the Veritigibbet to take 3 psychic damage. Creatures who are immune to charm effects are not affected by this action.

The Veritigibbet can teleport once per day with its Veiled Escape ability, moving up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see while becoming invisible upon arrival. This makes it an elusive opponent during combat scenarios.

In terms of reactions, the Veritigibbet has Liar Liar, which triggers when a creature within 30 feet lies. The lying creature takes 3 fire damage, and it then ignites, requiring a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to extinguish the flames. Until the fire is doused, the target continues to take 3 fire damage at the start of its turns. 

Overall, the Veritigibbet is a clever, tricky fey that thrives on mental manipulation and psychological warfare, making it a formidable opponent in encounters focused on guile rather than brute strength.
