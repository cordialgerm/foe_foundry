The Faceless Wanderer is a medium-sized aberration known for its neutral evil alignment. This entity presents a unique challenge for adventurers due to its ability to drain memories from its victims, leaving them disoriented and vulnerable. With a higher Dexterity score granting it agility in combat and resilience through damage immunities, the Faceless Wanderer can be a formidable opponent. However, its Armor Class of 13 indicates that it is vulnerable to attacks if caught by surprise. Notably, its special abilities, like Memory Loss and Regeneration, allow it to maintain a distinct strategic advantage, making it a dangerous foe that can easily manipulate encounters to its favor.

The Faceless Wanderer has a hit point total of 58, which is decent but can be rapidly decreased if not handled properly. It has a Challenge Rating of 4, yielding 1,100 experience points upon defeat. The attributes are as follows: Strength is 12, which translates to a very good modifier of +1; Dexterity is 17, resulting in a very good +3 modifier; Constitution stands at 14, providing a good +2 modifier; Intelligence is 16 with a very good +3 modifier; Wisdom is 12, yielding an average +1 modifier; and Charisma is 10, translating to an average modifier of +0. The only saving throw it excels in is Wisdom with a +3, indicating average effectiveness in resisting effects that would target this ability.

When it comes to damage, the Faceless Wanderer has immunities to poison and psychic damage and resistance to cold damage. It is immune to conditions such as being blinded, exhausted, poisoned, and prone. Its sensory perception is enhanced with blindsight up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 12, making it quite aware of its surroundings. The creature can communicate in all languages through telepathy within a range of 60 feet.

Its special ability, Memory Loss, compels any creature that sees or interacts with it to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 11) one minute after the encounter. If they fail this check, their memory of the Faceless Wanderer fades completely, including the events involved. This can significantly hinder character recollection and strategy in continued encounters. 

The Faceless Wanderer possesses a regenerative trait, allowing it to recover 5 hit points at the start of its turn unless a creature has recently failed the saving throw from its Memory Drain ability. If reduced to 0 hit points while able to regenerate, it merely dissipates into vapor, only to reappear in the Void after a span of 1d10 days, unless permanently destroyed.

In terms of actions, it can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to take two actions in one turn, albeit limited to using its Memory Drain ability only once per turn. Its primary attack, Claws, has an attack bonus of +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 6 slashing damage in addition to 7 psychic damage, making it a significant threat in close combat. 

The Memory Drain action is particularly potent, targeting a creature within 30 feet and requiring them to make an Intelligence saving throw (DC 13). On failure, the target suffers 14 psychic damage and their Intelligence score is reduced by a roll of 1d4. If their Intelligence is reduced to 0, the target dies and rises after 1d4 hours as a new Faceless Wanderer. If the target succeeds in the saving throw, they only sustain half the damage and their Intelligence remains intact. This powerful mechanic accentuates the Faceless Wanderer's role as a manipulative predator, preying on the minds of its victims.
