The Fire Giant War Priest is an imposing and powerful creature within the realm of giants, renowned for its immense size, martial prowess, and fiery abilities. As a spellcaster, this giant blends brute strength with mystical flame, making it a formidable foe on the battlefield. Its notable strengths include high damage output, resistance to fire damage, and the capability to empower its attacks with additional fire damage. However, the Fire Giant War Priest has a significant weakness against cold damage, which can hinder its mobility. With a substantial amount of hit points and a robust armor class, it can withstand significant punishment, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers.

The Fire Giant War Priest has an Armor Class of 18, providing a good defense against attacks. It has 162 hit points, calculated as 13d12+78, allowing it to endure extensive combat. The giant has a walking speed of 30 feet and is rated with a Challenge Level of 12, typically yielding 8,400 XP for a defeated party. Its attributes include a Strength of 25 (+7), enabling it to deal serious damage, and a Constitution of 22 (+6), which bolsters its physical resilience with a very good saving throw modifier of +10. Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), while Intelligence is also average at 10 (+0). It possesses a Wisdom of 14 (+2), contributing to a passive Perception of 16, and a Charisma of 12 (+1), with notable saving throw bonuses in Strength (+11), Dexterity (+4), Constitution (+10), and Charisma (+5).

The Fire Giant War Priest is immune to fire damage, allowing it to resist one of the most common forms of attack. However, it has a vulnerability to cold damage through a special ability known as Cold Weakness; when it takes cold damage, its speed is decreased by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

In battle, the Fire Giant War Priest can perform a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two melee attacks with its greatsword. Each greatsword attack is made at +11 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 28 (6d6 + 7) slashing damage on a hit. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw, or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone. Additionally, the giant can throw a rock as a ranged attack with the same +11 attack modifier and a range of 60/240 feet, inflicting significant bludgeoning damage with a successful hit.

The Fire Giant War Priest can utilize its Sword Sweep ability once a day while its hit points are below half. This allows it to attack every creature within a 10-foot radius with its greatsword. The Ignite Blades ability can also be used once a day to ignite the greatswords of itself and any allied fire giants within 30 feet, adding an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage to their attacks for one minute.

One of its most devastating abilities is Pillar of Flame, which can be used once a day. The giant can select a point within 60 feet to create a 40-foot-high cylinder of flame affecting all creatures within a 10-foot radius. These creatures must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. The flames also ignite unattended flammable objects, adding a layer of environmental threat.

Finally, as a reaction, the Fire Giant War Priest can execute a Kick when hit by a melee attack from a Medium or smaller creature nearby. The attacker must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (3d4 + 7) bludgeoning damage, be pushed up to 20 feet away, and fall prone, thus adding to its defensive capabilities during melee encounters.
