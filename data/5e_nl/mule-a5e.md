The Mule is a medium-sized beast that occupies a unique role as a reliable mount and pack animal in Dungeons & Dragons. It has a solid endurance with a modest amount of hit points, making it a durable choice for players looking for a creature to carry heavy loads. The Mule's strengths lie in its carrying capacity due to its special ability, "Beast of Burden," which allows it to be treated as a larger creature for the purposes of determining how much weight it can bear. However, it has low intelligence and charisma, making it ineffective in social situations or strategy-based endeavors. Its combat abilities are basic, mainly revolving around a hoof attack that inflicts a small amount of bludgeoning damage. Overall, the Mule serves primarily as a practical asset for adventurers in need of transportation and storage.

The Mule has the following attributes: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 2 (-4), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 4 (-3). Its Strength score is rated as average, contributing a +3 modifier to its Strength saving throws, which is considered good in terms of its effectiveness. The average Dexterity score offers no modifier, while its Constitution grants it an additional +1 for a decent level of resilience. The very low Intelligence and Charisma scores render the Mule incapable of participating in mental challenges or social interactions, rated as very bad in effectiveness.

Its special ability, "Beast of Burden," enhances its role as a mount and pack animal by allowing the Mule to be considered Large when calculating carrying capacity. This means it can carry significantly more weight than a regular Medium beast, making it an essential companion for adventurers on lengthy journeys.

In combat, the Mule can utilize its action to perform a hoof attack. This melee weapon attack has a +3 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to strike one target within range. On a successful hit, the Mule deals 3 (1d4+1) bludgeoning damage. While this damage output is minimal, it provides the Mule with a basic means of defense or offense if necessary. However, due to its overall low combat capabilities, the Mule is not typically relied upon for dealing significant damage in a confrontation.
