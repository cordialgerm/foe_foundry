The Xorn has several special abilities that enhance its role in the game. Earth Glide allows the creature to burrow through nonmagical earth and stone without disturbing the material, enabling it to surprise foes by emerging unexpectedly. Stone Camouflage boosts its Stealth score to 18 in rocky terrain, making it difficult for opponents to detect it. Treasure Sense is a unique ability that allows the Xorn to pinpoint the location of precious metals and gems within 60 feet by scent, which can significantly influence quest dynamics and treasure hunting within the game.

In combat, the Xorn can perform a Multiattack, where it can make one Bite attack and three Claw attacks, or utilize three Lob Stone attacks in the same turn.

Additionally, the Xorn can use a bonus action called Shard Belch, where it emits a mixture of stomach gas and crystalline shards in a 15-foot cone. Any creature caught in this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in the creature being coated in crystalline shards that inflict pain, reducing their movement speed by 10 feet and granting disadvantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of their next turn. This ability can significantly hinder an enemy’s effectiveness in battle.

Overall, the Xorn is a formidable creature that combines strong defensive abilities and unique offensive capabilities, making it an interesting adversary or ally in a variety of situations.
