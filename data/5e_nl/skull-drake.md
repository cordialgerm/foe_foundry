The Skull Drake is a Medium-sized Dragon with a neutral alignment, presenting a balanced blend of strength and agility. It has an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, and possesses a total of 75 hit points, making it a formidable opponent with a decent amount of resilience in combat. With a challenge rating of 3, it offers 700 experience points for a successful encounter. The creature's mobility is notable, boasting a flying speed of 60 feet, walking speed of 40 feet, and the ability to burrow at a rate of 10 feet. However, its strengths are somewhat countered by vulnerability to radiant damage and a significant disadvantage in sunlight, impacting its effectiveness in certain environments.

The Skull Drake has the following ability scores: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, which is classified as good, allowing it to deal considerable melee damage. Dexterity is also at 17 with a +3 modifier, which is very good, contributing to its agility and effectiveness in dodging attacks. Constitution is 16 (+3), enhancing its durability in fights. Intelligence is quite low at 8 (-1), which is very bad, limiting its capabilities outside of combat. Wisdom is average at 12 (+1) and Charisma is 10 (+0), allowing for basic interaction but not standing out in social situations.

In terms of saving throws, the Skull Drake excels with a +5 in Dexterity and a +3 in Wisdom, making it good at avoiding harmful spells and effects. Its stealth skill of +5 allows it to be very adept at moving silently, while a +3 perception skill aids in detecting hidden threats. The creature can intimidate foes with a +2 bonus and has a passive perception of 13, enabling it to notice details in its surroundings effectively.

The Skull Drake has vulnerabilities and immunities that shape its combat strategy. It is vulnerable to radiant damage, meaning it takes extra damage from such attacks. On the flip side, it is immune to necrotic damage, allowing it to resist certain types of magical attacks, and it has resistance to poison damage, giving it an edge against poison-based threats. The drake is also immune to being poisoned, making it resilient against debilitating effects that might incapacitate other creatures.

Two special abilities add tactical depth to the Skull Drake. Its Keen Smell grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, enhancing its capabilities to detect prey or threats. However, its Sunlight Sensitivity imposes a disadvantage on attack rolls and specific perception checks while in direct sunlight, making it less effective in brightly lit areas.

The Skull Drake's actions in combat include a Multiattack feature, allowing it to engage in two bite attacks per turn. The bite is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 10 piercing damage (2d6 + 3) on a successful hit. It also possesses a powerful special attack called Necrotic Breath, which can be used once every six rounds. This attack releases a 15-foot cone of noxious black gas, forcing any creature in the area to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 necrotic damage (4d6), or half on a success. Notably, if this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature dies immediately, adding a lethal aspect to its combat capabilities.
