The Death Butterfly Swarm is a large, unaligned creature that serves as a formidable foe in combat, primarily due to its unique swarm mechanics and potent poison abilities. With an Armor Class of 15 and 60 hit points, it possesses moderate durability, though its utility is significantly enhanced by its ability to occupy spaces and move through tight openings like other swarms. The swarm excels at hindering enemy movement and inflicting poison damage, making it a dangerous encounter for any adventurer who underestimates its capabilities. However, the swarm is particularly vulnerable to cold and fire damage, and it lacks offensive capabilities outside its swarm dynamics.

The Death Butterfly Swarm has the following ability scores: Strength 1 (very bad), Dexterity 14 (good), Constitution 10 (average), Intelligence 1 (very bad), Wisdom 12 (average), and Charisma 12 (average). Its Dexterity score allows the swarm to be quite nimble and evasive, facilitating its movement strategy in combat. The swarm's skills, damage vulnerabilities to cold and fire, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage bolster its survivability against several attack types. Notably, it is immune to several conditions including charm, fright, paralysis, and poison, allowing it to bypass many common debuffs.

The swarm possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in battle. The first is "Potent Poison," which means that even undead creatures that are typically resistant or immune to poison can be affected by its poison damage. The "Swarm" ability allows it to occupy another creature's space and move freely through openings large enough for tiny insects, facilitating its unusual tactics in engagement. It cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, indicating a reliance on its unique attributes rather than regenerative capabilities. The "Weight of Wings" ability proves particularly detrimental to foes; a creature starting its turn within the swarm's space has their speed halved and must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in being blinded until the creature moves out of the swarm’s area, while success grants immunity to this effect for the next 24 hours.

In terms of actions, the Death Butterfly Swarm can perform a melee attack called "Bites." This attack has a +4 to hit and targets any creature within its space, which effectively means it can attack multiple enemies simultaneously. A successful bite inflicts 21 piercing damage if the swarm is at full health, or reduces to 10 damage if it has taken half or fewer hit points. Additionally, the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw; failure incurs an additional 10 poison damage and the poisoned condition until the end of their next turn, while success results in half damage and no poison effect. This dual damage output makes the Bites action particularly potent, allowing for both immediate harm and the potential for ongoing status effects.
