The Young Red Dragon is a formidable creature known for its fiery breath and intimidating presence. As a Large Dragon with a challenge rating of 11, it serves as a potent adversary in battle, capable of dealing severe damage while remaining quite resilient due to its high hit points and defensive abilities. With an Armor Class of 18, it is relatively difficult to hit in combat. Its most notable strengths lie in its powerful multiattack capability and devastating fire breath, allowing it to control the battlefield effectively. However, its weaknesses may arise from being a creature susceptible to targeted tactics as it primarily relies on melee attacks and spells to deal damage.

The Young Red Dragon possesses strong attributes with a Strength score of 22 (+6), making it exceptionally powerful in melee combat, while its Constitution score of 20 (+5) grants it good durability with 178 hit points. It has an average Dexterity score of 10 (+0), resulting in bad dexterity-based saving throws, but its Intelligence (14, +2) and Wisdom (12, +1) scores are adequate. The dragon's Charisma score (18, +4) is exceptional, enhancing the effectiveness of its innate spellcasting. 

The saving throw modifiers are as follows: Dexterity +4 (bad), Constitution +9 (very good), Wisdom +5 (good), and Charisma +8 (very good). Skills include intimidation +8 (very good), perception +5 (good), and stealth +4 (average). The Young Red Dragon is immune to fire damage, allowing it to resist most fire-based attacks entirely. Its senses include blindsight within a range of 30 feet and darkvision extending up to 120 feet, which complement its high passive Perception score of 18, helping it detect hidden foes effectively. The dragon speaks both Common and Draconic.

In terms of special abilities, the Young Red Dragon has Searing Heat, which inflicts 3 (1d6) fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in contact with it or attacks it with a melee attack for the first time in their turn. This adds an additional layer of danger when engaging the dragon in close combat. The Volcanic Tyrant ability grants it immunity to poisonous gas effects from volcanic locations and allows it to ignore difficult terrain caused by lava, making it highly advantageous in such environments. Its innate spellcasting features a Charisma-based spellcasting ability with a save DC of 16, enabling it to cast spells without material components. It can cast the spells command and hold person three times per day each, potentially controlling or manipulating adversaries during encounters.

The Young Red Dragon's primary combat actions consist of a Multiattack, allowing it to make one bite attack and two claw attacks in a single action. Its bite attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage and an additional 4 (1d8) fire damage on a successful hit. The claw attacks also have a +10 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, each dealing 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage. 

One of its most devastating abilities is Fire Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the dragon to exhale a powerful fire blast in a 30-foot cone, compelling creatures within to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in taking 52 (15d6) fire damage, while a successful one results in half damage. Additionally, any creature that fails the saving throw suffers from 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage and becomes frightened of the dragon until the ongoing damage ends, presenting a significant threat on the battlefield as frightened creatures may struggle to engage effectively.
