The Hezrou is a large fiend known for its chaotic and evil nature. As a formidable creature in combat, it boasts a significant armor class of 16 and a total of 136 hit points, making it a tough adversary in battle. This creature walks at a speed of 40 feet and has a Challenge Rating of 10, which indicates it can provide a significant challenge for a party of adventurers, granting them 5,900 experience points upon defeat. The Hezrou's strengths lie in its strong physical attributes—particularly its Strength and Constitution, with scores of 18 (+4) and 20 (+5), respectively—allowing it to deal substantial damage while withstanding attacks. However, it suffers from low Intelligence, which restricts its strategic options in terms of spellcasting and problem-solving.

The Hezrou has several notable abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. It has resistance to cold, fire, lightning, and damage from nonmagical weapons, making it more durable in battle. Additionally, it has immunity to poison damage and is also immune to being poisoned—a very good defensive trait. The creature has darkvision with a range of 120 feet and can communicate in Abyssal as well as through telepathy within the same range.

Its special abilities include "Magic Resistance," which grants the Hezrou advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, thereby making it difficult for spellcasters to incapacitate it. The "Chaotic Evil" aura underscores its malevolent nature, influencing the battlefield's tone.

In terms of attacks, the Hezrou can utilize a Multiattack feature allowing it to execute both a bite and a claw attack in one turn. The bite attack targets a creature within 5 feet, has a +7 to hit, and deals 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage. If this attack successfully hits a Medium or smaller creature, it immediately grapples them, requiring a DC 15 escape check. While grappled, the target is restrained, preventing it from moving freely. The claws deal more damage, hitting for 22 (4d8 + 4) slashing damage with the same attack bonuses, showcasing its offensive capabilities.

The "Swallow" ability allows the Hezrou to attempt to consume a Medium or smaller creature if it has already grappled them. If the bite attack hits, the target is swallowed, gaining total cover from outside attacks and becoming both blinded and restrained, suffering ongoing acid damage of 17 (5d6) each turn until they escape or the Hezrou is defeated. If a swallowed creature manages to deal 25 or more damage to the Hezrou in a single turn, or if the Hezrou dies, the creature is vomited up.

The Hezrou can also create magical darkness that spreads out from a point within 30 feet, filling a 15-foot radius. This darkness lasts for one minute, obscuring vision for creatures with darkvision and cannot be penetrated by nonmagical light, making it an exceptional tactical choice to control the battlefield.

As a reaction, the Hezrou can trigger "Stench" once per day when it is hit by a melee attack. It releases a foul-smelling gas in a 20-foot radius, requiring creatures in the area to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the creature becoming poisoned for one minute, which can be repeated at the end of each of its turns. This ability serves as a deterrent for melee attacks, further complicating confrontations with the Hezrou.
