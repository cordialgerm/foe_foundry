The One-Headed Clockwork Dragon is a Large Construct that embodies advanced mechanical design and formidable combat capabilities. With an Armor Class of 16 and a significant pool of 178 hit points, this creature possesses good defensive and offensive traits, making it a challenging opponent in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 8, it is suitable for parties of mid-level adventurers. This dragon is unaligned, which means it does not adhere to moral guidelines, and thus can pose a serious threat to adventurers without any reason to hold back. Its strengths lie in its ability to deal substantial damage, high durability, magical resistances, and unique abilities tied to circlets that allow telepathic communication and shared experiences with its wearers. However, if those circlet wearers are not present, the dragon becomes hostile, viewing all creatures as enemies. 

In terms of attributes, the One-Headed Clockwork Dragon has a Strength of 22, providing an exceptional +6 modifier, indicating its great physical power. Its Dexterity is average at +0, suggesting that it does not excel at agile maneuvers but is not particularly hindered either. The Constitution of 20 gives it a very good +5 modifier, showcasing its durability and resilience to damage. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma all sit at average levels, with scores of 10, meaning it does not excel in cognitive or social skill checks and has no means of influencing creatures through charisma, as indicated by its negative -5 Charisma modifier. The dragon benefits from saving throw bonuses of +9 in Strength and +8 in Constitution, which are good, ensuring it can resist physical effects reliably. It is proficient in Athletics at +9 and has Perception at +6, allowing it to detect threats effectively. The dragon is immune to poison and psychic damage, can’t be charmed or frightened, and is impervious to conditions such as exhaustion and paralysis. It possesses darkvision that allows it to see in the dark up to 60 feet and has a passive Perception score of 16, making it quite observant. While it understands Common, it cannot communicate verbally.

The dragon has several special abilities. First, its Bound ability links it to three circlets, enabling any wearers within one mile to communicate telepathically and perceive through the dragon's senses. However, if too few circlet users are nearby, they risk accumulating exhaustion which can impede their performance. If no wearers are close, the dragon will consider all creatures as enemies until it receives commands from a circlet wearer or is destroyed. Its Immutable Form ability makes it resistant to any spell or effect that would try to alter its form. Magic Resistance allows it to have an advantage on saving throws against magical effects, enhancing its defensive capabilities significantly. Finally, its Siege Monster trait enables it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it effective against fortifications.

In combat, the One-Headed Clockwork Dragon can utilize a Multiattack. It first uses its Oil Spray ability to potentially prepare enemies for further attacks, and then it strikes with a Bite and two Fist attacks. The Bite attack requires a +9 to hit and reaches 10 feet, dealing 17 piercing damage plus additional 3 fire damage on a hit. The Fist attack similarly has a +9 to hit but has a shorter reach of 5 feet and deals 13 bludgeoning damage. 

The dragon can unleash a Fire Breath attack, which it can use after a recharge of six rounds. This powerful move allows the dragon to exhale fire in a 30-foot cone, requiring creatures within the area to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A failure results in taking 35 fire damage, while a successful save halves the damage. 

The Oil Spray ability lets the dragon spray a 30-foot cone of oil, forcing creatures to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail become vulnerable to fire damage until the end of the dragon’s next turn, setting them up for devastating fire attacks. Finally, the Tail Sweep functions as a powerful cleaving attack, requiring creatures within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in taking 15 slashing damage, while a successful save halves the damage dealt.

Overall, the One-Headed Clockwork Dragon is a highly tactical and powerful adversary, leveraging its mechanical nature to execute a range of combat strategies while also relying on magical properties to maintain its operational efficiency.
