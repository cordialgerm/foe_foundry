The Jaculus is a small, neutral evil dragon known for its agility and cunning nature. With a challenging rating of 3, it is a formidable opponent for lower-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its high Dexterity and Constitution, which not only enhance its defenses but also improve its offensive capabilities. The Jaculus has a decent Armor Class of 15, alongside 65 hit points, making it resilient in combat. However, its lack of significant ranged attacks and reliance on tactical melee strikes are notable weaknesses. The Jaculus is designed to utilize speed and precision rather than brute strength, allowing it to outmaneuver enemies while dealing moderate damage.

The Jaculus possesses a variety of attributes that enhance its combat effectiveness. It has a Strength score of 14, providing a good modifier of +2, which means it can perform physical tasks and deal damage reasonably well. Its Dexterity is its strongest attribute, at 18 with a +4 modifier, granting it very good agility and increasing its chances of avoiding attacks. The Constitution score of 17 translates to a +3 modifier, providing it with good durability. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all average at 13, with +1 modifiers in these areas, which affects its ability to engage in social situations and resist certain effects, although these aren't its strong suit.

In terms of saving throws, the Jaculus excels in Dexterity with a +6 modifier, which is considered very good, allowing it to avoid many harmful effects. Its skills in Acrobatics and Stealth also both boast a +6 modifier, indicating exceptional proficiency in avoiding detection and performing agile maneuvers. It has a +3 modifier in Perception, enabling it to notice details in its environment well. Combining its damage resistances to acid and lightning with sensory abilities like blindsight and darkvision makes the Jaculus a versatile foe in darker settings. Moreover, it can communicate in both Common and Draconic languages.

The Jaculus has notable special abilities. The first is Spearhead, where if it moves at least 10 feet straight towards a target and then successfully lands a Bite attack on the same turn, it inflicts an additional 4 points of piercing damage. Furthermore, if the target is a creature, it must attempt a DC 13 Strength saving throw; failure results in being knocked prone, making it a daunting ability during battles. Its Standing Leap allows remarkable jumps, enabling the Jaculus to leap up to 20 feet horizontally or 10 feet vertically, enhancing its mobility significantly.

In terms of actions, the Jaculus has a Multiattack option, allowing it to perform one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, which can deal 8 piercing damage upon a successful hit. The Claw attacks, also with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, deal 7 slashing damage each upon hitting a target. This versatility in attacking styles, combined with its unique abilities, makes the Jaculus a challenging and tactical adversary in any encounter.
