The Giant Octopus is a large, aquatic beast known for its intelligence and adaptability in underwater environments. With a challenge rating of 1, it is a creature that can be a formidable opponent in aquatic settings due to its ability to grapple multiple creatures and obscure visibility with a surge of ink. The octopus has a relatively low armor class of 11, making it vulnerable to attacks, but its hit points totaling 44 provide it with decent durability in combat. Its movement capabilities are impressive, as it can swim at a speed of 60 feet, allowing it to maneuver swiftly in water.

The physical attributes of the Giant Octopus include a Strength of +3, which provides a good bonus for melee attacks, a Dexterity of +1, contributing to its initiative and ability to evade attacks, and a Constitution of +1, which gives it average resilience. Its Intelligence is -3, indicating very poor cognitive abilities, while its Wisdom is average at +0, and its Charisma is very bad at -3, meaning it lacks social skills or charm. The creature possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and has a Perception score of 14, which allows it to notice hidden threats effectively. With a Stealth score of 13, it can hide reasonably well, but its underwater camouflage boosts this dramatically to 18 when submerged.

In terms of special abilities, the Giant Octopus has several noteworthy skills. It can hold its breath for an hour while out of water, which offers a significant advantage when needing to briefly exit its aquatic environment. Its underwater camouflage greatly enhances its stealth capabilities, making it difficult for enemies to spot it while submerged. Moreover, it can only breathe underwater, limiting its presence to aquatic scenarios.

The Giant Octopus has several actions it can perform during combat. Its primary attack is its tentacles, where it makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, dealing an average of 10 bludgeoning damage (calculated by rolling 2d6 + 3). If the attack is successful, it can grapple the target, provided they are Huge or smaller, with an escape DC of 13. Grappled targets are restrained, significantly hindering their movement and actions. The octopus can grapple up to two creatures simultaneously, increasing its threat level in combat.

As a bonus action, the Giant Octopus can execute a Tentacle Slam, where it slams a Medium-sized or smaller creature it is grappling against a solid surface. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 13) or take 7 bludgeoning damage (2d6) on a failed save, reducing damage by half if they succeed. This ability can deal substantial damage while maintaining control over the target.

Additionally, the octopus has a reactive ability known as Ink Dash (which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6). When damaged by a creature it can see, the octopus can release a cloud of ink in a 20-foot radius while underwater. This creates heavily obscured conditions until the octopus's next turn ends, allowing it to conceal itself and escape by swimming up to its swimming speed. Notably, the octopus releases any creatures it is grappling if it uses this ability to evade.

Overall, the Giant Octopus is a tactical creature that excels in aquatic environments, utilizing grappling mechanics and its ink cloud to control the battlefield effectively.
