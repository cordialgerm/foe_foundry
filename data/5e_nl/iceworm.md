The Iceworm is a small monstrosity that inhabits cold environments, showcasing both unique strengths and notable weaknesses. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it poses a manageable threat to low-level adventurers, particularly due to its ability to manipulate cold damage and its agility in movement. Its attributes are balanced, with a good Dexterity score that allows it to be nimble in combat, while its Constitution provides it with decent durability. However, its intelligence and charisma scores are very low, indicating a lack of mental prowess and social capability. The Iceworm's vulnerabilities to fire and its weaknesses against heat sources make it particularly susceptible in warmer climates. It excels in icy terrains where its cold abilities can shine, using its icy attacks to potentially hinder opponents.

The Iceworm has an Armor Class of 13, which is average, and it possesses 38 Hit Points derived from 7d6 + 14, showing better than average resilience in combat. Its movement options include a walking speed of 20 feet, burrowing at 30 feet, and swimming at 20 feet, which provides good mobility in various environments.

The Iceworm's ability scores include a Strength of 10 (which is average), Dexterity of 16 (+3 which is good), Constitution of 15 (+2, also good), Intelligence of 3 (-4, very bad), Wisdom of 8 (-1, bad), and Charisma of 4 (-3, very bad). The creature's skill in perception is a -1 modifier, signifying an average proficiency in this area.

One standout feature of the Iceworm is its special abilities. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water. Its cold physiology is critical; it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw every hour in temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Failure results in one level of exhaustion, which cannot be removed until it has a long rest in a cooler environment. Heat sensitivity imposes disadvantage on its attack rolls when within 5 feet of intense heat sources. However, this ability also enables it to sense warm-blooded creatures' locations within 90 feet and detect their direction up to a mile away. Lastly, the slippery ability provides the Iceworm with an advantage on saving throws and checks to escape grapples, showcasing its elusive nature.

In combat, the Iceworm has a melee attack called Icy Bite, which utilizes a +5 to hit for a 5-foot range against a single target, dealing 5 piercing damage plus an additional 7 cold damage. This attack effectively adds up to a total of 12 damage, demonstrating significant potential in close-range encounters. The Ice Spit is a ranged attack with a similar +5 to hit and an effective range of 20 feet up to 60 feet. This attack inflicts 10 cold damage and coats the target with a freezing slime. While affected, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and they suffer disadvantage on their first attack roll each turn. The target can remove the slime effect by taking an action to clean it off, making it an impactful attack that can hinder opponents significantly.
