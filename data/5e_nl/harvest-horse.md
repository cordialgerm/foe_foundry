The Harvest Horse is a large construct that functions mainly as a powerful yet unaligned creature without specific allegiances. Its role in combat is that of a robust frontline entity, capable of dealing significant damage while having the strength to carry heavy loads. It possesses a notably high Strength score of 15, giving it a good modifier of +2, which enhances its melee capabilities. However, it has poor Dexterity, reflected by a -3 modifier, making it less effective at dodging attacks. The Harvest Horse has average resilience, with a Constitution of 14, leading to a good +2 modifier and decent hit points totaling 37, making it durable, but not exceptionally survivable. 

The creature has a base Armor Class of 13, which is somewhat below average for a creature of its size, providing decent but not outstanding defense. It is primarily immune to poison and psychic damage, which means it is well-protected against those specific types of attacks. It also has a wide array of condition immunities, including being unable to be charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, making it exceptionally resilient in terms of status effects. 

The Harvest Horse possesses several notable abilities. With the special ability "Beast of Burden," it is treated as one size larger when calculating its carrying capacity, making it capable of carrying heavy loads efficiently. Its "Construct Nature" ability means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, which can be highly advantageous in prolonged situations like dungeons or expeditions. However, it suffers from "Poor Traversal," meaning it requires two additional feet of movement to navigate difficult terrain, which can hinder mobility in certain environments, making this aspect a clear weakness. Furthermore, as a "Siege Monster," the Harvest Horse inflicts double damage on objects and structures, which makes it a valuable asset for breaking down barriers.

In terms of combat actions, the Harvest Horse's primary attack is its "Slam," which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 bonus to hit. The attack has a short range of 5 feet and deals an average of 7 bludgeoning damage using 2d4+2 dice, making it effective for direct confrontations. Its standout combat maneuver is called "Harvester’s Stampede," which recharges between uses on a roll of 5 or 6. During this ability, the Harvest Horse can move up to its speed in a straight line and trample over any Large or smaller creatures in its path. The first creature whose space the Harvest Horse enters must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 12. If they fail, they take an average of 7 slashing damage from the stampede and are knocked prone; if they succeed, they only take half damage and remain standing. This ability allows the Harvest Horse to traverse the battlefield effectively while potentially incapacitating enemies, as it can also avoid provoking opportunity attacks during its movement.
