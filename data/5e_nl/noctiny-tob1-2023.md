The Noctiny is a medium-sized humanoid of neutral evil alignment, making it a cunning and unpredictable adversary in combat. With its notable roster of abilities, it serves as a formidable opponent, particularly in magical confrontations. The Noctiny features a good Armor Class of 13 and has 52 hit points, placing it in a solid position for resilience. Its primary strengths include Eldritch Weapons, which augment its damage output significantly, and Magic Resistance, granting it an advantage against spells. However, its lack of advanced skills or special senses might leave it vulnerable in certain scenarios. Overall, the Noctiny embodies a blend of potent offense, decent defense, and strategic magical advantages.

The Noctiny has the following attributes: Strength of 16 with a modifier of +3, categorizing it as strong and resulting in good melee damage. Dexterity is at 13 with a +1 modifier, which is average, supporting its agility in combat. It has a Constitution score of 14 (+2), which is also good, enhancing its durability.

The creature has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Eldritch Weapons ability designates its weapon attacks as magical, enabling the Noctiny to deal an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit, effectively increasing its damage per attack to a very good level. The Magic Resistance ability allows the Noctiny to have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it especially resilient to magical attacks.

In terms of actions, the Noctiny can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks using either the Quarterstaff or its Eldritch Fury. The Quarterstaff is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, targeting one opponent. Successfully striking a target will deal 6 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 3) or 7 bludgeoning damage (1d8 + 3) if wielded with both hands, plus an additional 3 force damage (1d6). Alternatively, the Eldritch Fury is a ranged spell attack, also with a +5 to hit, effective at a distance of 120 feet, dealing 10 force damage (2d6 + 3) on a hit. Each of these attacks contributes to the Noctinyâ€™s overall strategy of dealing consistent damage while utilizing its magical enhancements to maintain an edge in combat situations.
