The Coven Winter Hag is a formidable Medium Fey creature embodying the essence of winter and malice. It serves as a cunning spellcaster and a dangerous foe in combat, boasting a variety of abilities that allow it to manipulate its environment, curse its enemies, and deal significant damage. With a respectable Armor Class of 17 and 135 hit points, the hag has a good chance of sustaining damage while delivering potent attacks both at range and in melee combat. Its strengths lie in its high Charisma, which enhances its spellcasting capabilities, and its ability to control cold weather—providing it advantages during specific encounters. However, its reliance on spells and tactics can make it vulnerable if faced with strong magical resistances or abilities that counteract its effects.

The Coven Winter Hag has the following attributes: Strength at 18, Dexterity at 16, Constitution at 16, Intelligence at 16, Wisdom at 16, and Charisma at 18. This translates to modifiers of +4 for Strength (good), +3 for Dexterity (good), +3 for Constitution (good), +3 for Intelligence (good), +3 for Wisdom (good), and +4 for Charisma (very good). In terms of saving throws, the hag is proficient in Constitution, providing a +6 bonus, and Wisdom, providing a +6 bonus as well. It has a range of skills with notable proficiencies including arcana and deception at +6 and +7, respectively, making it quite proficient in manipulating and influencing other characters.

As for resistances, the Coven Winter Hag has resistance to cold damage, allowing it to take only half damage from cold-based attacks. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, which enables it to see in darkness as if it were bright light, and a passive perception score of 16, indicating that it is reasonably aware of its surroundings. The hag is fluent in Common, Draconic, and Sylvan, making it capable of communication with various creatures.

The hag possesses several special abilities that enhance its threat in combat. The **Curse** ability allows it to magically curse any creature that accepts a gift from it for 30 days. While cursed, the target automatically fails saving throws against the hag's charm person, geas, and scrying spells, creating a significant strategic disadvantage. Additionally, with **Icy Travel**, the hag is unhindered by cold conditions and can move without leaving tracks in snowy or icy terrain, which is advantageous for ambushes. 

The hag’s innate spellcasting is based on Charisma, with a spell save DC of 15. It can cast spells at will, including **charm person**, which charms one humanoid, **dancing lights**, which creates floating lights, **invisibility**, allowing it to turn invisible for up to an hour, **minor illusion**, creating simple visual or auditory illusions, and **passwall** limited to ice surfaces only. Once per day, it can cast powerful spells such as **control weather**, specifically to create extreme cold conditions, **geas**, which imposes magical commands on a creature, and **scrying** to spy on others. The hag also casts **cone of cold**, which creates a frigid blast affecting a large area, dealing significant cold damage, and **wall of ice**, which creates a barrier offering strategic control over the battlefield.

Regarding the hag's actions in combat, it can make a **Multiattack**, using its claws to strike an opponent and follow up with an **Ice Bolt**. The **claws attack** has a +7 to hit and deals 15 slashing damage on a successful hit. The **Ice Bolt** is a ranged spell attack with the same hit modifier, dealing 15 cold damage, while requiring the target to make a Constitution saving throw. If the target is under the hag's curse, it automatically fails this saving throw and may become restrained or petrified, which greatly affects its ability to fight back.

With the **Shapeshift** ability, the hag can transform into a Small or Medium humanoid. This ability allows it to change forms while retaining its statistics and a signature streak of white hair, which can make it visually distinctive even in disguise. The hag can also react during combat using **Ice Shield**, which adds +3 to its Armor Class against one melee attack that targets it, potentially reflecting cold damage back on the attacker if the attack misses.

Overall, the Coven Winter Hag is a cunning and powerful adversary, masterfully using its spells, abilities, and tactics to weave both deception and destruction into encounters with unsuspecting adventurers.
