The Giant Vulture is a large beast characterized by its impressive flying ability and keen senses, making it an opportunistic predator in the wild. With a challenge rating of 1, it is an adequate combatant for lower-level adventurers seeking to test their mettle. The vulture's ability to attack with both its beak and talons allows it to deal a decent amount of damage, while its special abilities, particularly keen sight and smell, provide it with a significant advantage in perception-related tasks. However, its moderate armor class and hit points reveal its vulnerability, making it susceptible to focused attacks by agile opponents.

The Giant Vulture has the following attributes: Strength of 14, Dexterity of 14, Constitution of 14, Intelligence of 6, Wisdom of 12, and Charisma of 6. This translates to a strength modifier of +2, which is good, a dexterity modifier of +2, also good, and a constitution modifier of +2, which is advantageous for its hit points. The intelligence score of 6 gives it a very bad intelligence modifier of -2, which means it's not very intelligent. Its wisdom of 12 provides a +1 modifier, which is average, while a charisma of 6 results in a very bad -2 modifier in social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Giant Vulture has a perception skill of +3, benefiting from its keen senses. This means it is very good at detecting unseen threats or tracking prey. With a passive perception of 13, the vulture is notably aware of its surroundings. The creature does not communicate verbally, which means it has no languages.

The vulture's special ability, Keen Sight and Smell, grants it advantage on perception checks that rely on these senses. This means that when the vulture attempts to notice something through sight or smell, it rolls two d20 dice and takes the higher result, significantly increasing its chances of success.

In combat, the Giant Vulture employs multiple attacks. Its Multiattack action allows it to strike with both its beak and talons during a single turn. The Beak attack is a melee weapon attack made at +4 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 6 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Talons attack follows the same mechanics, also hitting at +4 to hit with the same reach, but dealing 6 slashing damage instead. Both attacks represent a solid output of damage for a creature of its challenge rating.

The vulture can also utilize its Retreat reaction, which allows it to move 5 feet away from an attacker when it is hit by a melee attack. If this movement takes the vulture out of the attacker’s reach, the attacker suffers disadvantage on their attack roll, making it harder for the opponent to connect successfully. This ability adds a layer of survival strategy to combat, allowing the vulture to evade potential harm effectively.
