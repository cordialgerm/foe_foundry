The Giant Centipede is a small beast characterized by its agility and ability to inflict poisonous attacks. With a relatively low Armor Class (AC) of 12 and 9 hit points, it is not particularly durable but makes up for these weaknesses with its moderate dexterity and unique venomous bite. This creature is classified as a Challenge Rating (CR) of 1/4, indicating that it is suitable for low-level encounters. It poses a significant threat with its ability to potentially paralyze its targets, making it an interesting addition to lower-tier adventures.

The attributes for the Giant Centipede are as follows: Strength 4 (very bad), Dexterity 14 (good), Constitution 12 (average), Intelligence 1 (very bad), Wisdom 6 (bad), and Charisma 3 (very bad). Its high Dexterity grants it a +2 modifier, which allows it to be reasonably effective in avoiding attacks and getting into advantageous positions. Its low Strength and Intelligence do not significantly contribute to its overall effectiveness in combat or interaction situations.

In terms of senses, the Giant Centipede has blindsight up to 30 feet, allowing it to detect creatures and objects in its immediate vicinity without relying on sight, as well as a passive Perception of 8, which is considered average. It does not possess any language capabilities, limiting its ability to communicate.

The Giant Centipede has one primary action: Bite. This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, which is quite effective given its moderate Dexterity. The reach of this attack is 5 feet, allowing it to strike at creatures nearby. If the bite is successful, it deals 1 point of piercing damage, but the real danger lies in the subsequent poison effect. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 11. If the target fails this saving throw, it suffers an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage. This could reduce the target to 0 hit points; in such a case, it is made stable but remains poisoned for 1 hour, even if it regains hit points. While poisoned, the target is also paralyzed, which could significantly impact gameplay and combat dynamics, especially in encounters where being incapacitated might lead to the demise of party members.
