The Ghul is a Medium undead creature embodying a sinister presence and is known for its tricky combat style and ability to unleash chaos upon its foes. With an Armor Class of 15 and 105 hit points, the Ghul is formidable in battle, particularly due to its resistances and immunities. It is most effective in melee range, leveraging its claws to deal substantial damage while having the potential to paralyze enemies. Its special abilities and spells enhance its role as a tactical combatant that can influence the battlefield and disrupt enemy plans. However, its reliance on Charisma for spellcasting and the potential vulnerability from certain forms of attack indicates that it has weaknesses that can be exploited by attentive opponents.

The Ghul has a Strength score of 16, providing a good modifier of +3, allowing it to deal significant melee damage. Its Dexterity score of 15 grants it a +2 modifier, which is also good for its defensive capabilities and initiative rolls. With a Constitution of 16, it has another good modifier of +3, contributing to its durability in fights. The Intelligence and Wisdom scores are both average at 10, giving a +0 modifier, while its Charisma score is 15, granting a +2 modifier that supports its innate spellcasting.

In terms of skills, the Ghul has no listed bonuses, which means its overall competency in skill checks is average. When it comes to survivability, it benefits from damage immunities to poison, and resistances against cold, fire, lightning, and necrotic damage. It is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, petrified, or poisoned, giving it exceptional resilience against many status effects. Its darkvision allows it to see up to 60 feet in darkness, and it speaks Common.

The Ghul possesses several notable special abilities. The "Paralyzing Throes" ability activates upon its death, causing it to explode in noxious smoke. Any creature within five feet must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; on failure, they become paralyzed until the end of their next turn, making this a significant threat to nearby characters. The "Turn Resistance" ability provides the Ghul with an advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, enhancing its survivability against certain divine foes.

The Ghul can change its damage resistances with "Variable Immunity," allowing it to adapt to the current battle situation by granting immunity to one particular damage type for its next turn. This flexibility can be exceptionally useful in countering incoming damage types from opponents.

As for innate spellcasting, the Ghul can cast various spells using its Charisma (spell save DC 13) without needing material components. Its at-will spells include "chill touch," which can deal necrotic damage and prevent healing; "fire bolt," a straightforward damaging fire attack; "ray of frost," which slows targets; and "shocking grasp," a melee spell that can potentially avoid attacks of opportunity. It can cast "fog cloud," which obscures vision; "rolling thunder," a damaging area spell; "misty step," allowing for short-range teleportation; and "spire of stone," creating a defensive structure. Additionally, it has access to powerful spells like "blur," which makes it harder to hit; "fireball," an explosive area-of-effect attack; "gaseous form," allowing it to become insubstantial; "frozen razors," dealing cold damage in an area; and "stinking cloud," which creates a noxious cloud that can incapacitate enemies.

In its combat capabilities, the Ghul can make use of a "Multiattack" action to make two claw attacks. Each claw attack is resolved with a +6 to hit and reaches out 5 feet to target one creature, dealing an average of 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. Furthermore, if the target is not an elf or undead, they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failure results in paralysis for one minute. Affected creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to try to end the effect. Overall, the Ghul presents an eclectic mix of melee and spellcasting abilities, along with tactical options to control the battlefield.
