The Sand Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon that embodies the essence of the arid desert, exuding a neutral evil alignment. With a well-rounded set of attributes, it boasts considerable physical durability and agility, making it a formidable foe in combat. It has an Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, which provides good protection against attacks. The Sand Wyrmling has 52 hit points, representing an average resilience for a challenge rating of 3, which allows it to endure a fair amount of punishment before being vanquished. Its high Strength and Constitution scores of 17 each grant it exceptional effectiveness in physical confrontations and resilience, while its Dexterity score of 12 reflects a somewhat above-average ability to evade attacks. However, its Intelligence at 11 is merely average, which might limit its strategic options. Its Wisdom (+2) and Charisma (+1) scores are also moderately strong, giving it decent perceptual abilities and social presence. 

The Sand Wyrmling possesses the following saving throw modifiers: Dexterity +3, Constitution +5 (very good), Wisdom +4 (good), and Charisma +3 (average). It has a proficiency in perception with a passive score of 16, which means it is attentive and can detect hidden creatures easily. The creature has immunity to fire damage and resistance to piercing damage, enabling it to withstand a variety of common attacks effectively. Additionally, it boasts condition immunity to being blinded, allowing it to negate certain combat penalties while exhibiting its keen senses through blindsight within a range of 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet. It communicates in Draconic, which may limit its direct interactions with non-draconic creatures.

The Sand Wyrmling's special abilities enhance its effectiveness in specific environments and combat situations. The Sand Camouflage ability grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in sandy environments, allowing it to hide effectively and ambush unsuspecting foes. Its Sandy Nature reflects its elemental affiliation, requiring only half the usual food and water, which makes it less dependent on resources than other dragons of comparable size. The Stinging Sand ability causes the first target it hits with a melee attack to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failing this save results in disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of the target's next turn, an ability that can significantly debilitate an opponent during combat.

In combat, the Sand Wyrmling can use two primary actions: a bite and its breath weapon. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, striking within a 5-foot range for an average of 8 piercing damage, making it a solid option for dealing damage in close quarters. Its Breath Weapon, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, can be used to unleash one of two potent effects. The Sand Blast option allows the Wyrmling to exhale superheated sand in a 15-foot cone, inflicting a combined total of 22 damage (11 piercing and 11 fire) on affected creatures who fail a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On the other hand, the Blinding Sand option releases fine sand in the same cone, blinding creatures for one minute on a failed DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Blinded creatures can spend an action to clear their eyes, providing a tactical element where the Sand Wyrmling can control the battlefield effectively.
