The King Kobold is a small yet cunning humanoid creature that embodies both strength in skirmishing and a unique role as a spellcaster. With a lawful neutral alignment, it adheres to a sense of order and loyalty among its kin. The King Kobold has a relatively good Armor Class of 15, enhanced to 18 with the use of mage armor, providing it with decent defense against attacks. It boasts 112 hit points, giving it a solid amount of resilience in battle. Although its physical strength is below average, its dexterity is exceptional at +5, allowing it to be very evasive in combat. The King Kobold excels in skills like deception, insight, intimidation, and persuasion, making it a formidable social combatant as well.

The King Kobold has the following attributes: Strength of 8 (which is bad), Dexterity of 20 (which is exceptional), Constitution of 12 (which is average), Intelligence of 14 (which is good), Wisdom of 14 (which is good), and Charisma of 15 (which is good). In terms of saving throws, it has very good bonuses with Dexterity +8 and Intelligence +5. With darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 12, it can see well in low light and is moderately perceptive. It can communicate in both Common and Draconic.

The King Kobold possesses several special abilities that enhance its survivability and effectiveness in combat. Cunning Action allows it to use a bonus action to Dash, Disengage, or Hide on each of its turns, enhancing its mobility. Evasion enables it to avoid damage from effects that allow a Dexterity saving throw, taking no damage on a success and half damage on a failure, making it very resilient against area attacks. Pack Tactics grants advantage on attack rolls against foes within 5 feet of its allies, which can greatly increase its offensive capabilities in group encounters. It also has a Sneak Attack that deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage under certain conditions, significantly boosting its damage output when the opportunity arises. However, King Kobolds are hampered by Sunlight Sensitivity, suffering disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom checks while in direct sunlight.

As a 4th-level spellcaster with a spell save DC of 13, the King Kobold has access to an array of spells that can alter the flow of battle. It can cast cantrips like fire bolt, which deals damage from a distance, mage hand for manipulating objects, minor illusion for distractions and cover, and poison spray to inflict damage without a ranged attack roll. Among its prepared 1st-level spells, alarm creates a magical barrier, grease can cause creatures to fall prone, and mage armor provides an additional protective layer. At the 2nd level, it can cast alter self to change its form, hold person to paralyze an opponent, and invisibility to escape or reposition in combat.

In combat, the King Kobold can utilize multiattack to make two shortsword strikes, both hitting with a +8 to attack, dealing 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage each time. It also has a hand crossbow that can attack from a distance, similarly hitting with a +8 and dealing the same damage. In reaction, the King Kobold can use Uncanny Dodge to halve the damage taken from a single attack, showcasing its evasive nature and tactical awareness in engagements. Overall, the King Kobold is a strategic and dangerous foe, capable of cunning ambushes and utilizing magic to manipulate encounters in its favor.
