The Spy is a cunning and agile humanoid creature, categorized as a Medium enemy with a challenge rating of 1. This type of foe specializes in stealth and deception, making it particularly dangerous in combat due to its ability to strike quickly and retreat without drawing attention. With a solid armor class of 13 and 40 hit points, it has decent survivability for its level. Its strengths lie in its Dexterity, which allows for nimble movements as well as high stealth capabilities, making it difficult to detect. However, its physical and mental attributes, particularly Strength and Constitution, are average at best, limiting its durability and raw power in melee encounters.

The Spy has the following ability scores: Strength is +0, Dexterity is +5 (very good), Constitution is +0, Intelligence is +1 (average), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +3 (good). With a high Dexterity modifier, the Spy excels at Stealth, boasting a score of 17, meaning it can easily hide from observers. Its Perception score is 16, allowing it to notice hidden dangers and traps effectively. The Spy can speak any two languages, which adds an element of versatility to its interactions.

In terms of combat, the Spy utilizes its special abilities effectively. It can perform a Multiattack, using either two Shortsword strikes or two Hand Crossbow shots against a single target in one turn. Each Shortsword attack has a +5 to hit modifier and deals 6 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Hand Crossbow operates similarly, with a +5 to hit and the same damage output, allowing for flexibility in choosing melee or ranged combat based on the situation.

The Spy also possesses several notable actions and bonus actions. The Cunning Action allows it to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action as a bonus action, which enhances its mobility and ability to evade confrontation. The Feint ability, which can be used after a recharge of 4â€“6 turns, demonstrates the Spy's tactical mindset. It feigns an attack within 5 feet of a target; if the target fails a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 13, the Spy gains advantage on its next attack roll against that creature. This can swing the tide of combat, allowing the Spy to land decisive hits on unsuspecting enemies.

Overall, the Spy is a versatile combatant effective in deceptive tactics and stealth maneuvers, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers who underestimate its cunning abilities.
