The Winter Wolf is a large monstrosity that strikes fear into the hearts of adventurers with its fierce demeanor and powerful abilities. This creature has a challenge rating of 3, indicating a formidable opponent for lower-level parties. It boasts significant hit points at 76 and possesses a fast speed of 50 feet, allowing it to close distances quickly. The Winter Wolf is particularly strong in combat due to its powerful bite attack and its ability to unleash a devastating cold breath. However, while it has good defensive capabilities, its intelligence is notably low, which may limit its tactical options. 

The Winter Wolf's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength of +3, which is considered good, allowing it to perform physical tasks effectively and deal decent melee damage.
- Dexterity of +1, which is average, providing a reasonable level of agility but not enough to rely on evasive maneuvers.
- Constitution of +2, regarded as good, giving it enhanced durability and contributing to its hit points.
- Intelligence of -2, classified as very bad, signifying a lack of problem-solving skills and tactical understanding.
- Wisdom of +1, which is average, providing some level of insight and perception.
- Charisma of -1, also considered bad, indicating that it is not persuasive or charming.

The Winter Wolf has several notable special abilities:
- Heightened Hearing and Smell enhances its Perception score to 20 when using those senses, making it exceptionally aware of its surroundings.
- Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and protects it from being frightened, providing it with stability in challenging situations.
- Pack Tactics offers it an advantage on attack rolls if an ally is close by, emphasizing its effectiveness in group combat scenarios.
- Snow Camouflage greatly enhances its Stealth in snowy terrain to a total of 18, making it a formidable ambush predator in icy environments.

In terms of actions, the Winter Wolf can perform the following:
- Multiattack allows it to make two Bite attacks in one turn.
- The Bite attack has a +5 to hit, good for successful strikes, and deals 10 piercing damage, enhanced by an additional 4 cold damage. If the attack hits a creature, they must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, potentially shifting the dynamics of combat.

The Winter Wolf has a special ability called Cold Breath, which can be used every 5 to 6 rounds. It exudes a blast of freezing wind in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures within that area to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 18 cold damage, while those who succeed take half that amount, presenting a significant threat to clustered enemies.

As a bonus action, it can perform Freezing Nose, targeting a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have part of their body frozen in ice for 1 minute, depending on the chosen body part. The body choices include:
- Body: Disadvantage on Constitution saving throws and vulnerability to cold damage.
- Head: The creature can't breathe or speak.
- Lower Limb: Speed is reduced to 0, with disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saves.
- Upper Limb: Disadvantage on attacks made with that limb.

Overall, the Winter Wolf combines powerful physical attacks with unique icy abilities, making it a dangerous opponent in combat scenarios, especially in environments where it can leverage its snow camouflage and freezing attacks.
