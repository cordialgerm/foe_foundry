The Shambling Mound is a large plant creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat due to its resilience and ability to utilize its environment to its advantage. With an Armor Class of 15 from its natural armor and 110 hit points, it is designed to withstand significant damage. It has a challenge rating of 5, indicating it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. Its strengths include its lightning absorption ability, which allows it to recover health when struck by lightning damage, and its resilience to various debilitating conditions. However, it lacks intelligence and charisma, which are very low, making it poor at social interactions and strategic planning.

The Shambling Mound has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 9 (-1), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 5 (-3). Its strength is exceptional, allowing it to deal heavy damage in melee combat and grapple opponents effectively. The dexterity, on the other hand, is bad, meaning its initiative and avoidance are limited. The constitution is good, contributing to its overall durability, while intelligence, wisdom, and charisma values are very bad, indicating poor cognitive and interaction skills.

One of the Shambling Mound's notable special abilities is Lightning Absorption. This ability negates any lightning damage it receives and allows it to heal for that amount. This makes it especially resilient against thunderbolts or similar attacks. Another ability, Plant Resilience, grants it resistance to exhaustion and reduces the chances of being affected by conditions like paralysis, petrification, or unconsciousness. Additionally, Rotting Vegetation emits a noxious smell that can poison creatures starting their turn within 10 feet, requiring a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to resist.

In terms of actions, the Shamblin Mound can make two melee attack attempts using its Slam ability, which has a +7 to hit and deals a base damage of 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning plus an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage. If both Slam attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the target is grappled, making it harder for that creature to escape.

As a bonus action, the Shambling Mound can use Engulf. This attack allows it to engulf a Medium or smaller creature already grappled by it. An engulfed creature is blinded, restrained, and cannot breathe. Each turn, the engulfed creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take ongoing damage. This adds a tactical layer to combat, as it can incapacitate opponents while moving through the battlefield.

Overall, the Shambling Mound is a fierce opponent that thrives in close quarters, leveraging its ability to heal from lightning, resist debilitating conditions, and engulf enemies to dominate combat situations.
