With a challenge rating of 1, the Erina Defender is suited for low-level encounters, providing a good balance of offense and defense with its notable abilities.

The Dexterity contributes to its initiative and ranged attack accuracy, while its Constitution contributes to its health and resilience against various effects.

The creature has proficiency in Athletics with a modifier of +4 and Perception with a modifier of +3. It also has resistance to poison damage, which enhances its survivability in situations involving poisonous attacks. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 13, allowing it to perceive its environment more effectively, especially in low-light settings. The Erina Defender speaks Common and its own language, Erina, allowing for basic communication.

Special abilities of the Erina Defender include Keen Smell, which grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, enhancing its tracking and awareness capabilities.

This ability plays a crucial role in protecting allies during combat, highlighting the Defender's role as a protector on the battlefield.
