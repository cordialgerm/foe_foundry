The Grindylow is a medium-sized aberration characterized by its chaotic evil nature. Residing underwater, this creature possesses a unique combination of cleverness and agility, making it a formidable opponent to unwary adventurers. With access to mimicry, the Grindylow can deceive foes by imitating humanoid voices, adding an element of psychological warfare to its combat strategy. However, its lack of robust intelligence makes it somewhat predictable in tactics, relying primarily on its physical attacks and the advantages provided by its aquatic environment. Its ability to move swiftly through water and use ink clouds for escape enhances its survivability, positioning it as a cunning adversary despite its relatively low challenge rating.

The Grindylow has an Armor Class of 13, which is regarded as average for creatures of its Challenge Rating. It possesses 27 hit points, calculated as 5d8 plus 5, granting it a moderate level of durability in combat. The creature's Speed is notably agile, allowing it to swim at 40 feet and walk at 10 feet, providing options for movement in both aquatic and terrestrial settings. The Grindylow's Strength is 13, giving it a modifier of +1, which is average; Dexterity is 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, classified as good; and Constitution stands at 12, leading to a +1 modifier that is also average. Its Intelligence is only 8, granting a -1 modifier, which is considered bad, while Wisdom is strong at 14, resulting in a +2 modifier that is good. Lastly, it has a Charisma of 9, leading to a -1 modifier, assessed as bad.

In terms of skills, the Grindylow shows proficiency in acrobatics +4, athletics +3, and stealth +4, showcasing its agile and sneaky nature. With darkvision extending 60 feet, it can see in low light conditions, paired with a passive Perception score of 12 that helps it detect invisible threats. The Grindylow can communicate in Aquan, the language of aquatic creatures.

The Grindylow possesses several notable special abilities. The first is Mimicry, allowing it to imitate humanoid voices, which can mislead adventurers unless they successfully pass a DC 13 Wisdom Insight check to discern the trickery. Its Slippery ability provides it with the advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape grapples, enhancing its means of evading capture. The Water Breathing trait facilitates its survival underwater, as it can breathe in such an environment exclusively.

During combat, the Grindylow uses a Multiattack, enabling it to make two separate attacks: one with its Bite and another with its Claws. The Bite is a melee weapon attack that adds +3 to hit, extending a reach of 5 feet, dealing 4 piercing damage on a successful hit (1d6 + 1). The Claws attack also adds +3 to hit, reaching out to 10 feet. It deals 8 slashing damage (2d6 + 1) and grapples the target with an escape DC of 13, leaving the targeted creature restrained until the grapple ends.

Additionally, the Grindylow can utilize the Ink Cloud ability, which recharges after a short or long rest. When underwater, it can release a cloud of ink in a 20-foot radius, which heavily obscures the area for 1 minute. Significant currents can disperse this ink, but during its duration, the Grindylow can also Dash as a bonus action, allowing it to escape or reposition swiftly amidst the chaos it creates. This combination of abilities and actions makes the Grindylow a tricky adversary that thrives in watery confrontations.
