The Vine Drake is a Medium, neutral dragon that combines physical prowess with the ability to manipulate nature, making it a formidable creature in 5e Dungeons & Dragons. With an Armor Class of 16 and a robust pool of 105 hit points, it can withstand considerable damage. The creature is particularly effective in combat, boasting a Challenge Rating of 7, which indicates it is a strong foe for mid-level adventurers. Notably, the Vine Drake has the ability to communicate with plants, utilizes its natural defenses through thorny skin, and can cast the entangle spell without the need for material components, allowing it to control its environment and hinder enemies effectively. 

The Vine Drake has the following attributes: Strength of 18 (+4), Dexterity of 15 (+2), Constitution of 16 (+3), Intelligence of 11 (+0), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 14 (+2). Its high Strength and Constitution make it a good combatant, while the Dexterity contributes to its decent mobility. The saving throw bonuses include +6 for Constitution, which is very good, and +4 for Wisdom, which is good. Its skills include Athletics at +7, which is exceptional, Nature at +3, which is average, Perception at +4, which is good, and Stealth at +5, which is also good. The Vine Drake resists bludgeoning and piercing damage from nonmagical attacks, giving it a strong defense against many traditional weapons. It has darkvision that extends up to 90 feet and a passive Perception score of 14, making it rather perceptive in dim light or darkness. The creature can communicate in Common and Draconic.

The Vine Drake possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and utility. The "Speak with Plants" ability allows it to converse with plants, which can provide tactical advantages in nature-rich terrains. The "Thorn Body" ability inflicts 4 (1d8) piercing damage to any creature that touches the drake or hits it with a melee attack while within five feet, making foes think twice before engaging in close combat. Additionally, it has "Innate Spellcasting," allowing it to cast entangle two times per day without needing material components, leveraging its Charisma as its spellcasting ability.

In terms of actions during combat, the Vine Drake can utilize a Multiattack, allowing it to perform three separate attacks in one turn. This includes one attack with its bite, one with its claw, and one with its vine lash. The bite attack requires a melee weapon attack roll with +7 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) poison damage. Targets hit must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute, with the opportunity to escape the effect at the end of their turns. The claw attack, also a melee weapon attack, deals 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage with the same +7 to hit. The vine lash has a reach of 10 feet and deals 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, grappling Medium or smaller creatures (escape DC 15) and restraining them until the grapple ends. Its final action is "Acid Breath," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the Vine Drake to exhale acid in a 30-foot line, forcing creatures within that line to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 22 (5d8) acid damage, or half on a successful one, making it a powerful area-of-effect attack. 

Overall, the Vine Drake is a versatile and dangerous creature that excels in both physical combat and nature manipulation, presenting a challenge to adventurers who encounter it.
