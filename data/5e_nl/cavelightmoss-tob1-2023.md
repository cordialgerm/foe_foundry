The Cavelight Moss is a large, unaligned plant creature known for its unique ability to illuminate dark areas, making it a fascinating addition to the subterranean ecosystem. This creature is particularly resilient due to its high hit points, and its natural armor provides decent protection against physical attacks. The Cavelight Moss excels in grappling and exhausting its foes, allowing it to sap the strength of adventurers who dare to approach. However, it is not particularly mobile, with a slow walking speed, and its intelligence is severely lacking, making it vulnerable to more cunning opponents. Players should be cautious when engaging the Cavelight Moss, as its abilities can hinder movement and impose debilitating exhaustion.

The Cavelight Moss has the following attributes: Strength 20 (+5, which is exceptional), Dexterity 10 (+0, which is average), Constitution 18 (+4, which is very good), Intelligence 1 (-5, which is very bad), Wisdom 13 (+1, which is average), and Charisma 5 (-3, which is very bad). Its strengths lie in physical power and resilience, but it is significantly hindered by its low intelligence and charisma.

In terms of skills, the Cavelight Moss possesses damage resistances to acid, cold, fire, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, making it quite durable in a variety of combat scenarios. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, prone, stunned, and unconscious, granting it a significant advantage against many forms of crowd control. Its senses include tremorsense up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect movement and vibrations in its vicinity, and a passive Perception score of 11.

One of the notable abilities of the Cavelight Moss is Variable Illumination, which allows it to shed bright light in a radius ranging from 5 to 20 feet, with a corresponding dim light area extending further. The creature can adjust this radius as a bonus action, providing tactical advantage in combat scenarios and aiding in ambushes.

For its actions, the Cavelight Moss can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Tendrils attacks. If both attacks successfully hit a Large or smaller target, that target becomes grappled with an escape DC of 15. While grappling a target, the creature restrains them, and at the beginning of each of that creature's turns, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it gains one level of exhaustion, while the moss receives 5 temporary hit points. A successful saving throw means the afflicted creature is no longer at risk of further exhaustion from the Cavelight Moss for the next 24 hours. It's important to note that the Cavelight Moss can only grapple one creature at a time, which can limit its versatility in larger encounters. Each Tendrils attack is a Melee Weapon Attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing significant bludgeoning damage of 16 (2d10 + 5) upon a successful strike. 

Engaging a Cavelight Moss can have serious consequences for adventurers, making it essential to strategize around its grappling and exhaustion abilities while considering its unique illumination powers.
