The Shadow Elf Champion Warrior is a formidable Medium humanoid with a Challenge Rating of 5, indicating that it poses a significant threat to adventurers. With an impressive Armor Class of 16 and 90 hit points, this warrior is built to endure in combat. It excels in both melee and ranged combat, using its agility and strength effectively. The creature possesses exceptional Dexterity and Strength, both at 18 (+4 modifier), allowing it to strike accurately and evade attacks.

The attributes of the Shadow Elf Champion Warrior include Strength at 18 (+4), ensuring very good melee damage output. Dexterity also at 18 (+4) provides good evasion and accurate ranged attacks.

Charisma at 14 (+2) supports its spellcasting abilities well. Saving throws reveal strengths in Strength (+7), Dexterity (+7), and Constitution (+6), while it has average weaknesses in Wisdom (+4), making it a well-rounded defense against various attacks.

This creature has a diverse skill set, with athletics (+7) and stealth (+7) showing exceptional prowess, allowing it to excel in both physical challenges and remaining undetected.

The Shadow Elf Champion Warrior possesses special abilities related to spellcasting, utilizing Charisma as its casting ability with a spell save DC of 13. Although not very high, this allows it to cast spells without the need for material components. 

In combat, the Champion Warrior can initiate a Multiattack, allowing it to make two weapon strikes in a single turn, increasing its offensive output significantly. Its primary melee weapon is a Shortsword, which has a +7 to hit and deals a base 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. Notably, the warrior can poison the blade to inflict an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage should it choose to do so. This dual damage mechanism makes its attacks particularly lethal.

For ranged engagements, it uses a Hand Crossbow, also making an attack roll with a +7 modifier. The range is effective at 30/120 feet, allowing it to engage targets safely from a distance. On a successful hit, it deals the same piercing damage of 7 (1d6 + 4). However, if this ranged attack hits a creature, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they are poisoned for one hour, suffering continuous effects from the poison. A critical failure—failing the saving throw by 5 or more—renders the target unconscious until they overcome the poison or are awakened by another creature.

Overall, the Shadow Elf Champion Warrior embodies a well-rounded combatant in both offense and defense, supported by strong abilities and skills that make it a challenging opponent in battle.
