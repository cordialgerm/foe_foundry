The Bannik is a Medium Fey creature characterized by its neutral alignment, making it an interesting entity within social interactions and combat scenarios. With a moderate Armor Class of 13 and a total of 60 hit points, it can endure some damage but is not heavily armored compared to more formidable foes. The Bannik's movement speed allows it to navigate both land and water with equal ease, possessing a walking speed of 30 feet and a swimming speed of 30 feet as well. It presents a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating that it can pose an interesting challenge to lower-level adventurers while rewarding 450 experience points for overcoming it. Notable strengths of the Bannik include its ability to see through fog and smoke, as well as its fire resistance and damage mitigation against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. However, it is vulnerable to cold damage, which can be exploited by clever foes.

The Bannik has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2, which is good), Dexterity 15 (+2, which is good), Constitution 13 (+1, which is average), Intelligence 9 (-1, which is bad), Wisdom 17 (+3, which is very good), and Charisma 10 (+0, which is average). For saving throws, the Bannik has a Constitution modifier of +3 (average) and a Charisma modifier of +2 (average). Its skills include perception with a +3 modifier (good), and it has darkvision that allows it to see 60 feet in darkness, adding to its efficiency in low-light environments.

The Bannik's special abilities enhance its combat and exploration capabilities. It can see through areas obscured by fog, smoke, and steam without any penalty due to its Hazesight ability. Additionally, it can hold its breath for up to 10 minutes, allowing it to navigate underwater without concern for drowning.

In combat, the Bannik can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks with its Scalding Claws. The Scalding Claws attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 modifier to hit. If successful, it deals 5 slashing damage plus an additional 3 fire damage, making it a total of 8 damage on a hit.

The Bannik also has an impactful action called Scalding Splash, which can be used once it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the Bannik to summon a giant ladle filled with boiling water that pours down on a point within 60 feet. This action extinguishes exposed flames within a 10-foot radius and forces creatures in that area to make a DC 13 Constitution save. Creatures that fail the save take 14 fire damage and suffer a scalded condition, which imposes disadvantage on weapon attack rolls and on Constitution saves required to maintain concentration. Successful saving creatures take half the damage and avoid being scalded, while scalded creatures can attempt to re-save at the end of each of their turns to end the effect.

The Bannik is also capable of spellcasting, with a Wisdom saving throw DC of 13. It can use the wand of bound fir to cast spells such as Augury and Create or Destroy Water at will, as well as Fog Cloud up to three times per day. Lesser Restoration is also available, allowing the Bannik to remove certain conditions from creatures. These spells add to the Bannik's versatility in both combat and roleplay scenarios, enabling it to influence the battlefield or aid allies significantly.
