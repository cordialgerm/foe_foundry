The Lemure is a Medium fiend classified as a devil, known for its resilience and its connection to the Hells. It has a low Armor Class of 8 and 17 hit points, making it somewhat fragile for combat situations. However, its unique abilities and resistances give it a niche role as a harbinger of chaos and minor torment, often serving more powerful devils. The Lemure has a challenge rating of 1/4, indicating it is a minor threat to adventurers. Its strengths lie in its immunities to fire and poison damage, as well as its ability to rejuvenate after death, making it a persistent foe. On the other hand, its low Dexterity and Intelligence scores leave it vulnerable to more agile and intelligent foes.

The Lemure has the following attributes: a Strength score of 12 (+2 modifier, considered average), Dexterity of 8 (-2 modifier, categorized as bad), Constitution of 11 (+1 modifier, average), Intelligence of 5 (-3 modifier, very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0 modifier, average), and a Charisma of 6 (-4 modifier, classified as very bad). It possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception score is an average 10, while its Stealth score is 7, which is relatively good due to the negative Dexterity modifier.

The Lemure has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. "Devilâ€™s Sight" allows the Lemure to see through magical darkness, making it difficult for enemies to hide from it. "Devilish Resilience" grants resistance to cold damage and immunity to both fire damage and the poisoned condition, allowing it to shrug off many types of attacks. "Hellish Rejuvenation" gives the Lemure a unique mechanic where it can return to life within 1d10 days if it dies in the Hells, regaining all hit points and becoming active once more; this can only be thwarted by the application of holy water to its remains.

In combat, the Lemure has a melee weapon attack called "Fist." This attack has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet and can target one creature. On a successful hit, it inflicts 4 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 2 fire damage, combining physical and elemental attacks, which can be particularly useful against foes vulnerable to fire.

The Lemure also has a bonus action called "Rippling Heat," usable once per day. This ability creates an aura of intense heat for 1 minute, affecting creatures that start their turn within 15 feet if they are not devils. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their attack rolls and deal only half damage with strength-based weapon attacks until their next turn. If they fail the save by 5 or more, they also gain one level of exhaustion. A creature suffering from exhaustion due to this effect cannot be affected again by the same lemure for 24 hours, making it a potent crowd control ability in appropriate encounters.
