The Umbral Vampire is a malevolent undead creature that embodies chaos and darkness, making it a formidable adversary. With its strong Dexterity and Charisma, it excels in stealth and manipulation, allowing it to sneak up on unsuspecting prey and inflict debilitating effects. It has a substantial amount of hit points, making it difficult to defeat in battle. However, it struggles in sunlight, where its power diminishes drastically due to its sensitivity to light. Its abilities and attacks focus on necrotic damage, the draining of strength, and the summoning of shadows, all of which can impose significant challenges for adventurers confronted by it.

The Umbral Vampire has an Armor Class of 14, representing a good defense, though not exceptional. It possesses 84 hit points, calculated through 13d8 plus an additional 26, which gives it a solid resilience in combatâ€”this can be classified as good. It moves quickly with a speed of 40 feet, enabling tactical positioning in fights. As a Challenge Rating 7 creature, it poses a credible threat to mid-level parties, offering 2,900 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Umbral Vampire has a Strength score of 1, which is very bad and indicates a complete lack of physical prowess. Its Dexterity is 18, with a modifier of +4, which is exceptional, allowing for agile movements and good defensive capabilities. With a Constitution score of 15 (+2), the vampire enjoys a decent level of resilience against ongoing damage. Its Intelligence and Wisdom scores both stand at 14 (+2), reflecting average mental capabilities. Most notably, its Charisma score is 19 (+4), which is exceptional and enhances its spellcasting and any social interactions.

The creature is proficient in Dexterity saving throws with a +7 bonus and Charisma saving throws, also with a +7 bonus, both of which are very good, ensuring resilience against many effects. It has skills in Perception (+5) and Stealth (+7), making it a very good ambusher. Immunities to cold, necrotic, and poison damage enhance its survivability, while it also resists acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, as well as nonmagical attacks, showcasing good defensive traits. The creature is immune to exhaustion, grapple, paralysis, petrification, poison, prone, and restrained conditions, indicating exceptional durability.

The Umbral Vampire possesses a range of special abilities. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects as though they were difficult terrain, resulting in a unique movement style. This ability inflicts 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve sight while the vampire is illuminated by sunlight, a significant weakness. It also benefits from Undead Nature, meaning it does not require air, allowing it to bypass any environmental hazards related to breathing.

In combat, the Umbral Vampire can execute a Multiattack, which allows it to use its Umbral Grasp before making two Shadow Touch attacks. The Shadow Touch employs a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, dealing 17 (3d8 + 4) necrotic damage and reducing the target's Strength score by 1d4. If the reduction takes the target's Strength to 0, it dies and rises as a shadow under the vampire's control after 24 hours unless revived. This mechanic can create an army of shadows, adding to the vampire's threat level. 

Umbral Grasp involves the vampire conjuring a hand of shadow that targets a creature in dim light or darkness within 30 feet. The target must perform a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw; on failure, they are restrained for one minute, suffering 9 (2d8) necrotic damage at the start of their turns. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to break free. This ability can significantly hinder an opponent's actions and diminish their combat effectiveness.

Additionally, the Umbral Vampire can use the bonus action Shadow Stealth while in dim light or darkness, allowing it to hide effectively. This amplifies its ambush potential and gives it a strategic advantage in engagements where light is limited. Overall, the Umbral Vampire is a cunning and dangerous foe that thrives in darkness and relies on its dark powers to manipulate and dominate its enemies.
