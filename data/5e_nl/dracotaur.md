In combat, the Dracotaur can utilize the following actions:
- Multiattack: The Dracotaur attacks twice: it can either make one bite attack and one claw attack, or two attacks with its longbow.
- Bite: This melee attack has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage and an additional 7 (2d6) lightning damage, making it a very potent attack.
- Claws: Similarly, this attack also has a +8 to hit and deals 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage on a hit.

The Dracotaur also possesses powerful spells:
- Lightning Arrow (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest): It allows the Dracotaur to fire an arrow that explodes into a 20-foot-radius sphere of lightning, requiring creatures in that area to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 28 (8d6) lightning damage, or half as much on a success, which can significantly alter the dynamics of a battle.
- Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6): Exhaling a line of lightning 60 feet long and 5 feet wide allows the Dracotaur to target multiple creatures, demanding a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in 33 (6d10) lightning damage, while success halves the damage, showcasing the Dracotaur's devastating potential in controlling the battlefield.

Overall, the Dracotaur combines strong physical attacks with lightning-based abilities, making it a versatile opponent in combat with both melee and ranged capabilities.
