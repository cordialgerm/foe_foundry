The Xorn is a Medium Elemental creature that serves as a highly skilled and resilient guardian of treasure within rocky environments. With an Armor Class of 19 and formidable hit points totaling 73, the Xorn is exceptionally durable, capable of withstanding significant damage before being defeated. Its burrowing ability allows it to navigate through earth and stone seamlessly, making it a versatile combatant in its favored terrain. The creature possesses a significant strength score of 18, which provides it with a good modifier for physical attacks, while its high Constitution score of 22 conveys its outstanding endurance. The Xorn's primary strengths lie in its ability to hide effectively within rocky terrains and its remarkable detection of valuable items through its Treasure Sense ability. However, it is limited in mobility, moving slowly at just 20 feet, which can make it vulnerable to ranged attacks.

The creature has darkvision of 60 feet and tremorsense of the same range, enhancing its situational awareness in low-light environments and through vibrations in the ground.

The Xorn possesses several special abilities: 

- Camouflage provides the creature with advantage on Stealth checks when hiding in rocky terrain, making it difficult to detect.
- Earth Glide allows the Xorn to burrow through unworked earth and stone without leaving a trace, enabling surprise attacks and evasive movements.
- Treasure Sense grants the Xorn the ability to smell coins and gems from up to 500 feet away, ensuring it can track down valuable targets. 

In combat, the Xorn has a Multiattack option, allowing it to make three claw attacks and, if it has successfully hit a target with its claws at least twice during a turn, it can then perform a bite attack. 

- The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 modifier to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 8 slashing damage on a successful hit. 
- The Bite attack also has a +7 modifier to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals more substantial damageâ€”13 piercing damage. Additionally, this bite can consume a nonmagical metal object in the target's possession, which could be armor or weapons, or any coins or gems. If the target tries to retrieve an item consumed by the Xorn within a minute of its consumption, they will take 7 acid damage in the process.

Overall, the Xorn is a formidable foe that excels at ambushing treasure seekers and providing a captivating challenge for players who seek to engage with it in both combat and strategy.
