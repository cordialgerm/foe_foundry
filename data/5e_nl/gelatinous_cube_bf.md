The Gelatinous Cube is a large ooze creature that serves as an ambush predator in various dungeons and subterranean environments. With its slow movement speed of 15 feet, it relies on cunning tactics rather than brute force to capture unsuspecting prey. Its notable features include a high resilience to various conditions and a unique ability to engulf creatures, making it a formidable opponent when encountered. However, its low Armor Class of 6 and lack of ranged attacks can be significant weaknesses, making it vulnerable to opponents who can maintain distance. Overall, the Gelatinous Cube is a challenge for adventurers who venture too carelessly.

The Gelatinous Cube possesses the following attributes: Strength is +3 (average), Dexterity is -3 (very bad), Constitution is +5 (very good), Intelligence is -5 (very bad), Wisdom is -2 (bad), and Charisma is -5 (very bad). Its hit points are 75, indicating considerable durability in combat. The creature has a challenge rating of 2, suggesting it poses a medium threat level to a party of adventurers. It has keen senses that allow it to effectively perceive its surroundings within a 60-foot radius, though it is unable to detect anything beyond this range. Its Perception score is 8 (bad), and it has a Stealth score of 7 (bad), which means it can attempt to hide effectively only when motionless due to its transparent body.

The Gelatinous Cube has several special abilities that enhance its unique characteristics in combat. The "Ooze Cube" ability allows it to occupy its entire space, making it challenging for ground-level creatures to avoid entering that space. Any creature entering its area is at a disadvantage when saving against the cube's engulfing attack. The "Ooze Nature" ability means that it does not need sleep, allowing it to remain active during long encounters. "Ooze Resilience" provides the cube significant advantages, offering immunity to several conditions such as exhaustion, and resistance to being grappled or restrained, thus making it difficult to control. Its "Transparent" ability allows it to effectively increase its Stealth score to 15 while motionless, even in clear view, providing an element of surprise when it is not detected.

In terms of actions, the Gelatinous Cube can make a melee weapon attack with a "Pseudopod," having a +5 modifier to hit. If successful, it deals 10 (3d6) acid damage to the targeted creature. The "Engulf" ability allows the cube to move up to its speed and attempt to engulf a creature in its path. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, with failure resulting in 10 acid damage and being engulfed. Engulfed creatures cannot breathe, become restrained, and suffer an additional 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube’s turns. If the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves along with it, complicating escape attempts.

Additionally, the Gelatinous Cube can utilize a reaction called "Skewer Prey." When it takes piercing damage, it can choose to move a random engulfed creature to absorb the attack, causing that creature to take the damage instead. This clever tactic can change the flow of battle by forcing the adventurers to reconsider their strategies, making the Gelatinous Cube a uniquely dangerous opponent in any encounter.
