The Cult Fanatic is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies the fervor and zealotry often associated with cults. They possess a modest armor class of 12, making them vulnerable to physical attacks, but their hit points total 39, providing them with reasonable durability in combat situations. The Cult Fanatic’s challenge rating is 2, which is appropriate for a creature that can both support allies and hinder enemies through its spellcasting capabilities. They have notably good Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, allowing them to excel in aspects of combat that involve agile movement and persuasive abilities. Their ability to resist charm and fear effects signifies a strong mental fortitude. While their melee capabilities using a dagger are reliable, their true strength lies in their spellcasting, where they can inflict considerable damage or manipulate foes with a variety of spells.

The Cult Fanatic's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength is 10, which is average and indicates they are not particularly strong. 
- Dexterity is 14 (+2), which is good and aids them in avoiding attacks. 
- Constitution is 14 (+2), providing them with good resilience. 
- Intelligence is 10, indicating average cognitive ability. 
- Wisdom is 14 (+2), which is good and enhances their saving throw against spells. 
- Charisma is also 14 (+2), supporting their roles in deception and persuasion. 

The Cult Fanatic has a saving throw bonus of +4 to Wisdom, which is good and reflects their proficiency in resisting spells that target the mind. Their skills include deception (+4), persuasion (+4), and religion (+2), allowing them to manipulate others and demonstrate some religious knowledge. With a passive perception of 12, they can reasonably detect hidden threats. They can communicate in any one language of their choice.

In terms of special abilities, the Cult Fanatic possesses "Fanatic," granting them advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, thus making them particularly resilient against mental effects. Their spellcasting ability revolves around Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 12 and a +4 to hit with spell attacks. The spells they have prepared include:

- Cantrips (which can be used at will): 
  - Light (creates a bright light),
  - Sacred Flame (a radiant damage attack),
  - Thaumaturgy (creates minor magical effects).

- 1st-level spells (with four available slots): 
  - Ceremony (a ritual spell for specific ceremonies),
  - Command (forces a creature to obey a simple order),
  - Detect Evil and Good (senses aberrations, celestials, fiends, etc.),
  - Inflict Wounds (a potent melee attack that deals necrotic damage).

- 2nd-level spells (with three available slots): 
  - Blindness/Deafness (can blind or deafen a target),
  - Hold Person (paralyzes a humanoid).

In combat, the Cult Fanatic can engage with their dagger, making a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit. A successful hit deals 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. Their use of Sacred Flame requires the target to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) radiant damage on a failure, and it affects creatures regardless of cover. 

The Command spell forces a creature to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw; if they fail, the creature must fall prone and end their turn, effectively removing them from the fight for that round. Inflict Wounds is a powerful melee spell attack that can deal up to 16 (3d10) necrotic damage, showcasing the Cult Fanatic’s dangerous close-combat potential. The Blindness/Deafness spell can incapacitate a target by blinding or deafening them for a minute if they fail their saving throw. Finally, the Hold Person spell, if successful, paralyzes a humanoid for one minute, giving the Cult Fanatic a significant edge in controlling the battlefield.
