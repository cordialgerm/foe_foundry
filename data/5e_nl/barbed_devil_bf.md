The Barbed Devil is a Medium fiend classified as a devil and is known for its menacing presence and formidable combat abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, boasting strong physical attributes, including a high Strength score of +6 and a remarkable Constitution score of +7, which provides it with substantial hit points totaling 94. The Barbed Devil is particularly effective in melee combat due to its piercing damage capabilities and special abilities that can hinder opponents. It is also resilient to various forms of damage, being resistant to cold and non-magical attacks, and immune to fire and poison. Its weaknesses primarily stem from reliance on spell resistance and potential vulnerabilities in strategic combat situations.

The Barbed Devil has the following ability scores: Strength +6 (very good), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +7 (exceptional), Intelligence +1 (average), Wisdom +5 (very good), and Charisma +5 (very good). Its senses are enhanced with darkvision that extends 120 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings in darkness effectively. The Barbed Devil possesses a Perception score of 18 (very good) and a Stealth score of 13 (average). It can communicate in Infernal as well as through telepathy within a range of 120 feet.

In terms of special abilities, the Barbed Devil can inflict hazardous conditions on the battlefield. Its Barbed Death ability activates upon its demise, withering its body and leaving a hazardous terrain of spikes in a 10-foot radius. This area becomes difficult terrain for one minute, causing any creature moving through it to suffer 2d6 piercing damage for every 5 feet traveled. The Barbed Hide ability deals 3 (1d6) piercing damage to any creature that strikes the devil with a melee attack while within 5 feet. Additionally, any creature grappling or grappled by the devil suffers the same damage at the start of its turn. The Devil's Sight ability allows the Barbed Devil to see through magical darkness, making it difficult for spellcasters to impede its vision. Its Devilish Resilience grants it substantial resistances and immunities, and it has Magic Resistance, enabling it to have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

In combat, the Barbed Devil can execute a Multiattack action, allowing it to strike with two Claw attacks and one Tail attack or three ranged Hurl Flame attacks. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage upon a successful hit. The Tail attack, also a melee weapon attack with the same +6 to hit, inflicts 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. The Hurl Flame action is a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit and a range of 150 feet, dealing 12 (3d6 + 2) fire damage to a target. If this attack hits a flammable object that is not in a creature's possession, the object ignites, adding additional strategic considerations for both the Barbed Devil and its opponents.
