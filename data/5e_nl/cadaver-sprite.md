The Cadaver Sprite is a tiny undead creature embodying a neutral evil alignment, making it a sneaky and unsettling opponent for adventurers. With a decent armor class of 14 and 20 hit points derived from 8d4, it can withstand moderate attacks. Its challenge rating of 1/2 indicates that it serves as a low-level threat, suitable for low-tier encounters. While it relies heavily on its Dexterity, which is exceptional at +4, it has low physical strength and charisma values, making it less effective in direct physical confrontations and social interactions. The Cadaver Sprite is particularly skilled in stealth, boasting a very good +8 modifier, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting targets.

In terms of abilities, the Cadaver Sprite's Strength score is a low 5, resulting in a very bad -3 modifier, indicating it struggles with melee attacks and physical feats. Its Dexterity of 18 allows for exceptional agility, enhancing both its attack rolls and overall stealth capabilities. The Constitution score of 10 matches the average, providing a moderate durability factor, while its Intelligence at 14 grants a good +2 modifier, which may imply a level of cunning in its tactics. The Wisdom of 13 gives an average +1 modifier, making it reasonably perceptive, and the Charisma score of 8 reflects a very bad -1 modifier, suggesting it is not charismatic or persuasive.

The Cadaver Sprite's damage vulnerabilities include bludgeoning damage, meaning it takes increased damage when hit by bludgeoning weapons. It possesses immunity to poison damage and is unaffected by conditions such as exhaustion and being poisoned. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness, and it has a passive perception score of 11, indicating its ability to notice threats or hidden creatures. The Cadaver Sprite does not understand any languages.

For its actions, the Cadaver Sprite can use a shortbow for ranged attacks, which has an attack modifier of +6. The range of the shortbow is 40 feet normally and can reach out to 160 feet at a disadvantage. When it successfully hits, it deals 7 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid becoming poisoned for one minute. If the saving throw is 5 or lower, the affected target falls unconscious during this time. This ability introduces a tactical element, as it can incapacitate foes for a significant duration.

It also has a melee attack called Corrupting Bite, with an attack modifier of +6 and a reach of 5 feet. The bite deals 6 piercing damage plus 2 necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer an additional 2 necrotic damage at the start of its next turn, adding a layer of sustained damage potential.

The Cadaver Sprite's Invisibility ability allows it to magically become invisible until it attacks or loses concentration, which is a powerful tactical option in combat. This invisibility extends to any equipment it carries, making it difficult for foes to target or predict its movements.

Overall, the Cadaver Sprite is highly adept at stealth and cunning, utilizing its invisibility and ranged attacks to create strategic advantages in combat scenarios while remaining resilient against certain forms of damage.
