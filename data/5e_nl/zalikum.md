Zalikum is a huge construct with a neutral evil alignment, designed to be a formidable foe in combat. It possesses a robust Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, and with 103 hit points, it can withstand significant damage. Its movement capabilities are notable, with a walking speed of 20 feet and the ability to fly at 80 feet, making it agile in the air. As a Challenge Rating 7 creature, it poses a serious threat to adventurers, granting 2,900 experience points upon defeat. Zalikum's strengths include high strength and constitution scores, which enhance its physical attacks and durability, while its weaknesses lie in its limited intelligence and wisdom, making it less effective in tasks requiring cleverness or insight.

Zalikum possesses the following ability scores: Strength at 19 (+4), Dexterity at 17 (+3), Constitution at 21 (+5), Intelligence at 8 (-1), Wisdom at 10 (+0), and Charisma at 15 (+2). The construct's Dexterity and Charisma saving throw bonuses are +6 and +5, respectively, which are considered good, allowing it to avoid many effects. Zalikum is immune to fire, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, and has resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, making it an exceptionally tough opponent to damage with ordinary weapons. It is also immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 13. While Zalikum understands the languages of its creator, it cannot speak.

Zalikum has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The Flyby ability allows it to move out of an enemy's reach without provoking opportunity attacks, granting it freedom to reposition during fights. The Ghastly Heated Body ability inflicts 3 (1d6) fire damage and 3 (1d6) necrotic damage to any creature that touches it or attacks it in melee while standing nearby, acting as a deterrent for close-range engagements. The Rejuvenation ability allows Zalikum to store the souls of up to three victims, granting it the ability to return to life in 1d10 days if it has at least one soul stored. This ability can only be thwarted by grounding its sandy remains in consecrated ground soaked with holy water.

In terms of combat actions, Zalikum can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one beak attack and one talon attack in a single turn. The Beak attack hits with a +7 to hit and has a 10-foot reach, dealing 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage alongside an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage and 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. If this attack kills a creature, the victim's body crumbles into sand, allowing Zalikum to store its soul with further resurrection hindrance. The Talon attack also has a +7 to hit with a 5-foot reach, dealing 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, plus the same 3 (1d6) fire and 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. 

Zalikumâ€™s most devastating ability is the Death-infused Desert Breath, which has a recharge of 6. This attack allows Zalikum to exhale superheated sand in a 30-foot cone, dealing significant area damage of 14 (4d6) fire and necrotic damage on a failed DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, or half that on a successful save. Additionally, if a creature's saving throw fails by 5 or more, it suffers one level of exhaustion, further crippling its ability to function effectively in battle. Overall, Zalikum is a well-rounded and fearsome opponent that threatens both physical and magical defense in combat encounters.
