The Giant Weasel is a Medium beast that serves primarily as a cunning and agile creature in Dungeons & Dragons. With its relatively low hit points of 14, the weasel is not particularly resilient, making it vulnerable in direct combat. However, its high speed of 40 feet allows it to maneuver quickly around the battlefield, often evading attacks. The challenge rating of 1/4 indicates it is a low-level threat, ideal for encounters with novice adventurers. Notable for its strong stealth capabilities and enhanced senses, the Giant Weasel can slip into shadows and avoid detection while also detecting creatures nearby through its heightened perception. 

The Giant Weasel has an Armor Class of 13, which is average for a creature of its type, allowing it to withstand some attacks. Its ability scores include a Dexterity of +3, which is good, making it nimble and evasive. The weasel has a Wisdom score of +1, which provides a perceptive edge in detecting threats. However, its other attributes, such as Intelligence and Charisma, are quite low, with scores of -3, indicating it has very bad skills in reasoning and influencing others.

Special abilities of the Giant Weasel include "Heightened Hearing and Smell," which gives it a Perception score of 18 when using its auditory or olfactory senses. This makes it exceptional at locating creatures and detecting hidden enemies.

In terms of actions, the Giant Weasel's primary offensive capability is its "Bite" attack. It has a +5 to hit, meaning it is likely to succeed in striking a target, with a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 5 piercing damage from a roll of 1d4 plus its Dexterity modifier. Notably, instead of inflicting damage, the Giant Weasel can attempt to steal an item weighing up to 10 pounds from its target, making it a clever distraction in combat.

The Giant Weasel also has a defensive reaction called "Repellent Spray." When an enemy comes within 15 feet, the weasel can release a foul-smelling spray. This requires the affected creature to make a Constitution saving throw against a difficulty of 13. If they fail, they become poisoned until the end of their next turn, which restricts their movement and makes them wary of approaching the weasel. This ability can significantly impact tactics, creating a buffer zone around the weasel that enemies will find hazardous to approach.
