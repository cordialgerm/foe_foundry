The Fulad-Zereh is a formidable creature from the depths of the Abyss, classified as a huge fiend with a chaotic evil alignment. This demon embodies power and peril, with a high armor class and significant hit points, making it a challenging opponent in combat. Its abilities allow it to control the battlefield with debilitating effects like petrification, while its resistance to various damage types makes it difficult to defeat with standard attacks. Though it has a relatively low Dexterity, its high Constitution and the mechanics of its abilities mean it can endure substantial damage, making it a threat that should not be underestimated.

The Fulad-Zereh has an armor class of 18, which is considered good, providing it with substantial protection in combat. It has 115 hit points, calculated from rolling ten twelve-sided dice and adding fifty, which gives it a high resilience against damage. With a speed of 40 feet for both flying and walking, this demon can maneuver effectively in both aerial and ground encounters. The creature has a challenge rating of 9, indicating that it is a significant adversary worth 5,000 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Fulad-Zereh has a Strength of 19 (+4 modifier, which is exceptional), a Dexterity of 11 (+0, average), a Constitution of 20 (+5, exceptional), an Intelligence of 17 (+3, good), a Wisdom of 15 (+2, average), and a Charisma of 17 (+3, good). The Fulad-Zereh possesses strong saving throws, particularly in Strength (+8, good), Constitution (+9, exceptional), Wisdom (+6, good), and Charisma (+7, good). Its skills in insight (+6, good) and intimidation (+7, good) further enhance its ability to manipulate and control encounters.

The Fulad-Zereh has immunity to poison damage and is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It is also immune to the poisoned condition. With truesight extending up to 120 feet and passive perception of 12, it can detect hidden foes and perceive its surroundings clearly. The ability to communicate in Abyssal and through telepathy also allows it to coordinate with allies or intimidate enemies.

The creature's special abilities include Petrifying Gaze and Weeping Acid. Petrifying Gaze allows the Fulad-Zereh to affect creatures within 30 feet that can see it by forcing them to make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 16. If the target fails by 5 or more, it is instantly petrified, while other failures lead to being restrained and needing to save again at the end of their next turn. This ability can significantly control the battlefield by potentially removing opponents from play. The Weeping Acid ability inflicts acid damage on any creature that touches the Fulad-Zereh or makes melee attacks against it while within 5 feet, requiring a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 16 to avoid taking 9 (2d8) acid damage.

For its actions, the Fulad-Zereh can use Multiattack, making two melee attacks in one turn. It can strike with a barbed whip, which has a +8 to hit, a reach of 30 feet, and deals 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is pulled 25 feet closer to the demon. The barbed whip also can inflict additional necrotic damage on a failed Constitution saving throw. The demon can also attack with a battleaxe, which also has a +8 to hit and deals 17 (3d8 + 4) slashing damage. These attacks not only inflict direct damage but also facilitate tactical maneuvers, enhancing the Fulad-Zereh's overall threat in combat.
