The Skullbloom is a Medium plant creature that embodies a fusion of ferocity and resilience. With an Armor Class of 11 due to its natural armor and a modest pool of 23 hit points, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers with a Challenge Rating of 1/2. The Skullbloom can move at a speed of 30 feet, enabling it to close the distance to its prey quickly. Its physical attributes are generally average; it has a Strength of +1, Dexterity of +0, Constitution of +2, and significantly lower mental capabilities, with Intelligence at -4, Wisdom at -1, and Charisma at -3. The creature's strengths lie in its heightened hearing, which enhances its Perception when relying on auditory senses, and its Plant Resilience, providing it with resistance against exhaustion and several debilitating conditions. However, its weaknesses stem from its poor mental attributes, making it less effective in circumstances that require cleverness or charm.

The Skullbloom's special abilities enhance its effectiveness in combat. Its Heightened Hearing allows it to perceive sounds with a bonus to Perception, raising it to 16 for auditory cues. This enables the Skullbloom to detect intruders or threats from a distance. The Plant Resilience trait means it can withstand fatigue and is resistant to becoming paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious, making it a tenacious foe.

In combat, the Skullbloom can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite and one Slam attack against a single target. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, extends to a 5-foot reach, and inflicts 3 piercing damage alongside an additional 2 poison damage on a successful hit. The Slam attack also has a +3 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 3 bludgeoning damage. If both attacks successfully hit a humanoid, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be infected with apocalyptic fungus, introducing a potentially severe consequence that could incapacitate the afflicted over time.

Additionally, the Skullbloom exhibits an instinctive behavior through its Bonus Action known as Instinct to Pursue, allowing it to take the Dash action to chase down an uninfected humanoid that it can either see or sense, increasing its chances of inflicting its fungal infection on susceptible targets.

Overall, the Skullbloom presents a unique challenge for adventurers, utilizing its robust attributes and strategic attacks to potentially take down unwary enemies.
