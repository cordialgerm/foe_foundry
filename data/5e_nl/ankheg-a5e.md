The Ankheg is a formidable Large monstrosity known for its brutal combat style and ability to ambush prey with a mixture of strength and acid attacks. With an Armor Class of 14 and hit points totaling 45, it presents a substantial challenge, particularly for adventurers who venture too close. The Ankheg has a walking speed of 30 feet and can burrow at 15 feet, making it effective in both ground and underground encounters. It possesses notable strengths in strength and constitution, boasting a Strength score of 16 (+3) and a Constitution score of 14 (+2), allowing it to deal significant damage while maintaining durability. However, its Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), and it has poor Intelligence and Charisma scores, suggesting it has limited problem-solving capabilities and social interactions. This creature's main weaknesses lie in its low Dexterity and lack of ranged attack options, making it susceptible to tactics that involve distance and evasion.

The Ankheg's abilities include a combination of physical attacks and a powerful acid spray attack. Its Claws attack allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit bonus, which is good. On a successful hit, it deals 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. If it attacks a Medium or smaller creature, it can grapple them, imposing an escape DC of 13, which is a manageable challenge for many characters. While grappled, the target is restrained, limiting their movement and making them more vulnerable to subsequent attacks.

The Ankheg's Bite attack, which it can use on creatures it has grappled, also has a +5 to hit. It delivers a devastating 16 (3d8 + 3) slashing damage, and if this attack kills the target, the Ankheg performs a gruesome finishing move by severing their head, adding a dark narrative element to combat.

One of its most notable abilities is Acid Spray, a toxic attack that requires a recharge of 6. The Ankheg can spit a stream of acid extending 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, forcing all creatures within the area to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they suffer 14 (4d6) acid damage, while a successful save halves the damage. If the Ankheg is grappling a target, this attack becomes even more dangerous, as it can bathe the target in acid without allowing for a saving throw, directly dealing 14 (4d6) acid damage exclusive to that creature.

The Ankheg blends brute strength with a vicious venomous attack style, making it a dangerous encounter for adventurers who may underestimate its offensive capabilities.
