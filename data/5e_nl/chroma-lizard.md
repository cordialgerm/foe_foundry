The Chroma Lizard is a large, unaligned beast known for its striking, reflective scales that create dazzling displays of light. With an armor class of 15, it has a decent level of defense thanks to its natural armor, making it reasonably tough in combat. The lizard has a significant pool of hit points, totaling 90, which allows it to endure through several rounds of conflict. As a challenge rating 4 creature, it offers a moderate level of challenge to adventurers, granting 1,100 experience points upon defeat. The Chroma Lizard's strengths lie in its dexterity and unique abilities to manipulate light for both offense and defense. However, it possesses low intelligence and charisma, making it less effective in interactions outside of combat. Its weaknesses include vulnerability to radiant damage, despite having some resistance.

The Chroma Lizard showcases an array of attributes, including a Strength score of 12, a Dexterity score of 16, and a Constitution score of 14. This array results in a character with average physical strength but very good dexterity and good constitution, allowing it to be nimble and hardy in battles. Additionally, it has an Intelligence score of 2, making its intelligence very bad, a Wisdom score of 10 signifying an average awareness, and a very bad Charisma score of 3 indicating poor persuasive capabilities.

The creature has access to several special abilities that significantly influence gameplay. Its "Mirror Scales" ability allows it to create a visual illusion in bright light, imposing disadvantage on attack rolls made by opponents relying on sight. "Mirror Shy" causes the lizard to become blinded if it sees its own reflection in a polished surface within close proximity and in bright light, limiting its effectiveness temporarily but adding a tactical layer to encounters. "Radiant Reflection" reflects half the radiant damage it receives back to the attacker, making it a formidable opponent against spellcasters or creatures that deal radiant damage.

In combat, the Chroma Lizard is capable of performing multiple actions thanks to its "Multiattack," which includes using a "Dazzling Display" followed by one Bite and one Claw attack. The "Bite" attack allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +5 hit modifier, dealing 14 piercing damage on a successful hit. The "Claw" attack also features a +5 hit modifier but deals a lesser 8 slashing damage. "Dazzling Display" is a powerful action that forces any creature that can see the lizard to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of their next turn. This move cannot be executed in darkness, and opponents gain advantage on their saving throw if the lizard is in dim light, adding a strategic element to its use in combat. This combination of abilities makes the Chroma Lizard a manipulative and visually stunning adversary on the battlefield.
