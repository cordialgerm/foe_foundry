The Putrescent Slime is a Medium ooze creature that serves as an ambush predator in various environments. It has a challenge rating of 1, making it suitable for low-level adventurers. With a reasonably high constitution score (16), the slime has a substantial pool of hit points at 45, which provides it with durability in combat. Its primary strengths lie in its damage immunities to acid and poison and its ability to move unhindered through tight spaces due to its amorphous nature. However, its weak Dexterity score (8) and low armor class (8) indicate that it is not very good at dodging attacks. The creature is unaligned and relies on its special abilities and attacks to inflict damage and control the battlefield.

The Putrescent Slime has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 12, which is average, contributing positively to its melee attack capabilities.
- Dexterity: 8, which is bad and results in a poor ability to evade attacks and avoid traps.
- Constitution: 16, which is very good, providing it with a solid defense due to its high hit points.
- Intelligence: 1, which is very bad, indicating that it does not possess any problem-solving skills or strategic thinking.
- Wisdom: 6, which is bad, resulting in a low perception and susceptibility to being deceived.
- Charisma: 1, which is very bad, showing that it has no influence or presence in social interactions.

The creature possesses several notable abilities:
- **Amorphous:** This ability allows the Putrescent Slime to slip through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without needing to squeeze, making it exceptionally versatile in navigating its environment.
- **Stench:** This ability triggers at the start of any creature's turn within 5 feet of the Putrescent Slime. Those creatures must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being poisoned until the beginning of their next turn. If successfully saved, they become immune to the Stench for 24 hours, providing a tactical challenge for players with low constitution.

In terms of actions, the Putrescent Slime has:
- **Pseudopod:** This is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, which allows it to reach a target 5 feet away. On a successful hit, it deals 8 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 poison damage. This can create a potent combination of physical and poison damage, posing a threat to unprepared adventurers.

Overall, the Putrescent Slime is an intriguing and dangerous opponent for low-level adventurers, leveraging its unique abilities to manipulate combat situations.
