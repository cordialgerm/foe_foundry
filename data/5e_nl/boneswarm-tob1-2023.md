The Bone Swarm is a Large, chaotic evil undead creature that embodies a sinister collection of bones animated into a deadly swarm. With an Armor Class of 17, it boasts both durability and an impressive pool of Hit Points totaling 198, making it a formidable opponent in combat. The Bone Swarm is characterized by its unique movement capabilities, able to walk swiftly at a speed of 60 feet and fly at 20 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. In terms of challenge, it has a Challenge Rating of 10, indicating it can present a significant threat to adventurers, yielding 5,900 experience points upon defeat. This creature is particularly notable for its robust offensive prowess and high damage potential, while also being resistant to many forms of attack.

The Bone Swarm has an impressive Strength of 22, which translates to a +6 modifier, making it very good in physical contests. Its Dexterity score is also high at 18 (+4), allowing it to excel at tasks requiring agility, with a strong +8 modifier for Dexterity saving throws. The swarm’s Constitution is average at 10 (+0), while its Intelligence is low at 9 (-1), reflecting a lack of cognitive ability. However, it has a good Wisdom score of 15 (+2) and a very good Charisma of 20 (+5), representing its ability to communicate in languages and influence others through its terrifying presence. The swarm is equipped with resistance to both piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks and is fully immune to poison damage. It has various condition immunities, making it highly resilient against many combat effects, such as being grappled or frightened.

Among its special abilities, the Bone Swarm can occupy another creature’s space, allowing it to effectively swarm enemies, and it is immune to the physiological needs of living beings thanks to its undead nature. This enables it to operate without the constraints of air, food, drink, or sleep, making it a relentless foe on the battlefield.

In combat, the Bone Swarm utilizes a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two Swirling Bones attacks per turn. The Swirling Bones attack provides a +10 to hit, with a reach of 0 feet, targeting one creature within the swarm's space. It can inflict considerable damage, dealing 36 (8d8) bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, or 18 (4d8) damage if the swarm is at or below half of its hit points. The varied damage renditions allow the Bone Swarm to adapt its attacks based on the state of engagement.

Additionally, the Bone Swarm has a powerful ability known as Death’s Embrace, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This attack grapples a target (escape DC 16) if it is a Large or smaller creature, leading to severe implications for the victim. Once grappled, the creature becomes restrained, entangled in the skeletal mass, and any attacks directed at the Bone Swarm have a 50 percent chance of inadvertently hitting the grappled creature instead. The confined creature can find a slight reprieve since it has advantage on attempts to escape the grapple when the Bone Swarm is below half its hit points, introducing an interesting tactical layer to confrontations with this menacing adversary.
