The Ogrepede is a massive and fearsome undead creature with a chaotic evil alignment. As a Huge monster boasting a Challenge Rating of 6, it presents a significant threat in combat due to its high hit points and powerful attacks. The Ogrepede has an armor class of 13, which is average for its challenge level, and it can move at a speed of 40 feet, with the ability to climb at 20 feet. While its Dexterity is subpar, its high Strength and Constitution afford it a good chance of dealing damage and absorbing hits. One of the creature's notable features is its ability to inflict fear on nearby opponents, making it a formidable foe in battle. However, it suffers from low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, which may limit its strategic engagements and interactions.

The Ogrepede possesses the following attributes: a Strength score of 21 (+5 modifier), Dexterity of 9 (-1 modifier), Constitution of 17 (+3 modifier), Intelligence of 5 (-3 modifier), Wisdom of 5 (-3 modifier), and Charisma of 3 (-4 modifier). The Ogrepede has a saving throw in Wisdom at +0, which is considered very bad. It is proficient in several skills, but specifics are not provided. This creature is immune to poison damage and several conditions, including being charmed, exhausted, poisoned, and prone. It can sense its environment with darkvision up to 90 feet and has a passive Perception score of 7, which is quite poor. While it understands all languages it knew in life, it lacks the ability to speak.

The Ogrepedeâ€™s special abilities enhance its effectiveness in combat. The first ability, Haphazard Charge, allows the Ogrepede to make a slam attack that is treated as a critical hit if it moves at least 10 feet directly toward its target before hitting. However, this comes with a drawback, as the Ogrepede becomes vulnerable to attack, granting advantage to opponents until the start of its next turn. The second special ability, Overwhelming Assault, triggers when the Ogrepede lands a critical hit. Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute. The frightening effect can be mitigated, as those affected can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to end the effect.

In combat, the Ogrepede makes use of its Multiattack action to strike twice: once with its bite and once with its slam attack. The bite attack has a +8 to hit and can reach out to 5 feet, dealing an average of 16 piercing damage (2d10 + 5). The slam attack also carries a +8 to hit, with a 10-foot reach, dealing 12 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 5) normally, or only 8 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 5) if it is below half its hit points. A critical hit with its slam means that the Ogrepede rolls damage dice three times instead of twice, increasing its potential damage output significantly, which can swing the tide of battle dramatically in its favor.
