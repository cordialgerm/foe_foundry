The Pombero is a medium-sized fey creature known for its chaotic nature and playful yet canny demeanor. With a sturdy armor class of 15 and a robust 90 hit points, it proves to be a formidable opponent despite its relatively low Challenge Rating of 3, which grants 700 experience points to those who defeat it. The Pombero possesses a well-balanced mix of physical strength and agility, demonstrated by its strength, dexterity, and constitution scores of 17, 16, and 16 respectively, all providing good to very good modifiers that enhance its physical effectiveness in combat. Furthermore, its charming capabilities and special traits grant it versatility in both combat and interaction with characters, making it a noteworthy adversary or ally.

The Pombero's attributes include a strength score of 17, translating to a +3 modifier, which is good for melee attacks. Its dexterity score of 16 and constitution score, also both at 16, provide a +3 modifier, contributing positively to its ability to evade attacks and withstand damage. The creature's intelligence score of 8 results in a -1 modifier, indicating a very bad capability in tasks requiring reasoning or knowledge. Its wisdom score of 10 yields an average modifier, and a charisma score of 14 provides a +2 modifier which is good for social interactions and charm attempts.

The Pombero's special abilities grant it unique advantages. As a contortionist, it can shift its body into unnatural shapes, allowing it to slip through spaces meant for Tiny creatures, as long as the destination can accommodate its volume. It also benefits from forest camouflage, providing it with advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding within forested terrain, making it a threat in wooded environments. Additionally, the Pombero possesses the ability to speak with beasts, enabling it to communicate effectively with animal creatures as if they shared a common language.

In combat, the Pombero can execute a multiattack, allowing it to make two slam attacks. The slam is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 12 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, which is an average damage output. It also has a special attack called Charming Touch, which has a recharge mechanic, activated on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability forces a creature within 5 feet to succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for 10 minutes, provided it does not take any damage during that time. This ability is powerful as it can sway the emotions of a creature, making for potential strategic opportunities during encounters. Finally, the Pombero can use its invisibility ability to magically become invisible until it decides to attack or uses Charming Touch again, or until its concentration is interrupted. During this time, any equipment it carries also becomes invisible, allowing for tactical surprise or escape maneuvers in battle.
