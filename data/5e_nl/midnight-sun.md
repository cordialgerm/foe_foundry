The Midnight Sun is a large aberration with a neutral evil alignment, exhibiting unique abilities tied to its manipulation of light and darkness. It boasts a high Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor and has significant hit points at 136, making it a resilient foe. With a flying speed of 60 feet, the Midnight Sun can navigate the battlefield effectively. The creature's challenge rating of 7 suggests that it poses a moderate to significant threat to adventurers, yielding an experience reward of 2,900 XP when defeated. Notably, the Midnight Sun's power lies in its ability to change forms based on lighting conditions, altering its damage type and immunities, making it both versatile and difficult to combat.

The Midnight Sun possesses various attributes with the following values: Strength is 10, Dexterity is 16 (+3 modifier, considered good), Constitution is 16 (+3 modifier, considered good), Intelligence is 11 (+0 modifier, average), Wisdom is 18 (+4 modifier, very good), and Charisma is 15 (+2 modifier, good). The creature's saving throws include Dexterity +6, Wisdom +7, and Charisma +5, providing it with solid defenses against various effects, particularly in terms of mental resilience. It excels in perception skills with a +4 modifier. Vulnerabilities to necrotic damage in its day form and radiant damage in its night form make it susceptible to specific tactics. The Midnight Sun is immune to necrotic and poison damage while also having resistances to acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. It cannot be affected by conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or frightened, showcasing its formidable presence in combat.

In terms of senses, the Midnight Sun has blindsight up to 120 feet, meaning it can perceive creatures without relying on sight, and a passive perception of 17. It communicates using Deep Speech, allowing for potential interaction with specific creatures or entities familiar with this language.

The Midnight Sun has a special ability called Changing Form, where it automatically changes based on the presence of light. In its Day Form, when more than half of it is in darkness, it appears as a glowing orb that deals radiant damage, has immunity to radiant damage, and is vulnerable to necrotic damage. In its Night Form, existing primarily in bright or dim light, it becomes an orb of darkness that deals necrotic damage, is immune to necrotic damage, and vulnerable to radiant damage. The Twilight Form occurs when half of it is in bright or dim light and half is in darkness, allowing it to deal force damage. Energy Being is another special ability that enables the Midnight Sun to move through extremely narrow spaces without squeezing and deal 3 (1d6) damage to a creature when it enters their space, with the damage type determined by the current form of the Midnight Sun. Reality Inversion changes any circumstance traits or features giving a creature advantage while in close proximity to the Midnight Sun, swapping them instead for disadvantage until the start of their next turn, further complicating encounters with this creature.

In combat, the Midnight Sun can execute a Multiattack that allows it to make three Energy Blast attacks. Each Energy Blast acts as either a melee or ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit, targeting a single creature within a range of 120 feet or within 5 feet. It deals 14 (3d6+4) damage, with the damage type being contingent on the creature's current form. Additionally, the Energy Pulse ability, which can be used once it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the Midnight Sun to deal 28 (8d6) damage to every creature within a 15-foot radius, requiring a DC 15 Constitution saving throw for half damage. This versatility in attacks and area effects makes the Midnight Sun a formidable opponent on the battlefield.
