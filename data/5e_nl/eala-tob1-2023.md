The Eala is a small, unaligned monstrosity known for its agility and fiery breath, making it a formidable opponent despite its less impressive physical stature. With an Armor Class of 15, it benefits from natural armor, providing good defense against attacks. It has 40 hit points, which is average for its challenge rating of 2, indicating it can endure some damage in combat. Notably, the Eala is quick on its feet with a walking speed of 60 feet and also has the ability to fly, albeit at a more limited speed of 10 feet. It possesses exceptional Dexterity, with a modifier of +3, allowing it to be effective in dodging attacks and executing its own. However, it struggles with its Intelligence, providing a very bad score of -4, which limits its ability to engage in complex strategies.

The Eala's ability scores include a Strength of 10 (+0), average for melee combat, a Constitution of 12 (+1) which grants it moderate resilience, a Wisdom of 12 (+1) providing decent perceptual skills, and a Charisma of 16 (+3) that supports its more enchanting aspects. Its saving throws highlight its exceptional ability to evade physical attacks, with a +5 modifier in Dexterity saves, making it resilient against effects that require agility.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Eala can make two Wing Blades attacks with a +5 to hit, making it quite proficient in melee combat. Each successful attack inflicts 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, which is a good amount for its challenge rating. Additionally, the Eala can unleash a powerful Fire Breath attack, which has a recharge mechanic requiring it to roll a 5 or 6 on a d6 to use again. This fire attack affects a 15-foot cone, forcing creatures within the area to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target receives 10 (3d6) fire damage, which is significant, while a successful save reduces the damage by half. Besides the damage, the fire breath can ignite flammable objects and melt soft metals within its area, adding strategic value in combat scenarios.

The Eala's reactions include the Swan Song ability, which activates when it reaches 0 hit points. This ability allows the Eala to sing a poignant melody that affects all creatures within 20 feet that can hear it. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, or they become incapacitated until the end of their next turn, rendering them unable to act and reducing their speed to 0. This ability can turn the tides of battle, as it effectively immobilizes enemies at a critical moment. 

Overall, the Eala combines agility, striking offense, and unique magical abilities, making it a challenge for inexperienced adventurers.
