The Leech Demon is a Large chaotic evil fiend known for its insidious nature and characteristic blood-draining abilities. Residing within the depths of dark waters, this creature boasts a formidable presence with a robust set of skills, allowing it to both traverse aquatic environments and engage effectively in combat. With an Armor Class of 17, it is well-defended, and its Hit Points of 147 give it significant durability on the battlefield. The Leech Demon is particularly strong in Constitution with a modifier of +5, indicating exceptional resilience, while its Strength and Dexterity scores of +4 and +3 respectively make it a good melee combatant. However, it has weaknesses in Charisma at -2, making it less effective for social interactions or spells requiring a high Charisma score. Its challenge rating of 11 places it as a formidable opponent for parties of intermediate level.

The Leech Demon possesses numerous special abilities. It has an Amphibious trait, allowing it to breathe both air and water, thus making it a versatile creature for both land and aquatic encounters. Its Blood Sense ability enables it to accurately locate creatures within a 30-foot radius that are not Constructs or Undead by scent, enhancing its hunting capabilities. Additionally, the demon benefits from Magic Resistance, allowing it to have an advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

In combat, the Leech Demon can make multiple attacks thanks to the Multiattack action. It can either deliver one Bite attack and two Tentacle Bites or two Bite attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit. If successful, it inflicts 14 piercing damage and an additional 9 necrotic damage, making it lethal against opponents. The Tentacle Bite is also a melee weapon attack, dealing 11 piercing damage and 4 necrotic damage. A successful Tentacle Bite allows the demon to attach a tentacle to its target, restraining them while draining their life force. Each turn, the target loses health due to blood loss, providing the demon with temporary hit points equal to the value lost. The demon can detach its tentacles as a bonus action or a creature can attempt to detach them with a successful Strength saving throw.

The Leech Demon also features the Release Swarm ability, which can be activated on a recharge of 5-6. This ability enables the demon to unleash a swarm of leeches that acts as an ally and follows the demon's commands for one minute or until dismissed. While near this swarm, the demon can consume it to gain temporary hit points equal to the swarm's current hit point value, providing further sustainability during combat. However, the demon can only maintain one swarm at a time, adding a tactical element to its usage.
