The Cloudhoof Assassin is a Medium-sized beast characterized by its agility and strength, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers. It boasts a respectable Armor Class of 13 and a moderately high hit point total of 45, derived from rolling seven eight-sided dice plus an additional 14 hit points, providing it with good durability in combat. With a challenge rating of 1, it offers a manageable but engaging encounter that can reward players with 200 experience points. The Cloudhoof excels in maneuverability, able to walk at a speed of 40 feet, and showcases both exceptional strength and dexterity, each at a score of 17. However, it has a low intelligence, charisma, and wisdom, indicating that it's not particularly perceptive or charming in social situations.

The creature's attributes are as follows: Strength is 17, which translates to a +3 modifier, indicating very good physical power; Dexterity is also at 17, providing a +3 modifier that enhances its agility; Constitution has a score of 14, giving it a +2 modifier which is considered good for maintaining health; Intelligence is very low at 2 with a -4 modifier, signifying very bad cognitive ability; Wisdom is average at 11 with a +0 modifier, indicating neither strength nor weakness in perception; and Charisma is low at 7 with a -2 modifier, suggesting bad presence in social interactions. 

The Cloudhoof Assassin has the special ability "Shoving Charge." This allows it to make a headbutt attack after moving at least 20 feet towards a target. If it successfully hits, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed away by up to 10 feet. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, they are pushed an additional 5 feet. This ability can significantly impact battlefield positioning, forcing enemies to spend movement to reposition. 

The "Sure-Hooved" ability grants the Cloudhoof advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws related to being knocked prone. It also benefits from advantage on Athletics checks for climbing rocky surfaces and on Acrobatics checks needed to maintain balance on such terrains, showcasing its adeptness in rugged environments.

In terms of actions, the Cloudhoof Assassin can perform a multiattack which consists of one Headbutt and one Shoving Kick. The Headbutt attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and deals 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage on a successful strike. Conversely, the Shoving Kick also carries a +5 to hit and deals slightly less damage at 5 (1d4+3) bludgeoning damage. Upon a successful Shoving Kick, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed back by up to 5 feet. If the Cloudhoof scores a critical hit, the push distance increases to 10 feet on a failed save. 

Overall, the Cloudhoof Assassin is a tactical beast with potential for controlling the battlefield through its shoving attacks and solid ability scores. Its advantages allow it to maintain stability in combat while also posing a challenge for enemies through its push mechanics.
