The Shadow Elf Mage is a formidable medium humanoid character, well-versed in arcane arts, and primarily serves as a spellcasting threat in combat situations. With a solid Armor Class of 12 and 67 hit points, it can sustain some damage but should not be underestimated for its potent magical abilities. The creature excels in Intelligence and Dexterity, granting it an exceptional ability to cast spells while maintaining a decent defense through spells like Shield and Greater Invisibility. However, its relatively low Strength score at 10 reflects a lack of physical prowess. The Shadow Elf Mage is capable of inflicting significant damage with spells, particularly using lightning bolt and cloudkill, which can dramatically shift the tides of battle. While it has many strengths, it remains vulnerable to direct attacks, particularly in the absence of its defensive spells.

The creature has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 10, which is average, but it does not rely on physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 14, allowing for good agility in avoiding attacks.
- Constitution: 16, providing the mage with good vitality and health.
- Intelligence: 16, which is exceptional for spellcasting, determining the effectiveness of their spells.
- Wisdom: 12, which is average and aids in perception checks.
- Charisma: 10, which is average and does not contribute significantly to its abilities.

The Shadow Elf Mage has proficient saving throws in Intelligence (+6, which is good) and Wisdom (+4, also good), making it capable of resisting various magical effects. It is skilled in arcana, history, investigation, and perception, all at +6 or +4, indicating its versatility and knowledge.

As for its special abilities, the Shadow Elf Mage can innately cast the cantrip Dancing Lights and has access to the spells Faerie Fire and Darkness, each usable once per long rest without the need for material components. The spellcasting ability is based on Intelligence, with a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 modifier to hit with spell attacks. 

The mage has prepared an extensive array of spells, including:
- Cantrips such as Fire Bolt (a potent ranged attack dealing 2d10 fire damage) and Mage Hand (allowing manipulation of objects from a distance).
- First-level spells include Detect Magic (to identify magical auras) and Shield (which grants a +5 bonus to AC against attacks).
- Second-level spells like Misty Step (offering teleportation) and Alter Self (changing one's appearance).
- Third-level spells include Counterspell (to interrupt enemy spellcasting) and Lightning Bolt (a dangerous straight line of lightning that deals 8d6 damage).
- Fourth-level spells such as Dimension Door (to teleport with another creature) and Greater Invisibility (rendering the mage or an ally unseen).
- At the fifth level, it can use Cloudkill, creating a lethal sphere of poison that lingers and damages those who enter or start their turn within it.

For actions, the mage can use a Dagger for a close combat attack, which has a +5 to hit, but it deals only modest damage of 1d4 + 2. 

The Shadow Elf Mage can perform several notable bonus actions, including Misty Step for quick repositioning and various reactions, such as Counterspell to potentially thwart an enemy's magic or Shield to enhance its defenses significantly during attacks.

Overall, the Shadow Elf Mage is a high-damage magical opponent that can control the battlefield with spells while relying on its cunning and agility for survival.
