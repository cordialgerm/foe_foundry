The spells it has prepared include various cantrips and higher-level spells. The cantrips available at will—light, sacred flame, and thaumaturgy—allow the Priest to illuminate areas, deal radiant damage, and perform minor magical effects. Sacred Flame requires a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 9 radiant damage on a failure and ignoring cover, making it an effective ranged attack.

Guiding bolt involves a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, delivering 14 radiant damage and granting advantage on the next attack roll against the target, making it a useful offensive option. Healing word allows the Priest to heal a target within 60 feet for 5 hit points using a bonus action, but cannot be cast alongside another 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.

At the 2nd-level, the Priest has prepared lesser restoration, which can remove certain conditions affecting a creature, and zone of truth, a spell that prevents creatures from knowingly lying within its area. The 3rd-level spells include dispel magic, capable of ending ongoing spells, and spirit guardians, which creates a protective aura around the Priest. Spirit guardians affects all creatures except those chosen by the Priest, making the area difficult terrain. It inflicts damage (10 radiant or necrotic) to creatures that enter or start their turn within the aura, providing both crowd control and protection for allies.

Overall, the Priest is a formidable support character with a variety of spells that can assist allies, heal wounds, and inflict damage on enemies, making it a valuable addition to any adventuring party.
