The Pseudodragon is a tiny dragon-like creature often favored for its intelligence and magical abilities. With an Armor Class of 13 and only 7 hit points, it is relatively fragile in combat but can be a valuable companion due to its magical resistance and ability to communicate telepathically. Its primary strength lies in its agility, with a Dexterity score of 14 that provides a good modifier (+2) for actions involving stealth, making it particularly adept at sneaking around or escaping danger. Despite its frail nature, it can inflict potent effects through its sting attack and spells like Telepathic Static, particularly in disrupting enemy actions.

The Pseudodragon has the following attributes: Strength 6 (very bad), Dexterity 14 (good), Constitution 12 (average), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 12 (average), and Charisma 10 (average). It possesses a good Dexterity modifier, enhancing its ability to evade attacks and perform subtle maneuvers. It is equipped with skills in Perception (+3) and Stealth (+4), making it a competent scout. Its senses include blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to navigate low-light environments efficiently. Despite its ability to understand Common and Draconic languages, it cannot speak, limiting its interactions.

The Pseudodragon has unique special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in various situations. Its Limited Telepathy enables it to communicate simple ideas, emotions, and images to any creature within 10 feet. This can aid in planning or warning allies without alerting foes. Additionally, its Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it resilient against magical attacks.

In combat, the Pseudodragon can use its sting attack, which requires a melee weapon attack roll of +4 to hit, reaching out to 5 feet to target one creature. On a hit, it deals 4 piercing damage (1d4 + 2) and forces the target to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails, it becomes poisoned; it must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. Success means the effect ends, while failure results in the target becoming unconscious for one hour, unless awakened through damage or an action from another creature. This ability can effectively incapacitate foes, allowing allies to gain an upper hand.

The Pseudodragon can also unleash Telepathic Static three times per day. This action targets one creature it can see within 10 feet, compelling the target to make a DC 11 Charisma saving throw. A failed save leaves the target stunned until the end of its next turn, as it is overwhelmed by a barrage of telepathic imagery. This can provide critical openings during combat, potentially disabling key threats to the Pseudodragon and its allies.
