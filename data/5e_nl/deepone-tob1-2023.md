The Deep One is a Medium humanoid creature embodying a chaotic evil alignment, serving as a formidable foe in Dungeons & Dragons. With a robust armor class of 13 due to its natural armor and a considerable pool of hit points totaling 71, it presents a resilient challenge for adventurers. This creature’s strengths lie in its impressive physical capabilities, highlighted by a Strength score of 16, which grants it a good modifier of +3, along with a Constitution of 14, providing it an average modifier of +2 for durability. However, its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are relatively low, indicating weaknesses in magical resistance and social interactions. The Deep One is particularly dangerous in melee combat, especially when it enters a frenzied state, enhancing its attacks significantly when damaged. Its vulnerabilities to fire make it susceptible to certain damage types, while its resistance to cold grants it additional survivability against icy spells and similar effects.

The Deep One possesses several key attributes. Its Strength of 16 allows it to execute strong melee attacks, while its Dexterity of 12 offers an average ability to avoid attacks, contributing modestly to its overall defenses. Constitution at 14 gives it a good endurance in combat. The creature’s intelligence is average at 10, indicating a basic level of understanding and tactical thinking, but its wisdom of 8 suggests poor judgment, making it susceptible to spells and effects that rely on insight. Charisma at 12 allows it basic interactions using social skills but does not make it particularly charming or influential.

Regarding defenses and resistances, the Deep One has saving throw bonuses of +5 for Strength, +4 for Constitution, and +3 for Charisma, which signify its competence against physical and some magical effects. It is vulnerable to fire damage, making it critical for opponents to exploit this weakness, while its resistance to cold damage provides some protection against ice-based attacks. The creature can see in complete darkness up to 120 feet with its darkvision, enhancing its capacity in poorly lit environments, though it has a passive Perception of only 9, indicating average awareness.

In gameplay, the Deep One's special abilities include Amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, thus presenting a versatile threat in aquatic or swamp environments. Its Frenzied Rage ability becomes activated whenever it suffers 10 or more damage from a single attack, granting it advantage on its Claws attack rolls and a +2 bonus to damage, making it exceptionally aggressive in retaliation.

When it comes to actions, the Deep One can utilize its Claws as a melee weapon attack, boasting a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it delivers a significant 12 damage, calculated as 2d8 plus its Strength modifier. This combination of abilities and attack prowess makes the Deep One a challenging opponent, capable of both taking hits and dealing significant damage in the heat of battle.
