The Bandit is a cunning medium humanoid who typically serves as a light adversary or a minor antagonist in adventures. Known for their opportunistic nature, Bandits are often encountered in groups, relying on ambush tactics and stealth to overwhelm unsuspecting travelers. Their strengths lie in their agility and ability to capitalize on opportunities, whereas their weak hit points make them vulnerable if engaged directly. With a challenge rating of 1/8, they are not formidable foes but can pose a threat in sufficient numbers or when utilized in strategic encounters.

The Bandit has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for their level, providing a reasonable defense against attacks. They possess 9 hit points, making them quite fragile in combat. Their speed is standard at 30 feet, allowing them to maneuver effectively in battle. 

The Bandit’s ability scores are as follows: Strength is +0 (very bad), Dexterity is +1 (average), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is +0 (very bad), Wisdom is +0 (very bad), and Charisma is +0 (very bad). Notably, their Dexterity score gives them a slight edge in their attacks and defenses.

One of their key special abilities is "Opportunist," which grants the Bandit advantage on opportunity attacks. This means when an enemy leaves their reach without disengaging, the Bandit can strike more effectively, increasing the likelihood of a successful hit.

In terms of actions, the Bandit can attack with either a scimitar or a light crossbow. The scimitar is a melee weapon that has a +3 to hit and reaches a target 5 feet away, dealing an average of 4 (1d6 + 1) slashing damage on a hit. The light crossbow is a ranged weapon with a +3 to hit and a range of 80 feet normally, extending to 320 feet at disadvantage, dealing an average of 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

Additionally, the Bandit can perform a bonus action to "Steal Item." This ability allows the Bandit to attempt to take an object from a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or lose one object of the Bandit's choice, weighing no more than 10 pounds and not being a weapon or firmly attached to the target.

Overall, the Bandit is an agile, stealthy opponent best used in ambushes and hit-and-run tactics, leveraging their abilities to distract and hinder foes while avoiding direct confrontation.
