- Perception: +1 - This is average, allowing it to notice basic threats.
- It has vulnerabilities to radiant damage, which means attacks of this type deal increased damage. 
- It is resistant to necrotic and poison damage, which allows it to take less damage from these sources.

The Duskwilt has special abilities that enhance its effectiveness:
- Light Absorption allows it to reduce light within a 60-foot radius. Bright light becomes dim light, and dim light transforms into darkness, creating strategic opportunities in combat by obscuring visibility for opponents.

The Duskwilt can perform several actions:
- Multiattack enables it to make three attacks per round, either with Slam or Nether Bolt.
- Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, targeting one creature within 5 feet. It deals 6 (1d4+4) bludgeoning damage and an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic damage, which combines physical and necrotic effects in its assault.
- Nether Bolt functions as a ranged spell attack with a +4 to hit at a distance of 60 feet, dealing 9 (2d6+2) necrotic damage to one target.
- Necrotizing Spores can be used three times per day. Each creature within 15 feet that is not a Construct or Undead must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 15 (6d4) poison damage and is poisoned for one minute. On a success, it takes half damage and avoids being poisoned. The poisoned target can attempt to save against the effect at the end of each of its turns, with success ending the status effect. Additionally, any Undead within 15 feet of the Duskwilt gains temporary hit points equal to 7 (2d6) from this ability.

Overall, the Duskwilt is an effective combatant and a tactical environmental manipulator, capable of supporting allies and hindering foes with its unique blend of abilities and spells.
