The Beach Weird is a large elemental creature that embodies the essence of coastal environments. It serves as a guardian of tide pools and sandy shores, conveying a sense of untamed nature. With moderate defensive capabilities, including a good Armor Class of 14 and a solid pool of hit points totaling 65, it can withstand a fair amount of punishment in combat. Its challenge rating of 3 indicates that it is designed to be a noteworthy adversary for a group of lower-level adventurers. The Beach Weird boasts several strengths, including a powerful slam attack, the ability to create hazardous quicksand, and unique movement abilities that enable it to traverse its watery habitat effectively. However, it is bound to its tide pools, limiting its range, which represents a significant tactical weakness. 

The Beach Weird's attributes are as follows: Strength is rated at 17 with a modifier of +3, making its physical attacks formidable; Dexterity is at 13 with a +1 modifier, which is average; Constitution also stands at 13 with a +1, resulting in average durability; Intelligence is rated at 13 with a +1, indicating little tactical cunning; Wisdom is 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good and reflective of its perceptiveness; and Charisma is 10 with a 0 modifier, showing no special charm. The creature has an average perception skill of +2 and benefits from various immunities, including damage from poison and several conditions such as exhaustion and being grappled.

In terms of special abilities, the Beach Weird has elemental nature, allowing it to thrive without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep. It can become invisible while completely immersed in water, making it elusive in its natural habitat. The "Swim in Sand" ability enables the Beach Weird to burrow through sand at half its swimming speed, though it cannot attack while doing so. The Tidepool Bound characteristic means that it will perish if it moves more than 100 feet from its tide pools or if these pools are waterless for over 24 hours, emphasizing its attachment to its coastal environment.

For actions, the Beach Weird can perform a Slam with a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit. This threatens an area of 10 feet and deals average damage of 16 (3d8+3) bludgeoning damage, plus it can push the target up to 10 feet away if they fail a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Additionally, it can use its "Create Quicksand" ability three times a day, creating a hazardous area with a 10-foot radius and 5 feet of quicksand. Creatures starting their turn in or entering this area must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or become grappled. If grappled, they must succeed on a saving throw at the start of their turns or sink further into the quicksand, risking being restrained if they sink 2 feet or more if Small, or 3 feet or more if Medium.

These attributes and abilities make the Beach Weird a unique and dangerous opponent in its coastal domain, presenting challenges to unwary adventurers who wander too close to its territory.
