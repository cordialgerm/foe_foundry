The Ancient Wind Dragon is a gargantuan, chaotic neutral dragon that embodies the destructive force of storms and winds. With a formidable challenge rating of 21, this creature is capable of dealing massive damage and has high durability with 351 hit points. It possesses exceptional strength, constitution, and charisma, making it a threat in both physical combat and social encounters. The dragon's abilities allow it to maneuver swiftly across the battlefield, avoiding hazards while unleashing devastating attacks on its enemies. Its major strengths include high damage output through its multiattack options, immunity to lightning damage, and significant control over the battlefield with abilities like Frightful Presence and Tempest Breath. However, as a highly powerful creature, it may struggle against coordinated efforts from multiple foes seeking to exploit its few weaknesses.

The Ancient Wind Dragon has the following attributes: strength of 28 (+9, exceptional), dexterity of 16 (+3, good), constitution of 26 (+8, very good), intelligence of 18 (+4, good), wisdom of 17 (+3, good), and charisma of 20 (+5, very good). Its defenses are bolstered by an armor class of 20 provided by natural armor, making it difficult to hit. The dragon is also immune to lightning damage and resistant to cold damage, which can heavily influence a combat encounter.

In terms of game mechanics, the dragon’s saving throws are as follows: dexterity +10 (good), constitution +15 (very good), wisdom +10 (good), and charisma +12 (very good). Its skills include Acrobatics with a +17 modifier (exceptional), Intimidation at +12 (good), Perception at +17 (exceptional), and Stealth at +10 (good). The dragon's senses include blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive perception score of 27, making it highly aware of its surroundings.

The Ancient Wind Dragon possesses several notable special abilities. Freedom of Movement allows it to ignore difficult terrain and avoid being restrained; it can escape from nonmagical restraints by using just 5 feet of movement. The Legendary Resistance ability grants it the option to succeed on saving throws three times a day, which can be critical in avoiding damaging spells. Storm Sight enables it to see through fog, mist, or precipitation, ensuring its line of sight is rarely interrupted. Whirling Winds deflects ordinary projectiles, granting the dragon a powerful defensive advantage against archers and ranged attackers.

In combat, the dragon can use a Multiattack, which includes activating its Frightful Presence, followed by a Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack rolls with a +16 to hit and inflicts 20 piercing damage on a successful hit. Each Claw attack also rolls at +16 to hit, dealing 16 slashing damage upon landing. It can use its Tail attack, which has a reach of 20 feet and also rolls +16 to hit, dealing 18 bludgeoning damage.

Frightful Presence creates fear in nearby creatures; those within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute, with the chance to repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns. Tempest Breath is a powerful cone attack that deals bludgeoning and lightning damage while pushing opponents back and knocking them prone on a failed Strength saving throw of DC 23.

Finally, the dragon can take legendary actions, which include Detect for a Wisdom (Perception) check, performing a Tail attack, or using a powerful Wing Attack at the cost of two actions. The Wing Attack affects all creatures within 15 feet, forcing them to succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone, allowing the dragon to reposition itself on the battlefield effectively. This array of abilities makes the Ancient Wind Dragon not only a daunting foe but also an exceptional combatant that can dominate in various scenarios.
