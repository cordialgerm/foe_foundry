The White Dragon Wyrmling is a Medium-sized dragon distinguished by its icy abilities and formidable presence. With an Armor Class of 16 and 45 Hit Points, it has a respectable defensive capacity and can shrug off damage thanks to its cold immunity. While its powers place it at a Challenge Rating of 2, which indicates it can pose a significant threat to low-level adventurers, the creature also exhibits weaknesses typical of its youth, particularly in its mental attributes. It excels in stealthy combat due to its decent Dexterity, and its special abilities enable it to maneuver effortlessly through icy terrains, making it a potent foe in cold environments.

For its attributes, the White Dragon Wyrmling has a Strength score of 14, which translates to a +2 modifier, indicating good physical power for melee attacks. With a Dexterity of 12 (+1 modifier), its agility is average. Its Constitution is 14 (+2), providing solid resilience. However, its Intelligence of 6 (-2) signifies a very bad capability in terms of mental acuity and strategy. Its Wisdom and Charisma are both average, sitting at 10, meaning it has no significant advantages or disadvantages in these areas. The dragon showcases proficiency in perception and stealth skills, granting it average effectiveness in spotting hidden foes and remaining undetected.

The creature is immune to cold damage, which makes it an exceptional threat when battling in ice or snow, as it can ignore the environmental obstacles that might hinder others. With blindsight to 10 feet and darkvision reaching 60 feet, it is capable of sensing creatures even in complete darkness within these ranges. Its passive perception score stands at 12, giving it an average ability to detect stealthy opponents. The dragon can communicate in Draconic, which adds a layer of role-playing richness when interacting with characters who share or decipher this language.

The White Dragon Wyrmling possesses notable special abilities, particularly its Cold Mastery. This ability allows it to move freely over icy surfaces and through cold environments without suffering any hindrances or leaving tracks. In combat, this not only aids its mobility but allows it to set ambushes in snowy terrains effectively.

In terms of actions, it has a bite attack that allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. This attack deals an average of 13 damage (2d10 + 2) with piercing damage, showcasing its strength in close combat. Furthermore, its Cold Breath ability can be a game-changer in battle. When this attack is recharged (on a roll of 5 or 6), it allows the dragon to exhale a 15-foot cone of frost. Creatures within this area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 damage (3d6) on a failed save and half damage on a successful save. This ability can significantly impact multiple enemies at once, making it a key feature during skirmishes.
