The Quiet Soul is a Medium undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This creature presents a significant threat in combat due to its ability to incapacitate opponents with its melancholic emanation, allowing it to control the battlefield effectively. With an Armor Class of 15 and 90 hit points, it poses a reasonable challenge, particularly at Challenge Rating 6, indicating that it provides moderate to advanced difficulty for adventuring parties. However, it is weakened by its low physical attributes, including a Strength score of 6, which is considered very bad for attacking or grappling, and a Dexterity score of 10, which is average. Its monstrous nature is enhanced by its exceptional Wisdom score of 18, granting it a very good perception skill, making it difficult for enemies to evade its influence.

The Quiet Soul’s attributes are as follows: 

- Strength: 6, which results in a modifier of -2 (very bad).
- Dexterity: 10, providing a +0 modifier (average).
- Constitution: 10, also offering a +0 modifier (average).
- Intelligence: 8, leading to a modifier of -1 (bad).
- Wisdom: 18, granting a +4 modifier (very good).
- Charisma: 10, with a +0 modifier (average).

Its saving throws reflect its strengths, particularly in Wisdom, where it has a +7 modifier, representing very good resilience against mind-affecting effects. The Quiet Soul has the following saving throw bonuses: Constitution +3 (average), Wisdom +7 (very good), and Charisma +3 (average). 

The creature possesses skills that enhance its effectiveness in encounters. It has perception +7, reflecting its strong ability to notice threats within its vicinity. It is immune to cold, poison, and psychic damage, which makes it very resilient in various combat situations, and it is also immune to the poisoned condition. 

In terms of senses, the Quiet Soul has blindsight up to 60 feet, meaning it can sense its surroundings without relying on sight, but beyond that radius, it is blind. It has a passive perception of 17, making it quite perceptive in spotting hidden threats. The creature understands the languages it spoke in life but cannot articulate them, limiting its interaction with adventurers.

Two special abilities define the Quiet Soul’s combat style. Its false appearance ability allows it to blend in seamlessly with a typical humanoid corpse while motionless, effectively employing ambush tactics. The melancholic emanation ability creates an aura that affects creatures within 30 feet; any creature starting its turn in this area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for one minute, creating a strong crowd control effect. The incapacitating influence can be mitigated if the affected creature takes damage or receives an action from another creature to awaken it.

As for its actions, the Quiet Soul can unleash a psychic lash, which is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 21 (6d6) psychic damage to a single target. If it successfully strikes an unconscious creature, that creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the creature remains unconscious; if successful, it wakes up, highlighting the Quiet Soul's ability to dominate the battlefield by incapacitating foes. Together, these abilities and attributes make the Quiet Soul a cunning and dangerous opponent that can disrupt party strategies with its manipulative powers.
