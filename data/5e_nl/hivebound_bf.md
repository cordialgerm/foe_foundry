The Hivebound is a small monstrosity that embodies the essence of insect swarms, making it a cunning and versatile opponent in combat. It boasts a respectable Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, allowing it to withstand blows from less skilled attackers. With 108 hit points, the Hivebound is capable of enduring significant damage, making it a challenging adversary with a Challenge Rating of 5. It can move at a speed of 25 feet on the ground and 40 feet while flying, giving it exceptional mobility on the battlefield. The Hivebound has a variety of strengths, including its ability to control swarms of insects and its good Dexterity and Constitution scores, which aid in evasiveness and durability. However, its weaknesses include a low Intelligence and Charisma, limiting its social interactions and certain mental resistances.

The Hivebound's attributes are as follows: Strength +2 (average), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +4 (very good), Intelligence -2 (very bad), Wisdom +2 (average), and Charisma -2 (very bad). It possesses keen senses that allow it to perceive its environment within a radius of 60 feet, though it cannot sense beyond that range. Its Perception score of 12 ensures that it can notice details effectively, while a Stealth score of 12 allows it to hide reasonably well. The Hivebound understands Common but cannot speak, which may limit its communication options.

The Hivebound has several special abilities that enhance its combat tactics. The Collective Mind ability connects the Hivebound with its controlled swarms of insects, allowing for telepathic communication across a mile. This aids in strategic maneuvers and ensures that it is never caught off guard, as it cannot be surprised. Its Monstrosity Resilience provides it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, allowing it to remain effective in chaotic situations. The Reinforced Mind ability gives the Hivebound an advantage on saving throws against certain ongoing effects affecting its Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, enabling it to resist debilitating effects more effectively.

In combat, the Hivebound can utilize its Multiattack feature to perform a combination of attacks: it can execute one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it can choose to make three Spit Insect attacks, offering a flexible approach to dealing damage. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit, reaches 5 feet, and deals 12 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage, making it quite deadly. The Claw attack, also with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicts 8 slashing damage. The Spit Insect ranged attack has a range of 30 feet with a maximum range of 120 feet, and it deals 5 piercing damage plus 7 poison damage. In addition, it forces the target to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or suffer from being pestered until the end of its next turn, granting disadvantage on their next attack roll.

The Hivebound also possesses a powerful special action known as Swarm Breath, which it can use after recharging on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the Hivebound to exhale a cone of stinging insects in a 30-foot area, forcing each creature in that zone to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in taking 10 piercing damage and 17 poison damage, while a successful save halves the damage. Additionally, a swarm of insects controlled by the Hivebound can materialize in an unoccupied area within the smoke cone, adding another layer of tactical advantage.

For movement, the Hivebound can employ the Swift Flight bonus action to ascend up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, enhancing its ability to reposition and evade threats during combat. With its combination of offensive and defensive capabilities, the Hivebound presents a diverse and exciting challenge for adventurers.
