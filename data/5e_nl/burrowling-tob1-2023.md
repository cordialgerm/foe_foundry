The Burrowling is a small humanoid creature that thrives underground and exhibits a lawful neutral alignment. Its notable strengths lie in its agility and team-based abilities, which make it a formidable opponent when paired with allies. With a relatively low armor class of 13 and 27 hit points, Burrowlings can be overwhelmed, though their burrowing capability allows them to navigate through the terrain effectively. They possess high Dexterity, granting them a good modifier of +3, which enhances their attack rolls and skills. Overall, Burrowlings excel in cooperative combat situations, utilizing pack tactics to gain advantages against their foes.

The Burrowling has the following attributes: Strength is 10, translating to a modifier of 0, which is average and indicates they are not particularly strong in melee combat. Dexterity is 16 with a modifier of +3, considered good, providing an advantage in attacks and notably improving their initiative. Constitution is 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average, offering a modest increase to their hit points. Intelligence is 9 with a -1 modifier, meaning they are not particularly knowledgeable. Wisdom is 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average and helps with perceptual awareness. Charisma is 13 with a +1 modifier, again average, showing they possess some personal charm, though it is not a standout trait.

In terms of skills, the Burrowling has a Perception skill with a +3 modifier, considered good, making it adept at noticing hidden threats or items in their vicinity. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, which is beneficial for underground or dimly lit environments.

The Burrowling possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. "Burrow Awareness" grants the Burrowling advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks if at least one other Burrowling is within 10 feet and is not incapacitated, enabling better alertness in groups. Additionally, "Pack Tactics" allows the Burrowling to have advantage on attack rolls against a target if an ally is within 5 feet of that target and also not incapacitated, making team attacks more effective.

During its action sequence, the Burrowling can perform a "Multiattack," using both a Bite and a Claw attack during its turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 5 piercing damage on a hit, derived from rolling a 1d4 and adding the +3 modifier. The Claw attack similarly has a +5 to hit and also deals 5 slashing damage. Additionally, the Burrowling can use a "Sling" for ranged attacks, which also has a +5 to hit, with a range of 30/120 feet, similarly inflicting 5 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, allowing it to engage from a distance when necessary.
