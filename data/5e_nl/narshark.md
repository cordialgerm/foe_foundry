The Narshark is a large, unaligned monstrosity known for its unique combination of characteristics. With a solid armor class of 14 provided by its natural armor, it has a moderate pool of hit points totaling 25. This creature is notable for its ability to fly, moving at a speed of 40 feet, along with a slower walking speed of 10 feet, and possesses the capability to hover. Although its challenge rating stands at 1/2, meaning it is relatively easy to deal with for a low-level party, its abilities and mechanics can pose interesting challenges due to its magical horn and its aggressive nature when provoked. The Narshark's attributes reveal it to be physically strong with a Strength score of 16, which translates to a good modifier of +3, while its Dexterity is average at 12, providing a modifier of +1. However, it is notably lacking in intelligence and charisma, with scores of 2 and 4, respectively.

The Narshark has a total of six attributes reflecting its physicality and abilities. Its Strength is 16 (+3), which is very good for melee attacks, while its Dexterity at 12 (+1) is average, impacting its ability to dodge attacks. With a Constitution of 15 (+2), the Narshark has good resilience, aiding its hit points. Intelligence is very low at 2 (-4), essentially making it dim-witted, which does not contribute to its effectiveness in strategic interaction. Wisdom is relatively higher at 14 (+2), allowing for good perception checks. Lastly, its Charisma is very low at 4 (-3), indicating poor social skills.

Some notable skills include Perception at +6, signaling exceptional awareness of its environment, and Stealth at +3, allowing it to hide more effectively. The Narshark is immune to being prone, helping it maintain combat posture. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 18, making it quite perceptive even in low-light situations. This creature does not communicate using any languages.

The Narshark has several special abilities that enhance its unique gameplay. Its Magical Horn grants it the ability to fly, and severing this horn leads to a panicked rage where it becomes more dangerous in combat. The horn itself can be attacked and has an armor class of 18 with 5 hit points, being immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. Should its horn be severed, the Narshark loses its ability to fly, suffers 4 (1d8) hit points at the start of each of its turns, and enters a frenzied state, gaining advantage on its bite attack rolls while attackers have advantage against it.

The Narsharkâ€™s primary action is its Bite attack which is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet targeting a single creature. On a hit, it deals 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is not an undead or construct, they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or lose an additional 2 (1d4) hit points at the start of their turns due to the shark's teeth damaging their flesh. A creature can stop this damage through an action taken to remove the tooth, or if they receive magical healing, the wound will heal and the tooth will be expelled naturally.
