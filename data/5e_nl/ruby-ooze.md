The Ruby Ooze is a Medium unaligned ooze creature that embodies a deceptive and hazardous element in combat. With a challenge rating of 6, it presents a significant threat due to its ability to inflict both bludgeoning and acid damage, alongside unique abilities that can shock and overwhelm unsuspecting adventurers. While its Armor Class is low at 9, the ooze has a substantial pool of Hit Points at 93, making it resilient against attacks. Its strength lies in surprise attacks and its corrosive nature, which can wear down weapons and ensnare foes. However, it is vulnerable to lightning damage, and its low Dexterity score results in poor evasion against ranged attacks.

The Ruby Ooze has the following ability scores: Strength at 14 (+2), Dexterity at 8 (-1), Constitution at 18 (+4), Intelligence at 2 (-4), Wisdom at 6 (-2), and Charisma at 1 (-5). Its Strength score is good, enabling it to exert powerful melee attacks, whereas its Dexterity is very bad, making it sluggish and easier to hit with ranged attacks. The Constitution score is exceptional, granting it a robust pool of Hit Points. The Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are very bad, indicating a lack of mental capabilities and social interaction skills.

The Ruby Ooze has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The Ambusher ability allows the ooze to have advantage on attack rolls against creatures it has surprised, making it a deadly foe when it can catch opponents off guard. Its Amorphous ability lets it squeeze through a space as narrow as 1 inch, making it highly mobile and tricky to contain. The Corrosive Form ability deals 7 damage to any creature that touches or attacks the ooze within 5 feet and also has the potential to damage and permanently degrade any nonmagical metal or wooden weapon used against it. The False Appearance ability lets it remain still and appear as a pile of rubies, effectively camouflaging itself in environments rich in precious gems. Additionally, its Spider Climb capability permits the ooze to traverse difficult surfaces without hindrance.

In terms of actions, the Ruby Ooze can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two pseudopod attacks per turn. Each pseudopod attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 9 bludgeoning damage on a hit, combined with 14 acid damage, which poses a serious threat to characters engaged in melee combat. The Acid Spray is a powerful ability that requires recharge on rolls of 5 or 6; it unleashes a 20-foot line of acid damage dealing 21 damage on a failed DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, while restraining victims as their flesh is transformed into a petrifying ruby-like state. Victims must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to potentially avoid further damage and petrification effects.

Overall, the Ruby Ooze is a formidable foe in battle, leveraging surprise, corrosive damage, and unique movement capabilities to control the battlefield while posing an interesting challenge to adventurers.
