The Eagle is a small beast known for its keen eyesight and swift flying abilities. With an Armor Class of 12, it can take a hit but has limited resilience due to its low hit points of just 3. The Eagle's primary strengths lie in its Dexterity of 14, which grants it a good attack bonus when it strikes with its talons, and its exceptional perception skills. However, it has very poor strength with a score of 6, making it ineffectual in melee combat beyond its unremarkable talon attack. This creature is best utilized for reconnaissance and support, rather than as a direct combatant.

The Eagle has the following attribute scores: Strength 6 (which equates to a modifier of -2, considered very bad), Dexterity 14 (+2 modifier, classified as good), Constitution 10 (+0 modifier, average), Intelligence 2 (-4 modifier, very bad), Wisdom 14 (+2 modifier, good), and Charisma 6 (-2 modifier, very bad). The Eagle is somewhat agile and perceptive, which enhances its effectiveness in scouting and observation tasks. It has proficiency in Perception, offering a +4 bonus to its checks, demonstrating its notable ability to notice details in its environment.

The Eagle's senses include a passive Perception score of 14, indicating it is adept at noticing as soon as potential threats or prey appear within its field of view. This makes it an effective scout for any adventuring party. However, the Eagle does not understand any languages, limiting its ability to engage in complex communication.

One of the Eagle's special abilities is Keen Sight, which grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight. This means that whenever the Eagle is required to make a Perception check involving sight, it rolls two d20 dice and takes the higher result, significantly increasing its chance to succeed on these checks.

In terms of actions, the Eagle can make a melee weapon attack with its talons, rolling with a +4 to hit over a reach of 5 feet against a single target. If successful, this attack deals 1 point of slashing damage. While the damage output is minimal, the talon attack still allows the Eagle to contribute to combat if necessary. Overall, the Eagle is a nimble and perceptive creature, better suited for flight and observation than for direct confrontation.
