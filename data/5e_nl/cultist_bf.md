The Cultist is a medium humanoid creature often found in dark religious sects, carrying out the wills of darker powers. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, the Cultist serves primarily as a low-tier adversary or a minion type in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. It has an average Armor Class of 13, suggesting it can absorb some damage, while its low hit points of just 9 make it relatively fragile. The Cultist is characterized by moderate Dexterity and Charisma, which indicate proficiency in stealth and social interactions, respectively. Its special ability, Dark Devotion, grants it resistance to being charmed or frightened, making it a slightly more steadfast character in unsettling situations. Due to its offensive capabilities and willingness to sacrifice for its allies, Cultists can be tricky opponents, though they remain vulnerable in a direct confrontation.

- Strength: +0 (average)
- Dexterity: +1 (average)
- Constitution: +1 (average)
- Intelligence: +0 (average)

The Cultist has no special senses and can perceive its surroundings at a level of 11, indicating average awareness. It can stealth with a score of 11, which is also considered average. The Cultist can communicate in one language, typically Common.

One of the notable special abilities of the Cultist is Dark Devotion, which provides resistance to both the charmed and frightened conditions. This allows the Cultist to remain focused and unyielding, especially when under mental or emotional duress.

In combat, the Cultist can employ its primary action, the Sacrificial Dagger. This melee weapon attack has a +3 modifier to hit, which is considered good, allowing it a decent chance to successfully strike its target within a reach of 5 feet. When the Cultist hits, it inflicts 3 slashing damage (1d4 + 1). If the target is in a vulnerable state—such as being paralyzed, prone, stunned, or unconscious—the Cultist deals an extra 2 slashing damage (1d4), potentially increasing its potency significantly during advantageous situations.

Additionally, the Cultist has a reaction named For the Cause!. This ability allows the Cultist to protect an ally within 5 feet at a moment of crisis. If a friendly creature is hit by an attack that would reduce it to 0 hit points, the Cultist can intercede and take the damage instead. This action demonstrates the Cultist's willingness to sacrifice itself for the sake of its companions, potentially shifting the dynamics of combat in favor of its team. The Cultist's abilities and actions combine to create an engaging character that players may encounter as they navigate the darker aspects of their campaigns.
