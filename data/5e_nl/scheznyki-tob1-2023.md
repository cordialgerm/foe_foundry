The Scheznyki is a small fey creature that embodies chaotic evil. With a formidable armor class of 16 and a significant 135 hit points, it stands out in combat due to its ability to both engage in melee and cast spells. The Scheznyki's main strengths include high physical damage output augmented by its brute ability, making its attacks particularly deadly. However, it is vulnerable to having its beard cut off, which disables its spellcasting. Its combination of physical prowess and magical abilities makes it a versatile opponent in battle. Notably, it has robust magic resistance, giving it an advantage against spells. 

The Scheznyki has the following attributes: Strength 19 (+4), Dexterity 15 (+2), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 15 (+2), Wisdom 16 (+3), and Charisma 16 (+3). Its strength of 19 allows it to excel in physical confrontations, offering a very good modifier for melee attacks. The Constitution score grants it a good modifying effect for its hit points and resilience. The Dexterity is average, providing a decent level of agility but not exceptional. Both its Wisdom and Charisma scores are solid at 16, translating to good modifiers for saving throws and spellcasting. 

In terms of saving throws, the Scheznyki has bonuses of +7 for Strength and Constitution, which are very good and significantly enhance its survival in physical confrontations. It is immune to being unconscious and has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light.

The Scheznyki's special abilities include "Beard Weakness," which allows a creature grappling it to cut off its beard with a successful DC 15 Strength check when using an edged weapon. If this occurs, the Scheznyki cannot cast spells until its beard regrows. Its "Brute" ability means that any melee weapon attack it makes deals an extra die of damage, making its physical strikes even more lethal. Additionally, the "Magic Resistance" ability grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, enhancing its capability to withstand magical assaults. 

For actions, the Scheznyki can make a melee weapon attack with its War Pick, featuring a +7 to hit, a 5-foot reach, and dealing an average of 13 piercing damage (2d8 + 4) on a successful hit. It can also launch a ranged attack using "Arcane Bolt," which is a ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit and a range of 60 feet, dealing 13 force damage (3d6 + 3) upon a hit.

The Scheznyki has the ability to turn invisible, allowing it to escape the notice of enemies until it decides to attack or cast a spell. This invisibility can be maintained until its concentration ends. In terms of spellcasting, the Scheznyki can use the following spells that require no material components: "Dancing Lights" and "Faerie Fire" can be cast at will. It can cast "Locate Object," "Hideous Laughter," and "Ray of Enfeeblement" three times a day; each of these spells can significantly influence battlefield dynamics, whether by scouting for objects, incapacitating foes with laughter, or weakening adversaries. Finally, it has the capacity to cast "Dispel Magic" and "Hold Person" once a day each, which allows it to neutralize magical effects or paralyze a target, respectively. The Scheznyki's spellcasting ability is based on Charisma, with a spell save DC of 14, making it a considerable threat in magical engagements.
