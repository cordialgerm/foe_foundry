The Mari Lwyd is a large undead creature characterized by its eerie presence and unique combat abilities, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. With a challenge rating of 4, it poses a significant threat, especially due to its higher-than-average hit points of 66 and solid defenses, highlighted by an armor class of 15. This creature moves at a speed of 40 feet and is especially resilient to certain types of damage, having immunities to poison and resistances to necrotic damage. Despite its strengths, it is not invulnerable, particularly vulnerable to charm effects as indicated by its lower Charisma saving throw modifier. Creatures facing the Mari Lwyd must be wary of its strong melee attacks and its ability to utilize magic to enhance its combat effectiveness or control the battlefield.

The Mari Lwyd possesses the following attributes: Strength is 16 (+3), Dexterity is 13 (+1), Constitution is 19 (+4), Intelligence is 10 (+0), Wisdom is 14 (+2), and Charisma is 15 (+2). Its Constitution score gives it a very good hit point pool, enhancing its durability in combat. The creature has a saving throw modifier of +4 to Charisma saves, which is average. It is skilled in intimidation with a +4 modifier, and it is exceptional in performance with a +6 modifier, indicating a knack for engaging and affecting others through speeches or shows.

In terms of special abilities, the Mari Lwyd has 'Turn Resistance', granting it advantage on saving throws against turning effects, which means it is difficult to repel using such abilities. Another unique ability, 'Turned by Rhyme', allows a creature to challenge the Mari Lwyd to a duel of rhymes. If the Mari Lwyd remains unchallenged until its next turn, it will recite a rhyme. The challenger must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma (Performance) check; if they succeed, the Mari Lwyd is treated as turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. This introduces a strategic layer in combat where players must consider their choices carefully.

The Mari Lwyd also has innate spellcasting abilities, using its Charisma for spellcasting with a spell save DC of 12 and a +4 modifier to hit with spells. It can cast 'Chill Touch' and 'Mage Hand' at will, which allows it to manipulate objects from a distance or harm opponents. In addition, it can cast 'Animate Dead', 'Hideous Laughter', and 'Suggestion' three times per day each. 'Animate Dead' allows it to raise fallen foes as undead minions, 'Hideous Laughter' incapacitates a target with uncontrollable laughter, and 'Suggestion' lets it influence a creature's actions by giving it a simple command, all of which can significantly impact gameplay by controlling the battlefield and manipulating the actions of player characters.

In terms of its offensive capabilities, the Mari Lwyd can perform a multiattack, allowing it to make one bite attack and one hooves attack per turn. The bite attack uses a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, while the hooves attack also has a +5 to hit and deals 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. Both attacks make the Mari Lwyd a threat in close combat, ensuring it can deal considerable damage while engaging multiple opponents if necessary.
