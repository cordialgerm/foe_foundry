The giant scorpion is a large beast known for its formidable presence and deadly attacks. It has an armor class of 15, which is considered good, and 76 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage in battle. With a challenge rating of 3, it is a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly due to its ability to grapple opponents and inflict poison damage. The scorpion's main strengths lie in its multiattack capabilities, which allow it to strike multiple times in a single turn, and its poison sting, which can incapacitate foes if they fail to make a constitution saving throw. However, its intelligence and charisma scores are significantly low, making it very poor at understanding or communicating with high-intelligence creatures.

The giant scorpion has the following attributes: strength of +2 (average effectiveness), dexterity of +1 (average), constitution of +2 (average), intelligence of -5 (very bad), wisdom of -1 (bad), and charisma of -4 (very bad). It possesses keen senses with a perception score of 11, allowing it to detect nearby creatures effectively, and a stealth score of 13, indicating it can move silently when attempting to ambush its prey. The creature does not communicate with either verbal or written languages.

In terms of special abilities, the giant scorpion’s primary feature is the multiattack, which enables it to perform two claw attacks and one sting attack in the same turn. The claw attack is a melee weapon attack, requiring a +4 to hit against the target. When successfully hitting, it deals 6 bludgeoning damage (1d8 + 2) and grapples the target; the target can escape the grapple by making a successful DC 12 strength check. The sting attack also requires a +4 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, inflicting 7 piercing damage (1d10 + 2) along with 7 poison damage (2d6). If the target fails to succeed on a DC 12 constitution saving throw, they are poisoned until the end of their next turn, severely impacting their effectiveness in combat.

Additionally, the giant scorpion has one reaction called Reflexive Sting. If a creature within 10 feet of the scorpion attempts to attack it, the scorpion can react by making a quick tail strike. The attacker must succeed on a DC 12 dexterity saving throw or take 5 piercing damage (1d10), adding to the creature's defensive capabilities. Overall, the giant scorpion presents a significant threat with its grappling and poison abilities, while also being capable of inflicting damage in response to nearby attackers.
