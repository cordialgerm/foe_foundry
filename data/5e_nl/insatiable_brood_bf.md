The Insatiable Brood is a medium swarm made up of tiny aberrations, characterized by its chaotic movement and otherworldly nature. In combat, this creature can be quite formidable due to its magical bite attacks, ability to double damage to structures, and its strong resistances. With an Armor Class of 13 and 63 hit points, it can sustain a decent amount of damage before being subdued. Additionally, its mobility is impressive, as it can fly at a speed of 50 feet. However, the Insatiable Brood's Challenge Rating of 3 indicates that while it is a dangerous foe, it can be tested and potentially overcome by a well-coordinated group of adventurers. Notably, it is resistant to most damage types and several crowd-control conditions, making it a resilient adversary. 

The Insatiable Brood has the following ability scores:
- Strength: 10, which is average and does not provide any significant offensive capability.
- Dexterity: 20, which is exceptional and gives the brood great agility, significantly impacting its Stealth, making it hard to detect.
- Constitution: 12, which is average, granting it some durability.
- Intelligence: 7, which is bad, reflecting its lack of cognitive capabilities.
- Wisdom: 12, which is average, indicating some perceptiveness.
- Charisma: 6, which is very bad, meaning it is not charming or persuasive.

The Insatiable Brood has several special abilities:
- Aberrant Resilience, which provides it advantage on saving throws against forms of magic that would alter it, making it quite durable against shape-altering effects.
- Magic Bites that enhance its melee attacks, making them magical and enabling it to bypass some resistances foes may have.
- The Siege Monster trait, allowing it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it a potential threat in destructible environments.
- Its Swarm ability allows it to fill and occupy the same space as its foes, enhancing its offensive capabilities and enabling it to evade attacks through tight spaces.
- Swarm Resilience grants it resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, while also making it immune to several debilitating conditions.
- The Void Traveler ability allows it to exist without the need for substances such as air, food, or sleep, further enhancing its adaptability in varied environments.

In terms of actions, the Insatiable Brood can perform the following:
- Bites: This is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. It can reach creatures within its occupied space, delivering significant damage depending on its health status. When healthy, it deals a total of 32 damage (14 piercing and 18 force), but if its hit points drop below half, this damage is reduced to a total of 16 (7 piercing and 9 force), making it essential to manage its health strategically in combat.

As a bonus action, the Insatiable Brood can use Void Gaze, enabling it to focus on a target within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 13; failure results in being frightened until the end of the next turn. If the target fails the save by 5 or more, it suffers from one of several potential dread effects for a minute, which can significantly impact the target’s performance in combat and their ability to interact with the brood or its allies.

Overall, the Insatiable Brood is a dangerous enemy, particularly effective in swarm tactics, and poses a unique challenge for adventurers with its blend of magical abilities and resistances.
