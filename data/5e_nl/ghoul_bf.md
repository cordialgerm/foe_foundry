The ghoul is a Medium undead creature known for its eerie presence and insatiable hunger for raw meat. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to unprepared adventurers. While it has some resilience granted by its undead nature, its combat abilities, particularly its paralyzing claws, make it a serious adversary in melee range. However, its relatively low hit points and lack of advanced intelligence could serve as weaknesses that players may exploit. Ghouls are adept climbers, with the ability to scale difficult surfaces and walk on ceilings, enhancing their tactical position in combat scenarios. 

The ghoul has an Armor Class of 13, which is average for its challenge rating, and it possesses 34 hit points, making it moderately durable. It has a speed of 30 feet and the unique ability to climb at the same speed. Its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are as follows: Strength +0 (average), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence -2 (very bad), Wisdom +2 (good), and Charisma -2 (very bad). With a Dexterity score of +3, the ghoul has an exceptional Stealth modifier of 14, allowing it to effectively hide and ambush unwary foes. Its Perception score of 12 provides an average ability to notice hidden threats, while its darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet.

One notable special ability is "Hungry Dead Nature," which means the ghoul does not require air or sleep but must consume 2 pounds of raw meat daily. Failure to do so leads to exhaustion and the risk of starvation, making it imperative for the creature to feed regularly. "Spider Climb" enables the ghoul to navigate difficult surfaces effortlessly, enhancing its mobility during encounters. The "Undead Resilience" ability grants the ghoul immunity to poison damage and exhaustion, as well as protection from the poisoned condition, making it a resilient opponent.

In combat, the ghoul can perform "Multiattack," allowing it to make one Bite attack and one Claws attack during its turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that yields a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and deals 7 piercing damage. The Claws attack, also a melee weapon attack, applies the same to hit bonus, but it deals 8 slashing damage. If both attacks strike a target that is neither a Construct nor Undead, the victim must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or they will contract "ghoul hunger," which has further implications for the character involved. Additionally, if the target is hit by the Claws attack, they must make the same Constitution save or become paralyzed for 1 minute, an effect that can greatly shift the balance of combat. The target can attempt to resist the paralysis at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on success.

Overall, the ghoul is a formidable foe in ambush situations or challenging terrains, capable of debilitating its enemies through clever use of its abilities and attacks.
