The Chronalmental is a formidable large elemental with a neutral alignment, serving as an embodiment of time within Dungeons & Dragons. With a substantial armor class of 17, it boasts a significant pool of hit points totaling 142, giving it considerable staying power in combat. The creature is particularly proficient in Dexterity, with a +5 modifier, making it agile and capable of avoiding attacks. Its challenge rating of 8 signifies that it is a potent opponent, apt to engage party members vigorously. Notably, the Chronalmental possesses a variety of damage immunities, including poison and nonmagical attacks, along with numerous condition immunities, further enhancing its resilience. However, it has relatively low Intelligence and Charisma scores, which might limit its ability to interact with others effectively. Overall, the Chronalmental’s strengths lie in its exceptional combat capabilities and its unique mechanics relating to the manipulation of time, which can alter the flow of battle significantly.

The attributes of the Chronalmental are as follows: Strength is 14, which translates to a good modifier of +2, indicating decent physical power; Dexterity is 20, with a very good +5 modifier, showcasing exceptional agility; Constitution is 19, resulting in a good +4 modifier, which contributes to its durability; Intelligence is 9, leading to a bad -1 modifier, limiting its cognitive abilities; Wisdom is 13, providing an average +1 modifier; and Charisma is 6, resulting in a very bad -2 modifier, making it ineffective in social interactions.

In terms of special abilities, the Chronalmental has "Elemental Nature," which means it does not require necessities such as air, food, drink, or sleep. Its "Temporal Body" ability allows it to automatically succeed on saving throws against slowing or hasting effects while also healing itself by 13 hit points when subjected to such spells. 

As for its actions, the Chronalmental can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three Slam attacks in one turn. The Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 16 bludgeoning damage. The "Steal Time" ability, usable once per day, allows it to halve the speed of a creature it can see within 30 feet while also limiting that creature's actions. Additionally, the Chronalmental gains advantages in terms of speed and extra slam attacks, making it a significant threat in combat. Targets can attempt to resist this effect with a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. 

The "Displace" ability (which recharges on rolls of 5 or 6) allows the Chronalmental to send a creature it can see outside the flow of time with another DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, it is stunned and temporarily removed from combat, returning only after one minute. The Chronalmental can take advantage of this delay to reposition itself or attack other foes. 

For reactions, the Chronalmental has "Step Between Seconds," which it can use when a creature moves within 5 feet of it. This ability allows the Chronalmental to teleport up to 60 feet to a space it previously occupied, making it highly mobile and difficult to pin down during battle. 

Overall, the Chronalmental presents players with a unique combination of powerful attacks, the ability to manipulate time, and a high degree of resilience, making it a challenging adversary in any campaign.
