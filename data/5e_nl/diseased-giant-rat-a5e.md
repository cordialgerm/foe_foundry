The Diseased Giant Rat is a small beast that poses a challenge for unsuspecting adventurers, especially in urban or dungeon settings where it often lurks in sewers and filth. With an Armor Class of 12 and a modest 7 hit points, it is relatively easy to defeat, but its ability to infect characters with disease makes it a notable threat despite its low Challenge Rating of 1/8. The rat's keen sense of smell and pack tactics allow it to be more effective when engaging in combat with its allies. Although it has low physical strength and intelligence, its speed and agility make it a savvy opponent, relying on numbers to overwhelm its targets.

In terms of attributes, the Diseased Giant Rat has a Strength of 6, which results in a very bad modifier of -2, making it physically weak. Its Dexterity is measured at 14, giving it a good modifier of +2, reflecting its agility and ability to dodge attacks. The Constitution score is average at 10, leading to a neutral modifier of +0 that indicates resilience to damage but not much else. Intelligence is very low at 2, therefore its modifier is a very bad -4, making it not particularly clever. Wisdom is average at 10 (0 modifier) and Charisma is low at 4, with a very bad -3 modifier; hence, it is not socially adept nor particularly insightful.

The Diseased Giant Rat has a few special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell, allowing it to detect hidden or stealthy creatures nearby more effectively. The Pack Tactics ability provides the rat with an advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of the same target and is not incapacitated. This strategy encourages players to consider their positioning when facing multiple rats.

When it comes to actions, the Diseased Giant Rat can use its Bite attack as a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully bites its target, it deals 4 piercing damage, calculated as 1d4 plus its Dexterity modifier. The attack carries an additional risk; if bitten, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failure to save results in the creature becoming infected with sewer plague, resulting in further detrimental effects and potentially leading to more dire consequences. This makes the Diseased Giant Rat not just a nuisance but a potential source of disease that adventurers must be wary of during encounters.
