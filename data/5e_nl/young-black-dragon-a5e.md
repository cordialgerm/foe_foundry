The Young Black Dragon is a formidable foe in combat, characterized by its size and abilities that make it both fearsome and versatile. It boasts an impressive Armor Class of 18, allowing it to effectively defend against attacks, and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 144, which makes it resilient in prolonged battles. This dragon can navigate multiple terrains with its ability to walk, fly, and swim, showcasing a speed that makes it agile and hard to pin down. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, capable of delivering high damage while harnessing innate magical powers. However, despite its strengths, it is essential for players to devise strategies to overcome its abilities, particularly with regard to its high damage potential and environmental advantages.

The Young Black Dragon has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 14 (+2). These attributes confer various modifiers: its Strength modifier is very good, granting it effective melee attacks; Dexterity is average, providing a decent boost to its initiative and ranged attack capability; Constitution is good, enhancing its hit points and ability to withstand damage; Intelligence is average, offering limited advantages in skill checks and saving throws; Wisdom is average, reflecting a basic capability in perception and insight; and Charisma is average, affecting its spellcasting and some interaction capabilities. The saving throw bonuses are as follows: Dexterity +6 (good), Constitution +7 (very good), Wisdom +5 (good), and Charisma +6 (good), making it relatively resilient against various effects.

In terms of skills, the dragon exhibits proficiency in history (+5), perception (+5), and stealth (+6), utilizing its environment effectively to gain an advantage in combat and exploration. Notably, it is immune to acid damage, granting it a significant defense against similar attacks. With senses including blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision extending to 120 feet, the dragon can operate in low visibility environments with ease. It is fluent in Common and Draconic, enabling communication with a range of creatures.

The Young Black Dragon possesses several special abilities. Under the Ambusher trait, it gains advantage on Stealth checks when submerged in water, making it difficult for opponents to detect it. This ability allows it to deal piercing damage and grapple a creature it strikes while hidden. The Amphibious trait permits it to breathe both air and water, granting it adaptability in aquatic settings. The Ruthless ability allows the dragon to immediately make one claw attack after scoring a critical hit, increasing its damage output during combat.

When it comes to spellcasting, the dragon can innately cast fog cloud and pass without trace, each three times per day. Fog cloud creates a heavily obscured area, which can hinder visibility and strategy in combat situations. Pass without trace provides a significant advantage in stealth, granting a bonus to all party members' stealth checks, thus facilitating sneaky approaches.

In battle, the Young Black Dragon is a daunting opponent. The multiattack feature enables it to strike once with its bite and twice with its claws, maximizing its potential damage output each turn. Its bite attack has a +8 to hit, reaching a distance of 10 feet, dealing 20 piercing damage plus an additional 4 acid damage on a hit. Alternatively, it can use the bite attack to grapple a target, restricting a Medium or smaller creature's movement. The claw attacks also benefit from the +8 to hit modifier, dealing 13 slashing damage.

One of the dragon's most devastating capabilities is its Acid Breath, which requires a recharge roll of 5-6. It unleashes a line of acid that affects creatures in a 40-foot-long, 5-foot-wide area. Affected creatures must perform a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 acid damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. Additionally, creatures that fail the save become blinded until the end of their subsequent turn, adding a significant debuff to those caught in the attack's area of effect.
