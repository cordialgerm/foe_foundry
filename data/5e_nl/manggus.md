The Manggus is a formidable creature characterized as a large, chaotic evil giant. It possesses a unique capability to shapeshift between its true form and a more terrifying hydra form, allowing it to adapt to different combat situations. With a strong armor class of 14 and substantial hit points totaling 127, the Manggus can withstand a considerable amount of damage. Its physical attributes are impressive, particularly its Strength score of 18, which grants it very good melee combat effectiveness, and a Constitution score of 16, enhancing its ability to endure attacks. However, it is less competent in mental faculties, with an Intelligence score of 8 (bad), Wisdom of 7 (very bad), and Charisma of 9 (bad), making it susceptible to mental effects and social interactions.

The Manggus has key abilities that enhance its combat strategy. One notable ability is "Roaring Transformation," which allows it to unleash a terrifying roar when shifting forms. Creatures within 30 feet that hear this roar must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Failing this save results in the creature becoming frightened until the end of its next turn, and if they fail by 5 or more, they are also paralyzed for the same duration. Successful saving throws grant immunity to this effect for 24 hours. Additionally, the Manggus can shift into a hydra form using its "Shapechanger" ability, maintaining its core statistics while changing size. It will revert to its original form upon death.

In its hydra form, the Manggus boasts the "Three-Headed" ability, giving it multiple advantages on saving throws against various conditions such as being frightened or stunned. Importantly, the Manggus can also regenerate heads; for every head lost due to taking 15 or more damage in one turn, it reverts to its true form if all heads are destroyed, but can regrow two heads at the end of its turn unless it has taken fire damage. This regeneration also provides healing, restoring 5 hit points for each head regrown.

In terms of actions, the Manggus can attack multiple times depending on its form. While in hydra form, it makes a number of bite attacks equivalent to the number of heads it has, each with a +7 to hit and dealing an average of 9 piercing damage. In its giant form, it wields a greataxe, also making attacks with a +7 to hit, but dealing significantly more damage at an average of 17 slashing damage per hit. This combination of fear-inducing abilities, transformation flexibility, and potent melee attacks makes the Manggus a dangerous adversary in combat.
