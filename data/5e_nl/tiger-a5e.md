The tiger is a formidable large beast known for its stealth and powerful physical presence. Its role in combat revolves around agility and melee attacks, making it a dangerous adversary, especially in environments that allow it to utilize its stealth. With moderate armor class and a reasonable amount of hit points, the tiger can withstand some attacks before falling. It boasts high strength and dexterity, which enhance its attacking capabilities, along with notable skills in perception and stealth. However, it has a very low intelligence and charisma, indicating that it operates purely on instinct rather than any kind of complexity in thought or social interaction. As a challenge rating 1 creature, it poses a balanced threat for low-level adventurers.

The tiger has an armor class of 12, which provides it moderate protection against attacks, making it somewhat vulnerable to skilled attackers. It has 30 hit points, calculated as 4d10 plus 8, suggesting its ability to endure some damage before being taken down. Its movement speed of 40 feet allows for good mobility on the battlefield.

In terms of attributes, the tiger ranks exceptionally with a strength of 16 (+3), which translates to a very good capability in dealing physical damage. Its dexterity is 14 (+2), providing it with a good defense and agility to avoid some attacks. With a constitution score of 14 (+2), the tiger possesses an average resilience. However, its intelligence score of 3 (-4) indicates a very bad understanding of complex tactics, while its wisdom of 12 (+1) shows an average capacity for awareness. Lastly, its charisma of 4 (-3) is very bad, making it ineffective in social situations.

The tiger's skills include a perception modifier of +3, which is good for spotting hidden threats, and a stealth modifier of +4, which is very good and allows it to remain undetected when moving. It can see in darkness up to 60 feet due to its darkvision and has a passive perception score of 13. The tiger does not communicate using languages.

One special ability the tiger possesses is keen smell, granting it advantage on perception checks that rely on its sense of smell. This ability allows the tiger to track prey and detect enemies more effectively, enhancing its effectiveness in the wild or during ambushes.

In combat, the tiger can perform several actions. Its bite is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 (1d10+3) piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, the tiger has a claw attack, which is also a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage. Notably, if the tiger moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target before using the claw attack, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw to avoid falling prone. This can significantly alter the dynamics of a combat encounter by enabling follow-up attacks on a downed target.

As a bonus action, the tiger can use its opportune bite ability, allowing it to make a bite attack against a creature that is already prone, taking advantage of its position to maximize damage.

Overall, the tiger is an efficient predator that capitalizes on its physical prowess and stealth in combat scenarios, making it a challenging encounter for adventurers unprepared for its tactics.
