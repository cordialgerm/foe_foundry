The Abysswalker possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat and augment its survivability. First, its Insanity ability grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, making it a resilient opponent in situations designed to manipulate or intimidate. Its Poisonous Vapors ability creates an area of danger for enemies; when a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the Abysswalker, or starts its turn there, it suffers 13 poison damage (2d12) and is poisoned until the start of its next turn, with a DC 15 Constitution saving throw for half damage and the condition. This ability makes engaging the Abysswalker in close combat particularly risky. However, it does suffer from Sunlight Sensitivity, causing disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks that utilize sight when in sunlight.

In combat, the Derro, Abysswalker can utilize multiattack actions, which allow it to make either one Bite, one Claw, and one Scimitar attack, or it can choose to make one Bite and two Scimitar attacks. The Bite attack delivers 6 piercing damage (1d4+4) along with 5 additional poison damage (2d4), providing a strong offensive option. The Claw attack can deal 11 bludgeoning damage (2d6+4) and can grapple a target if it is Medium or smaller, restraining the creature and preventing the Abysswalker from attacking others with its claws. The escape DC from this grapple is 15. Lastly, the Scimitar attack inflicts 7 slashing damage (1d6+4). 

This combination of abilities and attacks makes the Derro, Abysswalker a formidable adversary that thrives in chaotic encounters, particularly in environments conducive to its poison abilities.
