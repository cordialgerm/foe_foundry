The Suturefly is a tiny, unaligned beast that serves as both a stealthy adversary and a unique source of disruption in combat. With a reasonable armor class of 12 and hit points totaling 10, it is relatively fragile. However, its strengths lie in its mobility, particularly its walk speed of 40 feet and a flying speed of 10 feet, allowing it to evade attacks and reposition quickly. The creature has very good Dexterity, reflected in its +2 modifier, which grants it advantage in stealth situations, making it a difficult target to pin down. Notably, its special abilities offer interesting mechanics during encounters, particularly its capacity to detect lies and inflict debilitating conditions with its sewing attack. While it has very low Strength, Intelligence, and Charisma scores, its stealth-focused fighter role allows it to thrive in forested environments.

For its attributes, the Suturefly has the following values:
- Strength: 1, with a very bad modifier of -5, making it exceptionally weak in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity: 15, resulting in a good +2 modifier, which enhances its stealth capabilities.
- Constitution: 10, yielding an average +0 modifier, indicating standard resilience.
- Intelligence: 1, presenting a very bad modifier of -5, implying a total lack of cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 12, granting a good +1 modifier, which aids in perception but is not overly significant.
- Charisma: 4, with a very bad modifier of -3, indicating poor social skills.

The Suturefly has proficiency in the Stealth skill, granting it a bonus of +4 to stealth checks. Additionally, it possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright and in darkness as though it were dim light. Its passive perception score is 11, reflecting its ability to notice hidden threats. The creature does not communicate in any known language.

The Suturefly's special abilities are as follows:
- **Detect Lies:** This ability enables the Suturefly to discern when it hears a lie and to pinpoint the location of the lying creature within a range of 60 feet, provided the lie was spoken within the last minute. This feature can influence social encounters and manipulation scenarios, adding a layer of complexity.
- **Forest Camouflage:** When hiding in forested terrain, the Suturefly gains advantage on its Dexterity (Stealth) checks, significantly enhancing its ability to remain hidden from perceptive characters.

In terms of actions, the Suturefly can perform the following:
- **Sew:** This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. Upon a successful hit, it deals 4 piercing damage, rolling 1d4 + 2 for damage. Furthermore, the target must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in the Suturefly sewing the target’s mouth, nose, or one of its eyes closed. This action involves a rapid sequence of piercing attacks that loop the target's skin together, creating a quickly constricting barrier. If the target’s mouth is sewn shut, it cannot speak; if both mouth and nose are sewn shut, it cannot breathe, and if both eyes are sewn shut, the target becomes blinded. A creature, including the target, can use their action to cut the sewn orifice open by succeeding on a DC 12 Dexterity check with a suitable edged weapon or tool. This ability can drastically alter the course of combat by restricting a character's actions and abilities, making the Suturefly a dangerous opponent in the right conditions.
