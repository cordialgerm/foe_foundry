The Snow Queen is a formidable Medium Fey creature embodying the essence of winter and chill. With a neutral evil alignment, she possesses manipulative and destructive abilities that make her a dangerous adversary. Her high Armor Class of 17 due to natural armor and a generous pool of 182 hit points (28d8 + 56) demonstrate her resilience in battle. The Snow Queen showcases impressive Dexterity and Charisma, which enhance her agility and persuasive capabilities, making her both a formidable combatant and a cunning manipulator. While she is immune to cold and has resistances to nonmagical physical attacks, she is vulnerable to fire damage and other magical forces, which can turn the tide against her. With a Challenge Rating of 16, this creature presents a significant challenge, commanding respect and careful strategy from those who oppose her.

The Snow Queen's attributes highlight her physical prowess and intellect. She has a Strength score of 16 (+3), which provides her with good physical power in melee combat. Her Dexterity is 18 (+4), making her exceptionally agile and elusive. Her Constitution stands at 14 (+2), offering her a decent level of stamina. With an Intelligence of 18 (+4), she exhibits very good cognitive abilities. Her Wisdom of 20 (+5) allows her to be very perceptive, while her Charisma of 18 (+4) enhances her presence in interpersonal interactions and spellcasting.

In terms of saving throws, the Snow Queen has a +9 in Dexterity, which is very good, a +7 in Constitution, classified as good, and a +9 in Charisma, also very good. Her skills include a +10 in Perception, granting her exceptional awareness of her surroundings, and a +9 in Stealth, enabling her to move unnoticed with high effectiveness. The creature enjoys damage immunities to cold and resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks made with weapons that are not cold iron. Additionally, she is immune to the charmed, exhausted, and frightened conditions, making her particularly resilient against various forms of magical control.

The Snow Queen has a series of special abilities that enhance her combat effectiveness and mobility. Her Ice Climb ability allows her to ascend icy surfaces with a climbing speed of 20 feet, bypassing the need for ability checks on difficult ice and snow terrain. With Icy Weapons, her weapon attacks deal an additional 2d6 cold damage, making her already potent attacks even deadlier. Legendary Resistance enables her to automatically succeed on saving throws three times per day, bolstering her defenses against debilitating effects. Snowsight grants her the ability to see through wintry obscurations, allowing her to locate enemies even in poor visibility. Snow Walk allows her to traverse icy grounds effortlessly, an ability that can provide tactical advantages in icy environments.

In terms of actions during combat, the Snow Queen can perform a Multiattack, making two melee attacks either with her Claw or Ice Bolt. The Claw attack has a hit bonus of +9 and deals 11 slashing damage and an additional 7 cold damage upon a hit. Conversely, the Ice Bolt attack, with a hit bonus of +10 and a range of 120 feet, can inflict 13 piercing damage along with 7 cold damage while also reducing the targetâ€™s speed by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

The Snow Queen also possesses a powerful recharge action called Cold Snap. This ability causes a dramatic temperature drop, forcing creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in 42 cold damage and one level of exhaustion, while a successful save halves the damage without causing exhaustion. Significantly, if a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is petrified in ice for 1 minute, with the possibility to break free by succeeding on additional saving throws.

The Snow Queen has access to legendary actions, allowing her to perform one of several options at the end of another creature's turn. She can attack, move without provoking opportunity attacks, or invoke Snowblind to blind a creature, requiring them to pass a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. She can also use Wintry Swirl, which requires creatures within 15 feet to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or gain vulnerability to cold damage until the end of their next turn, effectively weakening their defenses against her cold attacks. A creature that is immune to cold suffers a loss of that immunity instead.

Overall, the Snow Queen exemplifies a blend of formidable combat abilities, effective mobility, and strategic manipulation of the battlefield, making her a noteworthy force for any adventuring party to contend with.
