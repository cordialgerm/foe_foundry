The Fragrant One is a small fey creature characterized by a chaotic neutral alignment. It serves as a manipulative charm caster, capable of influencing the minds of others with its sweet-smelling pheromones. With an Armor Class of 11, it possesses only average defense capabilities. However, it boasts a notable pool of hit points at 45, making it reasonably resilient. The Fragrant One is effective at mind control, using its charm abilities to bend allies to its will, which also enhances its own combat effectiveness as it gains temporary hit points and deals extra damage when surrounded by charmed allies. Despite its prowess in charm and manipulation, it has low physical strength indicated by a Strength score of 7, resulting in a very bad modifier, which makes it vulnerable in physical confrontations.

The attributes of the Fragrant One reflect its strength in magical abilities and social manipulation. It has a Dexterity score of 12 resulting in an average modifier of +1, allowing for some effective dodging, while its Constitution score of 10 indicates no particular strength in resisting damage. Notably, its Intelligence score of 18 provides an exceptional modifier of +4, making it a formidable spellcaster. Its Wisdom score of 15 gives a good modifier of +2, enhancing its perception and insight capabilities, while its Charisma score of 18 results in an exceptional modifier of +4, making the Fragrant One extremely effective in social interactions and charming foes.

The Fragrant One has saving throw bonuses that reflect its proficiency in mental manipulation: +6 in Intelligence, +4 in Wisdom, and +6 in Charisma, all indicating good resilience to being influenced or affected by others' magic. It is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions, allowing it to maintain its focus and control over the battlefield. Its senses provide it with darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 14, which is good for detecting hidden threats. It communicates in Common, Elvish, Sylvan, and has a telepathic range of 60 feet, enhancing its influence over others.

The creature possesses remarkable special abilities. The Fragrant Aura emits a cloud of pheromones affecting creatures within a 20-foot radius. Any giant, humanoid, or beast that starts its turn within this aura must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for one minute. A creature can attempt to shake off the charm at the end of its turns. If a creature fails three times within one hour, it becomes charmed for an extended period of one day and must obey the Fragrant One's commands, with additional chances to resist should it take damage or receive harmful commands. The Fragrant One can charm a maximum of six creatures at any time, offering strategic options in battle.

With the Strength in Numbers ability, the Fragrant One becomes increasingly powerful in the presence of charmed allies—gaining 5 temporary hit points, increasing its Armor Class by 1, and adding an additional 2 psychic damage to its attacks for each charmed ally present within 20 feet. This ability, replenished every minute, enhances its survivability and damage potential.

In combat, the Fragrant One can use its Phrenic Antennae as a melee spell attack with a +6 to hit, reaching out to strike a target at 5 feet. On a hit, it inflicts 6 psychic damage and forces the target to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. Failing this save causes the target to be incapacitated until the end of its next turn, effectively removing them from the fight temporarily.

As a reaction, the Fragrant One can employ the Interpose Ally ability. When targeted by an attack, it can redirect that attack to a nearby charmed ally, who absorbs the damage instead. This ability allows the affected ally to make a saving throw against the Fragrant Aura, potentially ending their charmed condition if they are harmed. This clever use of the ally's position can turn the tide of combat, ensuring the Fragrant One remains unharmed while maintaining its charming influence.
