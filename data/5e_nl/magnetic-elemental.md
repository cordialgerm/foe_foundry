The Magnetic Elemental is a powerful large creature of elemental origin with a neutral alignment. It serves as a formidable opponent in combat, leveraging its magnetic powers to manipulate metal objects and significantly hinder armored foes. With a decent armor class of 16 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 95, this elemental can sustain itself in engagements. It excels in melee combat with a good attack modifier, particularly against those wearing metal armor. However, its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma are notably low, limiting its effectiveness in social interactions and tactics that might require mental acuity. Key traits such as damage immunities to lightning and poison, along with various condition immunities, bolster its resilience in battle. While it deals substantial bludgeoning damage through its slam attacks, its true potential lies in its ability to control the battlefield with magnetism.

The Magnetic Elemental possesses the following attributes: Strength is 18 with a modifier of +4, which is classified as very good; Dexterity is 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average agility; Constitution is 18 with a +4 modifier, again very good; Intelligence is 6 with a -2 modifier, which is very bad; Wisdom is 10 with a +0 modifier, placing it at average; and Charisma is 6, also very bad. This combination of attributes highlights its physical strength and durability while emphasizing its intellectual and social deficiencies.

In terms of abilities, the Magnetic Elemental has several notable features. The first, Controlled Polarity, gives it an advantage on attack rolls against any creature wearing metal armor, making its attacks more deadly against such foes. Conversely, creatures attacking with metal weapons within a close range of the elemental suffer a disadvantage on their attack rolls, making combat against it trickier.

Its Magnetism ability allows the elemental to manipulate metal objects within proximity. When moving, it can pull Medium and smaller metal items up to 5 feet closer. If these objects enter its space, they stick to it until a creature successfully performs a DC 15 Strength check to remove them. There are exceptions; specifically, gold and silver objects are unaffected by this magnetism, providing strategic opportunities to avoid its power.

The Magnetic Elemental can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two slam attacks in one turn. Each slam attack requires a +7 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 (or an average of 2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

Additionally, it has access to the Magnetic Pulse ability, which has a recharge mechanic, only becoming available again after rolling a 4 to 6 on a die. This ability can either pull or push nearby metal objects. For the pull effect, any creature wearing metal armor or holding a metal weapon within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw to prevent their items from sticking to the elemental; those that fail become grappled. The elemental's armor class increases by 1 for each creature it grapples in this manner. The push effect targets creatures in a 10-foot radius, requiring the same Strength saving throw. Failure results in taking 21 (or an average of 6d6) force damage and being pushed away from the elemental. Successful saves reduce the damage to half and prevent being pushed, though grappled targets suffer a disadvantage on their saving throw.

In conclusion, the Magnetic Elemental is a unique and powerful foe with significant control over the battlefield through its magnetism, making it a complicated adversary for heroes to face, especially if they rely on metal weapons or armor.
