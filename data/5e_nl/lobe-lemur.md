The Lobe Lemur is a small monstrosity known for its agility and unique combat abilities. With an Armor Class of 14 and 93 hit points, it possesses a good level of durability for its challenge rating of 4, making it a respectable threat in combat. The Lobe Lemur excels in Dexterity, boasting a score of 18 (+4), which grants it good agility in both attacks and evasive maneuvers. However, its Intelligence and Charisma are quite low, which may hinder its interactions and strategic decisions outside of combat. The creature is particularly adept at ambushing foes due to its special jumping abilities and excellent camouflage in swampy environments, although its average Strength and Wisdom provide it with limited resilience to physical attacks and social encounters.

The Lobe Lemur has notable saving throw capabilities, excelling in Dexterity with a modifier of +6, which translates to a good effectiveness in avoiding damage or effects requiring Dexterity saves. Its passive Perception of 13 indicates it can notice opponents with average success. The creature understands Common but cannot speak, limiting its communication to non-verbal cues.

Among its special abilities, "Danger From Above" grants the Lobe Lemur advantageous positioning when it leaps down from a height of ten feet or more, effectively increasing its chance of landing a successful attack on its target. The "Standing Leap" ability allows it to make impressive jumps of 30 feet horizontally or 15 feet vertically, whether with or without a running start, further emphasizing its skill in mobility. The "Swamp Camouflage" ability provides it with advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in swampy terrains, making it exceptionally good at hiding.

In terms of actions, the Lobe Lemur can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to either make three Claw Swipes or one Face Clamp followed by two Claw Swipes. The "Claw Swipe" is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 9 (2d4+4) slashing damage if successful. The "Face Clamp" also has a +6 to hit, inflicting the same damage but with the added mechanic of attaching to the target's head. If the Face Clamp successfully hooks onto a creature's head, that creature becomes blinded until the end of its next turn, presenting a significant disadvantage during combat. While attached, the Lobe Lemur is still able to attack its target with advantage on its rolls, but it cannot target other creatures. The target can attempt to detach the lemur using a Strength check against a DC of 14, or the lemur can choose to release itself by expending 5 feet of movement on its turn.

Overall, the Lobe Lemur is an agile and stealthy creature that poses a unique challenge in combat due to its climbing and swimming abilities, as well as its capacity to hinder opponents through its Face Clamp ability, making it a valuable addition to any swamp-themed encounter.
