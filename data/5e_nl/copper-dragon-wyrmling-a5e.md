The Copper Dragon Wyrmling is a Medium-sized dragon known for its cunning and agility. With an armor class of 16 and hit points totaling 44, it presents a formidable challenge for adventurers with a Challenge Rating of 2, making it well-suited for encounters with lower-level parties. Its strengths lie in its mobility; it can walk and climb at 30 feet and fly at a speed of 60 feet, granting it exceptional maneuverability in combat. Additionally, it possesses damage immunity to acid, making it resilient against certain attacks. Despite these strengths, the wyrmling has average Constitution and Wisdom scores, which may limit its durability in prolonged combat situations. Its special ability, "Flow Within the Mountain," provides it with very good stealth capabilities in mountainous regions, enhancing its ability to ambush foes. 

The Copper Dragon Wyrmling has the following ability scores: Strength is 15 (+2), Dexterity is 12 (+1), Constitution is 13 (+1), Intelligence is 14 (+2), Wisdom is 11 (+0), and Charisma is 13 (+1). The Strength modifier is good, allowing it to perform well in melee combat, while Dexterity gives it an average boost to its agility. Constitution provides an average level of hit point resilience, and Intelligence offers good insight and knowledge in various scenarios. Wisdom is average, suggesting it may not be highly perceptive, while Charisma is also average, affecting social interactions but not significantly.

In terms of skills, the Copper Dragon Wyrmling has a +2 modifier to Perception, indicating it has an average awareness of its surroundings, and a +3 modifier to Stealth, which is very good for sneaking and hiding. Its damage immunity to acid means it cannot be harmed by acid-based attacks, which can be a significant advantage if facing enemies that utilize such damage types. The creature possesses blindsight to a range of 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, which allows it to perceive its environment even in complete darkness, enhancing its effectiveness in various situations. It can communicate in Draconic, which is typical for dragons.

The Copper Dragon Wyrmling has several actions in combat. Its "Bite" attack is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to deal an average of 13 piercing damage (2d10 + 2) on a successful hit, making it a reliable source of melee damage. The wyrmling can also use one of its breath weapons, which recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. The first breath weapon is "Acid Breath," which releases a line of acid measuring 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this area must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to take 13 (3d8) acid damage on a failure or half damage on a success, which can significantly affect multiple targets. The second breath weapon is "Slowing Breath," a toxic gas that fills a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail become slowed for 1 minute, with the potential to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect. This ability can control the battlefield, hindering enemy movement and actions while the wyrmling remains mobile.
