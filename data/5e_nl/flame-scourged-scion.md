The Flame-Scourged Scion is a formidable creature characterized as a Huge Aberration with a chaotic evil alignment. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, boasting a relatively high Armor Class of 16 thanks to its natural armor and substantial Hit Points totaling 125. Its key strengths lie in its exceptional Constitution, which grants it superior resilience, along with abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness after taking fire damage. However, despite its prowess, it has a very low Wisdom score, which could leave it vulnerable in scenarios that require insight or perception. The Flame-Scourged Scion is well-equipped to dominate the battlefield, using its tentacle attacks and the unique Ember ability to inflict area damage.

The attributes of the Flame-Scourged Scion are as follows: Strength is 19, which provides a good modifier of +4; Dexterity is 17 with a good modifier of +3; Constitution is exceptionally high at 22, giving a +6 modifier; Intelligence is 16 resulting in a good +3 modifier; Wisdom is low at 6, leading to a bad -2 modifier; and Charisma sits at 15 with a +2 modifier. It has saving throw bonuses of Con +10, Wis +2, and Cha +6, making it very good at resisting effects targeting its Constitution. Its skills include insight and perception, both of which are at +6, indicating a good proficiency.

In terms of resistances and immunities, the Flame-Scourged Scion has damage resistance to fire attacks and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, allowing it to withstand a variety of attacks effectively. It is immune to grappled, paralyzed, and restrained conditions, ensuring it can maintain its mobility in combat. The creature has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 16, which helps it navigate in low-light conditions. It understands Common, Deep Speech, and Sylvan languages, allowing it to communicate with various beings.

The Flame-Scourged Scion possesses special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities. Its Burning Rage ability gives it an advantage on attack rolls when it takes fire damage, benefiting from this boost until the end of its next turn. If it receives more than 5 fire damage, this advantage is extended for two rounds, promoting aggressive tactics in a fire-laden environment. The Firesight ability allows it to see unobstructed through fire, smoke, and fog, making it difficult for opponents to conceal themselves from it. Finally, Groundbreaker permits the Flame-Scourged Scion to move through difficult terrain without penalty, maintaining its speed regardless of the battlefield conditions.

In combat, the Flame-Scourged Scion can execute a Multiattack, making three tentacle attacks in one turn. Each tentacle attack utilizes a +8 to hit modifier and has a reach of 5 feet, inflicting an average of 15 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, if a tentacle attack hits a creature that is Large or smaller, the target is grappled, requiring them to succeed on an escape DC of 16 to break free. While grappled, the target is restrained, and the Flame-Scourged Scion can continue to automatically hit that target with its tentacle attacks, effectively disabling its movement and actions. 

The Ember ability, which has a recharge time of 6 rounds, allows the Flame-Scourged Scion to unleash a cloud of burning embers in a 10-foot radius around itself. Each creature in this area must perform a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 fire damage on a failure, or half that damage on a success. This ability can create a significant impact in combat, posing a high risk to nearby characters and shaping the dynamics of the battlefield. The embers dissipate quickly, ensuring that this attack remains a tactical option rather than a lasting area effect.
