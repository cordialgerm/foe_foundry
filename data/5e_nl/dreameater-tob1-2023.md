The Dream Eater is a medium-sized fiend characterized by its lawful evil alignment. Known for its deceptive nature and nightmarish abilities, it plays the role of a cunning predator that feeds on the dreams and mental states of its victims. With robust hit points and a combination of physical and psychic damage capabilities, the Dream Eater poses a significant threat in combat. It has strong Charisma and Dexterity, making it not only an effective attacker with its claws and bite but also highly skilled in deception and charm effects. Its key strengths include its damage immunities and resistances, while it is notably vulnerable to magical attacks that overcome its resistances.

The Dream Eater has an Armor Class of 15, considered good for its challenge rating of 5, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage in battle. With hit points totaling 75, derived from rolling 10d8 and adding 30, it can endure prolonged engagements, making it tough to defeat in combat. It is capable of walking at a speed of 20 feet and can fly at a speed of 30 feet, offering it mobility in and out of combat situations.

The creature's Strength score is 15, providing a good modifier of +2 for physical attacks. Its Dexterity is rated at 18 with a +4 modifier, allowing for exceptional agility and quick reflexes in combat scenarios. The Constitution score of 17 yields a +3 modifier, contributing to its impressive resilience. Intelligence is also strong at 16, giving it a +3 modifier, which is beneficial for clever maneuvers and tactics. Wisdom of 13 gives an average +1 modifier, and Charisma sits at a very high 20 granting a +5 modifier, indicating its exceptional ability to deceive and influence others.

In terms of skills, the Dream Eater excels in Deception with a +8 modifier, indicating a very good proficiency in trickery. It has an Insight score of +4, suggesting good awareness of others' motives, and a Persuasion score of +8, enabling it to convincingly manipulate those it encounters.

The Dream Eater has immunity to poison damage and is resistant to cold, fire, lightning, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, making it a hard opponent to harm unless the attackers utilize magical or specific damage types. Additionally, it is immune to being poisoned, which enhances its durability in fights. Its sensory capabilities include darkvision up to 60 feet, augmenting its ability to operate in low-light conditions, and it possesses a passive Perception score of 11. It can communicate in multiple languages: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Infernal, and has telepathy within a 120-foot range.

The Dream Eater’s abilities include “Dream Eater’s Caress," which inflicts psychic damage on creatures grappled by it. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or take 5 psychic damage, allowing the Dream Eater to gain temporary hit points that equal the psychic damage dealt. 

In combat, it employs a multiattack mechanism, using its “Lotus Scent” ability first to incapacitate foes, followed by a Bite attack that has a +7 to hit and can deal 15 piercing damage on a hit. The Claw attack also has a +7 to hit and inflicts 13 slashing damage, while additionally grappling medium or smaller creatures (escape DC 14) and restraining them.

The “Lotus Scent” ability forces nearby creatures that are not Constructs or Undead to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute. While poisoned, affected victims are charmed by the Dream Eater. They may repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn to try to shake off the effect. Successful saves or the effect ending renders the creature immune to further attempts of being poisoned by the Dream Eater for a day, making this ability very potent against groups of unprepared foes.

Another formidable ability, “Waking Dreams," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, requires each creature within a 20-foot radius of the Dream Eater to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in taking 21 psychic damage and becoming incapacitated, forcing the affected to move randomly. Succeeding on the saving throw halves the damage and avoids incapacitation. Affected creatures can attempt to break free from this condition at the end of their turns.

For mobility and strategy, the Dream Eater can use a bonus action called “Change Shape,” allowing it to transform into a Small or Medium humanoid it has previously observed or return to its fiendish form. This ability keeps its statistics intact aside from size and makes it an adept infiltrator. If it falls in battle, it reverts to its true form.
