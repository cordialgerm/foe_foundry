The Fire-Infused Water Elemental is a formidable Huge elemental creature that combines the intrinsic properties of water with the fiery essence of fire. This unique being functions both offensively and defensively in combat, boasting a strong Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 138. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it presents a significant threat, offering 2,900 experience points upon defeat. It possesses strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, with scores of 20 (+5) and 20 (+5), respectively, making it exceptionally resilient and powerful in melee combat. However, it has low Intelligence and Charisma, indicating limited cognitive abilities and social interaction.

The Fire-Infused Water Elemental has a swimming speed of 90 feet and a walking speed of 30 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. Its Strength score allows for very good physical attacks, while its Dexterity provides a good boost to its evasiveness. It is immune to poison damage and possesses resistance to acid, cold, and fire, as well as protection against nonmagical physical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to numerous conditions, making it exceptionally hard to hinder in combat scenarios.

For actions, the Fire-Infused Water Elemental can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two melee slam attacks against its foes. The Slam attack has a +8 to hit, which is very good, with a reach of 5 feet, enabling it to engage opponents effectively. A successful hit deals 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage accompanied by an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage, showcasing its dual elemental nature.

One of its key special abilities is Water Form, allowing it to occupy the same space as a hostile creature and squeeze through tight areas easily, which can create tactical positioning advantages in encounters. Its Scald ability, which recharges on a roll of 6, unleashes a 30-foot cone of superheated water. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 21 (6d6) fire damage and are knocked prone, effectively hindering their movement. Success halves the damage and prevents being knocked down. This ability can significantly impact the positioning of enemy forces during combat.

Overall, the Fire-Infused Water Elemental is a well-rounded adversary with strong offensive capabilities, defensive resilience, and unique movement traits that make it a unique challenge in any encounter.
