The Young Copper Dragon is a large and powerful dragon known for its cunning and playful demeanor. It has a strong presence in combat, capable of dealing substantial damage with its physical attacks and breath weapons. With an impressive Armor Class of 17 and a total of 144 hit points, this dragon is relatively durable and can withstand significant amounts of damage. It is especially dangerous at high altitudes, possessing excellent flying capabilities. However, it has average Dexterity, which makes it slightly less agile compared to other creatures. The Young Copper Dragon excels in stealth in mountainous environments, thanks to its special ability, "Flow Within the Mountain." In terms of magical capabilities, it can cast a variety of spells, enhancing its utility beyond just physical attacks. 

Its attributes are as follows: Strength is 18 (+4), Dexterity is 12 (+1), Constitution is 16 (+3), Intelligence is 16 (+3), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 14 (+2). The dragon's Strength modifier is exceptional, allowing it to deal significant damage with its attacks. The Dexterity modifier is average, providing it with a decent but not outstanding capacity for finesse. With a Constitution modifier that is good, it has resilience against physical attacks. The Intelligence and Charisma modifiers are both good, enhancing its spellcasting abilities and social interactions. 

For saving throws, the Young Copper Dragon has the following values: Dexterity +5, Constitution +7, Wisdom +5, and Charisma +6, all of which indicate good resilience against various effects. In terms of skills, it possesses deception +6, perception +5, and stealth +5, making it a well-rounded creature adept at both subterfuge and awareness in its environment. The dragon is immune to acid damage, which grants it a significant advantage against foes who rely on this damage type.

The dragon has a passive perception of 15, allowing it to notice hidden creatures or objects effectively. It is capable of communication in both Common and Draconic, making it interactively versatile in conversations or negotiations.

The Young Copper Dragon has several notable abilities. "Flow Within the Mountain" grants it advantage on Stealth checks when hiding in mountainous regions, making it exceptionally skilled in its preferred environment. Its innate spellcasting, governed by Charisma with a save DC of 15, allows it to cast spells such as "hideous laughter" and "suggestion" three times per day each. These spells can incapacitate or manipulate opponents, showcasing the dragonâ€™s clever and strategic approach to combat.

In terms of actions, the Young Copper Dragon can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to attack with its bite once and its claws twice in one turn. The bite is a melee weapon attack with a modifier of +8 to hit, and on a successful hit, it deals 15 piercing damage along with an additional 4 acid damage. The claws are also a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, and they deal 13 slashing damage on a successful hit.

The dragon's breath weapons offer powerful area-of-effect options. With a recharge requirement of 5-6, it can utilize either the "Acid Breath" or "Slowing Breath." The "Acid Breath" involves exhaling acid in a 40-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line, requiring creatures in that area to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. They take 45 (10d8) acid damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful one. The "Slowing Breath" involves exhaling toxic gas in a 30-foot cone, compelling creatures within to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A failure results in the creature being slowed for 1 minute, making them less effective in combat. They may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect.

The Young Copper Dragon is a formidable opponent that combines physical prowess, magical abilities, and cunning tactics, making it a memorable encounter for any adventuring party.
