The Rattok is a Small fiend characterized by its chaotic evil nature. This creature is known for its speed and the ability to deftly navigate through its environment, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 14 and hit points totaling 66, the Rattok demonstrates decent resilience. However, despite its strengths, it has weakness in the Wisdom and Charisma attributes, showing a lack of perception and social influence. With a challenge rating of 4, it poses a fair but manageable threat to adventurers, offering a rewarding experience upon defeat. Notably, the Rattok's abilities to regenerate health quickly and its immunity to common damage types make it a challenging foe in battles.

The Rattok's attributes are as follows: Strength is 10, which is average; Dexterity is 16, which is good, allowing for effective actions in combat; Constitution is 14, which is also good, enhancing its hit points; Intelligence is 14, also good, indicating a level of cunning; Wisdom is a low 6, indicating a very bad perception; and Charisma is a low 9, which is bad, suggesting difficulty in social interactions. Its skills include a Stealth score of +5, which is good, enhancing its ability to conceal itself. The Rattok possesses immunities to fire, necrotic, and poison damage and has resistances to cold and lightning damage, significantly reducing the effectiveness of various attacks against it. It is immune to the poisoned condition and has darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dark conditions. The creature understands Abyssal, Common, and Void Speech.

The Rattok has several special abilities that can significantly impact encounters. The "Bottled Soul" ability can be used three times per day as a bonus action. When it consumes a bottled soul, it regains 7 hit points and gains advantage on all attack rolls and ability checks for one round. Non-fiends who consume a bottled soul also regain 7 hit points but must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid being stunned for one round and poisoned for an hour on a failed save, or just poisoned for an hour on a successful save. The "Fire Dancer" ability allows the Rattok to take no damage when subjected to fire or necrotic damage and becomes immune to spells that would impede its movement for one minute. This grants it exceptional mobility and makes it difficult to control. Additionally, it has "Magic Resistance," granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it exceptionally resilient against magic.

In combat, the Rattok can perform a Multiattack, making three attacks consisting of one bite and two claw strikes. The bite attack has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage plus an additional 3 necrotic damage on a hit. The claw attacks also have +5 to hit and deal 5 slashing damage. The Rattok can unleash a "Necrotic Rush" as its special action, which recharges on a roll of 5-6. This ability sends out shadowy copies of itself to claw at all creatures within a 15-foot radius, forcing them to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed throw, a creature takes 14 necrotic damage, or half that on a successful throw. This attack can significantly impact multiple targets at once, making the Rattok a threatening presence on the battlefield.
