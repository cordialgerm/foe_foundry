The Wardu is a Medium-sized aberration known for its neutral evil alignment. This creature possesses a blend of magical abilities and evasive maneuverability, making it both a challenging foe and a tricky opponent in battle. With a moderate overall power level, rated at Challenge Rating 6, the Wardu is recognized for its strong magical resistance and ability to inflict debilitating conditions on its foes while also healing itself through its attacks. The Wardu's significant speed in the air allows it to engage and disengage from combat effectively, putting it in a strong strategic position. However, its lack of physical movement on the ground can be seen as a notable weakness, preventing it from engaging in some combat scenarios without the ability to maneuver.

The Wardu has an Armor Class of 16, which denotes a good defensive capability, and it possesses 105 hit points, making it quite resilient in combat. The creature's attributes are as follows: Strength is average at 10, Dexterity is good at 18, Constitution is good at 16, Intelligence is average at 10, Wisdom is good at 15, and Charisma is average at 12. The Wardu has saving throw bonuses of +3 in Intelligence and +4 in Charisma, both of which are considered good, enhancing its survivability against certain effects. The creature is immune to exhaustion and the prone condition, enabling it to maintain its performance in challenging situations. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, a passive Perception score of 13, and understands Deep Speech but cannot communicate verbally, utilizing telepathy to interact with others at a range of 60 feet.

In terms of special abilities, the Wardu has Flyby, which allows it to leave an enemy's reach without provoking opportunity attacks, making it exceptionally mobile. Additionally, it possesses Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, significantly enhancing its defensive capabilities against magic users.

The Wardu employs a Multiattack action, which consists of using its Segmented Gaze ability followed by two attacks with its proboscis. The Proboscis attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals an average of 11 piercing damage through a roll of 2d6 + 4. Importantly, the Wardu regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt, allowing it to sustain itself during battle. If the target of this attack is a spellcaster, they must contend with disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells until the end of their next turn, providing a tactical advantage against caster foes.

The Segmented Gaze ability allows the Wardu to concentrate magical energy within its central eye directed at a single creature within a 30-foot range. That creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On failure, they suffer a random condition determined by rolling a d4: they may become blinded, frightened, deafened, or incapacitated until the end of their next turn. This ability not only debuffs the enemy but also enhances the Warduâ€™s tactical prowess by creating opportunities to capitalize on the affected opponent's weakened state.
