The Dire Pangolin is a large beast that serves as a formidable defender in its environment. With an Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, this creature displays significant durability with 82 hit points, making it a tough opponent to take down. Its role in combat centers around dealing damage while leveraging its special abilities for both offense and defense. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it possesses a mix of strong melee attacks, resilient defenses, and unique abilities that make it a noteworthy adversary for adventurers. However, it has low Dexterity and Intelligence, which creates vulnerabilities that can be exploited by savvy players.

The Dire Pangolin has a Strength score of 18, which equates to a modifier of +4, representing exceptional physical power that enhances its ability to deal damage. Its Dexterity score is average at 11, meaning it has a modifier of +0, indicating no particular advantage or disadvantage in actions that rely on agility. Its Constitution score of 15 (+2 modifier) reflects good endurance, bolstering its hit points. The intelligence attribute is very low at 3 (-4 modifier), revealing that the pangolin lacks strategic thinking and problem-solving capabilities. Its Wisdom score of 12 (+1 modifier) is average, allowing it to perceive threats somewhat effectively, while its Charisma of 7 (-2 modifier) means it is not persuasive or socially adept.

In terms of abilities, the Dire Pangolin has strong damage resistances, with resistance to poison. It has keen senses, granting it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing and smell, with a passive perception score of 13, which allows it to react quickly to nearby threats.

The creature's special abilities include Edged Scales and Keen Hearing and Smell. Edged Scales inflict 4 (1d8) slashing damage on any creature that touches the pangolin or strikes it in melee range, creating a deterrent to physical attacks. Keen Hearing and Smell grants the pangolin heightened awareness, allowing it to detect intruders or predators more effectively.

In combat, the Dire Pangolin can use Multiattack to make two Claws attacks and one Tail Slap attack. The Claws attack has a +6 to hit and deals 10 (2d6+4) slashing damage, making it a significant threat in close range. The Tail Slap also has a +6 to hit, deals 8 (1d8+4) piercing damage, and forces the target to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. A prone target is more susceptible to attacks, enhancing the pangolin's threat level in battle.

The Tuck In action allows the Dire Pangolin to curl into a protective ball, granting it resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. While curled, it cannot use its Claw or Tail Slap attacks and cannot climb, but it is immune to being knocked prone, making it a strategic defensive position. The pangolin can uncurl as a bonus action, allowing for flexible tactics during encounters.
