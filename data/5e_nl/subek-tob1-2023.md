The Subek is a formidable large humanoid creature that embodies a chaotic and aggressive nature, particularly during its flood season. As a Lawful Neutral entity, it follows a code but is prone to violent outbursts when provoked or hungry. With 114 hit points, it possesses a strong resilience in combat, thanks to its natural armor which grants it an Armor Class of 15. Its Strength attribute of 19, alongside an exceptional modifier of +4, indicates its physical prowess, making its melee attacks particularly dangerous. However, while its Constitution of 18 also gives it good durability in battle, its overall average Dexterity of 10 could be seen as a weakness when faced with high-speed adversaries. Subekâ€™s challenge rating of 5 makes it a moderate threat in the game, suitable for parties of about five characters. The Subek has abilities that emphasize its aggression and combat capabilities, particularly its unique Blood Frenzy feature, which enhances its offensive potential under specific conditions.

The Subek has the following statistics and features:
- Strength: 19 (+4) - This is exceptional and reinforces its role as a powerful striker in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0) - This is average and indicates it has no special speed or evasion capabilities.
- Constitution: 18 (+4) - This is very good and contributes to its survivability in battles.
- Intelligence: 14 (+2) - This is above average and shows it has decent reasoning skills.
- Wisdom: 13 (+1) - This is average, affecting its perception and insight.
- Charisma: 13 (+1) - This is also average and may impact its social interactions.

The Subek has proficiency in two skills: History and Investigation, granting it a +5 modifier to these checks under normal conditions. Its senses include 60 feet of darkvision and a passive perception score of 11, allowing it to see in darkness and detect creatures within its field of awareness efficiently. The languages it understands include Common.

Among its special abilities, the Subek has Flood Fever, which activates during flood season when it becomes extremely aggressive. While in this state, it loses its proficiency in Intelligence checks tied to History and Investigation, effectively making it very bad at these tasks. If the Subek has not consumed food in the last 8 hours, it enters a frenzy, prioritizing attacks against the nearest creature visible. In cases where no such target is present, it will attack objects, favoring those that are smaller than itself. The frenzy grants it advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have full hit points, making it especially deadly against injured foes. It also has the Hold Breath ability, allowing it to remain underwater for up to 15 minutes, adding to its versatility as a creature that might engage in aquatic confrontations.

In terms of actions, the Subek has a Multiattack feature, enabling it to make one Bite and two Claw attacks in the same turn. The Bite attack rolls at +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 points of piercing damage on a successful hit. The Claw attack also rolls at +7 to hit, dealing 11 points of slashing damage each time. If both claw attacks hit a single target, that target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. Failure results in an additional 7 points of slashing damage as the Subek mauls its prey. This capacity for multiple attacks makes the Subek a significant threat in melee confrontations, capable of dealing substantial damage in a single turn.
