The Rakshasa is a Medium fiend known for its cunning abilities and magical prowess. With an Armor Class of 16 and a substantial 161 hit points, it presents a significant challenge to adventurers, rated at a Challenge Rating of 13, equating to 10,000 experience points. This creature is particularly adept at manipulation and deception, utilizing its high Charisma score of 20, which offers an exceptional modifier of +5 in social interactions. It is skilled in deception and insight, boasting values of +10 and +8 respectively. While it is resistant to bludgeoning and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, its abilities offer it further advantages in combat and social manipulation. Notably, the Rakshasa can shapeshift, making it a formidable foe in both direct confrontation and strategic play.

The Rakshasa has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 16 (+3), Wisdom 16 (+3), and Charisma 20 (+5). The Constitution score reflects good durability, while the good Dexterity grants it agility in both attack and defense. Its spells are cast using Charisma as its innate spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 18, making its spells difficult to resist.

Among its special abilities, the Rakshasa has innate spellcasting that allows it to cast spells without material components. It can cast spells at will such as detect magic, mage hand, and major image, which can create illusory figures for deception. It can also cast charm person and dominate person three times a day each, making it highly effective at manipulating others. Its ability to fly and turn invisible enhances its combat strategy, allowing for mobility and stealth.

For actions, the Rakshasa can execute a multiattack by making two weapon attacks in a turn. The claw attack, available only in its true form, offers a melee weapon attack with a +8 modifier to hit and does 10 slashing damage. Notably, if the claw attack hits a creature, it curses the target, preventing it from benefiting from long rests, leading to terrible visions. The Rakshasa can also use a rapier for piercing damage, making another melee attack that deals 7 damage. 

A unique and potent action it can take is called Sweet Promises, where it targets a creature within 60 feet and offers something that it covets. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in the target being charmed and stunned until the end of its next turn, which can significantly hinder an opponentâ€™s actions in battle. 

The Rakshasa has additional spell-like abilities; when using Invisibility, it can remain unseen for up to one hour unless it attacks or casts a spell. With Fly, it can soar through the air at a speed of 60 feet, making it challenging to engage in melee.

In terms of bonus actions, the Rakshasa can shapeshift to alter its form while retaining its ability scores, which allows it to disguise itself as a Medium or Small humanoid. It can also use Read Thoughts, gaining insight into the surface thoughts of a creature, which grants it an advantage on attack rolls and checks involving deception or persuasion against that target. 

As a reaction, the Rakshasa can employ Counterproposal, applying Sweet Promises to a creature that has attacked it or attempted to use a spell against it, providing an excellent way to turn the tables in combat.

Overall, the Rakshasa is a versatile and challenging foe, utilizing a combination of magical abilities, shapeshifting, and deception to confound and outmaneuver its enemies, making it a memorable encounter for any adventuring party.
