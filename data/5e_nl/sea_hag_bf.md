The Sea Hag is a Medium fey creature known for its cunning and unsettling appearance. It serves as an antagonist in watery realms, often utilizing its amphibious nature and illusion powers to deceive and terrify adventurers. With an impressive swim speed and abilities that instill fear, the Sea Hag can incapacitate its foes mentally while delivering considerable damage with its claws. However, its moderate challenge rating and average defenses make it vulnerable to coordinated attacks from a party of adventurers. Its effectiveness in combat is amplified by its ability to manipulate its appearance and create fear, but it is not without its weaknesses as its relatively low hit points can lead to its downfall.

The Sea Hag has an Armor Class of 14, reflecting good natural defenses, and 51 hit points, which are considered average for a creature of its challenge rating (CR 2). It has a movement speed of 30 feet on land and 40 feet while swimming, giving it a very good ability to navigate aquatic environments. Its attributes include a Strength score of 13 (+3, which is good), Dexterity of 12 (+1, which is average), Constitution of 14 (+2, which is good), Intelligence of 12 (+1, which is average), Wisdom of 12 (+1, which is average), and Charisma of 12 (+1, which is average). The Sea Hag possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and a Perception score of 11, indicative of its average awareness. With a Stealth score of 13, it can blend in reasonably well, especially when taking advantage of its underwater camouflage.

The Sea Hag has several noteworthy abilities. Its Amphibious quality allows it to breathe both air and water, making it equally comfortable in both environments. Fey Resilience grants it resistance to being charmed or incapacitated, protecting it from a range of mental effects. The Horrific Appearance ability enables the Sea Hag to instill fear in nearby humanoids; when a creature that can see it begins its turn within 30 feet, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 12. If that creature fails, it becomes frightened until the start of its next turn. This ability can dramatically change the dynamics of a combat encounter by disabling opponents. Underwater Camouflage enhances the hag’s stealth ability when submerged, making it significantly harder to spot (with a Stealth rating of 18) while not using its Illusory Appearance.

In terms of direct actions, the Sea Hag can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to utilize its Death Glare ability followed by two Claw attacks. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack that deals 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage on a hit, which is a good damage output for its challenge rating. The Death Glare forces a creature within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 12; failure results in being frightened until the end of its next turn. If the target is already frightened and fails the save, it is reduced to 0 hit points, making this a powerful and potentially devastating move in the right circumstances. 

As a bonus action, the Sea Hag can utilize Illusory Appearance, cloaking itself and its possessions in a magical illusion that disguises it as a humanoid creature of similar size. This illusion can create strategic advantages in both combat and social interactions, as it enables deceptive tactics. 

For reactions, the Sea Hag has the Barnacle Block ability, which allows it to absorb some incoming damage. When the hag is damaged by an attack it can see, it can reduce the damage taken by 4 (1d8) by shifting the barnacles and scales on its body, enhancing its survivability in combat situations.

Overall, the Sea Hag’s unique blend of fear-inducing abilities, solid melee attacks, and magical illusions allows it to be a memorable and formidable opponent in aquatic settings.
