The Stone Giant is a formidable and imposing creature within the realm of Dungeons & Dragons. As a Huge giant, it stands as a significant threat on the battlefield, boasting a high Armor Class of 17 and substantial Hit Points totaling 126. This makes the Stone Giant a resilient opponent capable of absorbing considerable damage. Its Challenge Rating of 8 indicates that it is suitable for parties facing mid-level challenges. Noteworthy strengths include its exceptional Strength score of 23, allowing it to deal significant melee damage and manipulate foes with relative ease. However, it possesses average Intelligence and Charisma, indicating it may not excel in social interactions or complex strategies requiring cunning. The Stone Giantâ€™s ability to camouflage itself in rocky terrain enhances its stealth capabilities, and it has resistances to acid damage while being immune to petrification, which adds to its survivability.

The attributes of the Stone Giant are as follows: Strength is 23 with a modifier of +6, which is exceptional; Dexterity is 14 with a +2 modifier, considered good; Constitution is 20 with a +5 modifier, also very good; Intelligence stands at 10, which is average; Wisdom is 12 with a +1 modifier, representing average; and Charisma is 10, also average. The Stone Giant's saving throws benefit from these high attributes, as they receive bonuses of +9 to Strength, +5 to Dexterity, +8 to Constitution, and +4 to Wisdom. It showcases skills such as athletics at +9, perception at +4, and stealth at +5, reinforcing its physical prowess and ability to remain undetected in its natural habitat.

In terms of combat abilities, the Stone Giant has access to multiple actions that enhance its threat level. Its special ability, Camouflage, grants it advantage on Stealth checks made in rocky terrains, making it hard to spot when it chooses to conceal itself. During combat, it can utilize the Multiattack action to strike twice either with its greatclub or by throwing rocks at its enemies. The greatclub attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 19 bludgeoning damage, but if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. 

The Rock attack allows the Stone Giant to hurl projectiles with a range of 60 feet, dealing 20 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Similar to the greatclub, if a Large or smaller creature is struck, it must also make a DC 19 Strength saving throw, risking being pushed back and knocked prone. As a unique feature, the Stone Giant can throw a grappling target up to 30 feet, providing both damage and movement manipulation during combat. 

Additionally, the Giant can use a Bonus Action to perform a Grab, allowing one creature within 5 feet to attempt a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being grappled. If they fail, they are grappled, which impedes their actions and gives the Stone Giant advantage on future attacks with its greatclub against that target, increasing its potential damage output.

As a reaction, the Stone Giant possesses the ability called Rock Catching. If a projectile is thrown at it, the Giant can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If successful, it catches the projectile and suffers no damage from it, showcasing its impressive defensive prowess. 

Overall, the Stone Giant presents a blend of raw physical power, survivability, and tactical options, making it a noteworthy adversary capable of providing substantial challenges to adventurers in a campaign.
