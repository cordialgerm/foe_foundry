The Rug of Smothering is a large construct that embodies a surprising blend of stealth and lethality, functioning as both a trap and an ambusher. It is particularly effective in surprise attacks due to its ability to disguise itself as an ordinary rug when motionless. With a challenge rating of 2, it offers a moderate threat to adventurers, possessing decent defenses with an Armor Class of 12 and 45 hit points. Though it has a good Dexterity modifier of +2, allowing for better stealth, its other attributes are lacking. As a construct, it is immune to various conditions and types of damage, making it resilient in combat. However, it is vulnerable to anti-magic effects, which can incapacitate it and leave it open to attacks. Its offensive capabilities revolve around grappling and suffocating its victims, which can be particularly deadly for unsuspecting characters.

The Rug of Smothering has the following attributes:
- Strength: +3, which is considered good, allowing it to manage grapple checks effectively.
- Dexterity: +2, also regarded as good, enhancing its stealth capabilities, enabling it to remain undetected until it attacks.
- Constitution: +0, average in terms of durability.
- Intelligence: -5, very bad, indicating it has no cognitive abilities for strategic thinking or understanding.
- Wisdom: -4, very bad, signifying poor awareness or insight.
- Charisma: -5, also very bad, underscoring its lack of social interaction or presence.

In terms of special abilities:
- **Antimagic Susceptibility:** This ability renders the rug incapacitated when within an antimagic field, making it vulnerable. It also risks falling unconscious for 1 minute if targeted by dispel magic and failing a Constitution saving throw.
- **Construct Nature:** The rug does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, meaning it can operate continuously without fatigue or need for sustenance.
- **Construct Resilience:** It is immune to poison and psychic damage, as well as the conditions of exhaustion, charm, fear, paralysis, petrification, and poisoning.
- **Damage Transfer:** While grappling, it only takes half damage from attacks directed at it and the grappled creature receives the remaining damage, encouraging strategic grappling in combat.
- **False Appearance:** The rug can mimic a regular rug when motionless and not flying, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting adventurers effectively.

For its actions:
- **Smother:** This attack involves a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, targeting one Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. If it hits, it deals 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target becomes grappled. While grappled, the target is restrained, blinded, and cannot breathe, greatly hindering its actions and survival.
- **Squeeze Prey:** The rug tightens around the grappled creature, forcing it to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. A failed save results in 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, while a successful save halves that amount. Additionally, if a breathing target fails by 5 or more, it starts suffocating, further enhancing the rug's lethality.

As a bonus action:
- **Rolling Charge (available when the Rug has 25 HP or fewer):** If the rug isn't currently grappling a creature, it can roll along the ground for up to three times its speed toward a sensed target, culminating in a potential Smother attack if it stops within 5 feet of the target. This versatility allows it to surprise enemies from a distance, reinforcing its ambush tactics.
