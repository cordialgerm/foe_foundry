The Young Shadow Dragon is a formidable creature that embodies the darkness and malevolence inherent in its nature. As a Large Dragon, it possesses a combination of strong attributes, significant hit points, and a range of powerful abilities that make it a challenging opponent. With an Armor Class of 17 and 114 hit points, it can sustain damage while delivering lethal strikes with its multiattack feature, which allows it to bite and use its claws in a single turn. Its strengths include high physical and mental capabilities, notably a Charisma score of 18, granting it exceptional proficiency in deception and powerful innate spellcasting. The Young Shadow Dragon also has resistances to various damage types and can move incorporeally, adding to its tactical advantages in combat. However, it is spiritually bound to a specific area, meaning it is vulnerable when separated from this essence link. Overall, it presents a significant challenge for adventurers, with a challenge rating of 10.

The Young Shadow Dragon has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 18 (+4). It has good saving throw modifiers: Dexterity +6 (good), Constitution +8 (very good), Intelligence +5 (average), and Wisdom +5 (average). Its skills are also noteworthy, featuring deception +8 (very good), insight +5 (average), nature +5 (average), perception +5 (average), and stealth +6 (good). The dragon is immune to necrotic and poison damage, resistant to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, and takes no damage from nonmagical weapons. It is immune to several conditions, including fatigue, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, poisoned, prone, and restrained, which enhances its combat longevity. With darkvision extending 240 feet and a passive perception of 15, the dragon is adept at navigating and detecting threats in the dark.

The Young Shadow Dragon has several unique abilities that enhance its role in combat. It radiates an Evil aura, establishing its menacing presence. Its incorporeal movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects at will, although it incurs force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. The essence link connects the dragon to a specific area; if it wanders too far, it cannot benefit from long rests and causes creatures entering the area to gain levels of fatigue and strife, which can only be alleviated by resting away from the area. This essence link mechanic creates strategic opportunities for the dragon in thwarting adventurers.

In combat, the Young Shadow Dragon can take various actions. Its multiattack lets it perform a bite and two claw attacks in a single turn, presenting a combined threat of piercing and slashing damage. The bite attack has a +8 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and inflicts an average of 20 piercing damage plus an additional 4 necrotic damage on a hit. The claw attacks also have a +8 to hit and deal 17 slashing damage. One of its most powerful abilities, the Anguished Breath, can be unleashed every five to six rounds. This breath weapon releases a shadowy maelstrom in a 30-foot cone that requires affected creatures to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail take an immense 40 necrotic damage, while successful saves result in halved damage. This breath weapon can significantly alter the dynamics of a battle, causing both direct damage and instilling fear based on the devastating effects of necrotic energy.

For its innate spellcasting, the Young Shadow Dragon can innately cast the spells darkness and detect evil and good, three times per day each. The spell darkness creates an area of magical darkness that obscures vision, hampering visibility for enemies, while detect evil and good allows the dragon to sense the presence of celestial, fiendish, and undead creatures. These spells can aid in controlling the battlefield and enhancing its tactical advantage during encounters.
