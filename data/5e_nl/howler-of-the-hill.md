The Howler of the Hill is a formidable Large Aberration infused with a neutral evil alignment. Its role in combat revolves around its high mobility, exceptional psychic abilities, and a powerful howl that can incapacitate or stun multiple opponents simultaneously. With a Challenge Rating of 14, it poses a significant threat, possessing 178 hit points and a natural armor class of 18, making it a tough adversary to defeat. Notably, the Howler is immune to psychic damage and possesses advantageous resistances, allowing it to withstand various forms of attacks while inflicting heavy psychic damage in return.

The Howler's attributes reflect its unique nature: it has a Strength of 17, granting a good modifier of +3 for melee attacks, a Dexterity of 22 for an exceptional +6 modifier that helps it avoid attacks and boosts its initiative, and a Constitution of 16, translating to a good +3 modifier for hit point calculations. It also has an Intelligence of 17 (+3), a Wisdom of 18 (+4), and a Charisma of 18 (+4), all contributing to versatile performance in combat and interactions. The Howler's saving throws are particularly strong in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma with +8, +9, and +9 respectively, making it very difficult to affect with spells and abilities targeting these attributes. It has a passive Perception of 19, allowing it to notice hidden creatures effectively.

In terms of special abilities, the Howler has several noteworthy traits. It is a "Hungry Void Traveler," meaning it does not require air, food, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. The "Inscrutable" ability grants it immunity to any attempt to sense its emotions or read its thoughts, and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made against it, making it exceptionally difficult for opponents to predict its actions.

For actions, the Howler can make multiattacks, using either three Claw attacks or Psychic Bolt attacks. Each Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +11 to hit, dealing an average of 15 slashing damage combined with an additional 13 psychic damage, which makes for a potent combination in close quarters. With its Psychic Bolt, it targets enemies from a distance, having a ranged spell attack bonus of +9. Upon a successful attack, it deals an average of 26 psychic damage to the target.

The Howler also possesses the "Gloaming Howl," a powerful magical ability dependent on the surrounding light. It can target creatures within a 120-foot range that can hear the howl. The affected creatures must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, or they suffer effects depending on the current light conditions. In bright light, they could be incapacitated until the end of their next turn. In dim light, they may be stunned until the end of their next turn. In complete darkness, targets drop whatever they are holding and are paralyzed with fear for one minute, though they can attempt to save against the paralysis at the end of each of their turns. This makes the Howler particularly dangerous in changing light conditions.

Finally, the "Otherworldly Hunter" ability allows the Howler to shift itself to another plane of existence, similar to the spell Plane Shift. However, it can only affect itself and cannot banish unwilling creatures. This ability enhances its role as a cunning and elusive foe.

Overall, the Howler of the Hill represents a blend of speed, psychological manipulation, and combat ferocity, making it a memorable and challenging adversary for any party of adventurers.
