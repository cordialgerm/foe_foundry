The Gullkin is a medium humanoid creature that embodies traits of both avian and aquatic life. It possesses an intriguing mix of mobility and resilience, with a challenge rating of 1/2, making it a suitable foe for low-level adventurers. The Gullkin's strengths lie in its dexterity and unique ability to fly and swim, granting it versatility in various environments. However, its weaknesses are apparent in its low armor class and hit points, making it somewhat vulnerable in prolonged combat. Notably, the Gullkin's ability to control the battlefield with its Tempest Breath can turn the tide in skirmishes, providing a distinct tactical advantage.

The Gullkin has the following attributes: Strength at 10 with a modifier of +0, indicating average physical strength; Dexterity at 16 with a +3 modifier, which is very good for agility and ranged attacks; Constitution at 13 with a +1 modifier, reflecting average endurance; Intelligence at 10 with a +0 modifier, meaning it has average intellect; Wisdom at 12 with a +1 modifier, also average; and Charisma at 8 with a -1 modifier, which is bad and suggests a lack of social finesse.

In terms of skills, the Gullkin has a perception skill score of +1, which is average, leading to a passive perception of 11—just enough to notice most stealthy intrusions. The Gullkin can communicate in Aquan and Common languages, making it versatile in conversations with various creatures.

The Gullkin possesses a special ability called "Hold Breath," allowing it to sustain itself underwater for up to 15 minutes. This adds to its adaptability in aquatic scenarios.

In combat, the Gullkin has two main actions: The first is its "Beak" attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, dealing 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. This attack is effective for close encounters, enabling the Gullkin to deal decent damage with a reliable hit chance. The second action is its "Javelin" attack, which can be executed either as a melee attack or a ranged attack with a similar +5 to hit, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. This provides flexibility in distance fighting.

The Gullkin's most notable special action is "Tempest Breath," which recharges on a short or long rest. When used, the Gullkin exhales a powerful gust of air in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area of effect must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from the Gullkin. This ability can disrupt enemy formations and provides tactical control in battles, allowing the Gullkin to create space or reposition itself and its foes during encounters.
