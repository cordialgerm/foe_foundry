The Adult Cave Dragon is a formidable creature in the Dungeons & Dragons realm, known for its immense size and formidable powers. It embodies the neutral evil alignment, making it an opportunistic threat to those who venture into its territory. With a high challenge rating of 19, it poses a significant danger to adventurers, capable of dealing substantial damage while having powerful defensive and utility abilities. Its major strengths include a high Armor Class of 18, an extraordinary pool of 270 hit points, and various resistances and immunities. However, its relatively lower Dexterity could be seen as a weakness. This dragon's ability to manipulate darkness and its unique burrowing capability makes it a cunning foe in subterranean environments.

The Adult Cave Dragon has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 27 (+8), which is exceptional and indicates immense physical power.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), which is average, reflecting some agility but not enough to evade attacks easily.
- Constitution: 25 (+7), showcasing a high resilience with a modifier that is very good.
- Intelligence: 12 (+1), indicating an average level of cunning.
- Wisdom: 14 (+2), reflecting an average perceptiveness.
- Charisma: 16 (+3), which is good, allowing it to exert influence over others.

The dragon has proficient savings throws with the following modifiers: Dexterity +7 (good), Constitution +13 (very good), Wisdom +8 (good), and Charisma +9 (good). It can also leverage skills effectively, with Perception at +14 (very good) and Stealth at +7 (good). It possesses immunity to poison damage and is also immune to being blinded and poisoned, making it a tough adversary in combat. Its sensory abilities include blindsight within 60 feet and tremorsense extending to 120 feet, significantly aiding it in detecting foes in darkness or while burrowing. The dragon understands Common, Darakhul, and Draconic languages.

The Adult Cave Dragon is equipped with several special abilities:
- Darkness Aura: It generates a magical darkness in a 30-foot radius, rendering darkvision ineffective within this area and able to dispel lower-level light spells. It can toggle this aura at the start of its turn, and dispel magic can temporarily suppress it, offering a strategic element in encounters.
- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): This enables the dragon to automatically succeed in three failed saving throws per day, making it exceptionally resilient against effects that require saving throws.
- Magical Tunneler: It can burrow through natural earth and stone, either leaving a tunnel in its wake or moving undisturbed, allowing for stealthy movement beneath the surface.
- Spiked Climb: The dragon can climb difficult surfaces without difficulty, though it cannot use its Ruff Spikes ability when in this position.

In terms of actions, the Adult Cave Dragon has multiple ways to attack:
- Multiattack: It can initiate a frightful presence action to instill fear and follow up with a Bite and two Claw attacks. 
- Bite: This attack applies a +14 to hit and deals 19 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage.
- Claw: This is another melee attack that also has a +14 to hit and inflicts 15 slashing damage.
- Tail: A powerful tail attack making contact with the same +14 to hit results in 17 bludgeoning damage.
- Frightful Presence: This ability forces creatures within 120 feet of it to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for up to 1 minute, promoting fear and potentially hindering their actions.
- Poison Breath (Recharge 5–6): A devastating cone attack with a DC 21 Constitution saving throw; failure results in 56 poison damage and poisoning status until a short rest is completed.

Finally, it has a reactive ability:
- Ruff Spikes: This reaction triggers when a creature approaches within 5 feet, forcing a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw; failing results in 9 piercing damage and prevents the creature from entering that space.

The Adult Cave Dragon can also perform legendary actions, including:
- Detect: Allowing it to make a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- Tail Attack: This permits it to make an additional Tail attack.
- Limb Sweep (Costs 2 Actions): A powerful sweep against creatures within 10 feet, requiring a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw resulting in damage and potentially knocking affected creatures prone. 

This dragon, with its combination of formidable physical prowess, resilience, and tactical abilities, makes for a challenging and exciting encounter for any adventuring party that dares to face it.
