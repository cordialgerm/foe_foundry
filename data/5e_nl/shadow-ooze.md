The Shadow Ooze is a Medium-sized ooze creature known for its ability to consume light and navigate the environment with ease. This creature is unaligned, focusing on its survival rather than any moral affiliation. With a moderate Armor Class of 8 and a noteworthy pool of Hit Points totaling 76, thanks to its robust Constitution score, it is designed for endurance in combat. Its notable strengths include immunity to acid and necrotic damage, and it possesses several useful abilities like the Aura of Darkness, which can heavily obscure its surroundings, creating a tactical advantage in battles. However, its Dexterity is quite low, making it less effective in dodging attacks, and it lacks any intelligence or charm, rendering it incapable of complex interactions. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it poses a good challenge to low-level adventurers, rewarding 700 experience points upon defeat.

The Shadow Ooze exhibits a Strength score of 16, which correlates with a good modifier of +3, allowing it to perform physical attacks effectively. Its Dexterity is a very bad -2, indicating that it is slow and clumsy, while its exceptional Constitution of 18 provides it with a +4 modifier, contributing significantly to its resilience. Intelligence is extremely low at -4, meaning it cannot engage in any sophisticated behavior. The Wisdom score is also low at 6, resulting in a bad modifier of -2, which affects its perception and insight. Finally, the Charisma reflects even lower at -4, indicating it has no social skills whatsoever.

The Shadow Ooze has a stealth skill modifier of +2, which is a good score that aids it in remaining undetected while moving in darkness. It is immune to several conditions, including being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, and prone, making it very difficult to incapacitate. Its blindsight extends 60 feet, allowing it to sense its surroundings without sight but becomes blind beyond that radius.

One of the ooze's special abilities, Amorphous, allows it to move through tight spaces with ease, enabling it to surprise creatures that may think they are safe in a confined area. The Aura of Darkness is another significant ability; it creates an area obscured by darkness, negating visibility for all but shadow fey. This can disrupt enemy tactics and create opportunities for ambushes. The Spider Climb ability permits the Shadow Ooze to navigate vertical spaces, including walking upside down, enhancing its versatility in combat situations.

In terms of actions, the Shadow Ooze can perform a Multiattack, which consists of one pseudopod strike followed by the ability Snuff Out. The Pseudopod attack has a +5 to hit and 5-foot reach, dealing a total of 20 damage upon a successful hit â€“ this includes 10 bludgeoning damage, along with 7 necrotic damage and 3 acid damage. This combination makes it a formidable attacker. 

The Snuff Out action allows the ooze to extinguish a light source within 60 feet, disrupting spells and abilities that rely on light, which can be critical during nighttime encounters or in dark environments. If the light source is a spell, it is dispelled, providing a tactical edge against spellcasters who rely on illumination. Overall, the Shadow Ooze is a dynamic creature that leverages its abilities to dominate in darkened combat scenarios.
