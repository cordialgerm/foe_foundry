The Junk Shaman is a small humanoid creature that operates within a lawful neutral framework. It has a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating it is suitable for a party of adventurers at lower levels, having a total of 42 hit points derived from 12d6. The Junk Shaman is characterized by its unique ability to create magical junk armor, significantly bolstering its defense, which can increase its Armor Class to 15. While it has relatively low strength and charisma scores, its dexterity and wisdom are above average, allowing it to be agile in combat and proficient in certain skills. Its reliance on pack tactics can make it formidable when surrounded by allies, though it does struggle in direct sunlight due to its sunlight sensitivity, which imposes disadvantages on its attacks and perception checks.

The attributes of the Junk Shaman are as follows:
- Strength: 6, resulting in a modifier of -2, which is very bad for physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 14, giving it a +2 modifier, leading to good agility and acrobatics.
- Constitution: 11, yielding a +0 modifier, considered average for durability.
- Intelligence: 11, also a +0 modifier, which is average and does not particularly enhance its spellcasting.
- Wisdom: 17, translating to a +3 modifier, which is very good for perception and saving throws, allowing it to succeed in wisdom saves often.
- Charisma: 9, resulting in a -1 modifier, making interactions that depend on charm very bad for the Junk Shaman.

In terms of saving throws, the Junk Shaman has a +4 modifier for Dexterity saves and a +5 for Wisdom saves, both of which can be classified as good. Its skills grant it darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive perception of 13, which allows it to notice hidden threats effectively. The languages it knows include Common and Draconic, enabling it to communicate with various creatures.

The Junk Shaman possesses special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in both offensive and defensive situations. Once per day, it can cast the spell Animate Objects without needing any spell components, utilizing Wisdom as the spellcasting ability. This allows it to manipulate various objects, potentially turning the battlefield to its advantage. 

Its Junk Armor ability allows it to create magical armor from discarded materials, which manifests as an Armor Class of 13 plus its Dexterity modifier. This armor also has an additional benefit: any critical hit against the Junk Shaman is treated as a normal hit. The armor remains active until it is dismissed or until the Junk Shaman dies.

Pack Tactics is another significant advantage, granting it an edge on attack rolls as long as at least one allied creature is within 5 feet of its target. This ability, paired with its other attributes, significantly improves its combat capabilities when fighting alongside allies.

However, while the Junk Shaman has many strengths, it suffers from sunlight sensitivity. When exposed to sunlight, it experiences disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight, making it vulnerable in bright conditions.

In combat actions, the Junk Shaman can use a Multiattack feature, allowing it to make two attacks with its Junk Staff. The Junk Staff is a melee weapon that has a +4 to hit, reaching a distance of 5 feet. Upon hitting, it deals 4 points of bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 points of fire damage. 

Additionally, the Junk Shaman can unleash a Flame Jet as a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit and a range of 120 feet, doing 7 points of fire damage upon a successful hit. If the target is a creature or flammable object that is not being worn or carried, it ignites and continues to take damage over time, specifically 3 points of fire damage at the start of each of its turns until extinguished. This continuous damage can alter the tactics employed by opponents, making it a strategic option in combat.
