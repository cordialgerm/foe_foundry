The Phase Spider is a formidable large monstrosity, notable for its unique abilities related to ethereal travel and web manipulation. With an Armor Class of 13, it presents a moderate challenge in combat, particularly due to its 73 hit points and the capacity to evade damage through its mobility and special traits. This creature excels in stealth, having a Stealth score of 15, which makes it effective at ambushing opponents. A Challenge Rating of 3 indicates that it is suitable for encounters with mid-level adventurers, providing both a threat and an opportunity for strategic engagement. Its notable abilities include Ethereal Sight, which allows it to perceive threats in both the Material and Ethereal Planes, and its capacity to create webs that can restrain targets, making it an effective combatant that can control the battlefield.

The Phase Spider has the following attributes: Strength of +2 (average effectiveness), Dexterity of +3 (good effectiveness), Constitution of +1 (average effectiveness), Intelligence of -2 (very bad effectiveness), Wisdom of +0 (average effectiveness), and Charisma of -2 (very bad effectiveness). It can see in darkness due to its darkvision, extends 60 feet, and has a base perception score of 10. As a creature of significant natural agility, the Phase Spider can climb difficult surfaces with ease and is resistant to the frightened condition and exhaustion.

In terms of actions, it employs multiple attack types: a Multiattack that includes a Barbed Legs attack and a Bite attack. The Barbed Legs provide a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and can deal an average of 8 piercing damage (2d4 + 3). The Bite attack has similar mechanics, also with a +5 to hit, causing 7 piercing damage (1d10 + 3), but it also introduces a poison effect where the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 13 poison damage (3d8), and if this damage drops the target to 0 hit points, it becomes stable but remains poisoned for an hour, during which it is paralyzed. The Phasing Web ranged attack, with a range of 30/60 feet, restrains its target, allowing for complex interactions with creatures on the Ethereal Plane while making it vulnerable if the webbing is attacked.

As a bonus action, the Phase Spider possesses Ethereal Jaunt, allowing it to magically shift between the Material and Ethereal Planes, providing a tactical advantage in retreats and repositioning during combat. The webbing it creates is also vulnerable to fire damage, which smart players can exploit if they discover existing weaknesses during their encounter with the creature.
