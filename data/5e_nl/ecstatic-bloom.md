The Ecstatic Bloom is a powerful Huge Celestial creature aligned with neutral good. It serves as a guardian of life and a beacon of protection against undead threats. With a high hit point total of 171, this creature is resilient, bolstered by its healing abilities and damage immunities. One of its notable strengths lies in its ability to regenerate health and bolster allied creatures, making it a significant asset in battle against evil foes. However, it is vulnerable to fire damage, which can disrupt its healing capabilities. The Ecstatic Bloom excels in support roles within a party, thanks to its various auras and cooperative abilities.

The Ecstatic Bloom's attributes show a well-rounded but not particularly physically imposing creature. It has a Strength score of 10, which is considered average and gives it a modifier of +0, indicating it does not excel in physical combat. Its Dexterity score of 9 is below average, resulting in a modifier of -1, making it clumsy and less capable of dodging attacks. The Constitution rating of 16 provides it with a good +3 modifier, contributing to its durability against spells and effects. Intellectually, it is exceptional with an Intelligence of 20 (+5), allowing it to excel in mental tasks and use a wide array of spells. The Wisdom of 19 (+4) supports its perception and insight, making it adept in detecting the true nature of creatures. Finally, with a Charisma of 14 (+2), it has some charm but isn't particularly captivating.

In combat, the Ecstatic Bloom has a few noteworthy saving throw bonuses: it has +9 for both Intelligence and Wisdom saves, which is exceptionally strong. It possesses skills in Insight and Perception, both at +9, making it very good at sensing the environment and the intentions of others. The Ecstatic Bloom has a vulnerability to fire, meaning it takes double damage from fire attacks, while it is immune to radiant damage and cannot be charmed or frightened. Its senses include truesight out to 120 feet, allowing it to perceive creatures and objects as they truly are, although it is blind beyond this radius. It can understand all languages and communicate telepathically up to 120 feet.

The Ecstatic Bloom has several special abilities that enhance its role on the battlefield. The Aura of Life activates when an undead creature comes within 30 feet, forcing it to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be turned until the end of its next turn, which can effectively neutralize threats from undead creatures. With Blessed Regrowth, at the start of its turns, it and all good-aligned creatures within 10 feet recover 4 hit points (1d8). However, if it has taken fire damage, this ability won't work on its following turn. The bloom can only be slain if it starts its turn at 0 hit points and cannot regain health from this ability. The Foster the Trees ability gives alabaster trees within 60 feet an advantage on all saving throws, reinforcing the bloom's protective nature. Its Like Calls to Like ability allows it to sense the alignment of creatures within a 120-foot range, which further emphasizes its celestial role.

In terms of actions, the Ecstatic Bloom has a Multiattack feature, allowing it to make three Gilded Beam attacks during its turn. It uses a ranged spell attack that has +9 to hit at a range of 150 feet and deals 27 radiant damage (6d8) upon a successful hit. Additionally, the bloom possesses a powerful ability called Castigate, which recharges after a short or long rest. This ability unleashes a chorus of celestial voices within a 30-foot radius, requiring affected creatures to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the end of their next turn. However, this only impacts non-good-aligned creatures possessing an Intelligence score of 5 or higher, making it a strategically beneficial ability in combating evil entities.
