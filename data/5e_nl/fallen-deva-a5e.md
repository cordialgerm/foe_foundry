The Fallen Deva is a powerful celestial being that has fallen from grace, embodying both strength and resilience. With an armor class of 17 and 153 hit points, it is well-equipped for combat, capable of taking and dealing substantial damage. This creature moves gracefully with a walking speed of 30 feet and an impressive flying speed of 90 feet, making it agile during encounters. It boasts a challenge rating of 10, indicating that it poses a significant threat to adventurers. Notably, while it possesses many strengths, such as high saving throws and resistances to damage from nonmagical weapons, it is particularly vulnerable to radiant damage. The Fallen Deva has robust characteristics, particularly in Wisdom and Charisma, both scoring +5, allowing it to excel in social interactions and resist mental influences.

The Fallen Deva has a Strength of 18, a Dexterity of 18, a Constitution of 18, an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 20. All these attributes score a modifier of +4 or +5, with Wisdom and Charisma being very good. The Deva’s saving throws in Wisdom and Charisma are +9, which is exceptionally effective in resisting psychological and magical effects. It is skilled in insight, perception, and religion, each also with a +9 bonus, making it very good in any role requiring perceptiveness or knowledge of the divine.

The Fallen Deva has vulnerabilities to radiant damage, which is a significant weakness given that it is a celestial entity. However, it resists damage from nonmagical weapons and is immune to conditions such as charm, exhaustion, and fear, enabling it to maintain a strong presence in battle without succumbing to psychological effects. Its senses include truesight, allowing it to see through illusions and concealment within 30 feet, and its passive perception is a solid 19. It can understand and communicate in all languages and possesses telepathy up to 120 feet.

In terms of special abilities, the Fallen Deva enjoys magic resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which is exceptionally beneficial in combat encounters involving other spellcasters. It has an alignment detection ability, allowing it to discern the moral stance of nearby creatures, and it can dissolve into motes of light upon death, making it harder for foes to claim its body. The Deva’s immortal nature means it does not need to eat, breathe, or sleep, which can be advantageous in long adventures.

For actions in combat, the Fallen Deva can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks during its turn. One of its primary weapon attacks is the Celestial Hammer, which has a +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. It deals 8 bludgeoning damage and an additional 17 radiant damage on a successful hit, which is good damage output. This attack also prevents the target from making opportunity attacks against the Deva until the start of the target's next turn, thus allowing for strategic movement. The Deva can also use Divine Blast, a ranged spell attack with the same +8 to hit that deals 22 radiant damage at a range of 60 feet, which is effective for keeping enemies at bay.

Additionally, the Deva possesses a powerful healing or damaging ability known as Radiant Energy, usable once per day. This ability allows the Deva to either heal a willing target for 60 hit points and remove certain ailments, or deal 60 radiant damage to an unwilling target after an attack roll, providing versatility in encounters. The Change Form ability enables the Deva to shapeshift into a beast or humanoid while retaining its statistics, keeping it unpredictable in both combat and role-playing situations. Lastly, its Consume Life Energy ability, also usable once per day, allows it to absorb temporary hit points equal to half the maximum hit points of a humanoid it has slain within the last hour, rewarding tactical play with additional durability that lasts until depleted.
