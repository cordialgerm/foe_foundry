The Peat Mammoth is a formidable creature native to swampy environments, distinguished by its massive size and plant-based nature. Serving as a potent foe for adventurers, it combines a robust defensive capability with substantial offensive power. With an Armor Class of 16 and a significant pool of 172 hit points, it is resistant to fire and necrotic damage, making it a difficult target to bring down. However, its low Dexterity results in poor agility, giving it a notable weakness against swift characters. The mammoth's unique abilities, such as igniting upon receiving fire damage and exploding upon its death, introduce a high level of tactical depth, requiring careful positioning from players. Its ability to engulf and restrain opponents further cements the Peat Mammoth as a menacing presence on the battlefield.

The Peat Mammoth has the following attributes: Strength 24 (+7), Dexterity 6 (-2), Constitution 21 (+5), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 8 (-1), and Charisma 3 (-4). Its strength score is exceptionally high, granting it powerful melee attacks, while its dexterity is very bad, leading to poor agility and movement. The Constitution score is very good, contributing to its impressive stamina. The creature possesses a Stealth skill modifier of +6, leveraging its camouflage in swampy terrains, which can be advantageous for initiating ambushes. 

The Peat Mammoth has damage resistances to fire and necrotic damage, rendering it less vulnerable to these types of attacks. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being blinded, deafened, or frightened, which helps it maintain control during combat. Its blindsight out to 120 feet allows it to effectively sense its environment, despite being blind beyond that range.

One of the Peat Mammoth's notable special abilities is "Slow Burn." When it takes fire damage, it catches fire, suffering an ongoing 5 damage at the start of its turn, but the saturation of its body extinguishes the flames at the end of its turn. Importantly, creatures engulfed by the mammoth are safe from this fiery effect. Upon death while still on fire, the Peat Mammoth explodes, dealing fire damage to nearby creatures, with a more significant effect on those engulfed, imposing disadvantage on their saving throw. 

The "Swamp Camouflage" ability grants the Peat Mammoth advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in swampy terrain, making it exceedingly difficult to detect in its natural habitat.

In terms of actions, the Peat Mammoth can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two melee attacks. Its "Slam" attack has a +11 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 20 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the mammoth is on fire, an additional 7 fire damage is inflicted upon the target. The "Engulf" action enables the mammoth to move up to its speed and enter the spaces of Large or smaller creatures. Those creatures must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, with failures resulting in being engulfed and taking substantial necrotic damage, while being restrained and unable to breathe. Engulfed creatures can attempt to escape on their turn by succeeding in a DC 17 Strength check. The mammoth can engulf up to two creatures simultaneously, adding to its threat in combat.
