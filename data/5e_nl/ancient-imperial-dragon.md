The Ancient Imperial Dragon is a gargantuan, neutral dragon known for its overwhelming power and mastery of nature. It boasts formidable physical prowess, exceptional defensive capabilities, and unique magical abilities. With an impressive Armor Class of 22 due to its natural armor, the dragon proves difficult to hit. The dragon's massive pool of hit points, totaling 546, provides it with substantial resilience in battle. Its mobility is remarkable, with a walking speed of 40 feet, swimming speed of 40 feet, and flying speed of 80 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in diverse environments. The Ancient Imperial Dragon's attributes are exceptionally high, particularly its Strength at 30, making its physical attacks devastating. It is also capable of charming opponents and has the ability to transform its appearance, providing it with versatility in combat and social interactions.

The dragon's attributes are as follows: Strength 30 with a modifier of +10 (exceptional), Dexterity 12 with a +1 modifier (average), Constitution 29 with a +9 modifier (very good), Intelligence 20 with a +5 modifier (good), Wisdom 18 with a +4 modifier (good), and Charisma 20 with a +5 modifier (good).

The Ancient Imperial Dragon possesses several powerful special abilities. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, enhancing its adaptability in various environments. It has Legendary Resistance, which enables it to succeed on a failed saving throw three times a day. With the Truespeak ability, it can communicate with any living creature, effectively bypassing language barriers. The dragon’s innate spellcasting ability is based on Charisma, with a spell save DC of 21, allowing it to cast spells without the need for material components. It can cast spells such as Control Water, Fog Cloud, Gust of Wind, and Stinking Cloud at will, providing it with various tactical options, while it can cast Cloudkill and Control Weather three times a day each and Legend Lore and Storm of Vengeance once a day each.

In terms of actions, the dragon can unleash a Multiattack, using its Mesmerizing Presence followed by making three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. Its Bite attack has a +18 to hit and deals 21 piercing damage, while each Claw attack also has a +18 to hit, dealing 17 slashing damage. The Tail attack similarly has a +18 to hit and deals 19 bludgeoning damage, making the dragon a significant threat in melee combat. The Mesmerizing Presence forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for one minute, allowing for tactical manipulation of opponents. The Lightning Breath, which recharges on a 5 or 6, deals massive damage in a 120-foot line, requiring enemies to succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 88 lightning damage, or half on a successful save.

The dragon can also use its Change Shape ability to polymorph into a humanoid or a beast of an equal or lower challenge rating. This transformation retains its alignment, hit points, and ability to communicate, allowing for stealthy infiltrations or social interactions. Additionally, the dragon can use legendary actions: it can detect its surroundings, make a tail attack, or cast a spell (costing three actions), enabling it to respond effectively even when it's not its turn. This combination of high power, adaptability, and potent abilities makes the Ancient Imperial Dragon a formidable opponent and a significant entity in any campaign.
