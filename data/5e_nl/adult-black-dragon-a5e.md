The Adult Black Dragon is a formidable and cunning creature, characterized by its enormous size and menacing presence. With a Challenge Rating of 17, it serves as a powerful adversary for high-level adventurers. The dragon possesses exceptional physical attributes, culminating in high Armor Class and extensive Hit Points, making it a challenging opponent to defeat. Its ability to utilize stealth, particularly when submerged, combined with innate magical abilities and devastating breath attacks, solidifies its role as a deadly predator both in and out of water. With weaknesses primarily related to its reliance on saving throws and the potential costs associated with its Legendary Resistance, seasoned players may find ways to exploit these traits to bring the dragon down.

The Adult Black Dragon has a high Armor Class of 19, indicating very good defensive capabilities, while its Hit Points total 253, derived from rolling 22d12 plus an additional 110, granting it exceptional durability in combat. With a movement speed of 40 feet on land, 80 feet in the air, and 40 feet when swimming, the dragon can maneuver effectively both in combat and in exploration. It has notable Strength of 22 (+6), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 20 (+5), Intelligence of 14 (+2), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 16 (+3). These attributes contribute to its combat effectiveness and interactions with other characters.

For saving throws, the dragon has a strong Dexterity modifier of +8, an exceptional Constitution modifier of +11, a good Wisdom modifier of +7, and a good Charisma modifier of +9. In terms of skills, it excels in history with a bonus of +8, has a good perception bonus of +7, and a good stealth bonus of +8—all of which enhance its capability to ambush opponents effectively. The dragon is immune to acid damage and has highly developed senses, with blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, complemented by a passive perception of 20. It can communicate in both Common and Draconic languages.

The Adult Black Dragon features several special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities. The Ambusher ability grants it advantage on Stealth checks when submerged in water, allowing it to effectively surprise enemies. Upon hitting a target that cannot see it with its bite attack, it can deal damage and grapple the creature simultaneously, which can significantly hinder opponents. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, facilitating its movement and attack strategies in diverse environments. Legendary Resistance (usable three times per day) permits the dragon to turn a failed saving throw into a success, though it incurs a minor penalty to its Armor Class if it exhausts this ability. The Ruthless trait allows it to launch an additional claw attack after scoring a critical hit in a turn, further increasing its offensive capacity.

For its actions, the Adult Black Dragon can perform a Multiattack, which consists of one bite and two claw strikes. The bite attack has a +12 to hit and, on a successful strike, deals 22 piercing damage plus an additional 4 acid damage. Alternatively, it can grapple the target instead of dealing damage, applying a DC 20 escape check to escape from the grapple. The claw attacks also have a +12 to hit, dealing 19 slashing damage. The tail attack, reaching 15 feet, also has a +12 to hit and deals 15 bludgeoning damage, while pushing the target back 10 feet. 

Its Acid Spit ability allows it to target a creature within 60 feet, forcing a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, the target suffers 22 acid damage and 5 ongoing acid damage until it uses an action to end the effect. The dragon's Acid Breath, usable once per five to six rounds, unleashes a devastating line attack, inflicting a staggering 63 acid damage upon failing a DC 19 saving throw, along with the added effect of temporary blindness on failure.

In terms of reactions, the dragon can perform a Tail Attack when a creature within 10 feet successfully hits it, allowing it to counterattack as a means of maintaining pressure in combat.

Additionally, the Adult Black Dragon can utilize three legendary actions at the end of another creature's turn. It can create a 20-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness, which prevents darkvision from penetrating it. The Roar ability allows it to frighten creatures within 120 feet, imposing a Charisma saving throw to resist, with frightened targets suffering ongoing effects until they succeed. Finally, the dragon can execute a Wing Attack that pushes creatures 10 feet away, knocking them prone and allowing the dragon to reposition itself by flying.
