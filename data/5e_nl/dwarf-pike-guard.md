The Dwarf Pike Guard is a medium humanoid creature that embodies the principles of lawful neutrality. They serve as stalwart defenders, armed with deadly pikes and an unwavering commitment to maintaining order. They possess a strong physical presence with an excellent Constitution, granting them durability in battle, while their combat capabilities shine through their attacks with a pike, making them formidable opponents. Their ability to work effectively in groups offers them enhanced defenses against ranged attacks, though they have vulnerabilities due to their limited mobility and low Dexterity.

The Dwarf Pike Guard has an Armor Class of 16, which is considered good, thanks to their chain mail armor. They have 30 hit points, averaged from rolling four eight-sided dice and adding 12, which provides them with a good amount of resilience in combat situations. With a walking speed of 25 feet, their mobility is somewhat limited but typical for their role. Their Challenge Rating stands at 1/2, indicating they are suitable for lower-level encounters, rewarding players with 100 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of their ability scores, the Dwarf Pike Guard has a Strength of 14, giving them a +2 modifier, which is rated as good for melee attacks. Their Dexterity, however, is quite low at 9, resulting in a -1 modifier, considered bad and impacting their agility. Their Constitution score of 16 translates to a +3 modifier, rated very good, enhancing their ability to withstand damage. Their Intelligence and Charisma scores are average, at 10 and 9 respectively, resulting in modifiers of 0 and -1. The Wisdom score of 13 with a +1 modifier is pretty standard and allows them slight advantages in perception.

The Dwarf Pike Guard has proficiency in the perception skill, resulting in a bonus of +1 to their passive perception score of 13. They possess damage resistance to poison and have darkvision, enabling them to see 60 feet in dim light as if it were bright light, and in total darkness as if it were dim light. They can communicate in both Common and Dwarvish, which aids interactions with other creatures.

One of their key special abilities is called "Forest of Pikes." This ability allows a Pike Guard to gain half cover against ranged attacks if they are within 5 feet of at least one other Pike Guard or a Pike Guard Captain. This significantly enhances their defensive capabilities in team scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Dwarf Pike Guard can make a melee weapon attack with their pike, which has a +4 to hit. The attack has a reach of 10 feet and deals 7 piercing damage, averaging from 1d10+2, making them a consistent threat in combat situations.

This reaction adds a strategic layer to their combat style, encouraging tactical positioning on the battlefield.
