The Arcanaphage is a Medium-sized monstrosity that dwells in the magical realms of Dungeons & Dragons, often serving as a formidable foe for adventurers seeking to harness arcane power. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it poses a significant threat due to its unique abilities centered around feeding on magical energy and countering spells. Its strengths lie in its speed and dexterity, allowing it to evade attacks and quickly close distances, as well as its powerful reactive abilities that can disrupt spellcasters. However, its low intelligence and lack of alignment make it less strategic in combat situations, relying heavily on its innate abilities to survive. The Arcanaphage's reliance on feeding to sustain itself can also be exploited by clever players who manage to keep their magical resources away from it.

The Arcanaphage possesses an Armor Class of 14 and Hit Points totaling 60, calculated from 8d8 plus 24. Its flight speed is 30 feet, and it can hover, but it cannot walk. The creature has the following ability scores: Strength is 10, Dexterity is 18, Constitution is 16, Intelligence is 2, Wisdom is 10, and Charisma is 8. Its Dexterity score results in a good modifier of +4, making it agile in combat, while its Constitution gives it a good +3 modifier, ensuring it can take a few hits before going down. The very low Intelligence and Charisma scores, both at -4 and -1 respectively, result in very bad effectiveness when it comes to mental capabilities or social interactions. The creature has a perception skill of +2, which is average.

In terms of resistances and immunities, the Arcanaphage is particularly resilient, demonstrating damage resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from magical weapons. It is immune to conditions such as blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, and prone, making it very difficult to incapacitate. It possesses blindsight within 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures without needing to see them, but beyond this range, it is effectively blind.

The Arcanaphage has several noteworthy special abilities. Its Arcane Discharge ability triggers upon its death, causing an explosion of magical energy that affects creatures within a 5-foot radius, based on its Feed score. Those who fail a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw take force damage, while those who succeed take half damage. The area remains dangerous for a minute, as creatures starting their turn within it will take additional force damage. The Hunger ability allows the Arcanaphage to regain hit points equal to twice the level of any spell it consumes during combat, increasing its Feed score by one with a maximum of 8. However, this score decreases by 1 after completing a long rest. The Ingest Magic ability requires creatures within 30 feet maintaining concentration on a spell to succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, or lose their concentration, allowing the Arcanaphage to feed on the dissipating magic. Finally, its Magic Immunity grants it complete immunity to magical damage and advantage on saving throws against other magical effects.

During combat, the Arcanaphage can take advantage of multiattack to make two tentacle strikes. The melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, delivering an average of 13 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. As a reaction, the Arcanaphage can invoke a Voracious ability in response to a spell cast nearby. This ability works like the counterspell spell but requires the Arcanaphage to make a spellcasting ability check with a +5 modifier to cancel the spell. If successful, it can subsequently feed on the defeated spell's magic, creating a cycle that makes it a challenging opponent for any spellcaster.
