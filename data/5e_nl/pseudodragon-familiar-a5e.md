The Pseudodragon is a tiny, dragon-like creature known for its role as a magical familiar. It is agile and offers significant advantages to spellcasters by enhancing their magic resistance and providing telepathic communication. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is relatively weak in direct combat, displaying only limited offensive capabilities and low hit points. Despite its size and frailty, the Pseudodragon's unique abilities, such as its telepathy and resistance to magic, make it a valuable companion in both reconnaissance and magic-related endeavors.

The Pseudodragon has an Armor Class of 13, indicating that it is not heavily armored but is reasonably maneuverable. It possesses 7 hit points, derived from rolling 2d4 and adding 2, making its durability low and its chances of staying in combat very bad. It can walk at a speed of 15 feet and fly at a speed of 60 feet, which is quite good, allowing it to navigate difficult terrain and escape danger quickly. 

Its ability scores present a mixed bag: it has a Strength of 6, which gives it a very bad modifier of -2, limiting its physical attacks. Its Dexterity is 14, providing a good +2 modifier, enhancing its initiative and ability to avoid attacks. The Constitution score is 12, yielding an average +1 modifier, which contributes to its hit points. The Intelligence and Charisma scores are average as well, both at 10 (no modifier), and Wisdom is at 12, giving it an average +1 modifier that affects skills like Perception and will saves.

In terms of skills, the Pseudodragon excels at Stealth with a +4 modifier, which is good, allowing it to remain hidden during scouting missions. It also has a Perception skill of +3, which is average, useful for spotting hidden threats. Its senses include blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, along with a passive Perception score of 16, which is exceptional and allows it to notice most threats.

The Pseudodragon understands both Common and Draconic languages but cannot speak, limiting its communication to telepathic forms. Its notable special abilities include Limited Telepathy, allowing it to convey simple ideas and emotions to creatures within 10 feet, facilitating non-verbal communication. Its Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it a resilient companion against magical threats. Additionally, as a Familiar, it can telepathically communicate with its master as long as they are within 1 mile, providing strategic advantages on the battlefield.

In terms of actions, the Pseudodragon can make a melee attack with its Sting, which has a +4 to hit (good) and a reach of 5 feet. Upon hitting, it inflicts 4 piercing damage through a roll of 1d4 + 2 and also forces the target to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails the saving throw, it becomes poisoned, which lasts for 1 hour unless expended by damage or if another creature shakes it awake. This poison effect can drastically impact the target's ability to function in combat, as a failed save means they will become unconscious.

Additionally, the Pseudodragon can use the Telepathic Static ability three times a day, targeting one creature within 10 feet and requiring a DC 11 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn, overwhelmed by a barrage of telepathic imagery, thus removing it from the fight momentarily. This ability can serve as a tactical maneuver to incapacitate enemies during critical moments.
