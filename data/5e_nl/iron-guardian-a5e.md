The Iron Guardian is a formidable large construct known for its high durability and offensive capabilities, making it a powerful asset in any combat scenario. With an impressive armor class of 20 and a substantial hit point total of 210, it can withstand considerable punishment before being defeated. The guardian excels in melee combat with its multiattack capability, allowing it to strike twice with a powerful sword attack that deals significant slashing damage. A challenge rating of 14 indicates that it poses a serious threat to adventurers, offering 11,500 experience points upon defeat. While its offensive abilities are noteworthy, the Iron Guardian's defenses are equally impressive; it is immune to fire damage and is able to regain health from such attacks, along with being resistant to many magical effects. However, its mental capabilities are significantly lacking, evidenced by its low intelligence and charisma scores, indicating that it relies purely on the commands of its creator.

The Iron Guardian has the following attributes: Strength 24 (+7), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 20 (+5), Intelligence 3 (-4), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 1 (-5). The high strength value of 24 provides the guardian with a very good attack bonus, making its melee attacks quite effective. Its dexterity is average, offering limited benefits to initiative and certain skill checks, while its constitution of 20 represents a very good ability to absorb damage. The low intelligence and charisma scores reflect its design as a construct focused on combat rather than social interaction or problem-solving.

Among the special abilities of the Iron Guardian, Fire Absorption stands out; this ability allows it to regain hit points equal to the fire damage it receives, effectively making fire attacks against it counterproductive. The Immutable Form ability makes the guardian immune to any effect that could change its form, such as polymorph spells. Additionally, its Magic Resistance provides it with an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further enhancing its defensive capabilities. Lastly, the Constructed Nature ability means that the guardian does not require air, food, or sleep, making it an unwavering combatant.

In terms of actions, the Iron Guardian can use Multiattack to make two sword attacks in a single turn. This sword attack has a +12 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, delivering an average of 29 slashing damage with a successful strike. Moreover, it has a powerful Poison Breath attack that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allowing it to exhale a 15-foot cone of poisonous gas. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 poison damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.

As a reaction, the Iron Guardian possesses the Deflection ability, which allows it to redirect a missed ranged attack against a target it can see within 60 feet. This capability not only enhances its defensive potential but also punishes attackers for their failed strikes, making it a formidable foe in ranged combat as well. Overall, the Iron Guardian is a powerful construct designed for combat, with numerous strengths that make it a difficult opponent to face.
