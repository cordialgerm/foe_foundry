Malcubus is a medium-sized fiend with a challenging presence in combat and a range of manipulative abilities that make it a cunning adversary. With an Armor Class of 14 and 78 hit points (12d8 + 24), it possesses solid defenses for its Challenge Rating of 4, allowing for moderate resilience in battle. The creature can move at a walking speed of 30 feet and is capable of flying at 60 feet, giving it agile movement both in the air and on the ground. However, while it has a good Dexterity score of 16 (providing a +3 modifier), its physical combat abilities, particularly its Strength of 10 (modifier of +0), are average, making it less effective in melee encounters. 

Malcubus shines in its high Charisma (20, +5 modifier), which greatly enhances its capability to charm and manipulate other creatures, supported by its skilled use of deception (+7), persuasion (+7), and insight (+5). It has resistance to several damage types, including cold, fire, lightning, and poison, as well as damage from nonmagical weapons, making it durable against many attacks. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 15, allowing it to effectively navigate in dark environments and be aware of subtle threats. It can communicate in multiple languages, including Abyssal, Common, and Infernal, and has the ability to communicate telepathically within 60 feet.

The Malcubus has several notable special abilities. Its "Cloaked Mind" ability allows it to resist detection by divination effects that reveal fiends or alignment, requiring it to succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. This ability is quite effective, making it difficult for enemies to discern its true nature. Additionally, its "Telepathic Bond" enables it to maintain communication over any distance with a charmed creature, even crossing planar boundaries.

When it comes to actions, the Malcubus has the "Claw" attack available in its true form, making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, inflicting 6 slashing damage and 7 necrotic damage on a hit. This combines physical and necrotic damage, offering versatility in its attack. The "Charm" action allows the Malcubus to magically charm a humanoid within 30 feet through a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, compelling the target to obey its commands. If the charm is broken due to damage or a suicidal command, the target gains immunity to this charm for 24 hours.

The "Draining Kiss" allows the Malcubus to kiss a willing or charmed creature, forcing them to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in 22 psychic damage, with the target's hit point maximum reduced by the same amount until they complete a long rest. This ability not only damages the target but also heals the Malcubus for the same amount, making it a significant threat in prolonged encounters. 

"Etherealness" gives the Malcubus the ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane, allowing it to see and hear into the Material Plane. This ability offers strategic escape options and can be utilized to phase back into the Material Plane if invited. Finally, the "Dream" ability allows the Malcubus to enter the dreams of a sleeping humanoid, which can disrupt the targetâ€™s rest and provide it with opportunities to charm the target even if they are on different planes.

For its bonus action, the Malcubus can "Shapeshift," changing its form to a Medium or Small humanoid, allowing it to blend in or escape detection while retaining its capabilities. As a reaction, it can utilize "Living Shield" to switch places with a charmed creature when attacked, redirecting damage away from itself. This ability highlights the Malcubus's reliance on manipulation and subterfuge in combat, making it a crafty and formidable foe.
