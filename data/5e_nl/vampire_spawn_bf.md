The Vampire Spawn is a Medium undead creature, embodying the classic traits of a vampire's minion but with distinct characteristics that set it apart. It has a solid Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, and a substantial pool of 91 hit points, allowing it to absorb a fair amount of damage before falling in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it serves as a formidable adversary in encounters. The Vampire Spawn possesses a diverse array of abilities that enhance its combat prowess, such as regeneration and enhanced mobility through climbing. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage and holy water, which can severely hinder its regenerative capabilities. Its stealthy nature, combined with its ability to grapple foes, makes it both a dangerous and tactical opponent.

The Vampire Spawn has the following ability scores:
- Strength: +3 (average effectiveness)
- Dexterity: +6 (very good effectiveness)
- Constitution: +3 (average effectiveness)
- Intelligence: +0 (very bad effectiveness)
- Wisdom: +3 (average effectiveness)
- Charisma: +1 (bad effectiveness)

The creature has darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. It has a perception score of 13, which gives it good awareness of its surroundings and helps it to notice hidden enemies or traps. With a stealth score of 16, it can effectively move unnoticed in shadows, making it adept at ambushing unsuspecting victims. The Vampire Spawn can only speak the languages it knew during its life, limiting its ability to communicate.

In terms of special abilities:
- Hungry Dead Nature allows it to retain certain abilities of a vampire.
- Regeneration enables the Vampire Spawn to regain 10 hit points at the beginning of its turn as long as it is not in sunlight or running water; this effect can be interrupted by radiant damage or damage from holy water.
- Resting Place, Spider Climb, and Vampire Weaknesses also mimic the traits of a true vampire, granting it additional mobility and reflecting its undead nature.
- Vampiric Resilience makes it immune to exhaustion, providing it with stamina in prolonged confrontations.

For its actions during combat:
- The Vampire Spawn can make two claw attacks with a +6 to hit, dealing 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage plus an additional 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If both claw attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, it can grapple that creature, requiring a DC 14 to escape.
- The Draining Bite attack targets willing creatures or those grappled, incapacitated, or restrained. It hits at a +6 to attack and deals similar damage: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage along with 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. Importantly, when a target is hit, its maximum hit points are reduced by the necrotic damage taken, and the Vampire Spawn heals equal to that amount.
  
As a bonus action, the Vampire Spawn can use Call Blood, which creates a connection with an injured creature within 10 feet, forcing it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails, it loses 7 (2d6) hit points, or half that on a successful save. This action also grants the Vampire Spawn advantage on its next attack roll against any creature that failed the save before its next turn, enhancing its potential to deal damage significantly. 

Overall, the Vampire Spawn combines effective physical attacks with dangerous abilities, making it a powerful foe in the right circumstances, skilled in grappling and draining the life from its opponents.
