The owlbear is a large monstrosity that presents a formidable challenge in combat with its exceptional strength and decent hit points. It serves as a fierce guardian of its territory, leveraging its powerful melee attacks and sharp senses to hunt down unsuspecting prey. With a Challenge Rating of 3, the owlbear is an appropriate foe for mid-level adventurers, possibly serving as an encounter in a wooded area or near a beast-inhabited region. While it boasts good offensive capabilities and strong physical attributes, the owlbear's poor intelligence and charisma render it less effective in social interactions and strategic thinking.

The owlbear has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average, making it somewhat challenging to hit for characters with a low to average attack bonus. With 59 hit points, calculated using 7d10+21, it can absorb a fair amount of damage before being taken down, positioning it as a resilient opponent in battle. The creature's movement speed allows it to walk at 40 feet per round and climb at 20 feet, offering versatility in navigating environments.

In terms of attributes, the owlbear showcases strong physical stats: its Strength is 18, granting a modifier of +4, which provides great effectiveness in physical attacks. The Dexterity score of 12 corresponds to a +1 modifier, which is considered average for avoiding attacks and maneuvers. Its Constitution score of 16 yields a +3 modifier, reflecting good durability. However, the owlbear's Intelligence (3) and Charisma (5) are exceptionally low, resulting in very bad effectiveness in roles that require these attributes. The Wisdom score of 12 translates to a +1 modifier, which is considered average at best.

The owlbear is skilled in perception and stealth, with values of +3 in both areas. Additionally, it possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, as well as a passive Perception score of 13.

One of the owlbear's notable special abilities is Keen Sight and Smell, which provides it with advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight or smell. This gives the creature an exceptional capacity to detect threats and prey, making it an efficient hunter.

In combat, the owlbear can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to deliver both a beak and claw attack in a single turn. The Beak attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. When successful, it deals 9 piercing damage, calculated as 1d10 + 4. The Claws attack is similarly executed, also with a +6 to hit, dealing a significant 13 slashing damage, calculated as 2d8 + 4. Both attacks highlight the owlbear's capability to inflict substantial damage, posing a significant threat during encounters.
