The Ogre Flesh Heap is a large undead creature that represents a reanimated hulk, formed from the remains of an ogre. It stands out as a formidable opponent in combat due to its strong physical attributes, high hit points, and immunity to various damage types. With its challenge rating of 4, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. The creature excels in melee encounters, being capable of delivering powerful attacks while also possessing hardiness attributed to its undead nature. However, it is limited by its low Dexterity and Intelligence scores, making it fairly sluggish and not very cunning. Notably, the Ogre Flesh Heap can endure lethal blows thanks to its Undead Fortitude ability, which allows it to cheat death, making it a resilient foe that needs to be dispatched with radiant damage or critical hits to prevent it from recovering.

In terms of attributes, the Ogre Flesh Heap has the following values: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 6 (-2), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 3 (-4), Wisdom 8 (-1), and Charisma 4 (-3). Its strength is exceptionally high, making it very effective in physical confrontations. Dexterity is very bad, resulting in poor initiative and low armor class. Constitution is also very good, providing significant hit points. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all very bad, indicating a lack of mental capability and social presence.

The creature has several useful abilities and actions. It is immune to poison damage and is not affected by fatigue or being poisoned. Its darkvision allows it to see in low-light conditions up to 60 feet, and it has a low passive perception score of 8, making it somewhat unaware of its surroundings. Although it understands the Giant language, it cannot communicate verbally.

One of its primary special abilities is **Undead Fortitude**, which allows it to remain standing when it would otherwise be reduced to 0 hit points, as long as the damage is not radiant or a critical hit. Instead, it drops to 1 hit point, falls prone, and becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, allowing it a brief moment to potentially retaliate in combat. 

The Ogre Flesh Heap's actions include a melee attack named **Greatclub**, which has a +6 to hit and can deal an average damage of 13 bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone. Another action, **Sweeping Strike**, deals an average 8 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within a 5-foot radius, pushing affected Medium or smaller creatures back if they fail a DC 14 Strength saving throw. 

The **Grab** action allows the Ogre Flesh Heap to wrestle a Medium or smaller creature, dealing 11 bludgeoning damage while grappling it, thereby preventing the creature from escaping unless it succeeds on a DC 14 check. Additionally, if it has a creature grappled, it can use its **Bite** attack, which deals significant piercing damage with an average of 15, allowing the flesh heap to regain hit points equal to the damage dealt.

In terms of reactions, it can use **Bodyblock** when grappling a creature to add 2 to its AC against an incoming attack; if the attack misses due to this effect, it strikes the grappled creature instead. Additionally, the **Corpulent Expulsion** ability allows it to unleash a cone of caustic gore when it takes damage. Creatures in the 30-foot cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, potentially taking substantial acid damage, while the flesh heap suffers from some damage as well from this explosive ability.

Overall, the Ogre Flesh Heap is a stubborn adversary that can inflict considerable damage while sustaining a lot of punishment, especially if left unchecked in combat. Its reliance on physical prowess and its unique undead characteristics make it a threatening presence in any battle scenario.
