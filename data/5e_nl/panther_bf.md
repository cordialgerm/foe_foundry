The panther has special abilities that enhance its hunting capabilities. Its "Heightened Smell" allows it to perceive its surroundings with a Perception score of 19 when relying on its sense of smell, providing substantial advantages in tracking or detecting hidden creatures. The "Pounce" ability allows the panther to knock a target prone if it successfully hits with a claw attack after moving at least 20 feet straight towards it; the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or fall prone. If the target is prone, the panther gains the opportunity to make an additional bite attack as a bonus action, making it a formidable opponent in close quarters when utilized correctly.

In terms of actions, the panther has two primary attacks. The "Bite" attack is a melee weapon attack that adds a +4 modifier to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 5 piercing damage on a successful hit, calculated as 1d6 plus 2 from its Strength modifier. The "Claw" attack also uses a +4 to hit, with the same reach, dealing 4 slashing damage, calculated as 1d4 plus 2 from its Strength modifier.

During combat, the panther can also use its bonus action to engage in stealth with the "Stealthy Hunter" ability, allowing it to take the Hide action. This ability enhances its role as an ambush predator, making it both a challenging and thrilling opponent for characters.
