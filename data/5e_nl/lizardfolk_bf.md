The Lizardfolk is a medium humanoid creature characterized by its reptilian features and adaptability to various environments. It has a challenge rating of 1/2, making it a relatively simple opponent, but it possesses notable strengths like a good Armor Class of 15, allowing it to endure some damage in combat. With 22 hit points, it stands at a moderate resilience level. This creature is particularly agile in water, capable of swimming at a speed of 30 feet and climbing with a speed of 15 feet, which gives it an edge in aquatic and rugged terrains. However, its intelligence is low, which may limit its effectiveness in complex problem-solving and social interactions. The Lizardfolk showcases strong perception capabilities, especially when using smell or taste, which can be beneficial in tracking or detecting hidden foes. 

Lizardfolk have the following attributes: Strength is +2 (good), Dexterity is +0 (average), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is -2 (bad), Wisdom is +3 (very good), and Charisma is -2 (bad). Their perception ability score allows them a passive perception of 13, making them somewhat aware of their surroundings. In stealth, they can manage a score of 14, which can aid in sneaky pursuits or ambushes. They primarily communicate using the Draconic language, which might limit interactions with non-Draconic speakers.

One of the Lizardfolk's special abilities is "Heightened Smell and Taste," which enhances their perception to an exceptional level of 18 when relying on these senses. Additionally, they can "Hold Breath" for up to 15 minutes, enabling them to engage in underwater situations effectively without the need to surface for air.

In terms of actions, the Lizardfolk utilizes "Multiattack," allowing them to make either one Bite attack and one Heavy Club attack, or two attacks with Javelins. The "Bite" is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and deals 5 points of piercing damage with a successful hit. The "Heavy Club" also has a +4 to hit and deals the same amount of damage as the Bite. Alternatively, the "Javelin" can be thrown or used in melee, also yielding 5 points of piercing damage with the same attack bonus.

As a reaction, the Lizardfolk can perform a "Shoving Counter." If an attacker misses their strike and the Lizardfolk is equipped with a shield, the creature can shove its shield back against the attacker. The attacker must then succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be pushed back up to 10 feet and knocked prone.

Overall, the Lizardfolk's combination of physical resilience, mobility in water, and potent perception makes it a unique creature, although it suffers from low intelligence and charisma.
