Speed is a key strength, with a movement rate of 50 feet, enabling it to close distances quickly or reposition as necessary. The Centaur has exceptional strength and wisdom, which enhances its combat effectiveness and situational awareness, although its intelligence is relatively low. Notable qualities include resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, which can be particularly advantageous in tougher encounters.

The Centaur's ability scores are as follows: its Strength is +4, indicating very good physical capability for melee attacks; Dexterity is +2, which is average and helps in some evasive maneuvers; Constitution is +2, offering good durability; Intelligence is -1, indicating a lack of knowledge; Wisdom is +3, providing good insight and perception; and Charisma is +0, showing an average presence in social situations.

The Centaur has several special abilities. The Monstrosity Resilience allows it to resist effects that cause exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it tougher in prolonged battles. The Trampling Charge ability lets the Centaur knock a creature prone with a successful Pike attack after charging, and if the target falls, it can follow up with a Hooves attack as a bonus action, which is a powerful combination for dealing damage.

In terms of actions, the Centaur can execute a Multiattack, which allows it to either perform one Hooves attack and one Pike attack, or three Longbow attacks in a single turn. The Hooves attack has a +6 to hit and deals 11 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. The Pike, with the same +6 to hit but a reach of 10 feet, deals 9 piercing damage. Additionally, the Centaur can attack from a distance using a Longbow, which has a +4 to hit and delivers 6 piercing damage at ranges up to 150 feet effectively.

As a reaction, the Centaur can use the Defensive Kick ability. This allows it to retaliate when attacked within a 5-foot range. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or pushed away up to 5 feet, showcasing the Centaur's ability to control space in combat while defending itself.

Overall, the Centaur is a robust and agile creature with a mix of melee and ranged attacks, special abilities, and clever defensive tactics that make it a reliable contender in various gameplay scenarios.
