The Grimlock Technical is a Medium humanoid that serves as a cunning and stealthy combatant, often found in rocky terrains where it employs its camouflage to gain the upper hand. With a modest challenge rating of 1/2, the Grimlock is designed to be an ambush predator, utilizing its keen senses and stealth skills to surprise opponents. Its strengths lie in its versatility in combat, able to deal bludgeoning and lightning damage with its melee attacks while also engaging at range with its sling and silenced blunderbuss. However, it has relatively low hit points and weak charisma, making it less effective in social situations and more susceptible to being overpowered by stronger foes.

The Grimlock has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 14 (+2), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 8 (-1). The creature's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores indicate a good physicality, making it capable in melee combat. The attributes suggest an average overall performance in traditional combat roles, with specific skills like athletics and stealth receiving a good modifier of +4, making it very capable in physical endeavors. Its Intelligence is average, allowing for reasonable engineering skills, while its poor Charisma score could result in very bad interactions in social encounters.

The Grimlock possesses several special abilities that enhance its stealthy nature. Its Camouflage ability grants it advantage on Stealth checks made to hide within rocky environments, increasing its effectiveness in ambush situations. Keen Hearing and Smell allows the Grimlock to utilize its senses to gain advantage on Perception checks that rely on either hearing or smell, making it very adept at detecting hidden foes or navigating its surroundings.

In terms of combat actions, the Grimlock has several noteworthy options:
- The Lightning Stick allows for a melee weapon attack with a +4 bonus to hit, reaching a range of 5 feet, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage and an additional 3 (1d6) lightning damage, making it an effective option for mixed damage output.
- Throttle is another melee option that also has a +4 bonus to hit and the potential to grapple its target (escape DC 12). The attack deals 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage while restricting the target’s breathing until the grapple is broken, allowing the Grimlock to focus its attacks solely on the grappled creature with advantage.
- The Sling is a ranged attack option with the same +4 to hit bonus, dealing 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage, effective for keeping foes at bay.
- The Silenced Blunderbuss is a stronger ranged option, capable of dealing 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage, but requires reloading after each use, represented by a quiet pop that can be heard from a short distance away.
- The Smoke Bomb, usable three times a day, can heavily obscure an area within a 30-foot radius for 1 minute, greatly enhancing the Grimlock's tactical options by creating a cloud of cover for ambush or retreat.

Overall, the Grimlock Technical is a clever combatant that excels in stealth and subterfuge, using its abilities to control the battlefield and deal damage while relying on its advantageous skills to outmaneuver foes.
