The Bucca is a Tiny fey creature characterized by its mischievous and treacherous nature. As a neutral evil entity, it thrives in environments where it can play tricks and outwit unsuspecting foes. With a decent Armor Class of 14 due to natural armor and 27 hit points, it can withstand some damage before being taken down. The Bucca excels in stealth and deception, with exceptional Dexterity and Charisma scores, making it a formidable opponent in combat and a cunning manipulator in social interactions. However, its reliance on stealth and elusiveness can be hindered when exposed to sunlight, which poses a significant weakness.

The Bucca's attributes are as follows: Strength is average at 10, providing no modifier to physical attacks. Dexterity is high at 16, giving it a good +3 modifier, enhancing its ability to dodge attacks as well as its performance in stealth and sleight of hand. Constitution is also good at 17, granting a +3 modifier that enhances its durability. Intelligence at 13 gives it an average +1 modifier, allowing for some tactics and problem-solving skills. Wisdom is low at 9, indicating a bad -1 modifier that may impact its perception of danger. Finally, Charisma is high at 16, providing a good +3 modifier that improves interaction roles, particularly for deception and persuasion.

The Bucca possesses several special abilities that enhance its agility and cunning. The Flyby ability allows the Bucca to fly out of reach without provoking opportunity attacks, making it hard to hit when escaping. The Sunlight Hypersensitivity is a notable weakness; when exposed to sunlight, it suffers 1 radiant damage per minute and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, which can significantly reduce its effectiveness in daylight. Its Treasure Sense ability serves as a unique skill, enabling it to detect precious metals and gems within 60 feet, making it adept at locating valuables.

In combat, the Bucca can use its Dagger, which allows for melee or ranged attacks with a +5 bonus to hit. At close range, it has a reach of 5 feet; at range, it can strike from up to 60 feet away. If it successfully hits with the dagger, it deals an average of 5 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid becoming poisoned for 1 minute. This poison effect can incapacitate enemies, as it hampers their abilities while they try to resist the effect each turn.

The Bucca also has the ability to cast Invisibility, allowing it to magically become invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends. This ability increases its survivability, allowing it to escape or reposition itself in combat while remaining a threat.

Overall, the Bucca is a clever and elusive adversary that relies on trickery and stealth, making it a unique challenge for adventurers who encounter it.
