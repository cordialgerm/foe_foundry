The Phase Spider is a formidable Large Monstrosity with unique abilities that allow it to traverse both the Material and Ethereal Planes, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 14 and hit points totaling 39, it can sustain considerable damage before being incapacitated. Its strengths lie primarily in its mobility and stealth, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting victims. While it has decent physical and dexterous attributes, its intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores are quite low, suggesting a creature more driven by instinct than strategic thought. The Phase Spider's challenge rating of 3 reflects its moderate difficulty, rewarding players with 700 experience points upon defeat.

The creature's physical attributes are as follows: Strength is at 14, providing a good modifier of +2, allowing it to reasonably succeed in strength-based checks. Dexterity is also 14, indicating a good modifier of +2 as well, contributing to its stealth and agility in combat scenarios. Constitution is at 12, with a +1 modifier, granting it average resilience. Intelligence is notably low at 6, with a -2 modifier, resulting in very bad performance in intelligence checks. Wisdom sits at 10, providing an average performance, while Charisma is at 4, leading to a very bad capability in social interactions and checks.

Regarding skills, the Phase Spider has a stealth bonus of +4, which is very good, making it adept at remaining hidden and performing ambush attacks. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and its passive Perception is a standard 10, meaning it may notice threats but lacks exceptional awareness. This creature has no spoken language interactions.

The Phase Spider has several notable special abilities. Its Ethereal Sight allows it to perceive both the Material and Ethereal Planes simultaneously, offering strategic advantages in combat by letting it see and target foes in both realms. The Spider Climb ability enables it to scale difficult surfaces and even ceilings with ease, making it a versatile threat in vertical environments. Additionally, with Web Walker, it can move freely without any hindrance from webs, making it immune to certain battlefield traps.

In terms of actions, the Phase Spider's primary offensive move is its Bite attack. This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting significant damage of 9 points on a successful hit. The target must also make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, with a failure leading to an additional 14 points of poison damage (which is exceptional damage). If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the creature becomes stable but remains poisoned for an hour, during which time it is paralyzed, even if it regains hit points.

As a bonus action, the Phase Spider can perform Ethereal Jaunt, allowing it to magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane or vice versa. This not only enhances its escape and repositioning capabilities during combat but can also lead to unexpected tactical maneuvers against its foes.
