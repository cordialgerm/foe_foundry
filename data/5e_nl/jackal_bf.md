The jackal is a small beast known for its keen senses and pack mentality, making it an opportunistic hunter and scavenger. These creatures possess a speed of 40 feet, allowing them to maneuver quickly in their environment. With an Armor Class of 11 and only 8 hit points, jackals are relatively frail and can be easily taken down in combat. However, their Challenge Rating of 0 indicates they are not a significant threat to higher-level adventurers. What makes jackals noteworthy is their special abilities that enhance their effectiveness in a group setting, primarily through heightened perception and advantageous attack rolls when in proximity to allies.

In terms of attributes, the jackal has a Strength score of -1 (very bad), Dexterity of +1 (average), and Constitution of +0 (average). Their Intelligence score is -4 (very bad), indicating that jackals are not particularly cunning or capable of complex thought. However, they possess a Wisdom score of +1 (average), which contributes to their perceptive capabilities, making their Perception score notably high at 13. They also have a Stealth score of 11, which is average for a creature of their kind, allowing them to sneak around effectively when necessary.

The jackal's special abilities include Heightened Hearing and Smell, which boosts its Perception to an exceptional level of 18 for detecting sounds and scents. This trait allows the jackal to be highly aware of its surroundings and to locate prey or threats more effectively. Another ability is Pack Tactics, which grants the jackal an advantage on attack rolls against a creature if an ally is close by, enhancing its combat effectiveness when hunting alongside other members of its pack.

The jackal can use a melee attack called Bite, which has a +3 to hit (good) and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 3 piercing damage (1d4 + 1). Additionally, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a debilitating disease known as shriveling fever. This disease causes significant damage by poisoning the afflicted creature and can reduce its Strength score over time unless cured, creating a tactical concern in combat. If a creature's Strength is reduced to 0 due to this disease, it will die. The infected creature can potentially recover from the disease by succeeding on two saving throws, making it a dangerous adversary despite the jackal's relatively low threat level.
