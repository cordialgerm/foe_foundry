The Stuhac is a medium-sized fiend known for its neutral evil alignment and formidable combat capabilities. With a challenge rating of 13, this creature presents a significant threat to adventurers, boasting a high armor class of 18 due to its natural armor, along with 209 hit points derived from 22d8 plus an additional 110. One of its notable strengths lies in its impressive attributes, particularly its strength and constitution, which are exceptional at +6 and +5 respectively, making it a formidable opponent in direct combat. The Stuhac is also versatile, with strong dexterity and wisdom scores, allowing for decent agility and perception. However, it is vulnerable to magical attacks that deal nonmagical bludgeoning or piercing damage, as it has resistances to various elemental damage types. Its intelligence and charisma are less noteworthy, suggesting it may not excel in magical abilities beyond its specific traits.

The Stuhac has strong saving throw proficiencies, with very good bonuses across strength (+11), dexterity (+9), constitution (+10), and charisma (+7). It possesses a good skill in deception, making it skilled at manipulation and trickery. The creature has a number of immunities, including to cold, poison, and the poisoned condition, granting it resilience against several effects that could hinder other beings. Its darkvision extends to 60 feet, and it can communicate through various languages, including Abyssal, Common, and Infernal, as well as a telepathic range of 120 feet, allowing it to interact with other creatures effectively.

Among its special abilities, the Stuhac's Mountain Walk allows it to traverse rocky surfaces without difficulty. This ability means it can navigate difficult terrain with ease, giving it an edge in rocky environments. The Standing Leap ability further enhances its mobility, enabling long and high jumps, making it a flexible adversary in various terrains.

In terms of actions, the Stuhac can execute a Multiattack that includes the unique Hobble action, a bite attack, and two claw attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon strike with a +11 to hit, dealing 20 piercing damage on a successful hit. The claw attacks are even more devastating with a +11 to hit as well, causing 28 slashing damage per successful strike. The Hobble action allows the Stuhac to telekinetically impair an opponent within 60 feet, imposing a challenging DC 18 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails, it incurs 13 force damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet, potentially incapacitating agile characters. This effect lasts until the target completes a long rest or receives restorative magic. Lastly, the Illusory Appearance ability grants the Stuhac the power to disguise itself as another creature of similar size and shape, providing it with tactical advantages in stealth or deception.

Overall, the Stuhac's blend of physical prowess, tactical ability, and magical deception make it a significant threat in any combat scenario, capable of manipulating the battlefield to its advantage while dealing substantial damage to any foes it encounters.
