The Haakjir is a medium-sized monstrosity characterized by its unique combination of earth manipulation and lethal claw attacks. It is a neutral creature that excels in tactical combat situations, especially when working alongside allies, thanks to its Pack Tactics ability. With a respectable Armor Class of 15, the Haakjir can endure moderate damage, and its solid hit point pool of 52 allows it to withstand encounters sufficiently. Although its intelligence and charisma scores are notably low, which can hinder social interactions or complex problem-solving, its physical attributes are strong, facilitating effective melee attacks and agility in combat. It is particularly adept at navigating diverse terrains, given its climbing and burrowing capabilities, giving it an advantage in encounters that might take place in rocky or uneven environments.

The Haakjir has the following attributes: Strength at 17, which is very good, gives it significant melee damage; Dexterity at 16 is also very good, allowing it good agility and maneuverability; Constitution at 15 is good, providing decent hit points; Intelligence at 5 is very bad, indicating a lack of mental prowess; Wisdom at 10 is average, suggesting a basic level of awareness; and Charisma at 8 is bad, indicating difficulty in social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Haakjir has a passive Perception of 14, which is average, and it has no proficiency in related checks. It has damage resistances to acid, piercing, and slashing, making it resilient against various types of attacks. The creature has darkvision within 120 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and tremorsense within 30 feet, enabling it to detect vibrations on the ground, which can be crucial during combat or ambush situations.

The Haakjir has several special abilities. Earth Climb allows it to traverse difficult earth or stone surfaces and even climb upside down on ceilings with a successful ability check, enhancing its mobility. Earth Glide permits it to burrow through nonmagical unworked earth or stone without disturbing the surrounding material, enabling stealthy approach or escape. Its Earthen Claws make its attacks particularly deadly against opponents in metal armor or wielding metal shields, as these attacks ignore the armor's effectiveness. Pack Tactics grants the Haakjir advantage on attacks against a creature if one or more of its allies are within 5 feet of the target, enhancing its combat effectiveness significantly. Lastly, Stone Camouflage enables the Haakjir to hide more effectively in rocky environments, providing it with an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

For its actions, the Haakjir can perform a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack followed by two Claw attacks. The Bite is a melee weapon attack with a +5 modifier to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 10 piercing damage on a hit. The two Claw attacks also have a +5 modifier to hit and can deal 8 slashing damage each. This combination of actions makes the Haakjir a formidable foe in combat, especially when combined with its tactical abilities.
