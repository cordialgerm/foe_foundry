It boasts good Dexterity and Constitution, enhancing its ability to evade attacks and withstand damage. Its saving throws include Dexterity at +6 and Wisdom at +5, both of which are very good.

The special abilities of the Lakescourge Lotus include:

- **Toxic Ichor**: This ability allows the Lakescourge Lotus to taint the water around it when submerged. Any creature entering the area for the first time or starting its turn within 10 ft. of the Lotus must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for as long as they remain in the area and for one minute after leaving. This ability adds a layer of strategy, forcing players to consider their movement carefully around the Lotus. If a creature is poisoned, it can attempt to save against the effect at the end of its turns if it is no longer in the affected water.
  
- **Undead Nature**: The Lakescourge Lotus does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain persistent during fights without the need for rest or sustenance.

- **Waterwalker**: This ability lets the Lakescourge Lotus walk across water as if it were solid ground, enhancing its mobility in aquatic environments. It offers practical zoning control during combat.

In terms of actions, the Lakescourge Lotus can utilize the following:

- **Multiattack**: This allows it to make either two Tainted Claw or Poisonous Water Jet attacks in one turn.

- **Tainted Claw**: This is a melee attack with +6 to hit, targeting one creature within 5 ft. It deals 6 slashing damage plus an additional 9 poison damage (averaging about 15 damage total) on a hit. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one minute, with the option to re-save at the end of their turns.

- **Poisonous Water Jet**: This ranged attack has a +5 to hit and can reach targets up to 60 ft. away, dealing 15 poison damage (averaging 15 damage total) on a hit.

- **Enter Reflection**: This ability allows the Lakescourge Lotus to touch a body of water and transform into a reflection on the surface. While in this form, it gains immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks and resistance to these damage types from magical sources. However, while a reflection, its movement is limited to 5 ft., and it cannot use its Tainted Claw attack. It can revert to its true form as a bonus action or if it takes damage from other types of attacks.

Overall, the Lakescourge Lotus is a deadly aquatic foe that excels in area control and debilitation, creating a unique challenge for players to navigate both combat and environmental hazards.
