The Boneshard Wraith is a formidable Medium Undead creature with a neutral evil alignment, lurking in the shadows and striking dread into the hearts of adventurers. It boasts a strong armor class of 16 due to its natural armor and has a considerable pool of hit points totaling 127, which gives it a good chance to withstand a fair amount of damage during encounters. The wraith's ability to hover, walk, and fly at impressive speeds makes it highly mobile, allowing it to evade attacks and position itself strategically in combat. Its Challenge Rating of 12 indicates it is a dangerous foe, likely requiring a well-prepared party to defeat it. Notably, the Boneshard Wraith has a variety of skills and resistances, making it a tough opponent especially in environments where it can utilize its mobility and incorporeal nature effectively.

In terms of attributes, the Boneshard Wraith has a Strength of 16, giving it a good modifier of +3, which results in average effectiveness for physical tasks. It has a Dexterity of 13 (+1 modifier), which provides average capabilities for agility-based tasks and initiative rolls. With a high Constitution of 18 (+4 modifier), the wraith enjoys very good resilience against effects that require saving throws, making it hard to incapacitate. The Intelligence score of 13 (+1) suggests average capability for mental tasks, while the Wisdom score of 14 (+2) allows for good perception checks. However, its Charisma of 8 (-1 modifier) indicates its interactions through charm or persuasion are very bad, fitting for a creature of its nature.

The wraith has several beneficial skills including a +6 in Perception, allowing it to effectively notice hidden creatures or objects, and a +7 in Stealth, improving its ability to avoid detection. It is immune to necrotic and poison damage, while also possessing significant resistances against various elemental damage types and nonmagical physical attacks that aren't made with silvered weapons. Additionally, it is immune to many conditions that could hinder its combat performance, such as being paralyzed or frightened, showcasing its unnerving nature as an undead.

The Boneshard Wraith has two notable special abilities. With Incorporeal Movement, it can pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, allowing for strategic advantages in combat. However, it risks taking force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. The wraith is also affected by Sunlight Sensitivity, suffering disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when in bright light, which can be a significant weakness for it in illuminated environments.

In combat, the Boneshard Wraith can take multiple actions. Through its Multiattack ability, it can make two spectral claw attacks against a single target. If both attacks hit, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for a minute, creating an opportunity for further attacks from the wraith or allies. Each Spectral Claw attack itself is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, having a reach of 15 feet and dealing 21 slashing damage on a hit. Furthermore, the attack forces the target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid gaining 1 level of exhaustion, potentially debilitating an opponent over successive hits since a creature can suffer a maximum of 2 levels of exhaustion from this ability.

The Boneshard Cyclone is its most powerful action, which it can use after recharging on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability targets a creature within 60 feet, requiring a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers considerable damage—20 slashing and 27 necrotic—and becomes enveloped in a cyclone of sharp bone fragments for 1 minute. While enveloped, the creature is blinded and deafened, suffering additional necrotic damage every turn it remains trapped. It can attempt to escape on subsequent turns by repeating the saving throw. Notably, if a creature dies while enveloped, it rises as a Boneshard Wraith on the next new moon unless specific resurrection methods are applied, adding a layer of danger for parties facing this undying menace.
