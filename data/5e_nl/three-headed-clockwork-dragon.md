The Three-Headed Clockwork Dragon is a formidable construct, classified as a Huge size creature with a Challenge Rating of 14, which means it poses a significant threat to adventurers. It boasts an impressive Armor Class of 18, backed by 275 hit points, offering resilience in combat. This dragon is not just durable; it is also capable of flight, reaching speeds of 60 feet and walking at 40 feet. Its attributes highlight its strengths: a Strength score of 25 grants it a +12 bonus to Strength saving throws and the ability to excel in athletic contests, while a Constitution score of 23 gives it a +11 bonus to Constitution saving throws. However, it has a very low Charisma score of 1, resulting in a -5 modifier, making it ineffective in social interactions that require charm or persuasion. The dragon is immune to several types of damage, including poison and psychic, and it's also conditioned to resist being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. 

The Three-Headed Clockwork Dragon possesses several unique special abilities. The first, **Bound**, allows it to be connected to three circlets worn by individuals within one mile. This connection enables telepathic communication between the dragon and the circlet-wearers, effectively allowing them to see and hear through the dragon's senses, although at a cost. If there are not enough circlet-wearers within range, it can lead to exhaustion for those wearing them, or it may even turn hostile against any creatures it perceives. It also has **Immutable Form**, making it immune to spell effects that alter its form, and **Magic Resistance**, giving it advantage on saving throws against spells, enhancing its durability against magical attacks. Furthermore, as a **Siege Monster**, it deals double damage to objects and structures, showcasing its devastating potential in combat.

In terms of actions, the dragon employs a **Multiattack**, which allows it to take several offensive actions in one turn. It can attack with its powerful **Bite**, making a melee weapon attack with a +12 to hit and dealing 18 piercing damage plus an additional 3 fire damage on a hit. It also has a **Fist** attack, which deals 14 bludgeoning damage, also with a +12 to hit. The dragon is capable of unleashing a devastating **Fire Breath** attack, available after recharging on a roll of 6. This attack encompasses three 60-foot cones of fire, dealing up to 45 fire damage to creatures caught in the area unless they succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. 

Moreover, the **Oil Spray** ability allows the dragon to spray oil in a 30-foot cone that makes creatures vulnerable to fire damage until the end of the dragon's next turn if they fail a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Lastly, with its **Tail Sweep**, the dragon can swing its bladed tail in a 15-foot radius, forcing creatures to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, dealing slashing damage and potentially knocking them prone. 

Overall, the Three-Headed Clockwork Dragon presents a blend of physical might and strategic abilities, making it a challenging opponent that requires careful planning and coordination to overcome in a D&D encounter.
