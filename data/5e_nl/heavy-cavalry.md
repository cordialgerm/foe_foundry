The Heavy Cavalry is a formidable Medium Humanoid that embodies the disciplined and relentless nature of lawful neutral warriors. With a robust Armor Class of 19 thanks to splint armor and a shield, this creature is well-protected in combat. It possesses a solid pool of 75 hit points, derived from 10d8 + 30, allowing it to sustain considerable damage before falling. The Heavy Cavalry has a walking speed of 30 feet and presents a challenge rating of 2, making it accessible for parties seeking moderate threats. Notably, it excels in both offensive and defensive aspects with a combination of melee and ranged attacks, as well as special abilities that enhance its mobility and combat effectiveness.

The attributes of the Heavy Cavalry include a Strength score of 15, which provides a +2 modifier, making it good at physical attacks and grappling. Dexterity is at 12, yielding an average +1 modifier, adequate for dodging but not remarkable. The Constitution of 17 gives it a +3 modifier, resulting in very good durability, while Intelligence remains average at 10, indicating no particular aptitude in mental challenges. Wisdom at 14 provides a +2 modifier, indicating good insight and perception capabilities, although it is hampered by a low Charisma score of 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, which reflects poor social skills.

In terms of skills, the Heavy Cavalry presents an athletics bonus of +4, showcasing significant physical prowess. It has damage resistance against fire, allowing it to mitigate those types of attacks, and possesses a passive perception of 12, which results in average awareness of hidden threats. The languages it understands include Common and Draconic.

The Heavy Cavalry has several noteworthy special abilities. The Cavalry Charge allows it to move at least 20 feet straight toward a target while mounted and then make a trample attack as a bonus action if it successfully strikes the target with a lance. The Locked Saddle ability ensures that the dragonborn cannot be knocked prone, dismounted, or forcibly moved while mounted. As a Mounted Warrior, it is typically seen with a giant lizard that it rides, which also has specialized armor increasing its Armor Class to 15. While mounted, this lizard cannot be charmed or frightened, providing additional tactical advantages.

In combat, the Heavy Cavalry can use its Lance for a melee weapon attack, rolling +4 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 8 piercing damage on a successful hit. For ranged options, it can employ a Heavy Crossbow, with a +3 to hit and a range of 100 feet. A successful shot deals 6 piercing damage. The Trample ability, usable only while mounted, allows for a +4 melee attack that can deal 9 bludgeoning damage while also posing a risk of knocking the target prone unless they succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Lastly, it can unleash a Fire Breath attack, which recharges after a short or long rest. This ability produces a 15-foot cone of fire, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid 10 fire damage or take half on a success.
