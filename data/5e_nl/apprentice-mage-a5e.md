The Apprentice Mage is a Medium humanoid creature representing a novice spellcaster who has begun their journey into the arcane arts. With a challenge rating of 1/2, this creature is designed to be an entry-level adversary for adventurers, providing a moderate challenge due to its spellcasting capabilities rather than physical prowess. The Apprentice Mage has decent hit points for a lower-tier enemy but possesses minimal armor to defend against attacks. Its reliance on spellcasting allows it to deal damage from a distance and provide utility spells but leaves it vulnerable if engaged in melee combat. While not particularly strong in physical attributes, the Apprentice Mage excels in Intelligence-based skills, enhancing its magical effectiveness.

The Apprentice Mage has the following attributes: Strength 10 (0 modifier, which is average), Dexterity 10 (0 modifier, also average), Constitution 12 (+1 modifier, considered average), Intelligence 14 (+2 modifier, good), Wisdom 10 (0 modifier, average), and Charisma 10 (0 modifier, average). Its primary focus on Intelligence indicates that it is skilled in arcane knowledge, reflected by its skills in Arcana and History, both with a +4 modifier, which is good. The creature can perceive its surroundings at a passive level of 10, which is average, and can communicate in one language of its choice.

As a 2nd level spellcaster, the Apprentice Mage employs its spells effectively, utilizing Intelligence as its spellcasting ability. This translates to a spell save DC of 12 for the spells it casts, and it has a +4 to hit with its spell attacks, which is considered good. The spells available to the Apprentice Mage include cantrips such as Fire Bolt, Light, and Prestidigitation, allowing for continual magical options without the expenditure of spell slots. At 1st level, it has three spell slots available for spells like Detect Magic, Magic Missile, and Shield.

In combat, the Apprentice Mage’s actions include making melee or ranged attacks with a dagger, which has a +2 to hit, reaching 5 feet or having a range of 20/60 feet, and dealing 2 (1d4) piercing damage, which is minimal. 

Fire Bolt is a ranged spell attack that requires an action to cast and allows the Apprentice Mage to target a single creature within 120 feet with +4 to hit and can deal 5 (1d10) fire damage, which is good damage output for a low-level enemy. Magic Missile is a first-level spell that automatically hits and can target up to three creatures within 120 feet, dealing 3 (1d4 + 1) force damage to each target, making it a very reliable damage-dealing option.

The Apprentice Mage also has a reaction ability called Shield, which can be activated when it is hit by an attack or targeted by Magic Missile. This ability grants the mage a +5 bonus to Armor Class until the start of its next turn, including against the triggering attack, while also providing immunity to the effects of Magic Missile. This defensive measure can significantly enhance its survivability in combat, making it a more formidable opponent for a brief period.

Additionally, the Apprentice Mage can represent various characters, such as a student at a wizard college or an older hedge wizard with limited magical abilities, adding versatility to its use in campaigns.
