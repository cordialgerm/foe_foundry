The Attercroppe is a tiny fey creature embodying chaotic evil, known for its cunning and its malicious control over water sources. It has an imposing Armor Class of 14, which provides it with decent defensive capabilities for its challenge rating of 1/2. With 21 hit points, it can withstand a few blows in combat. The Attercroppe excels in Dexterity, boasting a +4 modifier, which allows it to move quickly and stealthily while supporting its abilities to evade attacks and capitalize on surprise. Its strengths are enhanced by its ability to poison water, become invisible, and use innate spellcasting, making it a formidable adversary in aquatic environments. However, its physical strength is poor, with a -1 modifier, and it has limited hit points, making it vulnerable if caught off guard. 

The creature has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 8 (very bad)
- Dexterity: 18 (exceptional)
- Constitution: 12 (average)
- Intelligence: 11 (average)
- Wisdom: 13 (average)
- Charisma: 15 (good)

In terms of saving throws, the Attercroppe has a +6 modifier to Dexterity saves, which is considered very good. It is skilled in several areas with an acrobatics skill of +6 (very good), a perception skill of +5 (good), and a stealth skill of +6 (very good). It is immune to poison damage and cannot be poisoned, granting it significant resilience against various attacks. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 15, making it highly perceptive in low-light conditions. The Attercroppe can communicate in Aquan, Common, and Sylvan languages, enhancing its capacity for interaction and deception. 

The Attercroppe possesses several notable abilities:
- **Poisonous Aura:** This ability allows the Attercroppe to contaminate surrounding water. Each hour it spends fully immersed in water, it can poison up to 10 gallons. Any creature drinking this poisoned water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage while also being poisoned for 1 hour, which can significantly hinder their actions.
- **Water Invisibility:** While fully submerged in water, the Attercroppe becomes invisible, providing an excellent tactical advantage. However, attacking will cause it to become visible until the start of its next turn. It can also suppress this invisibility as a bonus action, allowing it to remain hidden when desired.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The Attercroppe has Charisma as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12). It can cast the following spells:
  - At will: **Poison Spray**, a ranged attack that deals poison damage to a single target.
  - 3 times per day each: **Create or Destroy Water**, which can be used strategically to manipulate the battlefield, and **Fog Cloud**, creating obscured areas for escape or ambush.
  - 1 time per day each: **Misty Step**, allowing it to teleport a short distance, and **Suggestion**, which can control a creature's actions within a conversation context, adding a layer of manipulation.

In combat, the Attercroppe can make a Bite attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage. This attack aligns with its tactics, combining stealth and poison to create a challenging opponent in skirmishes near water bodies.
