The Aniwye is a formidable large monstrosity with an alignment leaning towards neutral evil. This creature possesses a blend of physical strength and cunning adaptability, making it a versatile opponent in combat. With an armor class of 15, it boasts notable resilience due to its natural armor, and it can withstand a fair amount of damage, having a total of 102 hit points. The Aniwye can traverse different terrains effectively, with a walking speed of 40 feet and a climbing speed of 20 feet. It is rated with a challenge level of 5, indicating that it presents a significant challenge for adventurers, garnering a reward of 1,800 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the Aniwye's ability to shapeshift between a skunk-like monstrosity and larger forms, such as an ogre or hill giant, allows it to adapt its strategy during encounters, although it has lower intelligence than most creatures. 

The Aniwye possesses a strong Strength score of 19, translating to a +4 modifier, making it very good in physical confrontations. It also has a Dexterity of 14 (+2), which is good for agility, and a Constitution of 16 (+3), signifying its decent stamina. Its Intelligence is notably low at 8 (-1), categorized as bad, indicating limited cognitive abilities. With a Wisdom of 14 (+2), it's perceptive, allowing for good awareness of its surroundings, and with a Charisma score of 9 (-1), it is somewhat less persuasive in social interactions.

In terms of skills, it has a perception modifier of +6, demonstrating strong observational skills, and a stealth modifier of +6, thus excelling at moving unseen. It can see in darkness up to 60 feet with darkvision, and its passive perception score is 16, which is good for detecting hidden enemies. It can communicate using both Common and Giant languages.

The Aniwye has special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Shapechanger ability allows it to transform into either a Large ogre or a Huge hill giant, or revert back to its original form. Importantly, when it takes on a new form, it retains the same statistical bonuses except for size, and only the skunk form retains the ability to burrow and climb adeptly. The Unstable Form ability provides a strategic advantage; if it sustains 30 or more points of damage on a single turn while in a larger form, it can immediately revert to its skunk form.

In combat scenarios, the Aniwye can unleash multiple attacks. In its ogre or giant forms, it can perform a Multiattack, making two slam attacks, while in skunk form, it can launch three attacks consisting of one bite and two claw strikes. Its slam attack has a +7 to hit and deals 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, which is effective but not overwhelming. The bite attack similarly has a +7 to hit and inflicts 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, while each claw attack also rolls with a +7 to hit, dealing 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.

When in giant form, the Aniwye can use a ranged attack with rocks, boasting a +7 to hit, reaching up to 60 feet, and dealing 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage, which can be particularly devastating. 

In its skunk form, the Aniwye can unleash a deadly musk with the Deadly Musk ability, which takes 5-6 rounds to recharge. This area effect attack covers a 15-foot cone and requires affected creatures to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail suffer 24 (7d6) poison damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn, while successful saves reduce the damage to half and negate the stun effect. This ability adds an additional layer of risk in encounters, emphasizing the Aniwye’s capacity to influence the battlefield significantly.
