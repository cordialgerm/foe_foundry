The Roc Juvenile is a massive beast known for its formidable presence and aerial prowess, making it a dangerous foe in any confrontation. With an Armor Class of 14 and a substantial Hit Points total of 147, it can absorb a good amount of damage before going down. Its challenge rating of 8 indicates that it poses a significant threat, especially to characters who are not adequately prepared. The Roc has exceptionally high Strength, allowing for devastating attacks, alongside a good Constitution for durability. While its Intelligence and Charisma are quite low, rendering it less effective in social interactions or strategic decision-making, its Keen Sight ability and substantial flying speed (100 feet) make it an agile combatant in the air, hunting down prey or engaging enemies from above.

The Roc Juvenile has the following attributes: Strength of 22, providing a very good modifier of +6; Dexterity of 12, resulting in an average modifier of +1; Constitution of 18, giving a very good modifier of +4; Intelligence of 3, yielding a very bad modifier of -4; Wisdom of 12 with a good modifier of +1; and a Charisma of 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1. For Saving Throws, it has +7 in Constitution, which is very good, and +4 in Wisdom, which is good. It also has a perception skill bonus of +4, giving it a passive Perception of 14, allowing it to detect threats effectively.

The special ability, Keen Sight, indicates that the Roc has advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight, making it adept at locating both foes and prey from afar. 

In terms of actions, the Roc can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to strike once with its beak and once with its talons in a single turn or to drop a grappled creature. The Beak attack has a +9 to hit, reaches out to 10 feet, and deals an average of 16 piercing damage (rolling 3d6 plus 6). The Talons attack also has a +9 to hit, reaches 5 feet, and deals the same average damage of 16 slashing damage; it also grapples the target with an escape DC of 17, restraining the creature until the grapple is released. While grappled, the target cannot escape the Roc's clutches, allowing it to deal further damage by continuing to use its Talons on the same target.

As a reaction, the Roc can utilize its Retributive Strike ability when struck by a melee weapon attack. In this scenario, it is allowed to make a beak attack against the attacking creature, providing it with an opportunity to retaliate immediately. This ability underscores the Roc's potential in combat, as it can dish out punishment even while taking hits from opponents.
