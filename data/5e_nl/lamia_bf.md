The Lamia is a large monstrosity known for its cunning and enchanting abilities. It has a Challenge Rating of 4, indicating that it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers. With a robust pool of hit points totaling 95 and decent armor class at 13 due to natural armor, the Lamia is capable of sustaining damage while dishing out powerful attacks. It possesses a mixture of physical and magical prowess, including spellcasting abilities that can manipulate opponents and create illusions. The Lamia is particularly effective in terrain such as sand, mud, or rock, allowing it to move efficiently without leaving traces. However, it can be vulnerable to direct attacks and might lack the physical robustness compared to some heavier combatants. 

The Lamia has the following attributes: Strength at +3 (good), Dexterity at +1 (average), Constitution at +2 (average), Intelligence at +2 (average), Wisdom at +2 (average), and Charisma at +5 (exceptional). Its Charisma is particularly notable, enhancing its spellcasting effectiveness and social interactions. The Lamia has darkvision extending to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a Perception score of 12, which allows it to notice hidden creatures or objects reasonably well. With a Stealth score of 13, it can move unnoticed in suitable environments. The Lamia speaks Abyssal and Common, making it able to communicate with a variety of creatures.

Among the Lamia's special abilities, "Badlands Strider" allows it to traverse difficult terrains like sand or mud without impediment and without leaving tracks. Its "Monstrosity Resilience" grants it resistance against exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it more durable in protracted engagements.

In combat, the Lamia employs a "Multiattack" action, allowing it to make two Hooves attacks and one Dagger attack, or three Arcane Bolt attacks. This versatility grants it a mixture of melee and ranged combat options. The Hooves attacks are particularly powerful, dealing 14 (2d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage, whereas the Dagger is less damaging but can be used both at close range and from a distance, dealing 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. The Arcane Bolt allows for ranged spell attacks dealing 12 (2d8 + 3) force damage, and utilizing Spellcasting grants even more options.

The Lamia's spellcasting is based on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 13. It can cast minor illusion and silent image at will, both powerful for creating distractions or concealment. It can cast charm and command three times a day each, manipulating the behaviors of others, while major image can create substantial visual illusions. Once a day, it can cast compulsion, potentially forcing a target to act against their will.

In addition to its main actions, the Lamia can use a bonus action for "Intoxicating Gaze." This ability allows it to charm a target within 30 feet if they fail a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. The charmed target becomes cursed for one hour, suffering disadvantage on Wisdom saves and ability checks, adding a strong strategic element in manipulating foes during combat.
