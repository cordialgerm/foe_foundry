The Shoreline Scrapper is a large, unaligned beast that thrives in coastal environments. With a solid armor class of 16 due to its natural armor and a respectable pool of hit points totaling 93, this creature presents a formidable challenge. It has a challenge rating of 4, making it a suitable adversary for mid-level adventurers seeking a robust encounter. The scrapper is designed to excel in both melee and control—utilizing its magnetic shell to hinder enemies and immobilize them while delivering strong claw attacks. While its physical attributes are commendable, its intelligence and charisma values are very low, indicating that it lacks any major capabilities in terms of strategy or social interaction.

The Shoreline Scrapper has the following attributes:
- Strength: 16 (+3) - This value indicates good physical power, making it effective in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1) - An average score, allowing for some agility but no real advantage in avoidance.
- Constitution: 16 (+3) - This value represents a very good resilience, contributing to its considerable hit points.
- Intelligence: 3 (-4) - A very bad score, indicating the scrapper has poor problem-solving skills and limited understanding.
- Wisdom: 11 (+0) - An average score indicating it has basic awareness.
- Charisma: 5 (-3) - Very bad, reflecting its inability to influence or engage with other creatures effectively.

The creature has a saving throw bonus of +5 for Constitution, which is good, indicating its ability to maintain durability against effects that could reduce its health. It possesses a survival skill with a modifier of +2, which is average for survival in its natural habitat. The Shoreline Scrapper has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a passive perception of 10, providing an average awareness of its surroundings. 

The scrapper has several noteworthy special abilities:
- **Amphibious** allows it to breathe both air and water, making it highly versatile in aquatic and terrestrial environments.
- **Magnetic Shell** activates at the beginning of each of its turns, forcing creatures within 5 feet to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw. If they fail, their metal items stick to the scrapper’s shell, and any creature made of metal or wearing metal armor becomes restrained. A creature can attempt to remove itself or an item by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. Notably, items made of gold and silver are unaffected by this ability.
- **Metal Sense** enables the scrapper to identify the location of metal objects within a range of 60 feet, which is valuable for locating potential threats or treasures.

In combat, the Shoreline Scrapper can utilize the following actions:
- **Multiattack** allows it to make two claw attacks in one turn, enhancing its offensive capabilities.
- **Claw** is a melee attack that utilizes a +5 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing an average of 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage upon a successful hit.
- **Magnetic Pulse (Recharge 5-6)** unleashes a powerful magnetic surge, impacting all creatures within 25 feet. Creatures that fail their save are pulled toward the scrapper, adhering to its magnetic shell and becoming restrained, amplifying the scrapper's control over the battlefield.

As a reaction, the Shoreline Scrapper can use **Shell Protection** which allows it to add 4 to its AC against one incoming melee attack, providing an exceptional defensive boost. While it is retracted into its shell, the scrapper cannot move or attack but can emerge as a bonus action, allowing it to balance between defense and offense effectively. Overall, the Shoreline Scrapper is a strong and strategic opponent in combat, leveraging its unique magnetic abilities to create chaos for those unprepared for its control tactics.
