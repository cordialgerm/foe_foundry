The Vættir is a Medium-sized undead creature with a lawful evil alignment, known for its tricky and deceptive behaviors. It possesses a solid Armor Class of 15, making it reasonably difficult to hit, and has a total of 97 hit points, which allows it to withstand considerable damage in combat. The Vættir is particularly effective at both melee and ranged attacks, utilizing a combination of physical weapon strikes and necrotic energy. Its strengths lie in its high Strength score of 20, giving it an exceptional melee attack modifier of +7, while its decent Dexterity and Constitution scores enhance its defenses and survivability. However, the Vættir has a weakness to sunlight, suffering from disadvantages while exposed to it. Its notable special abilities, such as Grave Goods Sense and Rejuvenation, allow it to track its belongings and return to a new body, presenting further challenges for adventurers confronting this creature.

The Vættir has the following attributes:
- Strength of 20 (+5), which is exceptional and grants a strong advantage in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity of 14 (+2), which is good for its defensive rolls.
- Constitution of 16 (+3), providing a robust health pool and solid saving throws.
- Intelligence of 10 (+0), average and not particularly useful in its strategies.
- Wisdom of 12 (+1), allowing for basic awareness but not exceptional insight.
- Charisma of 14 (+2), which is good and aids its ability to manipulate or influence others.

In terms of saving throws, the Vættir is adept with Dexterity, providing an additional +4 modifier, which is good, and has a +3 to Wisdom, which is adequate. It is immune to necrotic and poison damage, showcasing its undead nature, and is also immune to conditions like charm, fright, and poison. The Vættir has truesight within 30 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, enhancing its perceptive abilities, and it can communicate in the languages it knew while alive.

The Vættir's special abilities include:
- Grave Goods Sense, allowing it to locate personal items within 60 feet, which can aid in reconnaissance or ambush setups.
- Rejuvenation, enabling it to reform a new body within 24 hours unless put to rest, making it a persistent threat unless dealt with effectively.
- Sunlight Sensitivity, which gives it disadvantage on attack and perception rolls while in sunlight, presenting a tactical opening for adventurers who can utilize daylight.
- Undead Nature, meaning it does not require typical biological needs, making it tireless in pursuit or battle.

In combat, the Vættir can perform multiattack actions where it first uses its Disorienting Gaze ability, and then follows up with two attacks from either its Vættir’s Greataxe or Necrotic Bolt. The Vættir’s Greataxe attack has a +7 to hit and deals slashing damage of 11 (1d12 + 5) along with an additional 4 (1d8) necrotic damage, making it a significant melee threat. The ranged attack, Necrotic Bolt, allows it to strike from a distance, requiring a +4 to hit and dealing 15 (3d8 + 2) necrotic damage.

The Disorienting Gaze ability locks the target in a sight contest, which requires a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If the target fails, they become incapacitated for one minute, moving randomly, which can cause chaos in combat situations. Targets that succeed their saving throw or shake off the effect become immune to it for 24 hours. Additionally, the Vættir can unleash a Corpse Breath attack (recharge 5–6) that encompasses a 15-foot cone, forcing creatures to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, creatures take 21 (6d6) poison damage and become poisoned for one minute, while a successful save halts the poisoning and deals half the damage.

In summary, confronting a Vættir demands strategic planning, particularly in dealing with its rejuvenation abilities and situational weaknesses to sunlight. Its combination of melee and necrotic attacks allows for versatility in battles, while its disruptive gaze can turn the tide of combat in its favor.
