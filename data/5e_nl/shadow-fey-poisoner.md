The Shadow Fey Poisoner is a cunning and elusive creature classified as a Medium humanoid of neutral alignment. With a Challenge Rating of 11, it serves as a formidable opponent in combat, boasting a robust Armor Class of 16 due to its studded leather armor and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 112. The Poisoner's strengths lie in its agility, dexterity, and stealth capabilities, making it exceptionally difficult to detect and defend against. However, it has a weakness in sunlight, where its effectiveness is significantly diminished due to its sunlight sensitivity. Its combination of deadly sneak attacks and poison-inflicting abilities makes it a dangerous foe and a master of deceit in combat situations.

The Shadow Fey Poisoner possesses the following attributes: Strength 11 (average), Dexterity 18 (very good), Constitution 16 (good), Intelligence 13 (average), Wisdom 11 (average), and Charisma 14 (good). It has specific saving throw bonuses of +8 for Dexterity (very good), +5 for Intelligence (good), and +6 for Charisma (good). The creature's skills include acrobatics +8 (very good), deception +6 (good), perception +4 (average), persuasion +6 (good), and stealth +12 (exceptional). It is immune to poison damage and conditions. With darkvision extending to 120 feet, it can see in complete darkness as if it were dim light, with a passive Perception of 14, indicating a good awareness of its surroundings. The Shadow Fey Poisoner is fluent in Common and Elvish.

Among its special abilities, the Shadow Fey Poisoner has the potential to deliver devastating attacks right from the start of a combat encounter. Under its Assassinate ability, it gains advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted, ensuring that any successful hits against surprised targets are critical hits. It can blend into the shadows effectively with Born of Shadows, making it invisible in dim light or darkness to evade detection. The Evasion ability enhances its survivability by allowing it to avoid damage from area effects more effectively. Born with Fey Ancestry, the Poisoner can resist charm effects and remains immune to magical sleep, demonstrating its resilience against such tactics. The Shadow Traveler ability allows it to teleport between shadows as a bonus action, providing exceptional mobility in combat. 

The Poisoner's Sneak Attack ability enables it to deal an additional 21 (6d6) damage under specific conditions, notably when it has advantage on its attack or when its target is near an ally, significantly amplifying its threat level. However, while in sunlight, it suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, causing it to have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom checks reliant on sight. This creates a critical strategic element during encounters involving light sources. Finally, the Traveler in Darkness ability grants it advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to shadow magic or shadow roads, emphasizing its intrinsic connection to the shadow realm.

In terms of actions in combat, the Shadow Fey Poisoner can perform a Multiattack, making either two shortsword attacks or two longbow attacks. Its Shortsword attack has a +8 to hit and can deal 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid taking 28 (8d6) poison damage; failing this results in taking full damage. The Longbow attack, also at +8 to hit with a range of 150/600 feet, deals 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage with the same Constitution save dealing poison damage as described for the shortsword. This dual threat of piercing and poison damage ensures the Shadow Fey Poisoner remains a lethal opponent capable of inflicting significant harm from a distance or up close.
