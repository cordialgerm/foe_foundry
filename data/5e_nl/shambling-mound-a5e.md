The Shambling Mound is a large plant creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat. It possesses a robust physical presence, making it a challenge at a challenge rating of 6, which translates to a worth of 2,300 experience points for defeating it. With an armor class of 15 and an impressive 123 hit points, this creature can endure significant damage while being able to deal harm in return. The Shambling Mound excels in grappling opponents and can absorb lightning damage, turning what would be harmful to it into healing. However, it suffers from weaknesses to certain types of damage, particularly that which is not resisted by its immunities. Its low Dexterity hampers its agility, making it predictable in movement.

The Shambling Mound has the following attributes: 
- Strength of 18, which results in a modifier of +4, indicating it has exceptional physical prowess. 
- Dexterity of 10, resulting in a modifier of +0, meaning its agility is average. 
- Constitution of 18, granting it a +4 modifier, signifying very good resilience and health. 
- Intelligence of 6, which translates to a -2 modifier, indicating a very bad ability to process complex thoughts or tactics. 
- Wisdom of 12 corresponds to a +1 modifier, showing an average perception of its surroundings. 
- Charisma of 6, with a -2 modifier, reflecting a very bad capability to influence others.

The Shambling Mound has characteristics that enhance its survivability and stealth; it has proficiency in stealth with a +3 modifier, which is good for surprising opponents. It has damage immunities to lightning, making it completely unaffected by that type of damage. Furthermore, it has resistances to cold, fire, and piercing damage, which allows it to mitigate a portion of those damage types. It is immune to the blinded, deafened, and fatigue conditions, meaning it can act without hindrance from these states. With blindsight extending 60 feet and a passive perception of 11, it can navigate without needing sight, although it is blind beyond that range.

One notable special ability is Lightning Absorption. When the Shambling Mound is subjected to lightning damage, instead of taking damage, it regains hit points equal to the amount of lightning damage it would have received. This makes it particularly dangerous if opponents rely on lightning-based attacks.

In combat, the Shambling Mound can use its Multiattack action to make two slam attacks against a target. The slam attack is made with a +7 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. If both attacks successfully hit a Medium or smaller creature, that creature becomes grappled with an escape DC of 15. Following this, the Shambling Mound can use its Engulf ability.

The Slam attack deals an average of 13 bludgeoning damage on a hit, with damage calculated as 2d8 plus 4. 

The Engulf ability allows the Shambling Mound to consume a grappled Medium or smaller creature, blinding, restraining, and preventing it from breathing. While engulfed, the creature moves with the Shambling Mound and takes additional bludgeoning damage at the start of the Mound's turns, averaging 11 damage, calculated as 2d6 plus 4. This combination of attacks and abilities makes the Shambling Mound a formidable force on the battlefield.
