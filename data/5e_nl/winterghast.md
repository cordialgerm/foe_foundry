The Winterghast is a sinister undead creature with a chaotic evil alignment, known for its ability to inflict debilitating cold and necrotic damage on its foes. With a medium size and a challenge rating of 4, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, particularly due to its ability to spread disease and cause paralysis. The Winterghast's strengths lie in its decent armor class of 13 and a robust hit point total of 78, providing it with durability in combat. However, its vulnerability to fire and lower Charisma make it susceptible to certain tactics. Notably, its abilities can create long-term complications for affected characters, making it a strategic encounter for players.

The Winterghast has the following ability scores: Strength is 16 with a modifier of +3, which is good for melee attacks; Dexterity is 17 with a +3 modifier, representing good agility and stealth capabilities; Constitution is 15 with a +2 modifier, providing an average level of durability; Intelligence is 10 with no modifier, indicating an average mental capacity; Wisdom is 13 with a +1 modifier, reflecting average perception; and Charisma is 9 with a -1 modifier, which is bad. The monster is skilled in stealth with a +5 modifier, which is very good, allowing it to move unnoticed in many situations. It has vulnerabilities to fire damage, which can be exploited in combat, and is immune to cold and poison damage, as well as being resistant to necrotic damage. Importantly, it is also immune to conditions like being charmed, exhausted, or poisoned, making it a formidable foe in combat scenarios.

The Winterghast possesses a special ability called Creeping Cold. When a creature is bitten and fails a saving throw, it contracts a disease that causes it to suffer cold and necrotic damage at the end of each long rest while also risking exhaustion. This is a powerful ability allowing the Winterghast to potentially eliminate foes or weaken them significantly over time. The disease can ultimately lead to death if the target's hit point maximum is reduced to zero, at which point the victim would rise as a new Winterghast in a matter of hours unless cured by magical means.

Another special ability is Known as Hidden Stench. When the Winterghast takes fire damage, it releases a toxic stench; creatures within a 20-foot radius must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of their next turn. This area effect can disrupt enemy plans and force opponents to cope with the consequences of positioning near the Winterghastâ€™s vulnerable state.

In terms of combat actions, the Winterghast can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make either one bite attack and one claw attack or two claw attacks in a single turn. The bite attack has a +5 attack modifier and deals 7 piercing damage along with an additional 4 cold damage, and can infect humanoids with Creeping Cold if they fail a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The claw attack also has a +5 attack modifier but deals 10 slashing damage. Additionally, it can inflict paralysis on non-undead creatures that fail a DC 13 saving throw, causing them to be incapacitated for a minute unless they succeed on subsequent saving throws at the end of their turns.

Overall, the Winterghast is a formidable challenge for adventurers, employing a combination of disease, paralysis, and damaging attacks to create a chaotic and dangerous encounter.
