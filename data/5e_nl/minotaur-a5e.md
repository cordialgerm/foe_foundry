The minotaur is a large monstrosity known for its immense strength and ferocity in battle. With a challenge rating of 4 and 76 hit points, it presents a substantial threat to players. Its notable physical prowess is reflected in its strong statistics, boasting an impressive Strength of 18, which translates to a +4 modifier, and a Constitution of 16, granting a +3 modifier. While its Dexterity and other mental stats are average, it compensates with exceptional combat abilities and a special power that allows it to recall any path it has taken, making it a formidable opponent in labyrinthine settings. The minotaur's primary weakness is its average Dexterity, making it less evasive in combat, and its reliance on melee attacks means it can be outmaneuvered at range.

The minotaur has an Armor Class of 14, which is fairly good and requires a moderate degree of attack roll success to hit effectively. Its action options include a Greataxe attack, which allows it to deliver significant slashing damage of 17 (2d12 + 4) per hit. It has a good chance to make this attack with advantage, giving it a better opportunity to land hits while putting itself at risk of being targeted in return. The minotaur also possesses a Gore attack, dealing 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, plus additional damage and the potential to knock targets prone if it charges before the assault, forcing a Strength saving throw. This can disrupt enemy formations and capitalize on their vulnerability if they fail to resist.

The special ability "Labyrinthine Recall" ensures that the minotaur never gets lost or confused within the labyrinthic environments it is often found in, providing strategic advantages in situations where navigation is critical. In a combat scenario where it successfully reduces an enemy to 0 hit points, the minotaur can use its bonus action "Roar of Triumph" to gain temporary hit points, enhancing its survivability in extended encounters.

In summary, the minotaur is a powerful melee combatant with strong physical and tactical abilities, making it a dangerous adversary, particularly in confined or complex terrain.
