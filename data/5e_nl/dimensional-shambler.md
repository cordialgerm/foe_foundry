The Dimensional Shambler is a large aberration embodying a neutral evil alignment. It serves as a formidable foe, capable of inflicting psychological terror and significant physical harm. The creature boasts high hit points and strong physical attributes that make it a compelling opponent in combat. Its exceptional Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence scores allow it to deal substantial damage while maintaining excellent evasive maneuvers. However, the Dimensional Shambler does have some weaknesses, such as a vulnerability to magical attacks which can bypass its resistances. Notably, it possesses abilities that manipulate space and the minds of its adversaries, making it a unique threat in any encounter.

The Dimensional Shambler has an Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, a good value that provides solid protection against many attacks. It has 102 hit points, which is quite good, allowing it to withstand a considerable amount of damage before being defeated. Its speed allows it to walk 30 feet per turn, giving it average mobility on the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it presents a serious challenge, granting 5,000 experience points to those who manage to defeat it.

In terms of attributes, the Dimensional Shambler has a Strength of 22, giving it a very good modifier of +6, which enhances its physical attacks. Its Dexterity is 21, with a +5 modifier, making it agile and difficult to hit. The Constitution score of 17 provides a good +3 modifier, supporting its durability. It has an Intelligence score of 21 with a +5 modifier, indicating a keen mind, useful for spellcasting and strategic thinking. Wisdom sits at 16 (+3), while its Charisma is 13 (+1), which are both average values.

The creature's saving throws reflect its capabilities: it has a +9 in Dexterity and Intelligence, +7 in Constitution and Wisdom, indicating very good to good proficiency against various threats. The Dimensional Shambler also has impressive skills: an arcana skill of +9, athletics +10, stealth +9, and perception +7, allowing it to excel at both combat and subterfuge.

The Dimensional Shambler has immunities and resistances that heighten its survivability; it is immune to poison damage, and resistant to acid, cold, fire, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It is also immune to exhaustion, fear, and poison conditions, further solidifying its role as a challenging adversary. It senses darkvision with a range of 60 feet and has a passive perception score of 17, making it aware of its surroundings. The languages it can communicate in include Abyssal, Infernal, and Void Speech.

Special abilities of the Dimensional Shambler include "Look Between," which allows it to see into the Lower Planes while on the Material Plane for a short duration as a bonus action. During this time, it loses its own senses on its current plane, making it strategically unique. The "Maddening Form" ability lets it instill fear in creatures that can see it when they begin their turn nearby. Those affected must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid becoming frightened, which affects their ability to act and concentrate on spells. 

Additionally, it has the "Step Between" ability that enables it to shift between the Material Plane and any Lower Plane without bringing others along, allowing it a means of escape or repositioning in combat.

For its actions, the Dimensional Shambler can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two claw attacks. When both attacks connect with the same target, the target becomes grappled, with an escape DC of 16. Each claw attack has a +10 to hit and deals an average of 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage. Its "Drag Through" ability is particularly dangerous; it can move through dimensions with a grappled target, causing the target to take psychic damage based on a Wisdom saving throw.

Through its psychological manipulation, potent melee attacks, and interdimensional capabilities, the Dimensional Shambler stands as a dangerous and unsettling opponent that can challenge even the most prepared adventurers.
