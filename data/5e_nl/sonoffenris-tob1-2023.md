Its keen senses, including truesight and tremorsense, enhance its ability to detect foes, with a passive perception of 14. The Son speaks Common, Celestial, and Giant, and possesses telepathy up to 60 feet, allowing it to communicate without words.

The Son of Fenris has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. With Keen Hearing and Smell, it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on these senses, giving it very good awareness of its surroundings. Its Divine Weapons ability makes all its weapon attacks magical and allows it to deal an extra 3d6 necrotic or radiant damage, depending on its choice, which significantly boosts its damage output.

In terms of actions, the Son of Fenris can perform a Multiattack, making one Bite attack and two Slam attacks, or four Divine Bolt attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +12 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 19 piercing damage plus an additional 10 necrotic or radiant damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, taking 21 acid damage on the Son's subsequent turns while having total cover from outside effects. The Slam attack, with the same +12 to hit and reach, deals 13 bludgeoning damage alongside 10 necrotic or radiant damage.

This attack emits poison in two 30-foot-long lines, requiring creatures within to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. Failing the save results in a hefty 45 poison damage, while succeeding halves that damage. If the lines intersect, affected creatures must save with disadvantage, making this ability particularly dangerous in crowded combat situations.
