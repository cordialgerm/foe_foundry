The War Horse Skeleton is a formidable large undead creature, serving as an eerie mount or guard. It boasts a reasonably strong armor class of 13, bolstered by scraps of barding, and possesses 25 hit points, making it a resilient adversary in combat. With a speed of 60 feet, it can swiftly maneuver on the battlefield. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/2, indicating that it poses a moderate threat to lower-level adventurers. Its ability scores display a solid Strength of +4, allowing for powerful melee attacks, while its Dexterity of +1 contributes to its agility. However, it has poor mental attributes with Intelligence being -4 and Charisma at -3, reflecting its limited cognitive capabilities. Notably, the War Horse Skeleton is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, enhancing its durability during encounters.

The War Horse Skeleton possesses several special abilities that come into play during gameplay. Its "False Appearance" allows it to blend in as an inanimate object when motionless and prone, providing it with a stealthy advantage. The "Undead Nature" ability signifies that this creature does not require sustenance or rest, making it a low-maintenance ally or foe. "Undead Resilience" further fortifies it against certain risks, granting immunity to poison damage and the exhaustion condition, which could otherwise limit its effectiveness in prolonged engagements.

In terms of actions, the War Horse Skeleton has the "Hooves" attack that enables it to deliver a melee weapon strike with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, this attack inflicts 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, making it a dangerous contender in close combat. Additionally, it has a bonus action called "Counterattack" which can be used after being struck by a melee attack while within 5 feet of an enemy. This recharge ability allows the skeleton to retaliate immediately with its Hooves attack against the assailant, effectively punishing those who dare to engage it directly. 

Overall, the War Horse Skeleton is a resilient undead creature, with a strong melee attack and abilities that can catch opponents off guard, making it a noteworthy adversary for any adventurer.
