The Basilisk is a medium-sized monstrosity known for its deadly gaze, which can petrify creatures with a mere look. With decent defenses due to its armor class of 15 and a good allotment of hit points totaling 52, it is capable of withstanding several attacks. As a Challenge Rating 3 creature, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, offering 700 experience points upon defeat. Its primary strengths lie in its unique abilities, particularly its Stone Gaze, which can immobilize enemies, making it an effective ambush predator. However, it has a low Dexterity score, making it vulnerable to ranged attacks. While it possesses a formidable bite attack augmented with poison damage, it is primarily reliant on its gaze to control the battlefield.

The Basilisk has the following ability scores: Strength at 14 (+2), which is good for physical attacks; Dexterity at 8 (-1), which is very bad and reflects its clumsiness; Constitution at 16 (+3), indicating good resilience; Intelligence at 2 (-4), marking it as very bad in terms of mental capabilities; Wisdom at 10 (+0), which is average; and Charisma at 8 (-1), also very bad. Its skills are undeclared, and it has darkvision up to 30 feet along with a passive Perception score of 10, allowing it to perceive its surroundings reasonably, though not exceptionally well.

The actions available to the Basilisk include Stone Gaze and Venomous Bite. The Stone Gaze function allows the basilisk to target a creature within 60 feet, compelling that creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails, it begins to turn to stone and becomes restrained. At the beginning of the basilisk's next turn, the restrained target can attempt to save again. If it fails subsequent checks, it becomes fully petrified, which requires greater restoration or basilisk venom to reverse. This ability can dramatically shift the dynamics of combat, potentially removing characters from the fight entirely.

The Venomous Bite is a melee weapon attack that allows the basilisk to strike at a target within a 5-foot reach. The basilisk rolls a +4 to hit, and on a successful strike, it deals 6 piercing damage along with an additional 10 poison damage, totaling up to 16 damage on a successful hit. This blend of physical and poison damage means that it can threaten both robust and weaker foes alike.

In terms of reactions, the Basilisk has Stone Glance, which triggers when it sees a creature within 60 feet that successfully hits it with an attack. In response, the basilisk can use its Stone Gaze ability against the attacker, emphasizing its defensive strategy of punishing those who dare to strike it. Overall, the Basilisk is a formidable foe that utilizes a combination of petrifying gaze and venomous bite to deter adventurers and control the battlefield effectively.
