The Stargazer is a formidable Huge Monstrosity that operates independently, showcasing a range of strengths and unique abilities that make it a challenging adversary in combat. With high durability provided by its solid Armor Class of 17 and significant Hit Points totaling 168, the Stargazer can absorb considerable damage. Its capabilities in battle are further enhanced by its multiattack feature, allowing it to deliver multiple strikes in a single turn. However, it has notable weaknesses; specifically, its low Dexterity score indicates it is not very nimble, making it susceptible to attacks that require agility. The creature has limited intelligence and charisma, making it less effective in social situations or for casting spells. Its challenge rating of 9 makes it a suitable foe for mid-level adventurers, offering 5,000 experience points upon defeat.

The Stargazer's ability scores are as follows: Strength is exceptionally high at 20 (+5), Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), Constitution is very good at 18 (+4), Intelligence is very bad at 3 (-4), Wisdom is good at 14 (+2), and Charisma is very bad at 4 (-3). It has a Strong saving throw modifier of +9 in Strength, making it difficult to overcome physically. Its skills provide a passive Perception of 16, which allows it to effectively sense its surroundings. The creature is immune to being prone and possesses tremorsense out to 60 feet, allowing it to detect vibrations in the ground.

The Stargazer has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. With its "Tendril Whip Regrowth," the creature can survive the destruction of its 12 tendrils, which regrow after a long rest. It also has "Magic Resistance," granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it resilient to magical assaults.

In terms of its actions, the Stargazer can perform a Multiattack consisting of three different types of attacks: Bites, Slams, and Whips, allowing for a varied offensive strategy. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit that deals 18 (3d8+5) piercing damage to one target within 5 feet. The Slam attack also has a +9 to hit and deals 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage to one creature from a distance of 10 feet. 

The Tendril Whip is particularly dangerous, allowing the Stargazer to attack from a distance of 20 feet, grappling the target with an escape DC of 16. Once grappled, the target becomes restrained, with the added effect that the same tendril cannot be used on another creature until the grapple ends. The tendril itself is destroyable, having an AC of 10 and 20 hit points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage, meaning it can be targeted without directly harming the Stargazer.

Additionally, the Wing Trap ability enables the Stargazer to snap its appendages shut if it has no creatures trapped, dealing 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage to creatures within 5 feet. Grappled creatures suffer additional disadvantages and must deal with continuous bludgeoning damage each turn. A trapped creature can escape by making a DC 16 Strength check.

As a bonus action, the Stargazer can use "Reel" to pull up to two creatures that are grappled by it directly toward itself by up to 15 feet, further enhancing its control over the battlefield. For its reaction, the "Wing Trap Snap" allows the Stargazer to emerge unexpectedly from underground when enemies step nearby, potentially trapping them in its grasp.

In summary, the Stargazer is a strong contender in combat with significant hit points and notable adaptability due to its special abilities and multiattack options, though it is hindered by its low Dexterity and mental capabilities.
