The Magma Mephit is a small elemental creature that embodies fire and magma, often found in volcanic regions or near geothermal features. With an Armor Class of 11 and 21 hit points, it is relatively fragile but possesses some interesting abilities that can turn the tide in combat. The mephit operates effectively as a skirmisher, using its flying speed to engage from the air while employing a range of fiery attacks. Its weaknesses include vulnerability to cold damage, while it is immune to fire and poison, making it a strong contender against certain attacks. The Magma Mephit has abilities that allow for clever positioning and surprising explosions upon death, making it a hazardous foe for unwary adventurers.

The attributes of the Magma Mephit are as follows: Strength is rated at 8, which is very bad for physical attacks; Dexterity is 12, giving it a good modifier of +1, enhancing its stealth and agility; Constitution is average at 10; Intelligence is rated at 8, resulting in a very bad modifier, limiting its problem-solving abilities; Wisdom is 10, making it average; and Charisma is also 10, which is average as well. Its skills include a +2 modifier to perception, which is good enough to notice hidden threats, and a +3 to stealth, making it a capable ambusher.

The Magma Mephit has specific vulnerabilities and immunities that define its nature in combat: it is vulnerable to cold damage, while being immune to fire and poison damage, and it is also immune to being poisoned. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 12, allowing it to see in the dark and spot hidden creatures easily. It speaks Ignan and Terran, which can be relevant in interactions with other elemental beings.

Special abilities include Death Burst, which triggers an explosion of lava upon its death, requiring nearby creatures to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failing the save results in 4 fire damage, while a successful save only takes half damage. The False Appearance ability allows the mephit to remain motionless and blend in with volcanic terrain, making it difficult to detect. Lastly, the Elemental Nature ability ensures that the mephit does not need air, sustenance, or sleep, allowing it to remain in hostile environments without concern.

In terms of actions, the Magma Mephit has two primary offensive options. Its Claws attack is a melee weapon attack that uses a +3 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 3 slashing damage along with an additional 2 fire damage on a hit. The Heat Metal spell, usable once per day, can target a creature holding or wearing a metal object. It uses a +4 to hit and deals 9 fire damage on a successful hit, forcing the affected creature to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid dropping the object if they take damage. Additionally, Fire Breath, also usable once per day, allows the mephit to exhale fire in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. These abilities make the Magma Mephit a dynamic opponent in battle, leveraging its elemental powers to create hazardous situations for its enemies.
