The Forest Marauder is a large giant embodying chaotic evil, serving as a formidable opponent in forest encounters. With a relatively high Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor and substantial Hit Points totaling 114, it can withstand significant damage in battle. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 4, indicating that it is appropriately challenging for a group of adventurers. The Forest Marauder’s primary strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks and its ability to remain hidden in wooded environments, making it an effective ambusher. However, it suffers from notable weaknesses, particularly its Sunlight Sensitivity, which hampers its effectiveness when exposed to light. Overall, the Forest Marauder is a dangerous adversary, utilizing stealth and brute force to achieve its goal.

The Forest Marauder features unique mechanics that enhance its tactical capabilities. The special ability Forest Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forested terrain, making it particularly adept at ambushing unaware foes. However, the drawback of Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on its attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks reliant on sight while in sunlight, making it less effective in bright conditions.

Each Boar Spear attack adds +7 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet, inflicting 16 piercing damage (2d10 + 5) on a successful hit. If both attacks hit a single target, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the marauder. The marauder can choose not to push a creature if it wishes. Additionally, the Forest Marauder can throw a Rock as a ranged weapon attack, also with a +7 to hit. This attack has a range of 30/120 feet, dealing 21 bludgeoning damage (3d10 + 5) on a hit.

For its bonus action, the Forest Marauder can utilize Forest Ambusher while in a forested area, allowing it to take the Hide action, further enhancing its stealth capabilities.

Overall, the Forest Marauder combines stealth and powerful physical attacks, making it a significant threat in its natural habitat, particularly against unprepared adventurers.
