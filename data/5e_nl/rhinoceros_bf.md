The Rhinoceros is a powerful and formidable creature classified as a large beast, often found in a variety of environments. With an Armor Class of 11, its natural armor provides some protection, while its 63 hit points enable it to endure significant damage during battles, making it a durable adversary. Its challenge rating (CR) of 2 indicates that it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers. Notably, the Rhinoceros excels in physical attacks, leveraging its strength, which has a modifier of +5, rated as very good. However, its Dexterity and Charisma modifiers are low, at -1 and -2 respectively, making it vulnerable to attacks that rely on agility or social interactions. Its high Constitution modifier of +2 provides it with resilience against effects that require saving throws.

The Rhinoceros has several notable abilities and actions. With a Charge ability, it can gain extra damage by moving quickly toward a target before attacking, which can also push the target and knock it prone if they fail a Strength saving throw. This makes it an aggressive creature in combat, seeking to close the gap and initiate powerful melee attacks. During a typical round, it can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Gore attacks in one action. The Gore attack has a +7 to hit and deals significant damage, averaging 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. 

Additionally, the Rhinoceros can use its Quaking Stomp as a bonus action. This ability shakes the ground around it, forcing creatures nearby to make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone, creating strategic opportunities for the Rhinoceros and disrupting enemy formations. Overall, this creature serves as a front-line fighter, using its strength to overpower opponents and control the battlefield with its abilities while relying on its durability to withstand retaliatory strikes.
