The Urushi Constrictor is a large monstrosity that embodies the dangers of jungle terrain. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers who tread too close to its territory. This creature has a formidable presence, boasting an Armor Class of 14 and a hefty 133 hit points, giving it good durability in combat. The Urushi Constrictor excels in ambush scenarios, thanks to its enhanced stealth capabilities in jungle environments, while its unique abilities to inflict poison and disease make encounters with it both challenging and dangerous. Being vulnerable to fire, however, is a notable weakness that players can exploit.

The creature has the following attributes: Strength at 17, Dexterity at 15, and Constitution at an impressive 18, resulting in good physical capabilities. Its Intelligence is very low at 3, indicating a lack of mental acuity. Wisdom is average at 10, signifying a normal awareness level, while its Charisma is also very low at 3, suggesting it cannot engage effectively in social interactions. The combination of its Strength, Dexterity, and high Constitution makes it a formidable opponent at close range.

In terms of skills, the Urushi Constrictor has a passive Perception of 13, which is average. This means it can moderately detect surroundings and notice hidden creatures. The creature has vulnerabilities, specifically to fire damage. It is immune to bludgeoning and poison damage, which makes it resilient against many forms of attacks. Additionally, it cannot be poisoned or knocked prone, further enhancing its combat viability against physical attackers. 

The Urushi Constrictor possesses several special abilities that enhance its lethality in jungle environments. The Jungle Camouflage ability grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in jungle terrain, making it a dangerous ambusher. Its Poisonous Leaves ability allows it to deal 7 poison damage to any non-Construct or Undead creature that touches it or attacks it from within 5 feet. Furthermore, the Urushi Blight disease it inflicts causes debilitating symptoms that can significantly hinder an opponent's combat effectiveness and spellcasting concentration.

In terms of actions, the Urushi Constrictor can perform a Multiattack, utilizing either two bites or one bite and one Poisonous Constriction. The bite attack, which has a +6 to hit and a range of 10 feet, deals 14 piercing damage. The Poisonous Constriction also has a +6 to hit but has a shorter range of 5 feet. This attack inflicts 12 bludgeoning damage, grapples the target (with an escape DC of 15), and restrains them. A restrained target suffers an additional 10 poison damage at the start of each turn. Each time it suffers this poison damage, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract the Urushi Blight disease.

Overall, the Urushi Constrictor is a formidable predator that thrives in its environment, posing a significant threat to unwary adventurers. Its resilience and ability to inflict poison and disease make it a challenging opponent in any encounter.
