The Weeping Treant possesses certain vulnerabilities and resistances. It is vulnerable to fire damage, which means it will take double damage from fire-based attacks.

With "Speak with Plants," the Treant can converse with plant life, creating potential for unique negotiations or interactions through role-play. The "Weep Acid" ability causes it to continuously ooze acidic sap, creating dangerous situations for characters that engage with it in melee combat. Any creature that comes into contact with it or that attacks it in close proximity must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sustain 3 (1d6) acid damage.
