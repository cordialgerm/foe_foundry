The Mule is a medium beast that serves primarily as a beast of burden in various settings, often used to carry loads or assist in simple tasks. With an armor class of 10 and 10 hit points, it is not particularly durable in combat, but it is agile with a movement speed of 40 feet. The challenge rating of 1/8 indicates that it is a very easy opponent, primarily useful for transporting goods rather than engaging in combat. Known for its strong constitution with a +1 modifier, the mule can carry significant weight as it qualifies as a large animal for carrying capacity purposes. However, it has low intelligence and charisma, making it poor in roles that require complex thought or social interaction.

The attributes of the Mule include a Strength score of 14, granting it a good modifier of +2, which makes it capable in physical tasks. Its Dexterity is average at +0, its Constitution is good at +1, and it has a very bad Intelligence score of -4, limiting its ability to understand or engage in complex scenarios. Its Wisdom is average with a +0 modifier, and its Charisma is very bad at -3, meaning it is not suitable for any charm or persuasion tasks. The mule has a passive Perception of 10 and a Stealth score of 10, indicating that it is generally not very perceptive or stealthy.

One of the special abilities of the Mule is called "Beast of Burden." This ability allows it to be treated as a Large animal when determining how much weight it can carry, making it an excellent choice for transporting goods due to its strength and size capabilities.

In terms of actions, the Mule has a melee weapon attack with its hooves. This attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to engage one target in close combat. When it successfully hits, it deals 4 bludgeoning damage, rolling 1d4 and adding its Strength modifier. While this damage is modest, it can still contribute to combat under the right circumstances, particularly when defending itself or being warned by its handler.

Overall, while the Mule may not be a fearsome creature in combat or intelligence, its utility as a strong and capable pack animal makes it a valuable asset in many adventures.
