The Derendian Moth Abomination is a formidable creature in the world of Dungeons & Dragons, falling into the category of Huge monstrosities with a neutral evil alignment. This creature excels in mobility and resilience, making it a challenging adversary for any party of adventurers. With an Armor Class of 14, its natural armor provides a good level of defense. Boasting a substantial pool of Hit Points at 210, derived from a combination of 20d12+80, the Moth Abomination can withstand significant punishment in combat. Its challenge rating of 12 suggests that encounters with this creature are balanced for parties of around five characters of approximately tenth level. Notable strengths include its high Dexterity and special abilities, such as its capacity to regenerate tentacles and teleport, while weaknesses may include its lack of ranged attacks and vulnerability to persistent threats.

The Derendian Moth Abomination has the following attributes: Strength at 14 (+2, average), Dexterity at 20 (+5, very good), Constitution at 18 (+4, good), Intelligence at 16 (+3, good), Wisdom at 14 (+2, average), and Charisma at 10 (+0, average). Its saving throw for Dexterity is +9, which is good, and it has a stealth skill bonus of +9, also good. The Moth Abomination is immune to cold and necrotic damage, making it resilient against certain elemental attacks. It also has immunity to the frightened condition, allowing it to maintain its combat effectiveness against fear-inducing effects. With darkvision extending up to 120 feet and a passive Perception score of 16, it can effectively detect threats in low-light environments.

The creature possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities. Its Antennae feature grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, facilitating its ability to detect hidden enemies. The Assimilation ability allows it to detach tentacles when taking significant damage and to sprout new ones when foes fall nearby, up to a maximum of ten. This ability can dramatically increase its offensive potential over time and requires tactics from opponents to avoid dropping to 0 hit points. The Legendary Resistance, usable three times daily, enables the Moth Abomination to turn failed saving throws into successes, providing exceptional durability against spells and abilities that require saving throws. Its Magic Weapons ability ensures that its attacks bypass resistances to non-magical damage, further enhancing its lethal potential. Lastly, the Unbound ability grants immunity to difficult terrain and paralysis or restraint from spells, making the creature exceedingly mobile and difficult to control.

In terms of actions, the Derendian Moth Abomination can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make tentacle strikes equal to its current number of tentacles, alongside one beak attack. Each Tentacle attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 20 feet, and deals bludgeoning damage equal to 5 (1d8 + 1). The Beak attack has the same to-hit bonus but deals a heavier 17 (3d10) piercing damage. One of its remarkable abilities is Wings of the Primal Tender, usable once per day. This allows the creature to teleport within 100 feet, leaving behind a shimmering outline that explodes into a rainbow-colored dust cloud. Any creature within a 60-foot radius must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or drop to 0 hit points, with those affected slowly regenerating hit points over subsequent turns.

For legendary actions, the Derendian Moth Abomination can use up to three of them at the end of other creatures' turns. Its options include Detect, which allows it to make a Perception check to sense hidden threats; Pursue, enabling it to move using its flying speed; and Lay Eggs (which costs two actions), allowing it to create a sticky mass of eggs that will hatch into a swarm of insects at the beginning of its next turn, attacking enemies within proximity. These legendary actions make the creature highly dynamic in combat, enabling it to maintain pressure on players between their turns.
