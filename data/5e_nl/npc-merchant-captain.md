The Merchant Captain is a medium humanoid character that embodies the role of a skilled negotiator and resourceful leader. With a focus on charisma and dexterity, this character is adept at both combat and social interactions, making them an engaging presence in any campaign. Their strengths lie in their high Charisma and Dexterity, allowing for effective spellcasting and athletic ability, while their Armor Class and considerable Hit Points afford them a decent level of survivability in battle. However, their low Strength and moderate Constitution may leave them vulnerable in direct physical confrontations. The Merchant Captain excels in situations requiring diplomacy or tactical finesse, utilizing their abilities to manipulate the battlefield in their favor.

In terms of attributes, the Merchant Captain has a Strength of 9, which is very bad for physical prowess; Dexterity of 16, which is good for agility and finesse; Constitution of 13, which is average in terms of durability; Intelligence of 14, which is good for mental acuity; Wisdom of 13, also average; and a Charisma of 18, which is exceptional for social interactions and spellcasting. The saving throws are Dexterity +6 (good) and Charisma +7 (very good), indicating strong evasion and persuasive capabilities. For skills, they possess a Perception of +1, which is average, and have a passive Perception score of 14. They are fluent in Common and two additional languages of their choice, showcasing their versatility.

The Merchant Captain can perform several actions during combat. They have a Multiattack feature, allowing them to use their Fast Talk ability followed by three attacks with either their rapier or quip, and they can substitute one of these attacks with their spellcasting. The Rapier attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, inflicting 7 piercing damage on a target plus an additional 7 poison damage, making this a formidable choice in close quarters. The Quip is a ranged spell attack that carries a +7 bonus to hit, dealing 14 psychic damage to a single target, demonstrating the Merchant Captain's ability to inflict mental harm from a distance.

Fast Talk is a unique ability where the Merchant Captain confounds a target within 30 feet with rapid chatter. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their next Wisdom saving throw before the Merchant Captain's next turn. This can greatly hinder the effectiveness of the targetâ€™s actions. The Merchant Captain is also capable of Spellcasting, using Charisma as their spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 15. Their spell list includes some useful abilities: At will, they can use comprehend languages, mage hand, and mending. Additionally, they can cast calm emotions and enthrall three times a day, and once per day, they can cast heroism, confusion, and freedom of movement.

Finally, the Merchant Captain can react in combat by providing Inspiration, which they can use four times a day. When a creature within 30 feet fails an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, the Merchant Captain can grant them the opportunity to reroll the die, ensuring that allies have a better chance of succeeding in critical moments. This ability highlights the Merchant Captain's role as a supportive leader in a party.
