The Air Elemental is a large elemental creature that embodies the essence of air. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial 94 hit points, it presents a noteworthy challenge for adventurers, rated at a Challenge Rating of 5. This creature is capable of flying at a speed of 90 feet and can hover without requiring a surface. The Air Elemental excels in mobility due to its ability to pass through narrow spaces and evade attacks, making it a formidable foe in combat. It possesses a variety of special abilities that enhance its survivability, particularly its resistance to many damage types and immunity to certain conditions. However, it has average physical strength and intelligence, which may affect its interactions outside of combat.

The Air Elemental has the following attributes: Strength is +2, which is average; Dexterity is +5, indicating very good agility; Constitution is +2, average for resilience; Intelligence is -2, very bad for mental challenges; Wisdom is +0, average; and Charisma is -2, also very bad. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, a Perception score of 13, and a Stealth score of 15, allowing it to slip away unnoticed in suitable environments. It communicates in Auran, the language of air elementals.

Special abilities include Air Form, which allows the elemental to move into any hostile creature's space easily and pass through tight spaces up to an inch wide; Cloud Camouflage, which improves its Stealth to 20 in conditions like clouds and fog; and Elemental Nature, which means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep. Elemental Resilience grants it resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, as well as immunity to poison damage and certain debilitating conditions such as paralysis and unconsciousness.

In terms of actions, the Air Elemental can make a Multiattack, allowing it to perform either two Wind Lash attacks or two Lightning Bolt attacks in a single round. The Wind Lash is a melee attack with a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, dealing 18 bludgeoning damage upon a successful strike. The Lightning Bolt is a ranged attack, also with a +8 to hit, that can deal 18 lightning damage at a range of 30 feet to 120 feet. Additionally, it has the Whirlwind ability, which can be used every four to six rounds; it requires targets within its space to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failing this results in 18 bludgeoning damage and being thrown 20 feet away in a random direction, potentially causing additional damage if they crash into an object or another creature.

The Air Elemental also has a defensive reaction called Thunderous Retreat. If it is damaged by a creature it can see, it can make a thunderous noise and move up to 15 feet to a visible, unoccupied space. Creatures in close proximity to its original position must then succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 7 thunder damage. This ability allows the elemental to escape attacks while still dealing damage to nearby foes.
