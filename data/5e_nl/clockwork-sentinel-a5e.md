The Clockwork Sentinel is a Medium construct designed as a formidable guardian or combatant. With a robust armor class of 18 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 60, it stands as a resilient obstacle in battle, capable of enduring considerable damage. The Sentinel has strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, with a Strength score of 16 (+3) granting it a good modifier for melee attacks. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are notably low, indicating a lack of mental abilities and emotional responses, which can hinder its effectiveness in social interactions or tasks requiring cleverness. One of its notable strengths is its immunity to a variety of conditions, including being blinded, frightened, or poisoned, making it a reliable front-line entity. Nonetheless, it does lack mobility, with a speed of 35 feet, and its primary attacks are melee-based.

The Clockwork Sentinel possesses a range of attributes that influence its performance in combat. Its Strength score of 16 gives it a good modifier of +3, making its melee attacks effective and potent. Its Dexterity score of 12 provides it an average +1 modifier, allowing it some agility but not enough to rely on for dodging attacks. The Constitution score of 16 results in a good modifier of +3 as well, contributing to its notable hit points. However, its Intelligence score is a very bad -5 modifier, reflecting its inability to think critically or solve complex problems. Wisdom is also very bad at -2, hindering perception checks, while its Charisma, also at -5, makes it ineffective in social encounters.

Among its special abilities, the Clockwork Sentinel has a False Appearance feature, which allows it to blend seamlessly with normal armor when motionless. This can confuse enemies who may underestimate its presence until it is activated. Its Clockwork Nature means it does not require essential biological functions like air or food, making it immune to diseases, which is advantageous in prolonged encounters. Additionally, its Immutable Form ensures that it cannot be transformed or altered by spells or abilities, providing stability in combat.

In terms of actions during combat, the Clockwork Sentinel can engage in a Multiattack, allowing it to strike three times in a single turn, maximizing its offensive potential. It employs a Halberd for melee attacks with a +5 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 8 slashing damage per hit. The Calculated Sweep action allows it to strike at all creatures within 10 feet of it, presenting a significant threat in close quarters. On a critical hit during this attack, it forces the target to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw; failure results in the target falling prone, potentially making it easier for the Sentinel to exploit the situation.

As a strategic option, the Clockwork Sentinel can utilize a bonus action called Overclock, which it can use once its recharge condition is met (on a roll of 5-6), effectively taking the Dash action to rapidly reposition itself in combat. This ability enhances its mobility temporarily, allowing it to respond more dynamically to threats. Additionally, as a defensive measure, it can employ the Parry reaction, adding 2 to its armor class against a melee attack that would hit it, granting it an improved chance of avoiding damage from incoming strikes.
