The Light Cavalry is a Medium humanoid creature characterized by its lawfully neutral alignment and adeptness in mounted combat. With a challenge rating of 1, this creature possesses solid combat capabilities, highlighted by its special abilities and proficiency in both melee and ranged attacks. One notable strength is the ability called "Infantry Slayer," which grants it an advantage in melee attacks against smaller opponents, making it especially lethal on the battlefield. However, its lower intelligence and charisma scores indicate weaknesses in problem-solving and social interactions. While the Light Cavalry is generally well-equipped for combat, its reliance on its mount and fire-based attacks can limit its versatility in non-combat scenarios.

The Light Cavalry has an Armor Class of 14, which offers fairly good protection due to its leather armor and shield. It has 39 hit points, calculated using 6d8+12, representing a good amount of survivability in battle. Its movement speed is average at 30 feet on foot. The Light Cavalryâ€™s Strength score is 15, which provides a +2 modifier that translates into good melee capabilities. With a Dexterity of 12, it has a +1 modifier, indicating an average ability to dodge or evade attacks. Constitution is also a notable asset at 15, giving it a +2 modifier that reflects very good durability. The Intelligence score of 8 grants a -1 modifier, indicating poor cognitive skills. Wisdom at 14 gives a +2 modifier, reflecting good insight, while Charisma at 9 results in a -1 modifier, indicating limited social influence.

The Light Cavalry excels in athletics and perception, with +4 bonuses in both skills; this is considered exceptional ability in physical contests and observational tasks. The creature has resistance to fire damage, which is useful in battles against fire-based attacks, and possesses a passive perception of 14, making it alert to its surroundings. It can communicate in Common and Draconic.

In terms of special abilities, the Light Cavalry has "Infantry Slayer," which allows it to gain advantage on melee weapon attacks against creatures that are Medium or smaller when mounted. This ability significantly enhances its combat effectiveness when engaging opponents that fit this size category. Additionally, the "Mounted Warrior" ability ensures that its mount cannot be charmed or frightened, enabling the cavalier to maintain control over their steed in challenging scenarios.

The Light Cavalry can execute actions using its "Cavalry Saber," allowing it to make a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit against targets within a 5-foot reach. If successful, it deals 5 slashing damage (1d6 + 2). For ranged combat, it can use a "Shortbow," providing a +3 to hit with a range of 80/320 feet, dealing 4 piercing damage (1d6 + 1) on a successful hit.

Furthermore, the Light Cavalry possesses a powerful breath weapon known as "Fire Breath." This ability allows the dragonborn to exhale fire in a 15-foot cone, requiring all creatures within that area to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, affected creatures take 10 fire damage (3d6), or half as much damage on a successful save. This devastating attack can potentially shift the tide of battle, causing significant area damage to multiple opponents.

In summary, the Light Cavalry is a versatile combatant particularly effective in mounted scenarios, capable of delivering strong melee and ranged attacks while also capable of significant area-of-effect damage with its fire breath. Its key strengths lie in its physical prowess and specific advantages against smaller foes, while its lower intelligence and charisma pose challenges outside of combat.
