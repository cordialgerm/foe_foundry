The Barometz is a large, chaotic neutral plant creature that plays a unique role in the ecosystem of its environment. With an armor class of 15 and 95 hit points, it boasts good resilience in combat. The creature has a challenge rating of 6, indicating it poses a significant threat to adventurers but is manageable for a well-prepared party. Notable strengths include its ability to regenerate health and resist damage from various physical attacks. However, it is vulnerable to slashing damage, and if its connection to its parent vine is severed, it loses important regenerative capabilities and suffers from exhaustion. The Barometz is characterized by its connection to the land and its unique abilities that can provide significant benefits to those who manage to consume the nourishing fruits it produces upon death.

In terms of attributes, the Barometz has the following scores: Strength is exceptionally good at 16 (+3), Dexterity is average at 11 (+0), Constitution is very good at 18 (+4), Intelligence is very bad at 5 (-3), Wisdom is good at 16 (+3), and Charisma is average at 13 (+1). The creature possesses a good array of defenses with damage immunities to poison, resistances to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, and immunities to exhaustion and the poisoned condition. It has darkvision extending 60 feet and a passive perception of 13. Although it can understand Sylvan, it is unable to speak.

The Barometz has several special abilities that enhance its gameplay. The first is **Fruit of the Land**, which allows it to sprout nourishing fruits and vegetables upon its death. If a creature spends 10 minutes consuming these, it receives the benefits of the heroes’ feast spell for 8 hours. If not consumed within one hour, the fruit disintegrates into dirt and leaves. The second ability is **Parent Vine**, which connects it to a nearby tree with a vine that has an armor class of 13, 20 hit points, and resistance to most damage types except slashing. Severing the vine causes the Barometz to lose its regeneration ability and suffer exhaustion each hour until it dies. **Regeneration** allows the Barometz to regain 5 hit points at the start of its turn, but this ability is lost if the vine is severed. Lastly, its **Wildland Runner** ability enables it to move through difficult terrain without hindrance and pass through magical and nonmagical plants without taking damage.

In combat, the Barometz can make two attacks in one turn through its **Multiattack** action, using both its gore and hooves. The **Gore** attack has a +6 to hit and can deal an average of 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage, along with a chance to knock a target prone if they fail a DC 14 Strength saving throw. The **Hooves** attack also has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. Overall, the Barometz serves as both a formidable adversary and a source of potential aid for those who can utilize its unique abilities effectively.
