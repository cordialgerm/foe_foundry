The Rainforest Ogre is a formidable adversary and a typical embodiment of chaotic evil within its environment. As a Large Giant, it wields significant physical strength and resilience, marked by its high hit points and solid attack options. The creature's abilities allow it to be an aggressive combatant, thriving on charging into battle and overpowering foes with its strength. While it possesses only moderate Dexterity and Wisdom attributes, its exceptional Strength provides it with powerful melee capabilities. The Rainforest Ogre also has unique traits that enhance its versatility, such as the ability to change shape into a large boar, which grants it additional combat options and mobility. However, its low Intelligence and Charisma scores indicate that it may struggle with complex strategies and social interactions.

The attributes of the Rainforest Ogre are as follows: Strong (Strength 19, +4 modifier, very good), Dexterous (Dexterity 12, +1 modifier, average), Tough (Constitution 14, +2 modifier, good), Unintelligent (Intelligence 7, -2 modifier, bad), Average (Wisdom 10, +0 modifier, average), and Lacking (Charisma 7, -2 modifier, bad). It possesses an Armor Class of 12, indicating it can be hit rather easily compared to tougher creatures, and 90 hit points, making it reasonably durable for its challenge rating of 4.

In terms of special abilities, the Rainforest Ogre can utilize its Devouring Charge when it transforms into a boar. If it moves 20 feet straight toward a target and successfully hits with its Tusk attack, the target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 14. If the target fails this save, it falls prone, allowing the ogre to make a Bite attack as a bonus action. This ability makes engaging the ogre in combat particularly dangerous, as being knocked prone can lead to further damage.

The ogreâ€™s Fey Ancestry grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed and makes it immune to magic-induced sleep, enhancing its resilience against magical manipulation. Additionally, it has the ability to Speak with Beasts, enabling it to communicate with animal creatures, which may be advantageous for navigating the rainforest environment or gaining allies among local fauna.

In combat, the Rainforest Ogre can make multiple attacks using its Multiattack ability, which allows it to perform two Spear or Tusk attacks and one Bite attack in a single turn. The Bite attack is particularly noteworthy; it has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 9 piercing damage while granting the ogre 5 temporary hit points if it lands, ensuring its survival in battle. The spear can be used either in melee or ranged scenarios, dealing up to 13 piercing damage when wielded with two hands.

As a bonus action, the ogre has the ability to Change Shape, allowing it to transform into a large boar. This transformation does not alter its statistics but instead provides tactical advantages and alters its appearance. The ogre reverts to its original form upon death, making it a versatile combatant with the ability to adapt its strategy to the flow of battle.
