The Peat Mummy is a formidable undead creature that embodies the unsettling and decay-ridden characteristics of a bog. As a medium undead of neutral evil alignment, it primarily serves as an antagonist in combat scenarios. This creature possesses significant strengths, notably high physical strength and resilience, making it a dangerous foe in close encounters. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it is capable of taking and dealing substantial damage, making encounters with it challenging for low to mid-level adventurers. However, its lower Dexterity and Intelligence scores indicate its potential weaknesses, making it less capable in ranged combat or intellectual challenges. One particularly notable aspect of the Peat Mummy is its ability to inflict a debilitating curse called "bog melt," which can severely hinder opponents over time.

The Peat Mummy has an Armor Class (AC) of 12, which is considered average for a creature of its level. It possesses 93 hit points, derived from rolling 11d8 and adding 44, indicating good survivability. It has a walking speed of 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat. The creature's Strength score is 19, giving it a +4 modifier, which is classified as very good, making it quite effective in physical attacks. Its Dexterity is low at 9, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is considered bad and reflects its slowness and clumsiness. With a Constitution score of 18 (+4 modifier, very good), the Peat Mummy is resilient against many forms of damage. Intelligence is notably low at 6, yielding a -2 modifier, which is very bad in terms of mental capacity. Wisdom is average at 10 (0 modifier) and Charisma is also average at 10 (0 modifier).

In terms of skills, it has a perception score of +0, allowing it only average sensory awareness. The Peat Mummy is immune to poison damage and has resistance to lightning damage as well as bludgeoning and piercing damage from nonmagical attacks. It is also immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned, making it difficult to incapacitate. The creature has darkvision to a range of 60 feet and a passive perception score of 10, enabling it to see in darkness and notice its surroundings. It can communicate in languages it knew in life but may not possess the same level of communication as living creatures.

The Peat Mummy has some special abilities that enhance its threat level. The "Bog Melt" ability curses a target, preventing them from regaining hit points and reducing their maximum hit points by 7 every 24 hours until the curse is lifted. Additionally, if the cursed creature is within 30 feet of the Peat Mummy, it has a chance of entering a rage and must attack the nearest target. When the curse reduces a creature's maximum hit points to 0, they die, and their body turns into a menacing pool of goo, which poses a risk to creatures nearby. The "Noxious Slurry" ability poisons attackers who strike the Peat Mummy in melee, effectively punishing them for their aggression.

In combat, the Peat Mummy can perform a multiattack, using two "Rabid Bite" attacks. Each bite has a +7 to hit, deals 11 piercing damage plus an additional 7 necrotic damage, and also imposes the bog melt curse on a successful hit. The physical bite from the Peat Mummy, combined with its special abilities, makes it a dangerous opponent capable of spreading its curse and dealing substantial damage while resisting various forms of attack. Overall, the Peat Mummy poses a significant threat to any adventurers who encounter it, requiring careful strategy and teamwork to defeat.
