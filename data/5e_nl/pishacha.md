The Pishacha is a medium-sized chaotic evil fiend that serves as a cunning and deceptive opponent in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers. The Pishacha possesses a solid Armor Class of 13 and 55 hit points, making it reasonably durable. Its physical attributes are impressive, particularly its Strength of 16, which provides it with good melee capabilities, and a Wisdom of 16, enhancing its perceptual awareness. However, it has a weak Charisma score of 7, indicating its ineptness in social situations. The creature is adept at evasion, made possible by its shapechanging ability and a variety of resistances; it is immune to poison damage and resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage. Vulnerable only to radiant damage, the Pishacha can also disappear through magical invisibility, adding to its trickster nature. Its unique abilities, particularly Demonic Possession, offer a tactical advantage by incapacitating opponents and allowing the Pishacha to control a character's actions.

In terms of its attributes and abilities, the Pishacha has the following scores: 
- Strength: 16 (+3), which is good for melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2), which is good for dodging and reflex-based actions.
- Constitution: 13 (+1), providing average durability.
- Intelligence: 10 (+0), which is average, signifying basic mental abilities.
- Wisdom: 16 (+3), making it perceptive and good at noticing hidden threats.
- Charisma: 7 (-2), reflecting its very bad social interactions.

The Pishacha has proficiency in Arcana and Perception. Its Arcana skill is at +2, which is average, while its Perception skill is +5, indicating a good ability to notice details and perceive threats in the environment.

For damage vulnerabilities and resistances, the Pishacha is vulnerable to radiant damage, meaning it takes double damage from such attacks. It is immune to poison damage and resistant to cold, fire, and lightning, as well as to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Additionally, it is immune to being poisoned.

The Pishacha has a remarkable ability to transform its shape due to its Shapechanger ability. It can use its action to polymorph into either a tiger or a wolf, adopting their physical forms and melee attacks while retaining its statistics apart from size. This transformation does not affect any equipment it is wearing or carrying, and it reverts to its true form upon death.

When engaging in combat, the Pishacha can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two separate attacks: one with its bite and another with its claws. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 12 piercing damage (2d8 + 3) upon a successful hit. Similarly, the Claws attack also has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 10 slashing damage (2d6 + 3).

One of its defining features is the Demonic Possession ability, which can be used as an action with a recharge time of 6. If a humanoid within 5 feet fails a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, they become possessed by the Pishacha, resulting in their incapacitation for a duration determined by rolling 3d6 rounds. While possessing, the Pishacha cannot be attacked directly, instead using the target's body for its purposes. The victim suffers random short-term madness during this time. Possession allows the Pishacha to exert control occasionally, demanding more saving throws from the victim every 1d4 hours and potentially leading to long-term madness if the possession persists. The possession ends if the host's body drops to 0 hit points, the Pishacha chooses to end it, or if a specific counteraction occurs, such as being turned or forced out.

Lastly, the Pishacha is capable of magical invisibility, which it can activate to become unseen. It remains invisible until it attacks or if it chooses to end this effect, which behaves similarly to concentrating on a spell.
