The Ochre Jelly is a Large ooze creature known for its amorphous form and unique movement abilities. It possesses moderate defensive capabilities, reflected in its Armor Class of 8, but relies on its ability to navigate through narrow spaces and difficult terrains to avoid direct confrontation. With 45 hit points, it can sustain a fair amount of damage, making it a noteworthy challenge for adventurers. This creature's strength lies in its capacity to grapple foes and deal ongoing acid damage while managing to split into multiple entities when exposed to slashing or lightning damage, effectively multiplying its threat level. However, it suffers from disadvantages when in sunlight, which can be exploited by savvy players.

In terms of attributes, the Ochre Jelly has a Strength of 14 (+2), which grants it a good physical capability for grappling and dealing damage. Its Dexterity score is quite low at 6 (-2), making it fairly slow in reaction and movement compared to other creatures. The Constitution is average at 14 (+2), allowing it to take hits better than many others. Intelligence is extremely low at 1 (-5), indicating it's incapable of complex thought. Wisdom is also low at 6 (-2), making it susceptible to effects that require awareness or perception. Charisma is similarly low at 1 (-5), denoting a lack of personal presence or ability to interact socially.

The Ochre Jelly does not possess any skills but is immune to acid, lightning, and slashing damage, making it resistant to common damage types. It is also immune to several conditions including being blinded, charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, and prone. The jelly has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to sense its environment effectively despite being blind beyond that distance, although its passive perception is rather low at 8.

The jelly has several noteworthy special abilities. Its Amorphous ability allows it to slip through gaps as narrow as 1 inch without any hindrance, effectively making it difficult to contain. The Spider Climb ability gives it the freedom to climb walls and ceilings with ease, regardless of the surface's difficulties. However, its Sunlight Sensitivity causes it to have disadvantage on attack rolls in sunlight, which is a significant drawback. Lastly, the Ooze Nature ability emphasizes its unique physiology, as it does not require air or sleep, presenting a unique challenge for those who might try to outlast it.

In terms of actions, the Ochre Jelly can use its Pseudopod attack for melee combat. This attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully lands a hit, it inflicts 9 bludgeoning damage and an additional 3 acid damage. Furthermore, if the attack connects, the target becomes grappled, creating a situation where they will continue to take 3 acid damage at the start of each of the jellyâ€™s subsequent turns, as long as they remain grappled.

As a reaction, the Jelly possesses the Split ability. When it is hit by lightning or slashing damage while having at least 10 hit points, it automatically splits into two smaller jellies, each with half the hit points of the original. This reaction allows any grappled targets to break free, therefore increasing the jelly's versatility and damage potential during combat.
