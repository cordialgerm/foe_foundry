The ghast is a Medium undead creature known for its physical prowess and sinister abilities. As a creature of challenge rating 2, it poses a noticeable threat, particularly due to its capability to inflict paralysis and its powerful melee attacks. With a solid armor class of 13 and 48 hit points, the ghast is reasonably resilient in combat. Its speed of 30 feet allows it to engage foes efficiently, while its ability to climb difficult surfaces grants it exceptional mobility, making it a tricky opponent. The ghast also relies on raw meat to maintain its abilities, introducing a unique vulnerability tied to its sustenance needs. Nonetheless, its undead nature offers it strong resilience against various conditions, making it a formidable adversary in encounters.

The ghast has the following attributes: 
- Strength is +3, indicating a good ability in physical combat. 
- Dexterity is also +3, granting it good agility, useful for avoiding attacks and sneaking. 
- Constitution is +0, showing average durability in terms of maintaining hit points. 
- Intelligence is +0, suggesting that it has an average capacity for knowledge. 
- Wisdom is +2, reflecting a good perception and insight ability. 
- Charisma is -1, indicating a very bad ability to influence or persuade others.

The ghast possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat and survival:
- **Hungry Dead Nature** means the ghast does not require air or sleep but must consume at least 2 pounds of raw meat every 24 hours to maintain full functionality. If it does not eat, it risks starvation and can become exhausted. This mechanic is particularly compelling as it creates a tangible resource management aspect for the creature.
- **Spider Climb** allows the ghast to ascend difficult terrains without requiring an ability check, giving it an exceptional edge in battlefield positioning and surprise tactics.
- **Stench** affects nearby creatures, forcing them to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of their next turn. Successful saves grant immunity to this effect for 24 hours, potentially affecting positioning in combat.
- **Turning Defiance** grants the ghast and any ghouls nearby advantage on saving throws against effects designed to turn undead, further enhancing their survivability against clerics and similar classes.
- **Undead Resilience** confers immunity to poison damage, the poisoned condition, and exhaustion, making the ghast exceptionally durable against many common sources of damage and effects.

For actions, the ghast can perform the following:
- **Multiattack** allows the ghast to make one Bite attack and two Claws attacks in a single turn. If it successfully lands one Bite and at least one Claws attack on a living target, that target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid contracting ghoul hunger, thereby adding a layer of complexity to encounters.
- The **Bite** attack has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage on a hit.
- The **Claws** attack has the same +5 to hit, dealing 8 slashing damage. If the target is not a Construct or Undead, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for up to one minute, offering the potential for significant crowd control. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the paralysis on a success. 

Overall, the ghast is a dangerous foe that blends physical ability with debilitating effects, making it a notable encounter in any campaign involving undead horror.
