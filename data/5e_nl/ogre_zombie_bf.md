The Ogre Zombie is a Large undead creature that serves as a menacing combatant in various encounters. With a notable armor class of 8 and a hit point total of 72, it can endure a fair amount of damage before being defeated. This zombie has abilities that reflect its resilience and brute strength, making it particularly dangerous in melee combat. However, its low Dexterity score, reflected by a -2 modifier, indicates that it can struggle with nimbleness and reflexive activities, making it vulnerable if faced with ranged attacks or agile opponents. The Ogre Zombie has a challenge rating of 2, signaling that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. Its undead nature grants it unique resistances, but it lacks intelligence and social skills, unable to communicate effectively beyond understanding some languages. 

The Ogre Zombie boasts the following attributes: 
- Strength: +4, which is very good, allowing it to deal significant damage in melee combat.
- Dexterity: -2, which is bad, indicating poor agility and reflexes.
- Constitution: +4, which is very good, contributing to its high hit points and durability.
- Intelligence: -4, which is very bad, reflecting its lack of mental acuity.
- Wisdom: -2, which is bad, suggesting it may have issues with perception and insight.
- Charisma: -3, which is bad, indicating an inability to influence or interact socially.

In terms of abilities, the Ogre Zombie has a few notable features:
- **Undead Fortitude:** If the Ogre Zombie is reduced to 0 hit points, it may make a Constitution saving throw, with a difficulty class (DC) equal to 5 plus the damage taken, provided the damage is not radiant or from a critical hit. On a successful save, it instead drops to 1 hit point, allowing it to remain in the fight.
- **Undead Nature:** This ability grants the Zombie the advantage of not needing air, food, drink, or sleep, making it immune to conditions that would affect living beings in this regard.
- **Undead Resilience:** The creature is immune to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, showcasing its robustness against various forms of attack.

In combat, the Ogre Zombie can take the following actions:
- **Multiattack:** This enables the Ogre Zombie to make two attacks with its Greatclub in one turn.
- **Greatclub:** The ogre makes a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it hits a target, the attack deals 13 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 2d8 plus its Strength modifier.
- **Lumbering Charge (Recharge 5â€“6):** This special action allows the Ogre Zombie to charge forward, covering up to 20 feet in a straight line and pushing through the space of Medium or smaller creatures. The first creature it enters must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 14. On a failed save, that creature takes 14 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If it succeeds, the creature takes half the damage and remains upright.

The combination of its powerful melee attacks and special abilities makes the Ogre Zombie a formidable opponent, particularly in close-quarters combat. Its ability to potentially shrug off fatal damage and its immunity to many debilitating effects allow it to remain a persistent threat to adventurers who encounter it.
