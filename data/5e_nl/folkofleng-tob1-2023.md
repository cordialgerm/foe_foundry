The Folk of Leng is a Medium humanoid with a neutral evil alignment, known for its cunning and mystical capabilities. With an Armor Class of 14, it presents a decent defense thanks to its studded leather armor, but its true strengths lie in its formidable combination of robust hit points totaling 68 and an array of unique abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Possessing high Dexterity and Charisma, this creature is agile and has potent magical capabilities that allow it to manipulate its enemies and engage effectively in combat. Additionally, it is immune to necrotic damage and possesses resistances to cold, making it a challenging adversary. However, it is particularly vulnerable to radiant damage, which can prevent it from regenerating.

It is skilled in Arcana and Deception, with a +4 and +8 modifier respectively, making it proficient in magic lore and manipulation, while also having a +5 in Perception due to its heightened awareness.

The creature features several notable special abilities. Ethereal Sight grants it the ability to see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane, giving it a strategic advantage against opponents. The Leng Rejuvenation ability allows it to resurrect after death unless certain conditions are met, such as being destroyed by radiant damage; this means that adventurers must consider the unique methods of permanently defeating it. As a Mortal Void Traveler, it does not require air or ambient pressure, allowing for versatility in various environments. Its Phrenic Weapons make all weapon attacks magical and add an additional 3d6 psychic damage, increasing the threat level of its attacks significantly. Unlike many other creatures, it also has a regeneration ability that allows it to regain 2 hit points at the start of its turn, unless it takes fire or radiant damage.

In combat, the Folk of Leng can strike with a scimitar, utilizing a +4 to hit and dealing 5 slashing damage plus an impressive 10 psychic damage on a successful hit. Its Psychic Bolt ranged attack allows it to strike from 120 feet away with +6 to hit, dealing 14 psychic damage. The Hooked Spider Net creates a tactical situation where, if successful, it inflicts pinpoint piercing damage while restraining the target, causing additional poison damage over time and giving another creature the chance to break free, adding a strategic layer to combat.

Additionally, the Folk of Leng is capable of spellcasting without the need for material components, using its exceptional Charisma. It can cast minor spells such as message and minor illusion at will, enhancing its ability to communicate and create distractions. It can also cast disguise self and suggestion three times per day each, allowing it to change its appearance and influence the minds of others, making it a formidable foe both in direct combat and social settings.

Finally, as a bonus action, the Folk of Leng can shift between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, giving it unique escape options and tactical advantages during encounters. It can become intangible during combat, affecting its visibility while remaining capable of observing and planning its next actions.
