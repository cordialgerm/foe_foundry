The baboon is a small, agile beast commonly found in various environments. Weighing in with a challenge rating of 1/8, this creature is not particularly powerful, but its unique abilities allow it to effectively support its allies in combat. Baboons possess a decent Armor Class of 11, allowing them to withstand some attacks, but their low hit points of only 10 make them vulnerable to damage. With a solid Dexterity score of +1, baboons exhibit good agility and can climb with ease, matching their speed on the ground. Their strength and constitution are below average, making them less effective in direct confrontations. However, their Pack Tactics ability enhances their combat performance when working with allies, allowing them to gain an advantage on attack rolls if another creature is within close proximity. 

The baboon's attributes are as follows: Strength is -1, which is considered very bad for physical attacks, Dexterity is +1 (good for agility-related actions), Constitution is +0 (average for endurance), Intelligence is -3 (very bad for mental tasks), Wisdom is +1 (good for perception checks), and Charisma is -2 (bad for social interactions). In terms of senses, baboons have darkvision up to 30 feet, allowing them to see in dim light as if it were bright light, which is beneficial in low-light situations. Their Perception and Stealth skills are both rated at 11, indicating an average ability to detect hidden creatures and move silently.

Baboons have a couple of special abilities and actions that enhance their role in combat. The Pack Tactics ability grants them advantage on attack rolls against enemies when at least one ally is close by, making their attacks more likely to hit. For their melee attack, they possess a Bite action, which is a weapon attack that has a +3 to hit, allowing them to successfully strike with a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, this bite deals 3 piercing damage, which is quite low but can be effective when combined with their Pack Tactics for coordinated strikes.

In addition to their offensive capabilities, baboons can also utilize a reaction called Startling Display. When an enemy attacks the baboon while within reach, it can perform a display meant to distract its attacker. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 11; if they fail, they incur disadvantage on the attack roll, which can significantly reduce the likelihood of hitting the baboon. This ability allows the baboon to contribute to the defense of itself and its allies effectively. Overall, while not formidable on their own, baboons can leverage their abilities to work effectively in groups, making them a helpful creature to have in a skirmish.
