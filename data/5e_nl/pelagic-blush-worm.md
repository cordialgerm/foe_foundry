The Pelagic Blush Worm is a gargantuan monstrosity characterized by its aquatic prowess and formidable abilities. With an armor class of 17 due to its natural armor, it can withstand significant damage, boasting 188 hit points that afford it substantial durability in combat. This creature’s immense strength allows it to perform devastating melee attacks, including a powerful bite and tail fin strike. However, its movement is limited to swimming at a speed of 50 feet, rendering it immobile on land and making it vulnerable to ranged attacks when out of the water. The Pelagic Blush Worm is a challenge for adventurers with a challenge rating of 9, making it a formidable opponent worth 5,000 experience points. Notable characteristics include its ability to breathe underwater and its damage immunities to acid and cold, which enhance its resilience in aquatic environments.

The Pelagic Blush Worm has a Strength score of 23, producing a very good modifier of +6, allowing for devastating physical attacks. Its Dexterity score of 14 yields a good modifier of +2, contributing to its avoidance and initiative. With a Constitution score of 19, it enjoys a good modifier of +4, enhancing its hit points and saving throws. The creature has an Intelligence score of 1, resulting in a very bad modifier of -5, indicating a lack of cognitive ability. A Wisdom score of 12 grants it an average modifier of +1, while its Charisma of 4 yields a very bad modifier of -3, reflecting its unappealing presence.

The Pelagic Blush Worm’s saving throw proficiency includes Dexterity at +6, Constitution at +8, and Wisdom at +5, indicating its strong resilience to physical and some magical effects. It has a skill in perception with a +1, allowing it to perceive its surroundings with an average effectiveness. The creature possesses blindsight extending up to 120 feet, enabling it to sense its environment without relying on sight, although it cannot utilize this ability while deafened.

Among its special abilities, the Pelagic Blush Worm has echolocation, allowing it to navigate through its environment unless it is deafened. It is classified as a siege monster, meaning it deals double damage to objects and structures, making it highly effective against fortifications. The creature's ability to breathe underwater allows it to thrive in aquatic habitats, but it is incapable of breathing air, which limits its mobility on land.

In terms of actions, the Pelagic Blush Worm can make a multiattack, consisting of one bite attack and one tail fin attack. The bite attack is a melee weapon strike with a +10 to hit, reaching out to 10 feet, and deals an average damage of 19 (3d8+6) piercing damage. If it targets a creature of Large size or smaller, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature becomes blinded and restrained, enjoys total cover against external attacks, and takes an average of 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the worm’s turns. Should the worm take 25 or more damage in a single turn from a creature inside it, it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, who then fall prone within a space 10 feet of the worm. If the worm is killed, swallowed creatures are freed from restraint and can escape by using 15 feet of movement while ending up prone.

The tail fin attack is also a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit and deals a substantial 16 (3d6+6) slashing damage along with an additional average of 16 (3d6+6) bludgeoning damage, making it a versatile and dangerous option in close quarters.

Additionally, the Pelagic Blush Worm can unleash a Red Acid Spume (recharge 5-6), a special ability where it exhales a cone of acid when underwater or a line of acid when above water. The area of this attack covers a 30-foot cone or a 50-foot line that is 5 feet wide, dealing a hefty average of 31 (9d6) acid damage to any creatures caught within the area, requiring a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw for half damage. This ability can significantly impact combat dynamics, especially when positioned strategically during encounters in water.
