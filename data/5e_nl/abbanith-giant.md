The Abbanith Giant is a formidable Large-sized creature of the Giant type, known for its neutral alignment. With an Armor Class of 13, it relies on natural armor to defend itself and possesses a robust pool of Hit Points totaling 76, derived from rolling 9d10 and adding 27. This giant has a movement capability that allows it to burrow at a speed of 30 feet and walk at 40 feet, making it versatile in diverse terrains. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it provides a decent challenge for adventurers, awarding 700 experience points upon defeat. Its impressive Strength score of 20 (+5) gives it exceptional melee capabilities, while its Constitution of 17 (+3) ensures good durability. With a Dexterity of 9 (-1), its agility is less effective, making it relatively vulnerable to ranged attacks. The Abbanith Giant has a Wisdom score of 13 (+1), giving it an average perception of danger, and it can communicate in both Giant and Terran languages.

In terms of saving throws, it has a very good modifier of +7 for Strength and +5 for Constitution, making it fairly resilient against physical attacks. Its abilities include tremorsense out to 120 feet and a passive Perception of 11, allowing it to detect vibrations in the ground and spot potential threats. 

The Abbanith Giant possesses unique special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and survivability. Its "One with the Earth" ability allows it to detect any disturbances in the ground, preventing it from being surprised by opponents that are in contact with the earth. Additionally, it gains advantage on attack rolls against constructs and elementals made of earth or stone, making it highly effective against such foes. The "Siege Monster" ability greatly enhances its damage output against structures, allowing it to inflict double damage to regular objects and structures and triple damage to those made of earth or stone, showcasing its destructive potential.

In combat, the Abbanith Giant can utilize its "Multiattack" action to make two "Thumb Claw" attacks. Each melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 12 piercing damage with a roll of 2d6 + 5 when it connects.

As a reaction, the Abbanith Giant can perform "Earth Counter" (with a recharge time of 6), allowing it to thwart spells cast by nearby creatures. This reaction mimics the effect of the counterspell spell, but is limited to spells that involve earth or stone manipulation, such as "stone shape," "wall of stone," or "move earth." The giant does not need to make a spellcasting ability check, making this ability especially effective against spellcasters attempting to manipulate the battlefield with terrain-altering spells.
