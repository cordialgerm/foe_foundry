The Undead Phoenix is a formidable creature characterized by its huge size and chaotic evil alignment. As an undead entity, it has a unique combination of resilience and destructive capabilities, making it a significant threat in combat scenarios. With a high armor class of 17 and a substantial hit point pool of 142, it is well-equipped to withstand prolonged conflicts. The creature's speed allows it to fly swiftly at 90 feet and walk at a moderate pace of 30 feet, enhancing its mobility in battles. Its challenge rating of 12 indicates that it presents a serious challenge for adventurers, granting it a reward of 8,400 experience points upon defeat. 

The Undead Phoenix possesses impressive attributes, with a Strength score of 23, giving it a very good modifier of +6 that significantly enhances its physical attacks. Its Dexterity and Constitution scores of 14 and 17 provide good and very good modifiers of +2 and +3, respectively, improving its agility and resilience against physical challenges. In contrast, it has average Intelligence and bad Charisma scores, posing little threat in terms of mental capabilities or social interactions. The creature has an exceptional Wisdom score of 17, granting it a very good modifier of +3 that aids in its perception and insight.

In terms of defenses, the Undead Phoenix has strong saving throws, particularly in Strength (+10), Constitution (+7), and Wisdom (+7), which makes it difficult to incapacitate or control. It is immune to necrotic, fire, and poison damage, as well as the poisoned condition, making it highly resistant to common forms of magical and physical attacks. The creatureâ€™s darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 120 feet, and it has a passive perception of 17, making it adept at noticing threats or hidden movements.

The Undead Phoenix's special abilities enhance its role as a menace in battle. The Bilious Aura creates a zone of decay around the creature; any living creature starting its turn within 10 feet cannot regain hit points and suffers disadvantage on Constitution saving throws until the beginning of its next turn. This can severely hinder the healing capabilities of opponents while putting them at risk of becoming incapacitated. Additionally, its Eternal Unlife ability means that if the phoenix is killed, it will resurrect itself after 24 hours unless it has been defeated with radiant damage, adding an element of urgency to any encounters.

In combat, the Undead Phoenix can execute a Multiattack action, allowing it to make three attacks in one turn: two using its claws and one with its Decaying Bite. The claw attacks have a +10 to hit and deal a strong 20 (4d6 + 6) slashing damage each. The Decaying Bite also has a +10 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage along with an additional 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. Notably, the bite attack can curse its target with perpetual decay unless they succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, preventing the target from regaining hit points until the curse is removed.

Overall, the Undead Phoenix embodies a blend of overwhelming power and a persistent threat, creating a memorable encounter for adventurers who dare to face it.
