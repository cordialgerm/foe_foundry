The Ettercap is a medium-sized monstrosity notable for its spider-like abilities and affinity for ambushing prey. With a challenge rating of 2, it serves as a moderate threat to adventurers, utilizing its resilience and climbing prowess to navigate and control environments where webs are present. Key strengths include decent offensive capabilities, particularly through its poisonous attacks and ability to restrain foes with webbing. However, it suffers from poor intelligence, limiting its tactical options. Overall, the Ettercap is a dangerous enemy in familiar territory, but less effective if caught in open combat without webs.

The Ettercap has an Armor Class of 13, providing it with average protection in combat scenarios. It possesses 54 hit points, allowing it to endure a moderate amount of damage before being defeated. With a speed of 30 feet and the ability to climb at the same speed, it can maneuver effectively in its environment. The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength at +2 (average effectiveness), Dexterity at +3 (good effectiveness), Constitution at +1 (average effectiveness), Intelligence at -3 (very bad effectiveness), Wisdom at +3 (good effectiveness), and Charisma at -1 (bad effectiveness). It has darkvision up to 60 feet, giving it an advantage in low-light conditions. The Ettercap also has a Perception modifier of +3 (good effectiveness) and a Stealth modifier of +3 (good effectiveness), enhancing its capacity for ambush tactics.

The Ettercap has several special abilities that enhance its survivability and effectiveness in combat. Its Monstrosity Resilience provides it with resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it tougher to deal with over time and immune to certain debilitating effects. The Spider Climb ability allows it to traverse difficult surfaces and even ceilings without difficulty, granting it a tactical edge in environments rich with verticality. With Web Sense, the Ettercap is aware of the precise location of any creature touching a web it is also in contact with, facilitating ambush strategies. Additionally, the Web Walker ability allows it to move freely through webbing without impediment, further supporting its ambush tactics and escape options.

In combat, the Ettercap can utilize Multiattack, enabling it to make one Bite attack and one Claws attack or to use two Spit Poison attacks during its turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 7 piercing damage along with an additional 4 poison damage. If the target fails a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, it becomes poisoned for 1 minute, with the possibility to repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect. The Claws attack also carries a +5 to hit and deals 10 slashing damage on a successful strike. 

The Spit Poison provides a ranged option, allowing the Ettercap to hit a target within 20 feet (60 feet maximum range) with a +5 to hit, dealing 11 poison damage on a successful attack. This versatility allows the Ettercap to engage both at close range and from a distance.

As a bonus action, the Ettercap can use the Web ability, which recharges on a roll of 4-6. This ability allows the Ettercap to launch a web at a creature within 30 feet. If the target fails a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, it becomes restrained. A creature can spend its action to free a restrained target by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check. The webbing can be destroyed, with an Armor Class of 10 and 5 hit points, but it is vulnerable to fire damage while immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. This ability can significantly alter the dynamics of combat, enabling the Ettercap to control the battlefield and hinder enemies effectively.
