The Catterball is a small, chaotic neutral creature classified as a Fey in Dungeons & Dragons 5e. With a challenge rating of 1, it provides a moderate challenge for adventurers, equating to 200 experience points upon defeat. It possesses a unique blend of abilities and resistances that make it notably elusive in combat. Its strengths lie in its impressive Dexterity and Constitution, allowing it to dodge attacks effectively and withstand damage. However, its low Strength and Intelligence make it less effective in physical confrontations and problem-solving situations. The Catterball excels at mobility, capable of navigating tight spaces and leaping impressive distances, which can confuse and disrupt its foes.

The Catterball has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average for its challenge rating, giving it a decent chance to avoid attacks. It has 44 hit points, derived from rolling eight six-sided dice and adding 16, translating into good durability for a creature of its size. The creature’s ability scores reflect its niche in agility and charm, with a Dexterity of 17 (+3 modifier, considered very good) providing significant bonuses to its actions, while its Strength at 8 (-1 modifier, considered very bad) indicates it struggles in melee strength. Its Constitution score of 14 (+2 modifier, considered good) aids in absorbing damage, and a Charisma of 15 (+2 modifier, considered good) supports its magical and social interactions.

The Catterball's primary special abilities include "Rubbery Flesh," which grants it immunity to any form-altering magic and provides an advantage on checks and saving throws to escape grapples, making it very difficult to restrain. In addition, it can squeeze through openings as narrow as one foot, allowing for a remarkable degree of mobility. The "Standing Leap" ability, which activates when in a ball form, enables the creature to perform long jumps of up to 60 feet and high jumps of up to 30 feet, making it exceptionally agile and hard to pin down in combat.

In terms of actions, the Catterball has two primary forms that dictate its attack choices: the "Slam" attack, used when in its extended or true form, allows it to strike targets in melee combat with a +5 to hit and inflicts 6 bludgeoning damage (1d6+3). This is a moderately effective melee attack. The "Snap Back" ability, only available in the extended form, allows it to return violently to its true form and deal damage to creatures within a 5-foot radius, inflicting 4 thunder damage (1d8) normally and 9 damage (2d8) if it has previously extended its reach. Affected creatures can attempt a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage, and if they are deafened, they can make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of their turns to end the deafening effect.

As a bonus action, the Catterball can "Change Form," giving it versatility in combat. It can roll into a ball to extend its reach, increasing the melee reach of its slam attack by 5 feet (up to a maximum of 15 feet), at the cost of lowering its Armor Class by 1. This flexibility allows it to adapt quickly to different combat scenarios, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers who face it.
