The Black Dragon Wyrmling is a young, medium-sized dragon that possesses deadly abilities and a cunning nature. As a creature of the dark waters, it is both agile and formidable, capable of flight and swimming, which adds to its versatile combat strategies. With an Armor Class of 17, it can withstand a good amount of damage, while its Hit Points total 44, enabling it to endure in battle. This dragon has a Challenge Rating of 2, making it a moderate threat in encounters, providing 450 XP upon defeat. Notably, it has a damage immunity to acid, which makes it very resilient against certain types of attacks. Despite its vulnerabilities, it presents a significant challenge due to its combination of speed, stealth, and potent offensive capabilities, particularly its Acid Breath ability.

The Black Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: Strength at 14 (+2 modifier, good), Dexterity at 16 (+3 modifier, very good), Constitution at 12 (+1 modifier, average), Intelligence at 10 (+0 modifier, average), Wisdom at 10 (+0 modifier, average), and Charisma at 12 (+1 modifier, average). These attributes contribute to its effective combat maneuvers and its ability to navigate through stealthy situations, especially considering its skill in Stealth (+5, exceptional) and perception (+2, average). 

Its special abilities further enhance its prowess. With the Ambusher ability, when it is submerged in water, the Black Dragon Wyrmling has advantage on Stealth checks, making it particularly dangerous when lurking in aquatic environments. Additionally, it possesses the Amphibious trait, allowing it to breathe both air and water, which grants it flexibility in various combat situations, whether on land or underwater.

In terms of actions, the Black Dragon Wyrmling can make a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and can target one enemy, inflicting 13 (2d10 + 2) piercing damage on a successful hit, representing a solid offensive option. 

The Wyrmling’s signature attack is its Acid Breath ability, which has a recharge mechanic requiring a roll of 5 or 6 on a d6 to become available again. The dragon can exhale a line of sizzling acid measuring 20 feet long and 5 feet wide, forcing any creature in that area to make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (3d8) acid damage, or half as much if it succeeds. This powerful area attack is particularly devastating, allowing the Wyrmling to control the battlefield and deal significant damage to multiple foes simultaneously, making it a fearsome opponent in combat scenarios.
