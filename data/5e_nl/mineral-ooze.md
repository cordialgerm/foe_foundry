The Mineral Ooze is a Large, neutral ooze that serves as a unique adversary in encounters, particularly effective in ambush scenarios due to its deceptive appearance and ability to restrain enemies. With a relatively low Armor Class of 9, it compensates with a high hit point total of 76, providing it with resilience in battle. Its challenge rating of 3 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly when it can utilize its grappling and encasing abilities to capture and neutralize foes. The ooze is particularly well-defended against damage types such as acid, cold, and fire. However, its weaknesses include a slow movement speed of only 20 feet and poor dexterity, making it vulnerable to ranged attacks from quick adversaries.

The Mineral Ooze has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 14, which gives it a modifier of +2, rated as good for melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, considered bad, limiting its effectiveness in avoiding attacks.
- Constitution: 18, with a +4 modifier, rated as exceptional, providing significant hit points and resistance to being incapacitated.
- Intelligence: 1, representing a -5 modifier, rated as very bad, indicating it cannot engage in complex problem-solving.
- Wisdom: 5, giving a -3 modifier, rated as very bad, which affects its ability to perceive threats effectively.
- Charisma: 3, resulting in a -4 modifier, rated as very bad, indicating it lacks social interaction abilities.

In combat, the Mineral Ooze has access to the following special abilities and actions that enhance its threat level: 

The ability to be Amorphous allows the ooze to squeeze through narrow openings, making it a challenging opponent in tight spaces or for foes who rely on closed environments. Its False Appearance ability enables it to blend into its surroundings when motionless, making ambush tactics very effective.

Mineralize is a powerful bonus action that the ooze can take when it has encased a creature. This action transforms its body into a hardened, stone-like state, reducing its speed to 5 feet while gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The ooze remains in this state until the encased creature perishes or the ooze voluntarily ends the effect.

In terms of actions during combat, the Mineral Ooze can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two melee slam attacks. If both attacks successfully hit a Medium or smaller target, the ooze can grapple that target, making it easier to follow up with the Encase action.

The Pseudopod attack is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, allowing the ooze to strike at reach with a total potential damage of 6 bludgeoning damage and an additional 3 acid damage, adding versatility to its single-target damage potential.

The Encase ability is particularly dangerous for enemies, as it captures a grappled Medium or smaller creature. An encased target suffers from blindness and restraint conditions and cannot breathe, necessitating a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the ooze's turns to avoid taking acid damage. This ability allows the ooze to control individual threats effectively. If the ooze moves, the encased creature moves with it, further complicating escape attempts and potentially placing the creature in harm's way. An encased creature can attempt to escape through a Strength check, but this becomes more difficult if the ooze is mineralized, as it imposes disadvantage on the check.

Overall, the Mineral Ooze is a formidable opponent that combines resilience, control, and effective damage output, making it a significant challenge for adventurers who encounter it.
