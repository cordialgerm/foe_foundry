The Clockwork Weaving Spider is a tiny, unaligned construct that embodies the intricate machinery and artistry of a clockwork design. With an Armor Class of 15 and 30 hit points, it is moderately resilient, making it a challenging opponent for low-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its high Dexterity score of 16, which grants it a good modifier of +3, allowing it to evade many attacks and granting higher chances for successful strikes in combat. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are quite low, with modifiers of -1, indicating average understanding and interaction capabilities. The spider excels in mobility and agility, evidenced by its speed of 40 feet and proficiency in Acrobatics, where it has an exceptional modifier of +5, while also possessing a good passive Perception of 13.

The Clockwork Weaving Spider has certain immunities that enhance its difficulty as an adversary. It is completely immune to poison and psychic damage, as well as various conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or frightened. This makes it a very resilient foe, as it can function effectively in situations where most creatures would be incapacitated. Its sensory capabilities include darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in the dark, albeit with a passive insight only average for its level.

One of its notable special abilities, "Construct Nature," indicates that it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, which is beneficial for encounters in hazardous environments. The "Immutable Form" ability grants it immunity to any spell or effect that attempts to alter its form, ensuring its mechanical integrity during combat. Additionally, "Magic Resistance" gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it more difficult for spellcasters to affect it.

In terms of its unique "Unmaking" ability, the Clockwork Weaving Spider can damage nonmagical objects made of cloth, leather, or paper with its attacks. If its attack roll exceeds the target's Armor Class by 5 or more, the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in one nonmagical item becoming damaged and unusable until repaired, making it a significant threat to adventurers carrying essential items.

In combat, the spider can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two Trimming Blade attacks or two Poisoned Needle Shuttle attacks in one turn. The "Trimming Blade" is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, dealing an average of 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage upon a successful strike. This makes it effective in close quarters. The "Poisoned Needle Shuttle" is a ranged attack with the same +5 to hit and a range of 30 feet, inflicting 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. Importantly, if the target is hit, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for one minute, with the opportunity to repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns. This paralysis effect could turn the tide of combat, rendering a target helpless while the spider or its allies engage without resistance.
