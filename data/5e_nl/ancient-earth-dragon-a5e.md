The False Appearance ability makes the dragon indistinguishable from rocky terrain when motionless, providing a perfect camouflage. Its Legendary Resistance, usable three times per day, enables it to succeed on failed saving throws, although this causes its mobility to be halved temporarily. The Essence Link ability ties it spiritually to a specific landmark, meaning it cannot recover from fatigue unless resting near this location. This connection also affects the surrounding area if the dragon perishes, causing fatigue and strife to intruders until a new essence dragon appears.

The dragon's innate spellcasting relies on Charisma with a save DC of 17. It can cast spells such as Locate Animals or Plants and Spike Growth three times per day each.

The dragon's Scouring Breath breath weapon, which recharges on a 5-6, deals significant slashing damage in a cone, emphasizing the dragon's area control and ability to blind opponents. The Rock Spire ability summons a magical spire that can injure and restrain targets, highlighting the dragon's capacity to control the battlefield physically.
