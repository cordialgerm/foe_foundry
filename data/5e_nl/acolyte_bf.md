The Acolyte is a Medium humanoid creature that serves a supportive role in encounters, often acting as a healer or buffer for allies. Its strengths lie in its ability to provide advantages in crucial situations, primarily through its special ability, Divine Providence, which enhances the survivability of nearby allies during death saves. However, with an Armor Class of 10 and only 15 hit points, the Acolyte is quite vulnerable in combat, making it important for them to stay protected during battles. The Acolyte has a Challenge Rating of 1/4, indicating that it is a low-level threat but can be quite beneficial when strategically utilized in group settings.

The Acolyte has the following attributes: Strength +0 (average), Dexterity +0 (average), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence +0 (average), Wisdom +4 (very good), and Charisma +0 (average). With a Wisdom modifier of +4, the Acolyte excels in Wisdom-based checks and saving throws, particularly in their spellcasting capabilities.

The Acolyte's special ability, Divine Providence, allows each friendly creature within 20 feet that is not a Construct or Undead to have advantage on death saving throws. This effect is particularly useful in dire situations where characters are on the brink of death, significantly improving their chances of recovering.

In terms of actions, the Acolyte can make a melee weapon attack with a mace, which has a +2 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it inflicts 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic or radiant damage, depending on the Acolyte’s selection. This makes the mace a modest offensive option.

For ranged attacks, the Acolyte can use Radiant Bolt, making a ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit and a range of 60 feet. Upon a successful hit, it deals 6 (1d4 + 4) radiant damage, making it a decent choice for attacking foes from a distance.

As a spellcaster, the Acolyte can utilize its Wisdom as the spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 13. The Acolyte has access to various spells that enhance their support capabilities: 
- At will, they can cast Light, which creates a bright light in a specific area, and Thaumaturgy, allowing them minor magical effects that can influence the environment or create sounds. 
- They can cast Bless three times a day, granting allies a bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, making this spell a key part of their role in buffing teammates. 
- Cure Wounds, also available three times a day, allows the Acolyte to heal an ally, which can swing the outcome of battles. 
- Sanctuary can be cast three times per day, protecting a target from attacks and making it harder for enemies to target that character directly.

Overall, the Acolyte plays an essential role in enhancing the performance and survivability of its allies, although its own defenses are quite weak, requiring careful positioning in combat.
