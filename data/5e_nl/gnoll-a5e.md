The Gnoll is a medium humanoid creature known for its aggressive nature and teamwork in combat, making it a formidable opponent despite its relatively low challenge rating of 1/2, which grants it 100 experience points. With an Armor Class of 14 and 22 hit points, the Gnoll can withstand a fair amount of damage. Its physical attributes show a preferred strength score of 14, granting it a good modifier of +2, while its dexterity is average with a score of 12 and a +1 modifier. However, its intelligence and wisdom are both low, at 10 and 8 respectively, giving it average and bad modifiers, which limits its effectiveness in skill checks and spellcasting. The Gnoll is equipped with a unique ability called Pack Tactics, allowing it to gain advantage on attack rolls when fighting alongside allies. This means it’s more likely to hit its target when in a group, enhancing its overall threat level during combat.

The Gnoll's attributes include a Strength of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 12 (+1), Constitution of 10 (+0), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 8 (-1), and Charisma of 10 (+0). The strength score indicates that the Gnoll is capable of delivering strong melee attacks, while its dexterity allows for some agility. However, its low wisdom score affects its perception capability, providing only a passive perception of 9, which is considered bad compared to many other creatures.

In combat, the Gnoll utilizes a spear for both melee and ranged attacks. The spear attack has a +4 to hit, meaning it has a good chance of successfully striking its target. With a reach of 5 feet for melee or a range of 20/60 feet for ranged attacks, the spear deals a standard 5 piercing damage on a successful hit, making it an effective weapon for the Gnoll. 

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Gnoll can make a Rampaging Bite attack against any creature that has been bloodied, which means it has previously taken damage. This bite attack also has a +4 to hit and deals a damage of 4 piercing damage. This ability benefits from the overall combat strategy of focusing on weakened enemies to maximize the Gnoll's damage output.

Overall, the Gnoll's strengths lie in its agility in battle, strong teamwork through Pack Tactics, manageable damage output, and capability to capitalize on weakened foes, while its weaknesses primarily stem from low wisdom and lack of versatility in skills or spells.
