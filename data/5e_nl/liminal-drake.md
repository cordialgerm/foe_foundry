The Liminal Drake is a large, neutral evil dragon renowned for its manipulation of space and its devastating attacks. This creature can fly and hover effectively, allowing it to navigate combat zones with great flexibility. With a robust Armor Class of 17 and a total of 204 hit points, the Liminal Drake is durable in battle. It possesses an impressive Dexterity score of 24, granting it a very good plus seven modifier, which enhances its ability to evade attacks. However, its Strength score is relatively low at 7, resulting in a very bad minus two modifier, limiting its physical melee capabilities. A challenge rating of 14 indicates that it poses a significant threat to adventurers, offering 11,500 experience points to those who can defeat it.

The attributes of the Liminal Drake include Strength at 7 (-2), Dexterity at 24 (+7), Constitution at 16 (+3), Intelligence at 15 (+2), Wisdom at 18 (+4), and Charisma at 17 (+3). Its saving throw bonuses for Constitution and Wisdom are +8 and +9 respectively, both of which are considered good. The drake has specific immunities to cold damage and resistances to several elemental damage types, including acid, fire, lightning, radiant, and thunder damage, as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Conditions such as exhaustion, fear, grappling, paralysis, petrification, poisoning, being prone, and being restrained do not affect the Liminal Drake, making it exceptionally resilient. The creature has darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive Perception score of 14, allowing it to perceive hidden threats effectively.

In combat, the Liminal Drake has unique special abilities that enhance its strategy. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, incurring some force damage only if it ends its turn inside an object. The Nauseating Luminance ability can incapacitate any creature that can see the drake within 60 feet unless they succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw; this can significantly hinder an opponentâ€™s effectiveness during their turn. Creatures can avoid this effect by averting their eyes, but they must be wary of encountering the drake later, as looking back at it will force another saving throw. Lastly, the Void Dweller ability highlights its cosmic nature, enabling it to traverse vast distances with ease.

During its turn, the Liminal Drake can use its Multiattack feature, allowing it to perform three separate attacks: one bite and two claws. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +12 to hit, dealing 14 piercing damage plus 18 cold damage on a hit. Its Claw attack similarly has a +12 to hit, inflicting 10 slashing damage along with 9 cold damage. Once per short rest, the drake can unleash its Stellar Breath, a powerful attack that covers a 30-foot cone, forcing affected creatures to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take significant damage consisting of 18 fire damage and 18 radiant damage, with halved damage on a successful save. Furthermore, the drake's Warp Space ability allows it to shift to a different plane as a form of teleportation using a mechanic similar to the plane shift spell, although it can only affect itself.

Overall, the Liminal Drake commands respect and fear on the battlefield, capable of devastating attacks and employing unique abilities that can disrupt and incapacitate its foes.
