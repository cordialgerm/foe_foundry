The deer is a Medium beast known for its agility and keen senses. With an Armor Class of 13, it has a moderate level of protection, making it somewhat difficult to hit in combat. The creature has 4 hit points, which signifies its fragility in battle; a single successful attack from many adversaries could take it down. It boasts a remarkable walking speed of 50 feet, allowing it to maneuver quickly on the battlefield. The challenge rating of 0 indicates that the deer poses negligible difficulty for adventurers, making it suitable for low-level encounters or as a target for tracking and hunting. Key strengths of the deer include its exceptional Dexterity, which contributes to its swift movements and enhanced ability to avoid danger, as well as its keen sense of smell, which allows it to detect threats from a distance. However, its overall combat capabilities are limited due to its low Strength and poor mental attributes.

The deer's attributes are as follows: 

- Strength (STR): 10, with a modifier of +0, which is average for physical strength. 
- Dexterity (DEX): 16, with a modifier of +3, indicating very good agility and reflexes. 
- Constitution (CON): 10, with a modifier of +0, which is average and reflects its resilience. 
- Intelligence (INT): 2, with a modifier of -4, demonstrating very bad cognitive abilities. 
- Wisdom (WIS): 14, with a modifier of +2, showing good perception and insight. 
- Charisma (CHA): 4, with a modifier of -3, revealing very bad social skills.

The deer possesses a passive Perception of 12, which means it is reasonably alert to its surroundings but not overly perceptive. The creature does not understand any languages.

One of the special abilities of the deer is "Keen Smell." This ability provides the deer with advantage on Perception checks that rely on its sense of smell, allowing it to more effectively sense hidden or approaching threats.

In terms of actions, the deer can perform two types of melee attacks: 

- **Bite:** The deer can make a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit, which is good, but it only deals 1 piercing damage on a hit. 
- **Headbutt:** The deer can also execute a headbutt, which similarly has a +2 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 2 piercing damage (1d4), making it slightly more effective than a bite, though still minimal.

Overall, the deer is primarily a prey animal rather than a combatant and lacks formidable offensive or defensive capabilities in a D&D encounter.
