The Spawn of Akyishigal is a medium-sized chaotic evil fiend, embodying a mixture of cunning and malice. With a solid armor class of 15 and a hefty pool of hit points totaling 119, it presents a formidable challenge for adventurers. This creature boasts impressive physical and magical resilience, with notable damage immunities and resistances. The Spawn excels in manipulating the battlefield through its command over lesser beasts, making it particularly dangerous in environments teeming with insectoid life forms. While its physical attacks can inflict significant damage, its true strength lies in its ability to summon swarms of allies and its inherent magic resistance, which gives it an edge in confronting spellcasters. However, its Intelligence is average, which could limit its strategic options in more cerebral contests.

The Spawn of Akyishigal has the following attributes: Strength is 15, granting a modifier of +2, which is good for melee combat. Dexterity stands at 13 with a +1 modifier, presenting an average agility. Constitution boasts a score of 19, resulting in a +4 modifier, making it very good at sustaining damage. Intelligence is rated at 10, with a +0 modifier, indicating average intelligence. Wisdom and Charisma are both slightly above average, sitting at 11 and 12 respectively, with modifiers of +0 and +1.

In terms of defenses, the Spawn has a saving throw bonus of +4 to Dexterity checks, which is good for evading attacks. It has immunities to poison damage and is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning, showcasing its ability to endure various forms of damage. The Spawn is also immune to the poisoned condition, providing additional resilience against certain effects.

The Spawn of Akyishigal possesses two significant special abilities. The first is "Command Vermin," which allows it to exert control over insectoid beasts within a 30-foot radius that have an Intelligence of 2 or lower and are not already controlled by another being. This command influences the beasts to act according to the Spawn’s will, often leading them into danger without regard for their safety. The second ability is "Magic Resistance," which grants the Spawn advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, increasing its survivability against magic users.

In combat, the Spawn can utilize a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike with one Bite and two Sting attacks during its turn. Its Bite attack benefits from a +5 to hit and can deal 7 piercing damage. The more potent Sting attack, also with a +5 to hit, inflicts a total of 14 damage—11 piercing and 3 poison damage. Furthermore, targets hit by the Sting must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being poisoned until the end of their next turn, which can severely hinder their ability to act. 

The Spawn can unleash "Swarming Cough" three times per day, releasing a swarm of insects that serve as allies. These swarms follow the Spawn’s commands, acting immediately after it in combat. Each swarm remains in play for up to one minute unless dismissed, and the Spawn can control up to two swarms at any time. This ability not only bolsters the Spawn’s offensive capabilities but also complicates combat for its enemies, as they must contend with multiple threats at once.
