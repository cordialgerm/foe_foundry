The Weretiger is a medium humanoid lycanthrope known for its ability to shift between its human form, a tiger-humanoid hybrid, and a large tiger. This creature presents a moderate challenge in combat with a balanced combination of strength, dexterity, and constitution, making it quite capable in physical confrontations. Its challenge rating of 2 indicates that it can be a formidable opponent for lower-level parties. Notably, the Weretiger is immune to damage from nonmagical and non-silvered weapons, allowing it to withstand typical attacks unless the attackers are prepared. However, it is vulnerable to wolfsbane, which can poison it while in its hybrid or beast forms, providing a tactical opportunity for characters who know how to exploit this weakness.

The Weretiger has the following attributes: strength of 16 (+3), dexterity of 16 (+3), constitution of 16 (+3), intelligence of 10 (+0), wisdom of 12 (+1), and charisma of 10 (+0). This distribution gives the Weretiger exceptional physical capabilities while keeping its mental attributes average. It has good skills in perception (+3) and stealth (+5), making it a stealthy hunter in the wild. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet but only in its tiger or hybrid forms. Its passive perception score of 15 indicates an ability to notice hidden threats effectively.

Its special abilities include Keen Hearing and Smell, which grants the Weretiger advantage on Perception checks that rely on these senses. This means the Weretiger is particularly good at detecting prey or potential ambushes. Another notable ability, Wolfsbane, allows it to be poisoned if within proximity to the wolfsbane flower, creating a strategic element where players can utilize wolfsbane to cripple its effectiveness in battle. Additionally, weapons or ammunition treated with wolfsbane can damage the Weretiger as if they were silvered, bypassing its damage immunity.

In combat, the Weretiger can take a Multiattack action when in humanoid or hybrid form, making two attacks on its turn. When using a longsword or longbow, it has a +5 to hit and can deal 7 (1d8 + 3) damage on a successful hit. In its tiger or hybrid forms, it can use its claws to inflict the same damage, but if it moves at least 20 feet in a straight line towards a target, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or fall prone, setting the target up for further attacks. The Weretiger's bite attack, also available in these forms, can deal 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage and potentially curse humanoid targets with weretiger lycanthropy on a failed DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

The Weretiger can use a bonus action to Shapeshift, allowing it to switch between its various forms without changing its statistics, though it cannot speak while in tiger form. If it chooses to use Opportune Bite, it can attack a prone creature, reflecting its predatory nature. When bloodied, it can unleash a Frenzied Bite as a bonus action, becoming even more dangerous as its health diminishes, demonstrating its tenacity in combat. These traits make the Weretiger a versatile and predatory foe, equally at home in human-like deception and primal savagery.
