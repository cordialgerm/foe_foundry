With a challenge rating of 8, the Hound of Tindalos is designed for encounters that yield 3,900 experience points, emphasizing its status as a high-level enemy. Notably, it can navigate sharp corners to teleport, making it quite unpredictable.

In terms of attributes, the Hound possesses Strength at 18, providing it with a good modifier of +4. Its Dexterity is exceptionally high at 22, granting a fantastic +6 modifier, which enhances its agility and finesse in combat scenarios. The creature's Constitution of 18 also contributes a good +4 modifier, bolstering its hit points. Intelligence stands at a moderate 14, translating to an average +2 modifier. Wisdom is at 16, giving it a good +3 modifier, while it also has strong Charisma at 18, which results in a good +4 modifier. 

The Hound of Tindalos excels in saving throws with a +7 modifier for Constitution and a +6 modifier for Wisdom, illustrating its resilience against physical and mental attacks, which can be classified as good effectiveness. The creature's skill proficiencies include acrobatics with a +9 modifier and perception at +6, indicating a high level of agility and awareness.

The Hound is immune to cold, psychic, and poison damage while resistant to necrotic damage. It is also immune to exhaustion and poisoned conditions, which provides it with an edge in combat and survivability. Its enhanced senses include darkvision extending up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 16, enabling it to detect enemies in low-light conditions. The creature communicates using Void Speech, a language that might be difficult for most adventurers to comprehend.

One of the Hound’s defining traits is its ability called "Entrance by Corners." This ability allows it to teleport between sharp corners as a bonus action, providing it with great maneuverability on the battlefield. Additionally, its "Keen Smell" grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on smell, making it very adept in tracking enemies. The Hound also exhibits "Magic Resistance," granting it advantage on saving throws against spells.

In terms of physical attacks, the Hound has a special ability called "Pounce." If it moves at least 15 feet toward a target and successfully strikes with a claw attack, the creature can force the target to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the Hound gains an additional attack with its tongue as a bonus action, enhancing its combat efficiency.

When it comes to basic attacks, the Hound of Tindalos can utilize "Multiattack," allowing it to make two claw attacks and one bite attack in a single turn. The damage output for the bite attack is +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 14 piercing damage on a hit. Its claw attack shares the same attack bonus and reach, doing 11 slashing damage. The tongue attack, also at +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, deals 7 piercing damage plus an additional 7 necrotic damage. The necrotic damage aspect reduces the target's maximum hit points by the same amount until the target finishes a long rest, which can potentially lead to the target's demise if their maximum hit points drop to zero.

Lastly, the "Hunter of the Lost" ability allows the Hound to transport itself to a different plane of existence, functioning similarly to the plane shift spell but limited to itself. This capability makes it an excellent escape artist and adds an additional layer of unpredictability to its behavior in combat.
