The Hongaek is a large, neutral evil elemental with a significant presence in combat, featuring a blend of offensive abilities and unique traits that make it a formidable foe. With a Challenge Rating of 8, it presents a tough challenge for adventurers, possessing high Dexterity and a range of immunities and resistances that make it hard to damage. Spellcasting adds to its versatility, enabling strategic manipulation of the battlefield. Its significant weaknesses include vulnerability to fire damage, while its ability to become invisible and move through tight spaces grants it an edge in ambush and retreat scenarios.

The Hongaek has an Armor Class of 15, making it reasonably resilient against attacks. It has 105 hit points, calculated as 14d10+28, providing a solid buffer against damage. Its movement capabilities are notable, as it can fly at 40 feet and hover, but it cannot walk. This aerial mobility allows it to engage or evade enemies effectively. 

The Hongaek has the following ability scores:
- Strength: 5, which results in a very bad strength modifier of -3, indicating that it is not physically powerful.
- Dexterity: 20, granting a very good modifier of +5, allowing it to dodge attacks effectively and act swiftly in combat.
- Constitution: 14, resulting in an average modifier of +2, contributing to its durability.
- Intelligence: 12, leading to an average modifier of +1, reflecting basic cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 15, with a good modifier of +2, offering better perception and insight.
- Charisma: 13, yielding a modest modifier of +1, which is decent for spellcasting.

In terms of skills, the Hongaek is proficient in Medicine and Perception (both +5), indicating it can effectively aid in healing or identifying threats, along with Stealth (+8), which allows it to remain concealed when necessary. It possesses several damage vulnerabilities, particularly to fire, while being immune to poison damage. Additionally, it resists lightning and thunder damage, as well as most forms of physical damage dealt by non-magical weapons. It is immune to a wide range of conditions, including being blinded, exhausted, or poisoned, which makes it quite resilient in various encounters. The creature has blindsight within a 90-foot radius and a passive Perception score of 15, allowing it to detect foes even without sight.

The languages spoken by the Hongaek include Auran, Common, and Deep Speech, enabling communication with various beings or creatures encountered.

Among its special abilities, the Hongaek can use Exacerbate Affliction, granting it advantage on attack rolls against creatures suffering from a disease or poisoned condition, enhancing its lethality against afflicted opponents. The ability called Gas Form allows it to move through tight spaces, emphasizing its intangible nature, while restricting movement through water or other liquids. Prolong Affliction significantly impacts nearby afflicted creatures, imposing disadvantage on their saving throws against diseases or poisons and allowing the Hongaek to detect them within 30 feet.

In terms of spellcasting, it has the ability to cast the spell Contagion once per day. This spell is particularly potent, as it can inflict a debilitating disease on a target, severely impacting their performance in battle.

For its actions, the Hongaek employs a Multiattack option, making two attacks with its tentacles each turn. Each Vaporous Tentacle attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, causing 18 (4d8) poison damage on a successful hit. Additionally, the target of the attack must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one minute, resulting in further complications for affected characters. Finally, the Hongaek can become invisible at will until it attacks or casts a spell, allowing it strategic advantages during encounters, as it can reposition or ambush foes without being detected. Any equipment it carries is also rendered invisible, enhancing its stealth capabilities.
