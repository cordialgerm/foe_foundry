The Red Dragon Wyrmling is a fierce and fearsome creature, embodying the raw elemental power of fire with its dragon lineage. As a Medium-sized dragon, it has a significant presence in combat, showcasing a good mix of offensive abilities and defensive capabilities. With an Armor Class of 17 and 75 hit points, it is reasonably durable for its Challenge Rating of 4, making it a formidable foe for adventurers. Its strengths lie in its high Strength score of 18, which grants it an exceptional melee attack, as well as its immunity to fire damage. However, its Dexterity and Intelligence are more average, providing it with moderate agility and intellect, making it less effective in ranged combat and problem-solving situations. Overall, the Red Dragon Wyrmling remains a strong opponent, particularly in fiery environments where it can leverage its special abilities.

The Red Dragon Wyrmling possesses the following attributes: 

- Strength of 18 (+4), which is exceptional, enhancing its melee attack capability significantly.
- Dexterity of 12 (+1), considered average, contributing a slight boost to its agility and stealth.
- Constitution of 16 (+3), which is good, improving its hit points and overall durability in combat.
- Intelligence of 12 (+1), average, providing no significant edge in intellectual challenges.
- Wisdom of 10 (+0), very bad, making it susceptible to effects targeting perception and insight.
- Charisma of 14 (+2), good, which aids in intimidation and social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Red Dragon Wyrmling excels at intimidation with a +4 modifier, making its threats quite imposing. It has a +2 modifier in perception, allowing it to notice hidden creatures or objects moderately well, and a +3 in stealth, giving it a decent chance to remain undetected when needed. It is immune to fire damage, which immunizes it from one of the most common damage types in the game. Its blindsight of 10 feet and darkvision of 60 feet allow it to effectively perceive its surroundings in poorly lit conditions, while its passive perception score of 12 reflects its ability to notice things passively without active searching. The creature communicates in Draconic.

One of its special abilities is the "Volcanic Tyrant," allowing it immunity to poisonous gases from volcanic environments, effectively assuring that it can navigate such hazardous terrains without penalty.

In combat, the Red Dragon Wyrmling can take the following actions:

- **Bite:** This is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 20 (3d10 + 4) piercing damage, which is quite substantial and can take down weaker foes quickly.

- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** This powerful ability allows the dragon to exhale a cone of fire that extends 15 feet. Creatures within this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they take 24 (7d6) fire damage; on a successful save, they take half damage. The recharge mechanics add a layer of strategy, as the dragon can only use this ability again after rolling a 5 or 6 on its recharge check.

Overall, the Red Dragon Wyrmling presents a balanced challenge, capable of dealing high damage both in melee and with its fiery breath, making it a dangerous opponent for adventurers encountering it.
