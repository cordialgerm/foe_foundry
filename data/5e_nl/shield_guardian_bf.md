The Shield Guardian is a large construct known for its powerful defensive abilities and strong offense. It stands as a protector for its amulet's wearer, possessing high durability with a solid Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 139. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it presents a significant challenge in combat. The creature has several extraordinary traits that make it an effective guardian, such as the ability to absorb half of the damage suffered by its wearer, immunity to various conditions, and a regenerative power that allows it to recover Hit Points. However, its intelligence is low, making it somewhat disadvantageous in situations requiring complex decision-making or strategy.

The Shield Guardian has the following attributes: Strength at +4 (good), Dexterity at -1 (bad), Constitution at +4 (good), Intelligence at -2 (very bad), Wisdom at +2 (average), and Charisma at -4 (very bad). This makes it formidable in terms of physical strength and durability but lacking in flexibility and social interactions. Its senses include keen sight within 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings in low light, while its Perception score is a 12, indicating an average ability to notice hidden details. It has a Stealth modifier of 9, which is fairly below average for a creature in combat but may still benefit from situations requiring surprise or stealth. The Shield Guardian understands the languages of its creator and the wearer of its amulet, though it cannot speak.

Among the Shield Guardian's special abilities, **Bound** is notable; it is magically tied to an amulet, enabling the guardian to know the wearer's location as long as they are on the same plane. If called, it can teleport to a position close to the wearer after one minute, providing swift protection when needed. Additionally, while within 60 feet of the wearer, it can absorb half of the damage that the wearer would receive, making it an excellent shield in battle. Its **Construct Nature** makes it immune to the needs of living creatures, allowing it to function without air, food, drink, or sleep. The **Construct Resilience** ability provides immunity to poison and psychic damage along with several detrimental conditions, enhancing its survivability in combat. **Regeneration** allows the Shield Guardian to recover 10 Hit Points at the start of its turn, as long as it is not reduced to 0 HP. Lastly, the **Spell Storing** ability allows a spellcaster wearing the guardian's amulet to store one spell of 4th level or lower, which the guardian can cast upon command or when specific conditions are met, adding versatility to its combat capabilities.

In terms of actions, the Shield Guardian can execute a **Multiattack**, where it can either make two melee attacks with its **Runed Fist** or three ranged attacks with its **Rune Bolt**. The **Runed Fist** is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit, possesses a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 13 bludgeoning damage plus 14 force damage on a hit, making it a formidable threat up close. The **Rune Bolt** serves as a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit and a range of 60 feet, capable of inflicting an average of 16 force damage upon a successful hit.

As a **Bonus Action**, the Shield Guardian can utilize **Protective Step** to teleport up to 60 feet to a visible unoccupied space near the wearer of its amulet, ensuring it is always close to provide defense. In response to threats, it can use its **Shield** reaction to offer a +2 bonus to the wearerâ€™s Armor Class if the guardian is within 5 feet, providing enhanced protection during enemy attacks.
