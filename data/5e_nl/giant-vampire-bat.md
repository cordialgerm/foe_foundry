The Giant Vampire Bat is a large, unaligned beast that serves as a formidable foe in combat, primarily using its flying ability and biting attack to incapacitate its enemies. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it offers a moderate challenge for adventurers, boasting decent Armor Class and Hit Points. The bat's strengths lie in its high Strength and Dexterity, allowing it to effectively engage in melee combat and dodge attacks. However, it has poor Intelligence and Charisma scores, making it less effective in social interactions and problem-solving scenarios. Its notable abilities include echolocation, which provides it with a strong sensory advantage in its environment, and it can recover health by dealing necrotic damage with its bite.

The Giant Vampire Bat has the following attributes: Strength is 16, which grants it a +3 modifier considered very good. Dexterity is also 16, which provides the bat with another +3 modifier, also very good. Constitution is 14, giving it a +2 modifier that is good. Intelligence is 2, resulting in a -4 modifier which is very bad. Wisdom is 12, providing a +1 modifier that is average. Finally, Charisma is 6, leading to a -2 modifier, also very bad. 

In terms of skills, the bat does not have any specific proficiencies, but it utilizes its keen senses. It has blindsight with a range of 60 feet, which allows it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, although this ability is inhibited if the bat is deafened. The bat also has a passive Perception score of 11, which is relatively average. Additionally, it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that relate to hearing, thanks to its keen hearing ability.

For actions, the Giant Vampire Bat can perform a melee bite attack. This attack has a +5 to hit, indicating a good chance of successfully landing the hit on its target. The reach of the bite is 5 feet, and upon a successful hit, the bat deals 6 points of piercing damage along with 7 points of necrotic damage, totaling 13 damage on a successful hit. If the target is hit, it is also grappled, which means it cannot move away without escaping the grapple. The escape DC for this grapple is 13. While grappling its victim, the bat cannot attack any other targets and instead regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage it has dealt, making it a potent threat in prolonged encounters.
