The Nalfeshnee is a formidable Large Fiend, embodying the essence of chaos and evil in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. With a high Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of 184 hit points, it can endure significant damage before succumbing in battle. This creature is proficient in both melee and magical combat, making it a versatile threat to any adventurer. With a Challenge Rating of 13, it presents a considerable challenge, capable of dealing heavy damage with its melee attacks as well as powerful area-of-effect spells. However, its speed is somewhat sluggish, only moving 20 feet on the ground and 30 feet while flying, which can be a weakness if it faces more agile opponents. The Nalfeshnee uses both its physical prowess and its magical abilities to dominate the battlefield, making it a dangerous foe when encountered.

The Nalfeshnee has the following attributes: Strength is 20 with a modifier of +5, making it exceptionally strong; Dexterity is 16 with a +3 modifier, indicating good reflexes; Constitution is 22 with +6, reflecting its exceptional toughness; Intelligence is 20 with +5, showcasing its cunning and tactical awareness; Wisdom is 16 with +3, showing a good degree of insight; and Charisma is also 16 with +3, highlighting its menacing presence. Its saving throws are formidable: Strength +10, Constitution +11, Intelligence +10, Wisdom +8, and Charisma +8, each representing good effectiveness against attempts to debilitate it. The creature has immunities to poison damage and conditions, resisting cold, fire, and lightning damage as well as damage from nonmagical weapons, making it exceptionally resilient against a variety of attacks. It possesses truesight, allowing it to see through illusions and invisibility up to 120 feet away, and understands Abyssal while being able to communicate telepathically within the same range.

Among its special abilities, the Nalfeshnee radiates a Chaotic Evil aura, reinforcing its nature. It also benefits from Magic Resistance, giving it advantage on saving throws against spells, which increases its survivability against casters. Its actions in combat include the Multiattack, where it can make both bite and claws attacks. The bite attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 32 piercing damage. Notably, if it uses this attack on a dead non-demon creature, it regains 27 hit points and recharges its Horror Nimbus ability, allowing for strategic play in combat. The claws attack is equally potent, also with +10 to hit but dealing 31 slashing damage.

The Chaos Blast ability allows the Nalfeshnee to unleash beams of multicolored light in a 15-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of itself. Any creature without a Chaotic alignment must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take a substantial 52 force damage on failure, or half damage on success, potentially resetting the battlefield dynamics by causing widespread harm.

As a bonus action, the Nalfeshnee can activate Horror Nimbus once a day. This ability causes it to glow with an unholy radiance, forcing creatures within 15 feet that can see it to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Failing this save results in the creature being frightened for one minute, significantly affecting their ability to fight. Victims can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect. Additionally, the Nalfeshnee has the ability to teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, providing exceptional mobility and allowing it to reposition strategically during combat.
