The Winter Hag is a Medium Fey creature that embodies the mystique and power of winter, making her a formidable opponent in combat. With an impressive armor class of 17 and 120 hit points, she is tough to take down, and her challenge rating of 7 signifies that she is suitable for a party of relatively experienced adventurers. Her greatest strengths lie in her strong melee and ranged attacks, as well as her potent spellcasting abilities, allowing her to manipulate the battlefield and control the flow of combat. However, her reliance on spells and the potential vulnerabilities of her innate magic may provide opportunities for cunning players to exploit her weaknesses.

The Winter Hag has the following ability scores: Strength 18 (+4, which is very good), Dexterity 16 (+3, which is good), Constitution 16 (+3, which is good), Intelligence 16 (+3, which is good), Wisdom 16 (+3, which is good), and Charisma 18 (+4, which is very good). Her saving throws include a +6 to Constitution and Wisdom, showing above-average resilience against physical and mental effects. She also possesses a selection of skills that make her both a deceptive and perceptive entity, with proficiency in arcana, deception, insight, perception, and stealth, all at +6 or +7, indicating strong capabilities in these areas.

Defensively, the Winter Hag has resistance to cold damage, enhancing her survivability against icy attacks. Her darkvision grants her the ability to see in dim light within a 60-foot radius, and her passive perception of 16 allows her to notice hidden creatures and objects easily. The Winter Hag can communicate in Common, Draconic, and Sylvan, which enables her to interact with a variety of beings.

One of her notable special abilities is the Curse, which affects any creature that accepts a gift from the hag. This curse lasts for 30 days, during which the victim fails saving throws against her charm person, geas, and scrying spells automatically. The hag can also utilize control weather centered on the cursed creature, further complicating the situation for her enemies.

Icy Travel is another advantage, enabling her to move freely through cold weather, snow, and ice without being hindered. This ability allows her and her allies to leave no trace while walking on such surfaces, adding to her stealth capabilities.

Her innate spellcasting, based on her strong Charisma with a spell save DC of 15, allows her to cast several spells without needing material components. She can use charm person, dancing lights, invisibility, minor illusion, and passwall (ice only) at will, providing her with versatility in both combat and exploration. Once per day, she can also cast control weather (extreme cold), geas, and scrying, which can have a profound impact on long-term strategies in a campaign.

In combat, the Winter Hag can perform a multiattack, using her claws and ice bolt. The Claws attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage on a successful hit. Her Ice Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit, which deals 15 (2d10 + 4) cold damage and forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the target is under her curse, they automatically fail this saving throw and risk being restrained and subjected to petrification into ice if they fail subsequent saving throws. 

The Shapeshift ability allows the hag to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, retaining her statistics and a distinct streak of white hair in any form, returning to her true form upon death. Finally, she can turn herself invisible for up to an hour through the Invisibility spell, but this effect ends if she makes an attack or casts another spell during that time.

As a reaction, the Winter Hag can use Ice Shield to bolster her defense, adding 3 to her AC against a melee attack that she can see. If the attack misses, the attacker suffers 14 (4d6) cold damage, serving as a deterrent for close-range combat. 

Overall, the Winter Hag combines potent abilities with a strategic approach, making her a challenging foe for any adventuring party willing to confront her.
