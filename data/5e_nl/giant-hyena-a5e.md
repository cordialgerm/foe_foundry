The Giant Hyena is a large beast commonly found in the wilderness, characterized by its speed and aggression. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, particularly due to its high movement speed of 50 feet which allows it to close distances quickly. It has a good Armor Class of 12 that provides decent protection, alongside a solid pool of hit points totaling 34, making it capable of surviving a few hits in combat. The Giant Hyena excels in melee combat with its powerful bite attack, but its intelligence and charisma are notably poor, reflecting its bestial nature.

Now, let's break down the statistics of the Giant Hyena:

- Strength: 14 with a modifier of +2, which is considered good, allowing it to excel in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 14, also with a +2 modifier, providing it with good agility for dodging attacks and possibly boosting its initiative.
- Constitution: 16, with a +3 modifier, indicating very good endurance and contributing to its respectable hit points.
- Intelligence: 2, with a -4 modifier, resulting in very bad mental capabilities, making it unable to understand complex strategies or commands.
- Wisdom: 12 with a +1 modifier denotes an average ability to perceive its environment, useful for detecting threats.
- Charisma: 6, with a -2 modifier, indicates very bad social interaction abilities, which reflects its primitive communication style.

In terms of skills, the Giant Hyena has a +3 modifier to Perception, granting it good awareness of its surroundings. It possesses darkvision up to 30 feet, which enables it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a passive perception score of 13, allowing it to notice things that might be hiding nearby.

The Giant Hyena's primary action is its Bite. This is a melee weapon attack, which means it rolls a d20 and adds +4 to determine if it successfully hits a target within 5 feet. If it hits, it deals 9 points of piercing damage, computed by rolling 2d6 and adding 2. Moreover, if the bite attack reduces its target to 0 hit points, the Giant Hyena can use its bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a second bite attack. This ability allows it to potentially take down multiple enemies in a single turn, making it quite dangerous in the right circumstances.
