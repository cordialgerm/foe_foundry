The Ancient Copper Dragon excels in combat with a Multiattack feature, allowing it to use its Frightful Presence to instill fear before making one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +15 to hit and deals an average of 19 piercing damage. Its Claw attacks also feature a +15 to hit, dealing 15 slashing damage each. Additionally, it has the Tail attack, with the same +15 bonus to hit, inflicting 17 bludgeoning damage. 

Frightful Presence affects all creatures within 120 feet that are aware of the dragon, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 18. Failure results in being frightened for one minute, during which they can attempt to save again at the end of their turns. If successful, they become immune to this fear effect for 24 hours. 

The dragon's acid breath attack can deal massive area damage. It is a 120-foot line of acid, with creatures needing to make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 21. On a failed save, they take 76 acid damage, while a successful save results in half damage. Additionally, it can unleash a Slowing Breath, which is a 90-foot cone that forces a saving throw of DC 21, slowing affected enemies significantly.

As a bonus action, the dragon can Change Shape into a Beast or Humanoid of a challenge rating equal to or less than its own. This ability retains its effectiveness, allowing it to utilize its strategies in various forms while being able to revert back if necessary.

For legendary actions, the Ancient Copper Dragon can use Detect to pinpoint any creature or trap within 30 feet, a Tail Attack to deal damage with its tail, or it can unleash an Elemental Roar, which may leave targets vulnerable to acid damage. For a significant tactical retreat or repositioning, the Wing Attack allows it to deal bludgeoning damage and gain distance without risking opportunity attacks.

This dragon creates a formidable presence in any campaign, capable of altering the tide of battle with its damage output, control abilities, and sheer resilience. Adventurers should prepare carefully when facing such a powerful adversary, as its multiple capabilities and tactical options make it a multi-faceted threat.
