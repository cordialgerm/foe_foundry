The Quoreq is a chaotic evil aberration known for its unsettling appearance and regenerative capabilities. This medium-sized creature exhibits a strong offensive presence, with formidable physical damage potential and abilities that instill fear in its opponents. With its high constitution, the Quoreq boasts a significant pool of hit points, making it quite durable in combat encounters. However, its intelligence is average, which can limit its strategic capabilities. The Quoreq is particularly susceptible to acid and fire damage, which can prevent its regeneration and potentially lead to its destruction. Overall, the Quoreq thrives in direct confrontations, using its special abilities to manipulate the battlefield and instill terror in enemies.

The Quoreq has the following attributes: Strength: 17 (+3), Dexterity: 13 (+1), Constitution: 18 (+4), Intelligence: 11 (+0), Wisdom: 14 (+2), and Charisma: 8 (-1). Its Strength and Constitution scores are good and exceptional respectively, making it a strong melee combatant with good resilience. Dexterity is average, providing it with a decent chance to evade some attacks. Its average Intelligence means it is not known for complex planning, while its Wisdom is good, leading to keen perception. However, with a low Charisma score, it lacks social finesse.

The Quoreq has a saving throw bonus of +7 to Constitution saves, which is very good. Its perception skill is also strong with a +5 modifier, enabling it to notice hidden foes effectively. This creature enjoys immunity to poison damage and is unaffected by the blinded, charmed, frightened, poisoned, or stunned conditions. Its blindsight enables it to detect creatures within 60 feet, although it is unable to see beyond that range.

The Quoreq has several special abilities that enhance its menacing presence. Its regeneration allows it to regain 10 hit points at the beginning of its turn, which is exceptionally valuable in battle. However, this regeneration is nullified if it takes acid or fire damage during the preceding turn, adding a tactical element to engagements with effective damage types. The Unsettling Appearance ability forces creatures that start their turn close to the Quoreq to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, they become frightened for 1 minute, possibly hampering their combat effectiveness and forcing them to flee. Creatures can attempt to save against this effect at the end of their turns, granting them an opportunity to remove the effect. Additionally, successful saves provide a 24-hour immunity from further effects of this ability. Lastly, the Whorling Jaws ability allows it to make a bite attack as a bonus action if it has taken 10 or more piercing or slashing damage in a round, significantly increasing its damage output and providing an effective reaction to being harmed.

In terms of actions, the Quoreq can execute a Multiattack, which allows it to strike three times with its claws. Each claw attack has a +6 to hit modifier and deals an average of 10 slashing damage per hit. The Quoreq can also perform a Bite attack, which has the same +6 to hit modifier and deals an average of 12 piercing damage. If it successfully scores a critical hit with the bite, it rolls three times for damage instead of the usual two, dramatically increasing the potential for high damage. 

Overall, the Quoreq poses a formidable challenge in combat, utilizing its abilities and attacks to maintain pressure on opponents while forcing tactical considerations with its unique abilities.
