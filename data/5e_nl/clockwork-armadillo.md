The Clockwork Armadillo is a Small, unaligned Construct that serves as a resilient guardian or helper in various settings. With a solid Armor Class of 14 and 22 hit points, it can endure some damage while also possessing specific immunities to various conditions and damage types. Its Dexterity is notably high at +4, allowing it to be very good at avoiding attacks and acting swiftly in combat. However, it has low Intelligence and Charisma, making it less effective in social interactions or complex problem-solving situations. Overall, the Clockwork Armadillo is a mechanical creature ideal for combat support, thanks to its special abilities and actions, while being relatively passive in roles that require emotional or intellectual engagement.

The Clockwork Armadillo has the following statistics: Strength of 10, Dexterity of 18 with a +4 modifier, Constitution of 14 with a +2 modifier, Intelligence of 5 with a -3 modifier, Wisdom of 10 with a +0 modifier, and Charisma of 10 with a +0 modifier. The Dexterity modifier contributes to its very good saving throw of +6 against Dexterity-based effects. It possesses a passive perception score of 12, which is average for detecting hidden objects or creatures. Being a Construct, the Armadillo does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing for continuous activity without the need for rest.

In terms of damage immunities, the Clockwork Armadillo is immune to poison and psychic damage, reflecting its mechanical nature. Additionally, it is immune to being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it exceptionally resistant to various debilitating effects. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, making it valuable in low-light environments.

The Clockwork Armadillo boasts several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness. "Immutable Form" makes it immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form, reinforcing its role as a steady and reliable ally. "Magic Resistance" grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further protecting it from magical attacks. The "Overclocked" ability grants it advantage on initiative rolls, allowing it to act more quickly than its opponents during combat.

For actions in gameplay, the Clockwork Armadillo can use its "Scissor Claws" attack to make a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 6 slashing damage and forces the target to make a Constitution saving throw. If the target fails this saving throw (DC 11), it must drop whatever it is holding, which can significantly affect combat dynamics by disarming opponents.

The "Tuck In" action allows the Clockwork Armadillo to retract into its shell, forming an armored ball. While in this state, it can move by rolling and has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It is immune to being knocked prone during this time and cannot use its Scissor Claws attack. Additionally, this ability allows the Armadillo to encapsulate one object of its size or smaller within 5 feet, making it useful for transporting items or protecting valuable possessions. The Armadillo can uncurl and release any contained item as a bonus action, providing tactical advantages in combat or exploration.
