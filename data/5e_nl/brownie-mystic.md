However, its Strength is significantly low, making it unable to engage in heavy physical confrontations. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it is suitable for a party of adventurers with moderate experience.

The Brownie Mystic possesses several special abilities. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, which significantly enhances its survivability against magic-wielding foes. The Speak with Beasts ability enables it to communicate seamlessly with animals, fostering potential alliances or gathering information from wildlife.

In combat, the Brownie Mystic can use its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make three attacks each turn with its Mystic Staff or launch a Mystic Blast attack, and it can substitute one attack for casting a spell.

The Mystic Blast is a ranged attack, operating at +6 to hit, and deals 10 psychic damage, allowing it to engage enemies from a distance.

Additionally, the Brownie Mystic can turn invisible, remaining undetected until it attacks or uses its spellcasting ability, or until its concentration ends. This invisibility also cloaks any equipment it wears or carries, providing a strategic advantage in combat. In terms of spellcasting, the Brownie Mystic has a Wisdom-based spellcasting ability with a save DC of 13 and does not require material components for its spells. It can cast the following spells at will: Mending, Minor Illusion, and Prestidigitation; three times per day each of Entangle and Mirror Image; and once each of Confusion, Conjure Animals, and Dimension Door. These spells can significantly impact gameplay, providing healing, utility, and crowd control options, enhancing the Brownie Mystic's tactical versatility in both combat and roleplaying scenarios.
