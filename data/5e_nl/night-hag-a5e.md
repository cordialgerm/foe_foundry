The Night Hag is a Medium Fey creature embodying the essence of cunning and malice. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, utilizing its formidable magical abilities and deceptive nature to manipulate foes. Its strengths lie in its solid defenses, including a high Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of 105 hit points, derived from its Constitution. The Night Hag's magical resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells, rendering it difficult for spellcasters to neutralize. While it excels in magical deception and manipulation, its lack of mobility—moving at only 30 feet per turn—could be seen as a vulnerability.

The Night Hag possesses a variety of attributes that bolster its effectiveness in combat. Its Strength score is 18, providing a very good modifier of +4 for melee attacks, while its Dexterity of 14 gives it a good +2 modifier for initiatives and dexterity-based skills. The creature’s Constitution score of 16 translates to a good +3 modifier, increasing its hit points and resilience. With an Intelligence of 16 (+3), the Night Hag is adept in arcana and deception, which align with its manipulative abilities. Wisdom and Charisma are also both strong at 14 (+2) and 16 (+3) respectively, allowing for insightful and persuasive engagements.

In terms of saving throws, the Night Hag has a +6 in Constitution and a +5 in Wisdom, indicating a good level of resilience against physical and mental challenges. The creature is skilled in several areas, boasting a +6 bonus to arcana and deception, along with a +5 to insight, perception, and stealth—making it a versatile adversary in both direct confrontations and subterfuge.

The Night Hag's special abilities further enhance its role. The "Curse" ability allows it to inflict a magical curse that lasts for 30 days, causing the target to have disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag, significantly hampering their combat capability. Additionally, the "Evil" ability radiates an aura of malevolence, unsettling those nearby. Its "Magic Resistance" lets it handle magical threats more effectively, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

In terms of actions, the Night Hag can attack with its "Claws," which provide a +5 to hit and deal an average of 12 slashing damage, while also applying its curse. For crowd control, the "Sleep Touch" allows it to incapacitate a target for up to 4 hours, making it a strategic tool in combat; however, it can use this ability only once until it finishes a long rest. The "Shapeshift" ability demonstrates its deceptive nature, allowing it to transform into a Small or Medium humanoid and retain its claws, enhancing its adaptability in various situations.

The Night Hag also has access to powerful magical abilities, such as "Planar Travel," which it can use three times per day to shift between planes of existence, making it challenging to pin down during combat. Its "Nightmare Haunting" ability is particularly sinister, allowing it to inflict lasting psychological damage on a cursed sleeping victim. If the target endures an hour of nightmares, their hit point maximum decreases, and should it reach zero, they die with their soul captured by the hag. This ability emphasizes the Night Hag's role as a terror in the nighttime and highlights the threat it poses even beyond a traditional confrontation.

Overall, the Night Hag serves as a compelling foe within the game, leveraging its mix of offensive capabilities, durability, and magical deceptions to instill fear and confusion among adventurers.
