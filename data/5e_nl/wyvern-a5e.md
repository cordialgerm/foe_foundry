The wyvern is a large dragon-like creature known for its agility and fierce combat abilities. With a challenge rating of 6, it presents a formidable threat in battle, capable of dealing significant damage while flying. The wyvern has a solid armor class of 13 and an impressive 110 hit points, making it resilient against attacks. However, its primary weakness is its impaired flying ability when bloodied, which restricts its mobility. With an exceptional strength score of 18 and a good constitution score of 16, the wyvern is both powerful in melee combat and durable. It is not particularly intelligent or charismatic, with intelligence at 5 and charisma at 6, which limits its non-combat interactions. The creature is adept at perception and has darkvision to augment its senses in dim light.

The wyvern has several attributes that define its capabilities in battle. Its strength of 18 provides a +4 modifier, indicating very good effectiveness in melee attacks, while its constitution of 16 gives a +3 modifier, representing good resilience. Its dexterity is average at 10, translating to no modifiers, meaning it has average agility. The wyvern understands Draconic but cannot speak, limiting its communication during encounters.

As for its special abilities, the wyvern has "Imperfect Flight," which reduces its flying speed by half and prevents it from gaining altitude when it is bloodied, making it more vulnerable to ground attacks and decreasing its mobility in the air.

In combat, the wyvern employs a "Multiattack" action, allowing it to make one bite attack and one stinger attack or, while flying, to replace one of those attacks with its claws. The bite attack has a +7 to hit and reaches 10 feet, dealing an average of 13 piercing damage. The claws attack also has a +7 to hit and reaches 5 feet, inflicting an average of 9 slashing damage. If the wyvern is attacking from a height, it can grapple the target with its claws, effectively reducing its movement speed to 0 and giving it an advantage on attacks against that target.

The stinger attack, with the same +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, deals an average of 11 piercing damage. In addition, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; on a failure, they take substantial poison damage averaging 24 (7d6), or half that on a successful save. This ability not only damages the target but can also incapacitate them significantly if they fail to resist the poison. Overall, the wyvern is a dangerous aerial predator that combines physical prowess with poisonous attacks, posing a great challenge to adventurers.
