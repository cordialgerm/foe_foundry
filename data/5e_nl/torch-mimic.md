The Torch Mimic is a small, deceptive monstrosity that serves the purpose of mimicking inanimate objects, specifically appearing as an ordinary torch. This creature possesses a moderate level of defensive capabilities, reflected in its Armor Class of 12, coupled with a health pool of 21 hit points. As a Challenge Rating of 1/2 indicates, it poses a relatively low-level threat, making it suitable for beginner encounters or as an environmental hazard. Notably, the Torch Mimic can fly at a speed of 30 feet, giving it an element of mobility despite its ability to walk being nonexistent. Its key strengths include its ability to regenerate health over time and its fire-related abilities, though it has vulnerabilities, particularly to cold damage, which hampers its regenerative capabilities.

The Torch Mimic has the following attributes: Strength 7, Dexterity 15, Constitution 13, Intelligence 6, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 8. Strength is very bad, indicating a lack of physical power. Dexterity is good, enhancing its agility and improving its chances to evade attacks, while Constitution is average, providing a decent foundation for hit points. Intelligence is very bad, suggesting a limited cognitive capacity, while Wisdom is average, allowing it reasonable perception. Charisma is also very bad, implying a weak influence over others.

In terms of skills, the Torch Mimic has a +1 bonus to Perception, which is sufficient to notice most things in its vicinity. It has resistance to fire damage, making it less susceptible to fiery attacks, while it has a basic passive Perception of 11. The creature can understand Common but cannot speak, limiting its ability to communicate directly with others.

The Torch Mimic has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in encounters. The "False Appearance" ability allows it to remain motionless and indistinguishable from a regular torch, providing an element of surprise. The "Fiery Soul" ability permits it to ignite or extinguish the flames on its head as a bonus action. When ignited, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, which can provide strategic benefits in dark or low-light environments. If the Mimic is subjected to effects that would extinguish its flames, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 11. If it fails, it falls unconscious until it takes damage or is awoken by another character. However, it has an advantage on this saving throw against nonmagical effects.

Additionally, the Torch Mimic has a regeneration ability, recovering 2 hit points at the start of its turn unless it took cold damage during its previous turn, which would prevent its regeneration. The creature can only die if it has 0 hit points at the beginning of its turn and cannot regenerate.

For actions, the Torch Mimic can attack with a "Bite," which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, extending within a range of 5 feet. This attack deals an average of 4 piercing damage on a successful hit. It also has a "Fire Blast" action, functioning as a ranged attack with the same +4 to hit, able to reach targets up to 20 feet away (and up to 60 feet with disadvantage). The Fire Blast deals an average of 7 fire damage, making it a formidable ranged option against unsuspecting foes.
