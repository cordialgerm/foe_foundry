The Salamander Nymph is a Medium-sized elemental creature known for its fiery nature and unique abilities. It has a moderate armor class of 14, making it somewhat resilient in combat, and it possesses a total of 27 hit points, reflecting average durability for its Challenge Rating of 1. The Salamander Nymph can move at a speed of 30 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. Its strengths lie in its fire damage immunity, making it particularly tricky for elemental-focused attackers, and its Heated Body ability, which punishes foes that engage with it in close combat. However, the Salamander Nymph does face vulnerabilities, particularly against cold damage, which disables some of its defensive traits.

The attributes of the Salamander Nymph show a balanced focus on physical capabilities. Its Strength and Dexterity are both at 14, providing a good modifier of +2 in both categories, which means it can perform physical tasks fairly well, making it a good combatant. Its Constitution score is slightly better than average at 12 (+1), allowing for decent stamina. However, its Intelligence (8, -1) and Charisma (8, -1) scores are both below average, indicating a lack of mental acuity and social charm. Wisdom is at a flat 10, reflecting average perceptiveness.

The Salamander Nymph has a few notable special abilities. The Heated Body ability deals 3 (1d6) fire damage to any creature that starts their turn grappled by the Salamander, touches it, or attacks it in melee while within 5 feet. This damage can only occur once per turn per creature. However, if the Salamander has taken any cold damage since its last turn, this ability becomes inactive, making it strategically important for opponents to exploit cold damage to mitigate its effects.

In terms of physical attacks, the Salamander Nymph can perform a Tail attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 modifier to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage to the target, as well as allowing the target to take damage from the Heated Body ability, further enhancing its combat potential.

The creature has inherent skills and attributes related to damage immunities, specifically to fire. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark or dim conditions as if it were bright light, enhancing its effectiveness in low-light environments. Its passive Perception score is 10, which is average, allowing it to pick up on most common sensory details. The Salamander Nymph understands the Ignan language, although it lacks the ability to communicate verbally, which can impact its interactions with others.
