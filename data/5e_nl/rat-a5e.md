The Rat is a tiny beast often found in urban and rural settings, serving primarily as a low-level creature encountered by adventurers. With a challenge rating of 0, it poses minimal threat, mainly serving as a nuisance or a source of potential food for other creatures. Its greatest strengths lie in its speed and ability to remain undetected, thanks to its keen sense of smell, while its weaknesses are evident in its extraordinarily low hit points and poor physical attributes. Overall, the rat is not meant to be an adversary but rather a minor creature that may fit into various scenarios within a campaign.

The Rat has the following attributes: Strength of 2, which translates to a modifier of -4, making physical attacks very bad; Dexterity of 12 gives it a modifier of +1, resulting in average agility; Constitution of 8 yields a -1 modifier, indicating a bad toughness; Intelligence of 2 confers a -4 modifier, resulting in very bad cognitive abilities; Wisdom of 10 gives a +0 modifier, which is average; and Charisma of 4 provides a -3 modifier, also very bad for any social interactions. Its armor class is 11, reflecting an average level of defense for a creature of its size. With only 1 hit point, which is determined by rolling a 1d4 and subtracting 1, any successful hit will likely eliminate it from the encounter.

The Rat possesses the special ability **Keen Smell**, allowing it to have advantage on Perception checks that rely on its sense of smell. This enhances its ability to detect creatures and environmental features, making it more effective in stealthy scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Rat can make a **Bite** attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +1 modifier to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and targets one creature. If the attack hits, it deals 1 piercing damage. Though this damage output is minimal, the simplicity and instant nature of the attack allow the Rat to be a threat in large numbers or in specific roleplay situations.
