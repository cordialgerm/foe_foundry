The Gold Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable Medium-sized dragon, known for its striking golden scales and powerful presence. As a creature of its kind, it embodies both beauty and might, serving as a strong opponent in combat scenarios. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it presents a significant challenge for adventurers, boasting decent defensive capabilities, good hit points, and the ability to deal substantial damage. Its strengths lie in its elemental fire immunity and potent breath abilities, making it a dangerous foe in battle. However, despite its power, a Gold Dragon Wyrmling is not invincible and can be bested with strategic play.

The Gold Dragon Wyrmling has an Armor Class of 17, which is considered good, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being injured. It has 75 hit points, with a notable constitution score of 16 (+3), contributing to its resilience. Its speed is versatile, allowing it to walk 30 feet, fly 60 feet, and swim 30 feet, providing excellent mobility options. The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength is 18 (+4), Dexterity is 14 (+2), Constitution is 16 (+3), Intelligence is 14 (+2), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 16 (+3). The high Strength and Charisma values indicate it can deliver compelling physical attacks and have a strong presence in social interactions. 

For skills, the Gold Dragon Wyrmling has a perception score of +3, which is considered average, and a stealth score of +4, regarded as good, enabling it to be somewhat effective in remaining unnoticed. It is immune to fire damage, making it highly resistant to fire-based attacks. Its sensory abilities include blindsight out to 10 feet and darkvision out to 60 feet, with a passive Perception score of 13, allowing it to detect hidden or lurking threats in dim light or darkness. The Gold Dragon Wyrmling speaks Draconic, which limits its communication primarily to those who understand the language.

In terms of actions, the Gold Dragon Wyrmling has several powerful options. The Bite is a melee weapon attack that has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to target one enemy. If hit, this attack deals 9 piercing damage, which is an average amount of damage for a creature of this level.

The creature can utilize two types of Breath Weapons, both of which can significantly affect gameplay. The Molten Breath, which has a recharge requirement of rolling a 5 or 6 on a d6, unleashes a cone of molten gold over a distance of 15 feet. Creatures in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; those who fail take 22 (4d10) fire damage, while successful saves result in halved damage. This mechanism introduces a crucial element of area damage, forcing opponents to either spread out or risk significant damage.

The Slowing Breath, also having a recharge of 5-6, exudes a gas in a 15-foot cone. Creatures that are caught in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failing this throw results in disadvantage on weapon attack rolls for one minute, greatly diminishing their effectiveness in combat. A creature affected by this ability can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, providing a strategic element as they work to overcome the disadvantage.

Overall, the Gold Dragon Wyrmling is a well-rounded creature that combines offensive and defensive capabilities with a touch of magical prowess, offering both formidable challenges and unique tactical opportunities in Dungeons & Dragons campaigns.
