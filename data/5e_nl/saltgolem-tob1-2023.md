The Salt Golem is a formidable Large Construct that serves as a guardian or enforcer in various settings. With an unaligned nature, it exhibits no moral compunction and acts on the commands of its creator. The Salt Golem boasts a strong Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor, making it difficult to hit in combat. It has a substantial pool of 115 hit points, providing it with resilience in battle. However, its slow movement speed of 20 feet can be a limitation in certain tactical situations. This creature is particularly dangerous due to its unique abilities, which can inflict debilitating conditions on its foes while being resistant to a wide array of damage types. Although its Intelligence and Charisma are very low, it has exceptional Strength and Constitution scores, making it a powerful melee attacker. 

The Salt Golem has the following attributes: a Strength score of 20 which corresponds to a +5 modifier, making it very good at physical attacks; a Dexterity score of 9 with a -1 modifier, indicating bad agility; a Constitution score of 20, leading to another very good +5 modifier; an Intelligence score of 3 with a -4 modifier, indicating very bad cognitive abilities; a Wisdom score of 11, yielding an average +0 modifier; and a Charisma score of 1 with a -5 modifier, marking it very bad in social interactions.

It possesses several noteworthy abilities. The Blinding Salt Spray ability activates when the Golem takes damage, releasing thousands of salt crystals that affect all creatures within a 5-foot radius. These creatures must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn. This can significantly impact the battlefield by reducing the effectiveness of nearby foes. The Construct Nature ability means that the Salt Golem is immune to the natural needs of living creatures, allowing it to operate indefinitely without needing sustenance or rest. 

The Dehydrating Fists ability enhances its Slam attacks, as they are magical and deal an additional 4d8 necrotic damage on a hit. This makes the Golem a potent melee combatant capable of inflicting not only physical harm but also necrotic damage that can bypass certain resistances. Immutable Form grants immunity to any effects that would alter the Golem's shape, ensuring it remains a formidable opponent. Finally, the Magic Resistance ability provides the Golem with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, bolstering its resilience against magical attacks.

In combat, the Salt Golem can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Slam attacks in one turn. Each Slam attack is executed with a +9 to hit, indicating a good likelihood of connecting. Each successful Slam deals 16 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 18 necrotic damage. If both attacks hit a single target, the targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion, further limiting its effectiveness in combat. 

Overall, the Salt Golem is a robust and imposing presence on the battlefield, capable of both dealing and withstanding significant amounts of damage, while also having the ability to hinder opponents through its special abilities.
