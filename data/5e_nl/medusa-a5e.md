The Medusa is a formidable Medium Monstrosity known for its ability to petrify foes with its deadly gaze. With a challenge rating of 7, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, thanks to its combination of dexterous movements, poisonous attacks, and the terrifying power of its petrifying gaze. Its moderate armor class of 14 and a robust hit point pool of 120 allows it to withstand considerable punishment in combat. However, it is somewhat reliant on its abilities to control the battlefield and can be vulnerable if caught off guard or overwhelmed by multiple attackers.

The Medusa has a Strength score of 12, which translates to a good modifier of +1, making it capable in melee but not a frontline powerhouse. Its Dexterity is exceptional at 18 (+4), providing it with good agility, which aids in stealth and ranged attacks. With a Constitution of 16 (+3), it can endure damage effectively, enhancing its already decent durability. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all average, each sitting at 12 (+1) or 14 (+2), allowing it to maintain a moderate level of versatility in skills and saving throws.

The Medusa's notable skills include deception, insight, perception, and stealth, each at good levels of +5 or +7 for stealth, which grants it exceptional capability in ambush scenarios. Possessing darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 15 ensures the Medusa can navigate dark environments and notice hidden targets, enhancing its effectiveness in both combat and scouting situations.

One of the Medusa's main strengths lies in its special ability known as Petrifying Gaze. This ability activates when a creature starts its turn within 60 feet of it and can see the Medusa's eyes. The creature has the option to shut its eyes, thus avoiding the gaze and its effects unless it is surprised or incapacitated. If it chooses to look, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being restrained and potentially petrified over subsequent turns, while a natural 1 results in instant petrification. The petrification condition can only be ended through powerful magic such as greater restoration.

In combat, the Medusa uses its Multiattack feature to make a combination of two attacks, drawing upon its snake hair and longbow. Its snake hair attack functions as a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage plus an additional 7 poison damage. If the target is surprised or cannot see the Medusa, it takes an extra 3 piercing damage. The longbow allows it to strike from a distance, also with a +7 to hit, dealing 8 piercing damage along with the same 7 poison damage.

In conclusion, the Medusa's combination of agile attacks, petrifying gaze, and stealth capabilities makes it a dangerous adversary that can control the dynamics of encounters effectively, forcing quick decisions from its opponents.
