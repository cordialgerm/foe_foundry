The Djinni is a powerful elemental creature embodying air, known for its graceful movements and formidable abilities. With a considerable combination of high hit points (172) and good armor class (16), it can withstand significant damage in combat, earning it the rank of challenge rating 11, which indicates it poses a substantial threat to adventurers. The Djinni excels in spells and physical attacks, combining flying speed of 90 feet with multi-attack capabilities, making it a versatile combatant in various scenarios. While it holds exceptional strengths in Dexterity (22), Constitution (22), and Charisma (20), it also possesses weaknesses, such as its resistance limited to lightning and thunder damage. Additionally, its reliance on spells means that opponents who can dispel or counter its magical capabilities can significantly hinder its effectiveness in battle.

The Djinni's attributes include a Strength of 18 (+4 modifier, which is good), a Dexterity of 22 (+6 modifier, which is exceptional), a Constitution of 22 (+6 modifier, which is exceptional), an Intelligence of 14 (+2 modifier, which is average), a Wisdom of 16 (+3 modifier, which is good), and a Charisma of 20 (+5 modifier, which is very good). For saving throws, it has a Dexterity modifier of +10, an Intelligence modifier of +6, a Wisdom modifier of +7, and a Charisma modifier of +9, indicating its exceptional ability to resist various effects. The Djinni is skilled in Acrobatics (+10), Insight (+7), and Perception (+7), demonstrating its agility and awareness in both combat and exploration. It has damage resistances specifically against lightning and thunder, and it possesses darkvision to a range of 120 feet, enhancing its sensory capabilities.

With its innate spellcasting, the Djinni can cast spells based on its Charisma, which has a spell save DC of 17. This includes being able to alter its form at will, detect magic, and summon wind walls. It can cast creation, major image, tongues, and wind walk three times a day, showcasing its versatility and tactical options. Once per day, it can conjure an air elemental, control weather, create food and water, or shift between planes, emphasizing its elemental nature and interaction with the environment.

In combat, the Djinni can perform a multiattack, making three melee scimitar strikes with a +10 to hit. Each successful scimitar hit deals an average of 13 slashing damage plus an additional 5 lightning damage. It also has the ability to unleash a Lightning Blast as a ranged spell attack, dealing an average of 35 lightning damage at a range of 90 feet. Once per day, while in giant form, the Djinni can perform a Scimitar Sweep, striking multiple targets within reach.

For its bonus actions, the Djinni can transform into a Huge, semi-substantial Giant Form once per day, gaining extra reach with its attacks and resistance to nonmagical damage. Additionally, it can create a mystical whirlwind that can restrain a creature within its area. This ability requires a Strength check to escape and can impact the battlefield significantly, as it can control enemy movement and create tactical advantages for itself. The whirlwind will disperse if the Djinni loses sight of it or dismisses it, allowing for strategic planning in its use.
