The Swamp Lily is a medium-sized plant creature that occupies an unaligned status, serving primarily as a deceptive and manipulative force in swamp environments. With an Armor Class of 15 and a total of 136 hit points, it demonstrates a decent level of resilience in combat. It operates effectively within the Challenge Rating of 7, making it a noteworthy opponent for adventurers. The Swamp Lily excels at manipulation through its unique abilities, particularly its capacity to charm and incapacitate foes, while sustaining itself with good defensive capabilities such as damage immunities and condition immunities. However, its movement speed is limited to 15 feet, which can be considered a significant weakness in terms of mobility.

The Swamp Lily has a Strength score of 16, granting it a +3 modifier that is classified as good, allowing it to stand out in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity is low at 9, indicating a -1 modifier, which is average, reflecting its lack of agility. The Constitution score of 18 translates to a +4 modifier, rated as very good, enhancing its hit points and overall toughness. Intelligence is notably low at 4, resulting in a -3 modifier that can be considered very bad, signifying that it lacks cognitive capabilities. With a Wisdom score of 12, the lily maintains an average +1 modifier, while its Charisma of 17 offers a +3 modifier that is exceptional, enhancing its efficacy in charming opponents.

The Swamp Lily possesses several special abilities that enrich its gameplay mechanics. One notable ability is Discern Food Preferences, which allows the creature to read the surface thoughts of all creatures within 60 feet. This ability functions similarly to the detect thoughts spell but is limited to determining each creature's favorite food. A creature within this range must pass a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in disadvantage on future saving throws against the lilyâ€™s Fake Feast action.

In terms of actions, the Swamp Lily has a Multiattack feature that allows it to make two melee root attacks in a turn. Each Root attack has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 12 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 3) on a hit. Additionally, the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 poison damage (3d6) on a failed save, or half as much damage if successful.

The Fake Feast action creates an illusory banquet within 5 feet of the Swamp Lily that charms creatures nearby. Creatures within 60 feet of the illusion that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed. While charmed, a target is incapacitated and compelled to move toward the illusion if it strays too far. The Lily can maintain this illusion with a bonus action. If the target comes within 5 feet of the banquet, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw after consuming the feast, with potential poison damage for failure. This power can disrupt enemy strategies and create openings for the Swamp Lily to dominate the battlefield.
