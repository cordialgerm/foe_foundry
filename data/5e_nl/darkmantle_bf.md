The Darkmantle is a small monstrosity that resembles a cave formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite when motionless. This creature has a unique strategic role, effectively serving as an ambush predator in dark environments. Its strengths include its resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, allowing it to maintain combat efficiency over time. However, its armor class is relatively low at 11, and its hit points total 25, making it somewhat vulnerable if discovered and attacked. It has a challenge rating of 1/2, indicating it is suitable as a low-level encounter for adventurers. Notably, the Darkmantle is capable of attacking and attaching itself to its prey, causing continued damage while impairing the target's ability to see and breathe.

For its attributes, the Darkmantle has a Strength of +3, which is considered good, enabling it to effectively deal melee damage. Its Dexterity is +1, which is average and provides some evasion in combat. It has a Constitution of +1, which again is average and contributes to its durability. Intelligence is -4, indicating very bad cognitive abilities, while its Wisdom is +0, suggesting average perception skills. Finally, its Charisma is -3, indicating very bad skills in social interactions or influence.

The Darkmantle has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Echolocation allows it to sense its surroundings within 60 feet, though it cannot use this ability while deafened. With False Appearance, when the Darkmantle remains still, it can deceive creatures into thinking it is simply part of the environment. Its Jagged Hide ability inflicts 2 piercing damage on any creature that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet, providing a deterrent against attempting to engage it in close quarters. Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it a bit more resilient in prolonged encounters.

In terms of actions, the Darkmantle has two primary offensive capabilities. The first is the Crush action, which is a melee weapon attack that adds a +5 to hit. If it successfully hits, it deals 6 bludgeoning damage and attaches itself to the target, blinding and restricting the breathing of creatures that are Medium or smaller. This attachment deals additional damage at the start of the Darkmantle's turns, continuously applying pressure. The second action, Topple, allows the Darkmantle to knock its attached target prone with a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is already prone, it is restrained, providing an opportunity for further attacks or control.

Additionally, the Darkmantle has a bonus action called Darkness Aura, which it can use once per day. This ability creates a magical darkness that extends 15 feet around it and moves with the Darkmantle, lasting up to 10 minutes while it maintains concentration. This darkness prevents Darkvision from seeing through it and dispels any natural light within its radius, creating a tactical advantage in combat and hindering opponents' visibility.
