The August Rooster has several special abilities:
- **Aura of Subservience:** This ability allows the August Rooster to charm any beast or humanoid that ends its turn within 30 feet, requiring a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to resist. If charmed, the effect lasts for 1 day unless the creature moves more than 100 feet away. If it requests tasks beyond mere caretaking, the charmed creature can attempt a new saving throw with advantage. Successful saves grant immunity to this aura for 24 hours.
- **Dive Bomb:** When the August Rooster flies and moves at least 20 feet towards a target before making a talon attack, it inflicts an additional 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a hit.
- **Jumper:** This ability allows the August Rooster to fly up to 40 feet, but it must start and end its movement on a solid surface. If it is in the air at the end of its turn, it will fall and take damage from the fall.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** With Charisma as its casting ability (spell save DC 14), the August Rooster can cast spells without needing material components. It can cast the following spells at will: "dancing lights," "mage hand," "message," and "vicious mockery." It can cast "bane," "charm person," and "hideous laughter" three times per day each, and "healing word" and "hold person" once per day each.

For actions in combat, the August Rooster can execute a **Multiattack**, using a total of two talon attacks during its turn. Its **Talon** attack has a +5 to hit and can reach a target up to 5 feet away, dealing an average of 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage on a successful hit. This combination of charm and mobility makes the August Rooster a uniquely dangerous adversary that excels in both subduing opponents and avoiding direct combat.
