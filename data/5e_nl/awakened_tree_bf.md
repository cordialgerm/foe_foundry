The Awakened Tree is a formidable creature, classified as a Huge plant. It serves as a guardian of the natural world, often animated by a powerful connection to nature or a druid's magic. With an Armor Class of 13, it has decent defensive capabilities provided by its natural armor, and it boasts 60 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage in combat. Its challenge rating of 2 indicates that it is a relatively powerful threat to low-level adventurers. The Awakened Tree excels in melee combat with its slam attack, which can deal significant bludgeoning damage. However, its mobility is limited with a speed of only 20 feet, and its Dexterity modifier of -2 makes it quite slow and less effective at dodging attacks, resulting in an overall average performance in terms of agility.

The Awakened Tree has an impressive Strength score of +4, meaning it is exceptionally strong and can deal considerable melee damage. Its Constitution score of +2 also contributes to its sturdiness, though it has a Wisdom score of 0, which does not enhance its mental faculties. The creature has no Intelligence or Charisma, indicating a lack of cognitive abilities and social skills. It can perceive its surroundings with a perception score of 10, while its stealth score of 8 implies it is not skilled at remaining hidden, especially since it typically does not move. One interesting aspect is that the Awakened Tree can communicate in one language known by its creator, though its lack of Charisma suggests it may not be very persuasive.

The Awakened Tree has several special abilities. With its False Appearance ability, it can remain motionless and blend in with its surroundings, making it indistinguishable from a normal tree. This allows it to ambush unsuspecting adventurers. Its Plant Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion, as well as to being paralyzed, petrified, or rendered unconscious, making it difficult to incapacitate.

In terms of actions, the Awakened Tree has a powerful melee option. Its Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an impressive 22 (4d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a hit. The Broken Branch attack is a ranged weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet, capable of dealing 18 (4d6 + 4) piercing damage. These attacks make it a dangerous foe in both melee and ranged scenarios.

Additionally, the Awakened Tree can use a bonus action to draw upon its Entangling Roots ability. This requires one creature on the ground within 10 feet to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or become restrained by roots until the end of its next turn, limiting movement and making them vulnerable to further attacks.

Overall, the Awakened Tree combines substantial strength and resilience with a natural camouflage ability, making it a dangerous foe for adventurers who underestimate the power of the natural world.
