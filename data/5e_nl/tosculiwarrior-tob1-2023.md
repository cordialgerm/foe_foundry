The Tosculi Warrior is a small humanoid creature characterized by its lawful evil alignment. As a combatant, it excels in both melee and tactical situations, employing its speed and flight to maneuver effectively in battle. With an Armor Class of 15 and a health pool of 58 hit points, it can sustain some damage while delivering notable attacks. The Tosculi Warrior's strengths lie in its high dexterity of 20, which provides it with exceptional agility and accuracy in attacks, coupled with strong attacking options and debilitating abilities. However, its moderate strength and intelligence suggest limitations in physical might and mental prowess. The warrior's unique features—Crowd Tactics and Hive Sense—enhance its effectiveness in combat and connection to its hive, making it a formidable foe.

In terms of attributes, the Tosculi Warrior has a Strength score of 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score of 20 grants a +5 modifier, achieving exceptional stealth and attack rolls. A Constitution score of 16 gives it a +3 modifier, making it fairly resilient. Intelligence is average at 10, with no modifier, while Wisdom at 12 has a +1 modifier, allowing for average perception and insight. Charisma is also at 12, yielding a +1 modifier, indicating a mediocre potential for social interactions.

The Tosculi Warrior possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat utility. The "Crowd Tactics" ability allows it to share its space with another Tosculi, granting it advantage on attack rolls against opponents when supported by its ally, making this tactic a good strategy for cooperative engagements. "Hive Sense" enables the Tosculi to locate its hive queen within 300 feet, maintaining a vital connection to its colony and enhancing its strategic awareness.

In combat, the Tosculi Warrior can utilize its actions to maximize damage potential. It has a "Multiattack" action, allowing it to strike with both its Claw and Stinger attacks in a single turn. The Claw attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 10 slashing damage. Similarly, the Stinger attack also has a +7 to hit, inflicting 10 piercing damage and requiring the target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure to succeed results in the target being poisoned for one minute, which simultaneously induces paralysis. This dual effect can severely hinder opponents, as they must repeat their saving throw each turn to attempt to break free from the poison-induced paralysis.

The "Prepare Host" ability is particularly deadly; if a target is already paralyzed due to the Stinger attack, the Tosculi can extend this paralysis for up to 8 hours by forcing a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. This extended paralysis prevents the target from making further saving throws unless they take damage while below half their hit point maximum, or until a spell or effect cures the condition. This makes the Tosculi Warrior a dangerous opponent capable of incapacitating foes and ensuring their colleagues can attack unhindered.
