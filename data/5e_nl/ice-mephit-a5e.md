The Ice Mephit is a small elemental creature that embodies the essence of cold and ice, making it both a nuisance and a potential hazard to adventurers. With a challenge rating of 1/2, this creature is relatively weak in terms of raw power, but it compensates with unique abilities such as its explosive death burst and the capacity to create areas of obscured visibility. Its speed allows it to maneuver both on foot and in the air, making it a versatile opponent that can strike from above before retreating into the fog. Ice Mephits have weaknesses to bludgeoning and fire damage, which makes them vulnerable to certain types of attacks. However, they possess strengths in their immunities to cold and poison damage, rendering them resilient against many forms of harm.

The Ice Mephit has the following attributes: Strength of 8 with a modifier of -1, which is considered very bad for physical attacks; Dexterity of 14 with a modifier of +2, indicating a good ability for dodging and stealth; Constitution of 10 with no modifier, representing average hardiness; Intelligence of 8 with a modifier of -1, deemed very bad for intelligence-based tasks; Wisdom of 10 with no modifier, which is again average; and Charisma of 10, also average. Its skills include perception at +2, making it somewhat effective at noticing hidden creatures, and stealth at +4, which is good for remaining unnoticed.

In terms of vulnerabilities and immunities, the Ice Mephit takes double damage from bludgeoning and fire attacks, making it an easy target for those types of damage. It is immune to cold and poison damage and is also unaffected by the poisoned condition, enhancing its survivability in certain combat scenarios. It possesses darkvision to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark environments, and a passive perception score of 12, which allows it to spot unnoticed threats effectively. The Mephit communicates in the languages Aquan and Auran, allowing it to interact with other elemental beings.

The Ice Mephit features several special abilities. The Death Burst ability triggers upon its death, causing it to explode into ice shards. Any creature within 5 feet must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) slashing damage on a failed save or halving the damage on a successful one. This can be an effective area deterrent against melee attackers. The False Appearance ability allows the Mephit to remain motionless and indistinguishable from a shard of ice, serving as a clever ambush tactic. Its Elemental Nature means the Ice Mephit does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, making it a low-maintenance creature in prolonged engagements.

The Ice Mephit's actions include a melee attack with its claws, which has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage plus an additional 2 (1d4) cold damage on a successful hit. It can also use its Fog ability once per day to exhale a 20-foot-radius cloud of fog, heavily obscuring the area for those who are not mephits, which can hinder opponents’ visibility and movement for 10 minutes or until a strong wind disperses the fog. Lastly, it can unleash a Freezing Breath attack once per day, which is a 15-foot cone of ice. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) cold damage on a failed save or half damage on a success, allowing the mephit to inflict significant cold damage while potentially controlling the battlefield.
