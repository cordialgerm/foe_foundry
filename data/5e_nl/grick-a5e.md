The Grick is a medium-sized monstrosity known for its unique ability to blend seamlessly into rocky environments, making it a cunning ambush predator. With a respectable armor class of 14 and a total of 33 hit points, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers, rated at Challenge Level 2. The Grick is agile with a speed of 30 feet on both the ground and when climbing, which enhances its tactical positioning in combat. The creature is particularly dangerous due to its tentacle attacks that can grapple opponents, limiting their actions while it inflicts damage. However, its low intelligence and charisma scores indicate that it lacks mental fortitude in social interactions or complex strategies. This creature's vulnerabilities include taking full damage from magical weapons, as it only resists damage from nonmagical attacks.

The Grick's ability scores are balanced, possessing a strength of 14, dexterity of 14, and constitution of 14, all of which are good, providing it with both offensive and defensive capabilities. Its intelligence is very low at 2, rendering it ineffective in tasks that require reasoning. The wisdom and charisma scores are average, with wisdom at 14 being adequate for perception checks but charisma at 5 being very bad, leading to its inability to engage in effective communication or manipulation.

In terms of skills, the Grick excels with a +4 modifier in stealth checks, which is exceptionally good for an ambush attacker in its natural environment, thanks to its camouflage ability. This advantage means it can effectively hide in rocky terrain, allowing it to surprise unsuspecting foes. Additionally, its spider climb ability allows the Grick to traverse difficult surfaces and ceilings effortlessly, increasing its mobility during encounters.

When it comes to actions, the Grick has a primary melee attack using its tentacles, which has a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. Successful hits deal an average of 9 bludgeoning damage (rolled as 2d6 + 2) and allow the Grick to grapple the target with an escape DC of 12. This grapple prevents the Grick from attacking any other targets using its tentacles until the grapple is broken. As a bonus action, the Grick can utilize its beak attack, which also has a +4 to hit and inflicts another 9 piercing damage to any target it has grappled. This combo of tentacle and beak attacks makes the Grick a formidable foe in close combat, capable of controlling the battlefield by limiting the movement and actions of its prey.
