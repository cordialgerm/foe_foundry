The Flame Eater Swarm is a Medium Beast that behaves like a collective of tiny, flame-consuming creatures. It is unaligned and possesses unique abilities to extinguish fires, making it a nuisance for spellcasters who rely on fire magic. With an Armor Class of 12 and 33 hit points, it is relatively easy to hit but can be quite resilient due to its immunities and resistances. The Challenge Rating of 2 indicates that while it might not be overwhelmingly powerful, it can still present a substantial challenge, especially if combined with other threats. It boasts high Dexterity, allowing it to evade attacks effectively, but its other attributes are quite weak. The swarm operates best in situations where fires are present, using its abilities to consume flames and bolster its attack power.

The Flame Eater Swarm has the following attributes: Strength of 3, which results in a very bad modifier of -4; Dexterity of 15, translating to a good modifier of +2; Constitution of 12, offering an average modifier of +1; Intelligence of 2, leading to a very bad modifier of -4; Wisdom of 14, giving a good modifier of +2; and Charisma of 4, reflecting a very bad modifier of -3. The swarm is immune to fire damage and resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, making it particularly hardy against physical attacks. It is immune to multiple conditions, including being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, or stunned, granting it a significant edge in combat. The swarm has blindsight up to 30 feet, allowing it to detect creatures without relying on sight, and it has a passive perception of 12.

Special abilities of the Flame Eater Swarm include "Consume Flame," which allows it to extinguish any normal fire within its space at the end of its turn. For magical fires, the swarm must successfully make a DC 13 Constitution check to extinguish them. After consuming fire, its bite attack can inflict an additional 9 fire damage and any creature that ends its turn in the swarm's space takes 4 fire damage. The swarm also utilizes "Swarm," enabling it to occupy the same space as other creatures and move through tight openings like a Tiny bat. However, it cannot regain hit points or accumulate temporary hit points. 

In combat, the Flame Eater Swarm utilizes a "Multiattack" action to make two bite attacks. These bite attacks have a +4 to hit and affect one creature within their space, dealing either 7 piercing damage or 3 piercing damage if the swarm's hit points are reduced to half or fewer. This combination of abilities allows the swarm to deal consistent damage while also hindering fire-based tactics employed by its opponents, making it a formidable encounter under specific circumstances.
