Heggarna is a tiny aberration characterized by its neutral evil disposition. This creature operates primarily in the shadows, using its stealth and ability to instill nightmares to undermine its foes. Heggarna excels at deception, utilizing its illusory appearance to masquerade as a harmless cat, allowing it to get close to unsuspecting prey. It has notable strengths in Dexterity and Charisma, making it a good infiltrator and manipulator. However, its low Strength and poor physical defenses make it vulnerable in direct combat. The combination of mind-affecting abilities and a knack for stealth makes Heggarna a formidable opponent in certain scenarios.

Heggarna has an Armor Class of 16, derived from its natural armor, indicating above-average defense for a creature of its size. It possesses 40 hit points, which translates into a decent survivability, but not insurmountable. The creature has a movement speed of 20 feet on the ground and can climb at the same rate, allowing for some mobility in vertical spaces. It has a Challenge Rating of 1, making it a low-level threat worth 200 experience points to those who defeat it, indicating its capabilities align with beginner adventurers.

The creature's attributes include a Strength score of 7, which equates to a very bad modifier of -2, indicating it is physically weak. Its Dexterity score is 16, resulting in a good modifier of +3, making it agile and difficult to hit. Heggarna has a Constitution score of 14, translating into an average +2 modifier, giving it reasonable resilience. Its Intelligence score is 12, corresponding to an average +1 modifier, allowing for decent tactical acumen. With a Wisdom score of 13 and a +1 modifier, it has average perceptive abilities. Finally, the Charisma score of 16 gives it a good +3 modifier, enabling powerful social interactions and the effectiveness of its abilities.

Heggarna has skills in perception with a +3 modifier and stealth with a +5 modifier, reinforcing its capabilities as a stealthy infiltrator. It has 60 feet of darkvision, allowing it to see clearly in darkness, and a passive perception score of 13, which helps it notice hidden threats. The creature can communicate in Deep Speech and possesses telepathy that functions up to 30 feet, enabling it to communicate with other creatures mentally.

The special abilities of Heggarna include:

- Cat Sneak: While in dim light or darkness, Heggarna gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide when disguised as a cat, enhancing its already impressive stealth skills.
- Dream Eating: This ability allows Heggarna to attach its lamprey-like maw to a sleeping creature as a bonus action. Initially, the target’s Charisma score is reduced by a roll of 1d4, with subsequent hourly reductions of 1 until it either dies or the reduction totals 8. If Charisma is reduced to 0, the target dies. The target experiences nightmares and must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw to gain rest benefits; failure leads to a disrupted rest while exceptional success awakens the target immediately. Heggarna can detach itself after moving 5 feet, allowing for strategic repositioning.

Heggarna’s actions consist of:

- Bite: A melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, reaching a distance of 5 feet. If successful, it inflicts 5 piercing damage, adding an extra 3 psychic damage through the attack, demonstrating its ability to deal both physical and mental harm.
- Dream Rift: This psychic ability has a recharge mechanism, activating on rolls of 5 or 6. Heggarna unleashes psychic energy in a 15-foot cone, forcing creatures in range to perform a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in 7 psychic damage and incapacitation until the end of their next turn due to overwhelming nightmarish images, while success halves the damage without incapacitating the target.
- Illusory Appearance: Heggarna can create a magical illusion to appear as a tiny cat. This disguise lasts until it takes an action to end it or receives damage, rendering it a temporary shield against detection. However, the illusion can be pierced by a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, reflecting the creature’s reliance on deception in encounters.

In summary, Heggarna blends stealth with psychological manipulation, making it a unique challenge for adventurers unprepared for its dream-invading capabilities.
