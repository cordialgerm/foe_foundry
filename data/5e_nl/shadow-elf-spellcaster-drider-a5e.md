The Shadow Elf Spellcaster Drider is a large monstrosity that blends the traits of a drider, typically a drow turned into a spider-like creature, with spellcasting abilities reminiscent of its shadow elf heritage. This creature has a robust defensive capability with an Armor Class of 17 and considerable hit points totaling 114, making it a durable opponent in combat. Its primary strengths include its agility, indicated by a Dexterity score of 16, and its potent Wisdom of 16, allowing it to effectively utilize spellcasting while maintaining significant physical damage output. Nevertheless, it is vulnerable to sunlight, suffering disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks when exposed. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it poses a serious challenge but can be matched by diligent adventurers.

The Shadow Elf Spellcaster Drider has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4) offers it a very good melee attack power; Dexterity 16 (+3) contributes to both its balance and ranged attack capability; Constitution 18 (+4) provides it a very good health pool; Intelligence 10 (+0) is average, meaning it lacks in mental prowess; Wisdom 16 (+3) enhances its perception and spellcasting; and Charisma 12 (+1) represents an average presence.

In terms of skills, it has expertise in perception, stealth, and survival, all with modifiers of +6, indicating good proficiency in these areas. The drider has a damage resistance against poison, helping it remain sturdy in adverse situations. It possesses darkvision with a range of 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness effectively, alongside a passive perception of 16, which is quite good for detecting hidden threats. It speaks Undercommon, Elvish, and one additional language, suggesting it can communicate with various creatures.

Its special abilities include Spider Climb, allowing the drider to move freely on difficult surfaces and even upside-down; Sunlight Sensitivity, which causes it to perform poorly in sunlight; Web Walker, enabling it to move unimpeded through webbing; and Fey Ancestry, which gives it an expertise die for saving throws against charm effects, as well as making it immune to magical sleep. The drider's innate spellcasting, reliant on Wisdom with a spell save DC of 14, allows it to cast “dancing lights” at will, whereas it can cast “darkness” and “web” once per day each without requiring material components.

For actions, the drider can make multiple attacks in one turn. It can perform a claws attack with a +7 attack modifier that has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage while also grappling the target (escape DC 15). Additionally, it can use a bite attack against grappled creatures, dealing 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) poison damage, making it dangerous for its victims. The drider possesses a longsword attack (wielded two-handed) that requires a +7 modifier, dealing 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage. It can also fire a longbow (with a +6 to hit) at a range of 120 feet, inflicting 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage alongside 7 (2d6) poison damage.

The spell “Darkness” creates magical darkness in a 15-foot radius from a point within 30 feet for one minute, preventing creatures with darkvision from seeing through it. “Web” enables the drider to fill a 20-foot cube with sticky webs, obscuring vision and hindering movement by making the terrain difficult; creatures caught must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being restrained. Webs can be burned away, causing fire damage to any creatures within.

This combination of physical prowess, spellcasting abilities, and strategic movement options makes the Shadow Elf Spellcaster Drider a formidable foe on the battlefield, capable of both direct confrontation and control of the environment.
