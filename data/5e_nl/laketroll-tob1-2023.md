The Lake Troll is a formidable aquatic giant characterized by its chaotic evil nature and its ability to thrive in both land and water environments. With a challenge rating of 7, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, featuring a combination of high durability with 126 hit points and substantial offensive capabilities through its fierce attacks. It has the special ability to regenerate health, making it even harder to defeat, provided it does not take cold or fire damage. The Lake Troll's keen sense of smell enhances its perception, allowing it to detect foes even in difficult conditions. However, its low intelligence and charisma indicate a lack of strategic thinking and social interaction, making it primarily a brute force creature.

The Lake Troll has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good, providing a decent amount of defense against attacks. Its physical attributes are robust: a Strength of 22 translates to a +6 modifier, representing exceptional physical power, allowing it to deal powerful attacks. The troll's Dexterity score of 13 gives it a +1 modifier, which is average, enabling moderate agility. The Constitution of 20 grants a +5 modifier, ensuring it can withstand damage effectively. Its Intelligence is quite low at 8 with a -1 modifier, indicating very bad cognitive abilities. The Wisdom score of 10 implies it has average insight, while a Cha score of 6 demonstrates very bad social skills.

In terms of skill proficiencies, the Lake Troll has a +3 in Perception and a +4 in Stealth, allowing it to be quite sneaky in its natural habitat. Its darkvision extends to 60 feet, enabling it to see in low-light conditions, and its passive Perception sits at 13, which reflects its ability to notice hidden threats or dangers. It can communicate through Common and Giant languages, though its social skills may limit effective interaction.

The Lake Troll has several notable special abilities. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, making it equally dangerous whether in a lake or on land. Keen Smell gives it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on smell, enhancing its ability to detect creatures nearby. The Regeneration ability allows it to recover 10 hit points at the start of its turn, significantly increasing its survivability during combat. If the troll suffers cold or fire damage, this healing is halved, and if affected by both types of damage, its regeneration ceases for the following turn. The troll can only be killed if it begins its turn with zero hit points and cannot regenerate.

In combat, the Lake Troll can use a Multiattack to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. Its Bite attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 10 slashing damage. The Claw attacks also carry a +9 to hit, inflicting an average of 15 piercing damage each. Notably, if both Claw attacks strike the same creature wielding a weapon, the victim must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in permanent damage to their weapon, accumulating a -1 penalty to damage rolls. If this penalty reaches -5, the weapon breaks. This ability makes the troll especially dangerous to armed foes, as it can render their weapons ineffective.
