Lazavik is a small, neutral good fey creature characterized by its unique abilities and affinity for swampy environments. This tiny being possesses a good balance of mobility and defense, highlighted by its notable defensive capabilities, including a decent Armor Class of 14 and a substantial hit point pool of 36, making it resilient in combat for a creature of its size. With a Challenge Rating of 3, Lazavik can pose a moderate challenge for adventurers, offering 700 XP upon defeat. Its impressive Dexterity score of 18 gives it an exceptional bonus of +4 to important skills like stealth, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively and evade attacks. However, while it possesses advantageous resistances and immunities, its combat strength primarily lies in its unique special abilities which enhance both its survival and support roles in combat.

Lazavik has a Strength score of 12, which provides a good +1 modifier, allowing for some effectiveness in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity, at +4, is exceptional, enabling it to excel in agility-based tasks. The creature's Constitution of 15 results in a good +2 modifier, contributing to its overall durability. The Intelligence score of 13 offers a modest +1, reflecting a reasonable level of cunning. With a Wisdom score of 17, Lazavik has a good +3 modifier, enhancing its perception skills and making it perceptive in various scenarios. Finally, its Charisma of 14 grants it a +2 modifier, which allows for effective communication and social interactions.

Lazavik has several noteworthy special abilities. Its Glowing Eye serves as a bonus action, allowing it to create a brilliant golden light that illuminates a significant area and grants allies the Swamp Stride trait while they remain within the illuminated path. This ability can be strategically used to assist teammates in navigating difficult terrains or avoiding hazards. The Hold Breath ability allows Lazavik to remain submerged for up to 30 minutes, enhancing its effectiveness in aquatic environments. With Speak with Beasts, Lazavik can converse naturally with beasts, which can be useful for gathering information or forming alliances. Additionally, the Swamp Stride ability permits it to move through difficult terrain without penalty and avoids damage from nonmagical plants and hazards.

In terms of actions, Lazavik can use its Reed Whip melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit. This attack has a reach of 10 feet, allowing it to engage enemies at a distance while dealing 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage if successful. Its Eye Flare ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, unleashes a blinding light in a 15-foot cone. Creatures within this area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; those who fail take 10 (3d6) radiant damage and become blinded for one minute. Successful save halves the damage and avoids blindness, and affected creatures may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, offering a tactical choice for Lazavik to engage in crowd control during combat.
