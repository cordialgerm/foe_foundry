The Ink Devil is a Small, Lawful Evil fiend that excels in stealth and manipulation, making it a formidable foe for adventurers who rely on magic and cunning. With an impressive Dexterity score of 18 and robust Intelligence, it is adept at sneaking around and casting spells to bewilder its enemies. The Ink Devil's primary strengths lie in its ability to resist magical effects, thanks to its Magic Resistance, and its unique capabilities to disrupt spellcasters and mark targets for its allies. Its challenge rating of 2 allows it to serve as a dangerous adversary to lower-level parties. One of its notable abilities, Devil's Ink, can severely hinder opponents by marking them and giving the Ink Devil’s allies an advantage against them.

The Ink Devil has an Armor Class of 14 and hit points totaling 54, which is above average for creatures of its challenge rating, giving it decent durability in combat. It possesses the following attributes: Strength of 12, Dexterity of 18 (+4), Constitution of 12 (+1), Intelligence of 20 (+5), Wisdom of 8 (-1), and Charisma of 18 (+4). The Dexterity score provides very good agility and effectiveness in stealth and ranged attacks. The relatively low Wisdom score is bad, limiting its ability to resist mental effects, while the high Intelligence and Charisma scores are exceptional, supporting its spellcasting and manipulation capabilities. 

In terms of saving throws, the Ink Devil has a +6 modifier in Dexterity, which is very good, enhancing its survivability against physical threats. It is skilled in Arcana and History with a +9 modifier each, and it has a +6 modifier in Deception and Stealth, offering it a good advantage in social interactions and evasion tactics. The creature is immune to fire and poison damage and has resistance to cold and nonmagical attacks that are not made with silvered weapons, making it quite resilient to several forms of damage. It is also immune to being poisoned and has darkvision out to 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness.

The Ink Devil possesses several special abilities. With Devil’s Sight, it can see through magical darkness, making it advantageous in combat against foes who rely on light-based spells. Its Magic Resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells, further increasing its survivability against magical attacks.

In combat, the Ink Devil can use its Claw attack, rolling a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and dealing 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage on a hit. Its primary attack, Devil's Ink, is either a melee or ranged spell attack, also with a +6 to hit. This ability deals 13 (2d8 + 4) poison damage and can mark the target with a small, fiendish tattoo, which lasts for 24 hours. The marked target suffers disadvantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities of devils, while the Ink Devil’s allies gain advantage on attack rolls against the marked target, making this a potent ability for battlefield control.

The Ink Devil can also use Corrupt Scroll to touch a scroll, potentially corrupting it. If a creature attempts to use the scroll, they must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. Failure could result in the spell harming the caster, benefiting a nearby devil, or simply failing and consuming the scroll. 

Furthermore, the Ink Devil can turn invisible through its Invisibility ability, remaining unseen until it attacks or uses another action. While invisible, any equipment it bears is also concealed, facilitating surprise attacks.

In terms of spellcasting, the Ink Devil can cast spells without the need for material components, using Charisma for its spellcasting ability with a DC of 14. This includes casting detect magic and illusory script at will, and it can cast glyph of warding once per day, providing it with versatile options for information gathering and defensive measures.

Lastly, as a bonus action, the Ink Devil can use Disrupt Concentration, forcing a spellcaster within 30 feet to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure means the targeted spellcaster loses concentration on their current spell, demonstrating the Ink Devil's capability for controlling the battlefield effectively.
