The Wereshark is a large, chaotic evil humanoid creature that embodies the traits of both a shark and a human. This formidable foe is particularly dangerous due to its ability to switch between forms, allowing it to take advantage of its aquatic environment while also being a capable melee attacker on land. With a strong set of physical attributes, including exceptional strength and good constitution, the Wereshark can withstand significant damage and becomes even deadlier when its prey is wounded. While it possesses weaknesses to silvered weaponry, its damage immunities to nonmagical physical attacks make it a tough opponent. 

The Wereshark's attributes are as follows: Strength is 19, providing it a +4 modifier, which is exceptional and allows it to hit hard. Dexterity is 13 with a +1 modifier, considered average, providing it some agility but not enough to excel. Constitution is 17, resulting in a +3 modifier, which is good and helps it maintain its hit points in battle. Intelligence is 11, a +0 modifier, meaning it has average cognitive abilities. Wisdom is 12, giving it a +1 modifier, which is average, allowing it to notice its surroundings but not much more. Lastly, its Charisma is 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, categorized as bad, indicating poor social skills. 

The Wereshark has a total of 90 hit points, which is represented by rolling twelve 8-sided dice plus 36 points. Its armor class in humanoid form is 11, increasing to 12 in shark and hybrid forms due to its natural armor. The monster has bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing immunity from nonmagical attacks unless made with silvered weapons. Its perception skill is boosted to +4, allowing it to effectively notice details around it.

Notable special abilities include Blood Frenzy, which grants the Wereshark advantage on melee attack rolls against creatures that do not have full hit points. This ability can significantly increase its effectiveness in combat by targeting weakened opponents. In hybrid form, it can hold its breath for 1 hour, enabling it to fight in aquatic environments without the need for air. The Shapechanger ability allows the Wereshark to transform into either a Large shark-humanoid hybrid or a Large hunter shark. This form transformation does not alter its statistics other than size and armor class, maintaining its effectiveness in various forms. Additionally, while in shark or hybrid form, it possesses the Water Breathing ability, enabling it to breathe underwater.

When it comes to actions, the Wereshark can execute a Multiattack in either its humanoid or hybrid form, allowing it to make three attacks with a trident. The Bite action, available in shark or hybrid form, is a melee weapon attack with a +7 modifier and a reach of 5 feet, dealing significant piercing damage. If it bites a humanoid, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer from wereshark lycanthropy, posing a dire threat for those who survive the encounter. The Trident can be used in humanoid or hybrid form either as a melee attack with a reach of 5 feet or as a ranged weapon with distances of 20/60 feet. This attack also has a +7 modifier, dealing varying amounts of piercing damage based on the attack type. 

Overall, the Wereshark is a cunning and dangerous predator, ready to exploit any opportunity in combat, making it a formidable opponent for any adventuring party.
