The Knight is a Medium humanoid creature that epitomizes the ideals of honor and valor in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 3, the Knight is a capable combatant, boasting a strong Armor Class of 18 due to its plate armor and a healthy pool of 68 hit points, making it quite resilient in encounters. The Knight has an average speed of 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver reasonably well on the battlefield. This creature possesses a balanced set of abilities, with a notable strength (STR) modifier of +3, which provides good effectiveness in physical confrontations. However, its Dexterity (DEX) score is average, yielding a +0 modifier. The Knight's combat prowess is complemented by special abilities and actions that enhance its role in battles, providing both offensive capabilities and tactical advantages.

The Knight's attributes are as follows: Strength with a score of 16 (+3), Dexterity with a score of 10 (+0), Constitution with a score of 14 (+2), Intelligence with a score of 12 (+1), Wisdom with a score of 12 (+1), and Charisma with a score of 14 (+2). The Strength modifier is good for melee combat, allowing it to hit hard with melee attacks, while the Constitution contributes to its hit points, providing resilience. The average Dexterity means it won’t excel at initiatives or ranged attacks, while the average Intelligence and Wisdom do not significantly enhance its capabilities in those regards. However, the Charisma modifier of +2 is useful for certain abilities that rely on presence and challenges.

The Knight has a keen Perception score of 13, which translates to an average likelihood of noticing hidden threats or important details in its surroundings. In terms of stealth, the Knight has a score of 5; however, this number increases to 10 when not wearing armor, indicating that it can be reasonably stealthy when stripped of heavy gear. The Knight speaks Common and one other language, reflecting its diverse background.

One of the unique abilities of the Knight is "Chivalrous Presence," which allows it to choose a type of presence at the start of its turn that lasts until the start of its next turn. This may provide various tactical advantages during combat, although the text does not specify what effects these presences have on gameplay.

In terms of combat actions, the Knight can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three attacks with its Greatsword or four attacks with Javelins in a single turn. When utilizing the Greatsword, the Knight makes a melee attack roll with a +5 to hit, targeting a creature within 5 feet. When successful, this attack deals 10 slashing damage, calculated as 2d6 + 3. The Javelin serves as both a melee and ranged weapon, also with a +5 to hit, allowing engagement with targets within 5 feet or at a range of 30/120 feet. A successful hit with a Javelin deals 6 piercing damage, calculated as 1d6 + 3.

Additionally, the Knight can use a bonus action to activate the "Champion’s Challenge" ability. This ability targets one creature within 30 feet, requiring the target to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in the creature having disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than the Knight until the end of its next turn, making the Knight a formidable opponent capable of drawing attention in combat and protecting allies.

Overall, the Knight is a well-rounded combatant capable of delivering significant damage while also controlling the battlefield through its abilities and presence.
