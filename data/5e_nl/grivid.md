The Grivid is a large aberration known for its unique parasitic abilities and significant healing properties. This neutral creature boasts a robust armor class of 17 thanks to its natural armor and has a formidable pool of 180 hit points, making it quite durable in combat. With a challenge rating of 11, it presents a substantial threat to adventurers, capable of inflicting both physical and poison damage. Its main strengths lie in its capacity to inflict infestation through its parasitic cheek worms, which allows it to poison its enemies while simultaneously healing itself based on the number of creatures afflicted. However, it has notable weaknesses including low intelligence and charisma, which hinder its mental capabilities and social interactions.

In terms of attributes, the Grivid has a strength of 21, granting it a +5 modifier, classifying its physical ability as very good. It has a dexterity of 16 (+3), considered good, and a constitution of 18 (+4), also deemed very good, contributing to both its resilience and its ability to withstand damage. Its intelligence is notably low at 2 (-4), resulting in very bad mental proficiency, while its wisdom stands at 15 (+2), providing an average insight. Its charisma is drastically low at 5 (-3), classifying its charm and influence as very bad.

The Grivid has saving throw proficiencies in dexterity with a +7 modifier and wisdom with a +6 modifier, both of which enhance its resilience against harmful effects. It possesses skills in perception with a +2 modifier and has a passive perception of 16, allowing it to detect threats effectively within a 60-foot radius due to its tremorsense.

Among its special abilities, the Grivid can regenerate effectively through the use of its Cheek Worm Regrowth, allowing it to store and regrow worms after a long rest. It has Keen Sight, which grants it advantage on wisdom (perception) checks related to sight. The Parasitic Cheek Worm ability enables the Grivid to release worms during its attack, inflicting poison damage and inflicting the infestation condition. An infested creature incurs 5 poison damage at the start of each of its turns, with the potential for other creatures to remove the infestations. The Worm Regeneration ability allows the Grivid to regain health based on the number of creatures it has infested, giving it an exceptional self-healing potential.

During combat, the Grivid can make a Multiattack, performing one Bite and two Kicks, or three Spit Worm attacks. Its Bite attack has a +9 to hit, deals significant damage (18 piercing plus 7 poison), and can infest targets if certain conditions are met. The Kick attack also has a +9 to hit, deals 18 bludgeoning damage, and can knock targets prone if they fail a saving throw. Finally, the Spit Worm allows the Grivid to attack from a distance, dealing similar damage as the Bite while also having the potential to infest the target with a successful hit.

As a bonus action, the Grivid can use the Consume Worms ability, allowing it to ingest up to three of its stored worms to regain health, further enhancing its sustainability in prolonged encounters. Overall, the Grivid serves as a complex and dangerous creature that requires strategic planning to combat effectively.
