The Gray Orc is a Medium humanoid that embodies the characteristics of a stealthy and resourceful predator. With a neutral alignment, this creature exhibits strengths in both agility and resilience, making it a formidable foe despite its relatively low hit points. It has a notable Challenge Rating of 1/4, indicating it can be used effectively in combat scenarios designed for lower-level adventurers. The Gray Orc excels in stealth and mobility, capable of climbing, walking, and burrowing efficiently, which allows it to take advantage of its surroundings. However, it has vulnerabilities, specifically its sunlight sensitivity, which can significantly hinder its effectiveness in bright conditions. 

The Gray Orc has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average, and possesses 15 hit points, calculated with a formula of 2d8+6. This means it can withstand a moderate amount of damage before being incapacitated. It has a speed of 30 feet when climbing, 40 feet when walking, and 20 feet when burrowing. Its strength (STR) is rated at 14 (+2), giving it a good modifier for physical attacks, while its dexterity (DEX) is 16 (+3), leading to a very good ability, particularly useful for stealth and ranged attacks. The constitution (CON) of 16 (+3) suggests it has very good durability. Other mental attributes—intelligence (INT) at 9 (-1), wisdom (WIS) at 11 (+0), and charisma (CHA) at 10 (+0)—indicate its lack of strong social or magical capabilities.

In terms of skills, the Gray Orc is proficient in acrobatics (+5), athletics (+4), perception (+2), and stealth (+7), reflecting its adeptness in sneaking and agility-driven tasks. The creature possesses blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to navigate and act efficiently in low-light conditions. It communicates in Orc, enabling its potential for interaction with similar creatures.

The Gray Orc has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. "Silent Hunters" allows it to move and attack without making noise, which is particularly useful in ambush situations. The "Aggressive" ability lets it use a bonus action to close in on a target, enhancing its mobility in combat. The "Magic Absorption" trait allows it to regain hit points equal to the level of any spell that affects it, creating a unique dynamic against spellcasters, though it does not negate the spell's effects. With "Pack Tactics," the Gray Orc gains advantage on attack rolls against enemies within close proximity of its allies, significantly improving its combat efficiency. However, the "Sunlight Sensitivity" ability imposes a disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks that rely on sight when exposed to sunlight, making it less effective in open and bright environments.

For its action, the Gray Orc can use its claws to make a melee weapon attack. This attack has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet against a single target. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage. This reflects its reliance on quick, agile attacks rather than heavy weaponry, highlighting its role as a swift and cunning adversary in encounters.
