The Ring Servant is a large construct creature that functions primarily as a powerful ally for its creator in combat scenarios. With a notable armor class of 15 due to its natural armor and a significant pool of hit points totaling 114, it is quite durable on the battlefield. This creature excels in melee combat, utilizing its strong physical attributes, particularly its impressive Strength score of 20, resulting in good attack modifiers. It possesses various resistances and immunities that make it a challenging opponent, especially against non-magical attacks. However, despite its high physical prowess, the Ring Servant is of neutral alignment and cannot initiate spoken communication, relying instead on its understanding of the creator's language. Its challenge rating of 8 denotes a moderate level of threat, making it a substantial foe for adventurers.

The Ring Servant has a Strength score of 20, providing it with a modifier of +5, which is considered very good, allowing for effective melee attacks. Its Dexterity score is average at 10, offering no additional bonuses to its agility or reflexes. The Constitution of 18 gives it a +4 modifier, contributing to its resilience and hit point pool. Intellect is low at -1, affecting its ability to strategize, while a Wisdom score of 13 (+1 modifier) aids in perception checks. Charisma is average at 10, having no impact on social interactions or persuasive skills.

In terms of saving throws, the Ring Servant has a +8 modifier for Strength saving throws, which is exceptional, and a +4 for Wisdom saving throws, regarded as good. For skills, it boasts an excellent +8 in athletics and a good +4 in perception, enhancing its physical capabilities and awareness in the environment. The creature is immune to poison damage and can withstand cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, making it a reliable combatant.

The Ring Servant possesses special abilities that enhance its combat viability. The Immutable Form ability makes it immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form, ensuring it remains a constant threat on the battlefield. Its slam attacks are magical, allowing them to bypass certain resistances.

In combat, the Ring Servant can perform a Multiattack, making two slam attacks each turn. The slam attack has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals 18 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Furthermore, a failed DC 16 Strength saving throw forces the target to be knocked prone. 

Additionally, the Ring Servant can unleash its Ring of Destruction ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This special attack allows it to discharge a spinning ring of magical energy in a 20-foot radius, compelling each creature within that area to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers 45 force damage, while a successful save results in taking half damage. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield by damaging multiple opponents at once, creating an advantageous situation for the Ring Servant and its allies.
