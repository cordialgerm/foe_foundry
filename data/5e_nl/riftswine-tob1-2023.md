The Rift Swine is a large aberration that embodies chaos and unpredictability, making it a formidable and intriguing foe in any encounter. Its chaotic neutral alignment denotes a lack of concern for law or chaos, focusing solely on its own whims. With an armor class of 15 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 127, the Rift Swine can withstand considerable damage in battle. As a Challenge Rating 5 creature, it presents a moderate challenge for adventurers, providing 1,800 experience points upon defeat. While it shows strong physical capabilities with a Strength score of 18 (+4) and a Constitution score of 17 (+3), its Intelligence and Charisma are notably low, at 4 (-3) and 5 (-3), respectively. This leads to very bad performance in social interactions and intellectual challenges.

The Rift Swine has several unique abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Firstly, its special ability, Chaos Mutations, allows it to undergo a transformation at the start of each of its turns. Players must roll a d6 or select an option to determine the mutation, giving the creature a varied approach to combat that keeps players on their toes. The mutations can offer temporary benefits or alter its combat role. 

Under the Dozens of Eyes ability, the Rift Swine gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks tied to sight. This makes its perception abilities good, as it can effectively spot hidden enemies or threats. In combat, if not blinded, enemies attacking it lose bonuses from abilities that require allies to distract the Rift Swine, such as the benefits of Pack Tactics or Sneak Attack. This makes the creature particularly resilient against coordinated attacks.

In terms of combat actions, the Rift Swine can perform Multiattack, enabling it to unleash one Tusk attack and two Tentacle attacks, or it can choose to make three Warping Bolt attacks. Its Tusk attack has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average damage of 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage on a hit. The Tentacle attack also has a +7 to hit but a longer reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If a Medium or smaller creature is hit by a Tentacle, it becomes grappled with an escape DC of 14, leaving it restrained until the grapple ends. This adds a layer of control and crowd management to the Rift Swine's capabilities.

For ranged attacks, the Rift Swine can utilize the Warping Bolt, which has a +4 to hit with a range of 60 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 11 (3d6 + 1) force damage. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on attack rolls due to the reality-warping effects. This ability can significantly hinder an opponentâ€™s effectiveness in combat, especially if they are already engaged in battle.

Overall, the Rift Swine is a unique creature that combines physical menace and chaotic abilities, making encounters with it dynamic and unpredictable. Its strengths lie in its resilience and adaptability, while its weaknesses stem from its low mental attributes.
