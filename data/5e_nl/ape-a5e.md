The Ape is a Medium-sized beast known for its agility and physical strength, often acting as a brute force combatant in the wild. With a well-rounded physical presence and decent climbing abilities, it can prove to be a formidable opponent in melee encounters. The Ape's strengths lie in its impressive Strength score of 16, granting it an attack bonus of +5, and its decent Dexterity of 14, which contributes to its combat agility. However, its intelligence is remarkably low at 6, making it poor at complex problem-solving, and though it possesses average Wisdom, its lack of Charisma means it may struggle in social situations. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it represents a threat primarily to low-level adventurers, and while it has good hit points at 19, its moderate Armor Class of 12 means it can be vulnerable to more experienced foes.

The Ape has the following ability scores: 
- Strength (STR): 16 (+3) - This indicates that the Ape has very good physical power and can effectively deal damage in melee combat.
- Dexterity (DEX): 14 (+2) - This score results in a good level of agility and reflexes, allowing the Ape to move swiftly and avoid some attacks.
- Constitution (CON): 14 (+2) - Providing the Ape with good resilience, this score enhances its hit points and makes it tougher in combat.
- Intelligence (INT): 6 (-2) - A very bad score reflecting the Ape's limited cognitive abilities, indicating it struggles with tasks requiring intelligence.
- Wisdom (WIS): 12 (+1) - An average score which gives the Ape some perception and instinctual understanding of its surroundings.
- Charisma (CHA): 6 (-2) - This very bad score reveals the Ape's inability to charm or interact effectively in social situations.

In terms of skills, the Ape has proficiency in Athletics (+5), allowing it to excel in physical endeavors like climbing and jumping. It also has a Perception skill of +3, resulting from its average Wisdom, which helps it notice dangers in its environment. Its passive Perception score is 13, meaning it can detect hidden foes or traps without actively searching.

The Ape has two main types of attacks during its turn in combat. Its first action is the Multiattack, allowing the Ape to strike twice with its fists each turn. Each fist attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet, and dealing 5 (1d4+3) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

The Ape can also perform a Rock attack as a ranged option, throwing a rock at a target. This ranged weapon attack also has a +5 to hit, with a range of 25 feet for normal range and 50 feet for disadvantage. This attack deals 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage if successful.
