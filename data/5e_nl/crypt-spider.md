The Crypt Spider is a Medium beast characterized by its lawful evil nature and predatory behavior. It is most commonly found dwelling in dark, web-infested areas where it uses its intelligence and cunning to ensnare and dominate prey. With a solid Armor Class of 15 and a total of 38 hit points, the Crypt Spider poses a moderate challenge to adventurers, making it a worthy adversary in lower-level encounters. Its strengths lie in its dexterous movements, impressive stealth capabilities, and ability to manipulate webs for both offense and defense. However, being a beast means it lacks the magical abilities that some creatures possess, and its relatively low hit points can be a drawback in drawn-out engagements. 

The Crypt Spider’s attributes showcase a balance of physical prowess and agility. Its Strength is 14 with a +2 modifier, indicating good effectiveness in melee combat. The Dexterity score of 16 grants the spider a +3 modifier, which is very good and enhances its ability to evade attacks, as well as its stealth skills. With a Constitution score of 12 (+1), it has average resilience to damage. Intelligence is average at 10 (+0), while Wisdom is slightly below average at 11 (+0), making the spider aware of its surroundings but not particularly insightful. The Crypt Spider has a Charisma of 8 with a -1 modifier, which is very bad and limits its interactions with creatures that rely on persuasion. 

In terms of skills, the Crypt Spider possesses a +1 in Deception and Intimidation, suggesting it can manipulate or scare off weaker foes with limited success. Its proficiency in Stealth is heightened with a +5 modifier, indicating exceptional stealth capabilities, allowing it to remain hidden and ambush its prey effectively. The spider is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, making it particularly challenging as it can freely attack without fear of its own poisons. It has blindsight of 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling excellent perception in darkness, but its passive perception is only 10, which is average.

The Crypt Spider has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. "Cocoon Prey," used as a bonus action, allows it to envelop a creature restrained by its webs, imposing disadvantage on attempts to escape. The "Spider Climb" ability enables it to traverse difficult terrains, including ceilings, without difficulty. With "Web Sense," the spider can detect creatures in contact with its web, revealing their positions even in darkness. Finally, "Web Walker" allows it to move freely through webs without impediment, making it adept at navigating its territory.

In combat, the Crypt Spider has the following actions: 

- The "Bite" is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 6 piercing damage plus a Constitution saving throw (DC 13) for additional poison damage of 9 (2d8) on a failed save. This poison can leave the target stable but poisoned and paralyzed until they recover, posing a significant threat to any creature it bites.

- The "Web" action can be used when recharged (on a roll of 5 or 6). This ranged attack also has a +5 to hit and targets a creature within 30 feet. If successful, the target is restrained by webbing, which can be escaped with a DC 13 Strength check. The webbing has specific vulnerabilities and immunities, making it easy to destroy using fire, while resistant to other types of damage.

- The "Create Zombie" ability allows the Crypt Spider to raise a swarm of spiders as zombies, under its control. It can only maintain a maximum of four at any given time, making it possible to overwhelm opponents with additional threats.

Overall, the Crypt Spider is a formidable low-tier opponent in D&D 5e, with strategic combat capabilities and interesting abilities that can pose significant challenges to adventurers who stumble into its lair.
