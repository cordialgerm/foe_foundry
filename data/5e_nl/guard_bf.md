The Guard is a medium humanoid creature that serves the role of a frontline defender with enough combat capability to pose a threat if needed. With a challenge rating of 1/8, the Guard is suitable for low-level encounters and is primarily focused on protection. Its strengths lie in its decent armor class of 14 and the ability to perform both melee and ranged attacks with a spear, dealing reasonable damage. However, its hit point total of 8 is relatively low, suggesting that it can be taken down quickly if faced with sustained fire. The Guard's defensive maneuver, Protector’s Parry, allows it to provide assistance to allies, making it a valuable asset in combat situations.

The Guard possesses the following attributes: Strength +1 (average), Dexterity +1 (average), Constitution +1 (average), Intelligence +0 (very bad), Wisdom +1 (average), and Charisma +0 (very bad). Its overall attributes suggest a balanced but not particularly standout combatant. The Guard has a Perception skill score of 13, which is good, allowing it to notice hidden threats, and a Stealth skill score of 11, which is also average, giving it reasonable ability to move unnoticed. The Guard can understand any one language, typically Common.

The Guard is equipped with a spear, which it can employ both in melee and at range. When making a melee or ranged weapon attack with the spear, it has a +3 to hit, indicating a good chance of successfully striking its target. The spear inflicts 4 piercing damage on a hit when used one-handed (1d6 + 1) or 5 piercing damage when wielded with two hands (1d8 + 1), providing versatile attack options depending on the situation.

In terms of reactions, the Guard has Protector’s Parry, which allows it to protect a nearby ally from an incoming attack. When an ally within 5 feet of the Guard is targeted, it can use its reaction to grant that ally a +2 bonus to their Armor Class against the attack. This ability is useful for helping to shield more vulnerable allies, but requires the Guard to see both the attacker and to be wielding a melee weapon to utilize effectively. 

Overall, the Guard serves as a competent low-level soldier, capable of engaging in combat and also providing protective support to its teammates.
