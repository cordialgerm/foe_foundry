The Egret Harpy is a medium-sized monstrosity known for its aerial agility and enchanting songs. As a neutral creature, it possesses a unique balance of offensive and supportive capabilities, making it versatile in various encounters. With a challenge rating of 2 and a solid pool of 75 hit points, it can endure a fair bit of damage. The harpy’s strength lies in its innate spellcasting ability and its range of both melee and magical attacks. However, its armor class of 12 indicates a moderate level of defense, making it vulnerable to coordinated assaults. Its most notable feature is the ability to assist allies in navigation and effectiveness in marshy terrain, enhancing both combat and exploration dynamics.

The Egret Harpy's attributes include a Strength of 16 (+3), which is good for melee combat, a Dexterity of 14 (+2) that grants it average agility, and a Constitution of 17 (+3) contributing to its very good durability. It has an Intelligence of 11 (+0), which is average, a Wisdom of 14 (+2) reflecting its good perception, and a Charisma of 15 (+2), making its spellcasting ability strong and noteworthy. The harpy has skills in Acrobatics (+4) and Nature (+2), and it possesses passive Perception of 12, allowing it to notice hidden threats effectively. The creature speaks Common and Sylvan, aiding in communication with a range of characters.

The Egret Harpy has several special abilities. Its **Innate Spellcasting** allows it to cast the spell **Suggestion** three times per day without the need for material components. The effectiveness of this ability can significantly influence encounters by charming foes to follow a suggested course of action.

In terms of actions, the harpy can execute a **Multiattack**, performing two strikes per turn: one with its spear and another with its talons. The **Spear** can be used both as a melee weapon and a ranged attack, providing flexibility. It has a +5 bonus to hit, and it inflicts 6 piercing damage with a successful hit when used one-handed or up to 7 piercing damage when wielded with two hands. The **Talons** attack, also with a +5 to hit, deals 6 slashing damage upon a successful hit.

The harpy also features a **Wing Buffet** ability, which has a recharge of 5-6. This attack targets each Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet, requiring them to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On failure, they take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone; on a successful save, they take half damage and remain standing.

Additionally, the **Guiding Song** is a remarkable ability that enhances navigation for allies. When the Egret Harpy sings, all humanoids and giants it chooses within 300 feet gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks related to navigating marshes, and movement through difficult terrain in marshy conditions does not cost extra movement. This effect requires the harpy to use a bonus action on subsequent turns to maintain the song. The song can be ended at any time, but if the harpy chooses to end it to cast **Mass Suggestion**, each creature that hears the song must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be subjected to the spell's effects for 8 hours. The use of this spell significantly raises the stakes by allowing the harpy to charm multiple creatures simultaneously. However, if this song is utilized for Mass Suggestion, the harpy must complete a long rest before it can use Guiding Song again.
