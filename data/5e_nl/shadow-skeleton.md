The Shadow Skeleton is a medium undead creature with a neutral evil alignment, created from the remnants of a being that once lived. It serves as a formidable enemy in combat, relying on its agility and a mix of melee and ranged attacks to confound and weaken foes. With an Armor Class of 13 and Hit Points totaling 52, this creature demonstrates strong resilience in battle, augmented by its immunities to poison damage and several resistances, including fire, piercing, and slashing. The Shadow Skeleton possesses average physical strength but excels in Dexterity, enabling it to evade attacks effectively while delivering swift strikes. Notably, its actions can inflict significant damage while imposing debilitating effects on its targets.

The Shadow Skeleton has an Armor Class of 13, which provides a good level of defense against attacks. Its Hit Points, totaling 52, derived from 8d8 + 16, suggest that it can withstand a decent amount of damage before being defeated. The creature has a movement speed of 30 feet on land and 40 feet while swimming, which is quite good for its size, allowing it to navigate various environments effectively. 

Its ability scores include a Strength of 10, which is average; Dexterity of 16, regarded as good, granting it a +3 modifier to many attacks and helping its evasion; Constitution of 15, also good, providing a +2 bonus that bolsters its hit points and resilience; Intelligence of 9, which is considered bad; Wisdom of 11, the average score; and Charisma of 9, which is again bad. The Shadow Skeleton possesses skill in the Dexterity category due to its high Dexterity score, making it adept at stealth. 

In terms of damage immunities, the Shadow Skeleton is immune to poison and resistant to damage from fire, piercing, and slashing attacks. It also has condition immunities to exhaustion and the poisoned condition. Its darkvision, extending to 60 feet, and a passive Perception score of 10 allow it to notice hidden enemies effectively in low-light conditions. The creature understands all languages it knew in life but cannot communicate verbally, adding a layer of intrigue to its abilities.

The Shadow Skeleton can make two attacks in a single turn using its Multiattack ability, employing its scimitar for melee strikes. When using the scimitar, it has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit results in 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

Additionally, it employs its Finger Darts as a ranged attack. This ability also features a +5 to hit and operates within a range of 30 feet. A successful hit deals 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a living creature (not undead or constructs), they must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to avoid further effects. On a failure, the target is enveloped in a shadowy aura for 1 minute. While affected by this aura, the target suffers an extra 7 (2d6) necrotic damage when hit by the scimitar attacks from the Shadow Skeleton. The aura can be extinguished by a creature taking an action to perform a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check or through magical healing received by the target. This combination of attacks emphasizes the Shadow Skeleton's role as a tactical adversary that can not only deal damage but also weaken its opponents over time.
