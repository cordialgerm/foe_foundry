The Shoal is a gargantuan ooze that primarily resides underwater and poses a unique threat due to its unusual ability to mimic a school of fish. Despite its low Armor Class of 9 and relative slowness on land, it boasts a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 232, making it quite resilient in combat. The Shoal is a formidable opponent with a Challenge Rating of 10, which means it is designed to be a significant challenge for a party of adventurers. Its deceptive appearance and the ability to incapacitate enemies make it a dangerous enemy in aquatic environments. It shares a symbiotic relationship with fish, which enhances its capabilities further. However, its lack of intelligence and reliance on physical attacks can render it vulnerable to more strategic opponents. 

The Shoal has the following ability scores: Strength 20 (+5, which is very good), Dexterity 8 (-1, which is bad), Constitution 19 (+4, which is very good), Intelligence 1 (-5, which is very bad), Wisdom 10 (+0, which is average), and Charisma 5 (-3, which is bad). It demonstrates strong physical prowess with great durability, deriving benefits from its high Constitution score, but it performs poorly in mental or social interactions due to its low Intelligence and Charisma.

The Shoal has proficiency in perception, but it has a total Skill modifier of +0, which is average. It is immune to acid damage and resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It cannot be affected by being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, or prone, granting it a significant advantage in various combat situations. The creature has blindsight out to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without needing to see, and its passive perception is 10. The Shoal does not communicate verbally as it has no languages.

Notable special abilities include:
- **False Appearance**: While the Shoal has not yet attacked, it appears indistinguishable from a large school of fish. This allows it to ambush unsuspecting creatures.
- **Ooze Nature**: This ooze does not require sleep, giving it the advantage of being active continuously.
- **Symbiotically Bound**: The ooze and the fish share their life force as if they are one creature, making it difficult to separate or target them individually. 
- **Water Breathing**: This ooze can only breathe underwater, which restricts its movement and combat capability to aquatic environments.

In terms of combat actions, the Shoal can perform a **Multiattack**, consisting of the **Mesmerizing Spiral** ability followed by three **Pseudopod** attacks and the **Engulf** action. 

- **Pseudopod**: The Shoal can make a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, reaching a distance of 15 feet to strike one target. If successful, the attack deals 16 (2d10+5) bludgeoning damage and grapples the target with an escape DC of 16. This allows the Shoal to control and restrict movement of its opponents.

- **Engulf**: This powerful ability allows the Shoal to engulf a creature that is grappled by it, effectively restraining the target and preventing it from breathing unless it can breathe underwater. The engulfed creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the Shoalâ€™s turns or take 21 (6d6) acid damage. The Shoal can engulf up to two Huge creatures or up to eight Large or smaller creatures simultaneously, significantly increasing its threat level. However, an engulfed creature or one within five feet can use their action to attempt to free a creature from the ooze with a successful DC 16 Strength check, positioning it in an unoccupied space nearby.

- **Mesmerizing Spiral**: This unique ability can incapacitate all creatures within 20 feet that can see the fish inside the Shoal. Affected creatures must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw to avoid being incapacitated for one minute. While incapacitated, their speed is reduced to zero, leaving them vulnerable. Creatures can attempt to save again at the end of each of their turns, and those who succeed or have the effect end are immune to the Mesmerizing Spiral of all Shoal oozes for the next 24 hours.

Overall, the Shoal is a robust and cunning adversary that relies on its unique abilities and strength in numbers, especially in aquatic environments.
