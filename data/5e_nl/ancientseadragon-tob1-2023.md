The Ancient Sea Dragon is a powerful and imposing creature categorized as a Gargantuan dragon with neutral evil alignment. With an exceptional Armor Class of 22 and an astounding 518 hit points, it epitomizes strength and durability in combat. This dragon boasts impressive statistical values, particularly in Strength and Constitution, making it formidable both as an attacker and a defender. Its challenge rating of 23 suggests that it is a significant threat in higher-level campaigns, rewarding players with considerable experience points upon its defeat. Notable traits include its ability to breathe both air and water, and its immunity to cold damage, showcasing its adaptation to aquatic environments. However, it has a mundane Dexterity score, which presents an opportunity for adversaries to exploit its lack of agility.

The Ancient Sea Dragon's ability scores are as follows: Strength is 29 (+9), Dexterity is 10 (+0), Constitution is 27 (+8), Intelligence is 19 (+4), Wisdom is 17 (+3), and Charisma is 21 (+5). Its saving throws reflect its high constitution and charisma, granting it a good defensive module; it has a good +15 to Constitution saves and a very good +12 to Charisma saves. It also has high perception skills (+17), making it exceptionally aware of its surroundings. 

In terms of abilities, the Ancient Sea Dragon has several special traits:
- Amphibious: This allows the dragon to comfortably inhabit sea and land, breathing both air and water.
- Legendary Resistance: This ability allows the dragon to avoid the consequences of failed saving throws up to three times per day, effectively giving it an exceptional defensive capacity.
- Siege Monster: This trait means that the dragon can double its damage against objects and structures, making it a terrifying foe for fortifications.

In battle, the Ancient Sea Dragon can utilize a frightening multiattack system. During its turn, it first unleashes the Frightful Presence ability, which sends a wave of terror toward creatures within 120 feet. Any affected creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute, causing potential panic and disarray in their ranks. The dragon then executes one Bite attack and two Fin attacks. The Bite attack has a +16 to hit and deals an average of 34 damage (20 piercing plus 14 cold), while each Fin attack also boasts a +16 to hit, dealing about 16 (slashing damage). Additionally, the Tail attack has a reach of 20 feet also at +16 to hit, dealing 18 bludgeoning damage.

A key special attack is the Tidal Breath, which can be used every five to six rounds. This powerful move allows the dragon to exhale a torrent of frigid seawater in a 90-foot cone, forcing all creatures in the area to make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in significant damage—an average of 88 (44 bludgeoning and 44 cold)—as well as being pushed 45 feet and knocked prone, potentially changing the battlefield dynamics. Success mitigates the damage but does not provide safety from being pushed.

Additionally, the Ancient Sea Dragon can take three legendary actions at the end of another creature's turn. These actions can include making a Detect check to enhance its perception, executing a Tail attack, or performing a Wing Attack, which forces creatures within a 15-foot radius to make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can also reposition itself following the Wing Attack, enhancing its tactical flexibility.

Overall, the Ancient Sea Dragon is a powerhouse in any campaign, capable of dominating both air and sea battles while instilling fear and commanding respect from its opponents. Its variety of powerful attacks, combined with its high defenses and legendary traits, makes it a truly formidable enemy.
