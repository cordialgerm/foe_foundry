The Scorpionfolk is a large monstrosity that strikes a balance between physical power and tactical versatility in combat. With an armor class of 15 and 52 hit points, it is well-equipped to endure a moderate amount of damage, making it a challenging opponent, particularly suitable for encounters with characters around level 3. The creature excels in melee combat and has the versatility of ranged attacks using javelins. Its grapple ability can control the battlefield, but it relies on its close-range claw and sting attacks to inflict significant damage, especially when utilizing its poison effect. However, it possesses average intelligence and charisma, making it less effective in social interactions or spellcasting. Overall, the Scorpionfolk is a formidable foe with strengths in strength and dexterity, though it may struggle against foes adept at avoiding grapples or resisting poisons.

The Scorpionfolk's attributes are as follows: Strength is 14, which gives it a good modifier of +2. This allows it to perform well in melee combat. Dexterity is 12, granting it an average modifier of +1, which contributes to its stealth and agility but doesn't grant significant bonuses. Constitution is also 14, providing a good modifier of +2 that enhances its hit points and durability. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all at 10, resulting in a base modifier of +0 for these attributes, meaning it has no particular advantages or disadvantages in mental tasks.

In terms of skills, the Scorpionfolk has a perception score of +2, which allows for average effectiveness in noticing hidden creatures and traps. Its stealth score of +3 is good, indicating it can be relatively sneaky when trying to ambush its targets. The survival skill is also modestly effective at +2, aiding it in navigation and tracking.

The Scorpionfolk has a passive perception of 12, allowing it to be aware of its surroundings at an average level. It communicates in both Common and the Scorpionfolk language, enabling it to engage with others but limiting its effectiveness in social situations due to its average charisma.

In combat, the Scorpionfolk utilizes several actions. It can perform a claw attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, meaning it has good chances of striking an opponent. This attack has a reach of 5 feet, and if successful, it deals an average of 5 bludgeoning damage while also grappling the target at an escape DC of 12; this grappling can be strategic in holding an opponent in place, although it cannot attack other targets with its claws while wrestling.

The javelin attack functions as both a melee and ranged option, also with a +4 to hit, allowing flexibility in combat strategies. It has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 30 to 120 feet, dealing the same average damage as the claw at 5 piercing damage.

As a bonus action, the Scorpionfolk can use its sting, which is a melee weapon attack with a reach of 10 feet again at a +4 to hit. If successful, it inflicts 5 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an additional 16 poison damage (3d10), which is significant and can prove fatal if the target is unprepared for the poison. If the target succeeds in the saving throw, they only take half damage. This ability adds a layer of danger, as characters may need to be cautious around this creature to avoid high damage from poison.
