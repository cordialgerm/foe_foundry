The Tusked Crimson Ogre is a formidable creature that combines brute strength and chaotic tendencies. As a large giant, it boasts high physical attributes, making it a powerful opponent in melee combat. With a challenge rating of 5, it can pose a significant threat to parties of adventurers, especially due to its special abilities and attacks. The ogre is chaotic evil, which influences its unpredictable nature in battle. It has a high Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of hit points, totaling 93, which allows it to sustain a lot of damage. Its strengths lie in its ability to dish out heavy melee damage and capitalize on weakened foes, while its weaknesses include low Dexterity and Intelligence, indicating poor agility and mental acuity.

In terms of attributes, the Tusked Crimson Ogre has a Strength score of 19, providing it with a good modifier of +4, which means it is very good at melee attacks and carrying heavy objects. Its Constitution is also strong at 16, giving it a good modifier of +3 for saving throws. Its Dexterity score is low at 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, indicating that it isn't very agile. The ogre's Intelligence sits at a mere 5, leading to a very bad modifier of -3, which means it has poor problem-solving skills. Wisdom is similarly low at 7, resulting in a bad modifier of -2, impacting its perception and insight. Charisma is also poor, scoring a 7 with a bad modifier of -2, influencing its social interactions.

The ogre's saving throws are +6 for Constitution and +1 for Wisdom, indicating that it is quite resilient against physical threats but not particularly perceptive or wise. Its skills include a strong Athletics score of +7, which makes it very good at physical feats like climbing and jumping, and an Intimidation score of +4, marking it as intimidating in social situations. The ogre has damage resistance against poison and is immune to the frightened condition, allowing it to withstand certain types of damage and effects.

Notable special abilities include Blood Frenzy, which gives the ogre advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that is not at full hit points. This ability is effective in keeping it aggressive during fights. The Rampage ability allows the ogre to move quickly and make an additional bite attack if it reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, enhancing its offensive capabilities.

For actions, the Tusked Crimson Ogre can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to perform two separate attacks: one with its morningstar and another with its bite. The morningstar is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 piercing damage (2d8 + 4) on a successful hit. The bite attack also has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 11 piercing damage (2d6 + 4) on a hit.

The ogre also possesses a powerful special action, Berserker's Blood, which can be used when it does not have all of its hit points. This ability requires it to roll a recharge, and on a result of 5 or 6, it can unleash a fearsome roar and spray blood, forcing each creature within 15 feet to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Creatures that fail the save take 21 acid damage (6d6) and go berserk, attacking the nearest creature they see. Successful saves take half damage and are not affected by the berserk condition. This ability can dramatically shift the dynamics of a combat encounter, making it a powerful tool in the ogre's arsenal.

In summary, the Tusked Crimson Ogre is a brutish and chaotic foe, thriving on physical combat and utilizing special abilities that encourage aggressive play and overpowering damage, while having notable vulnerabilities in agility and intellect.
