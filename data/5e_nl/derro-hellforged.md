The Derro, Hellforged is a small yet formidable humanoid creature characterized by its lawful evil alignment. With a robust Armor Class of 16, the Hellforged boasts impressive hit points totaling 112, making it a resilient opponent in combat. Its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it poses a significant threat to parties of adventurers, providing 2,300 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the Hellforged possesses a unique combination of abilities that enhance its combat prowess while also introducing some vulnerabilities, particularly to light. Its strengths lie in its magical weapon attacks and resistance to certain types of damage, while its disadvantages include its impaired performance in bright sunlight and lower Wisdom, which means it struggles with perception checks.

The Hellforged creature has a Strength score of 16, corresponding to a modifier of +3, which is considered good, allowing it to deal significant melee damage. Its Dexterity score is 14 (+2), also a good modifier, which supports its defense and agility. A Constitution of 18 (+4) lends exceptional durability, enhancing its hit points and making it harder to incapacitate. The Intelligence score is average at 11 (+0), indicating it has no particular strengths or weaknesses in this area. Its Wisdom is low at 7 (-2), indicating a very bad passive perception ability, while its Charisma is good at 15 (+2), allowing for some effective interactions and magical influence.

In terms of saving throws, the Hellforged has a Dexterity saving throw of +5, a Constitution saving throw of +7, and a Charisma saving throw of +5, all of which are considered good. This makes it resilient to effects targeting these attributes. The creature has damage immunities to fire and poison, making it highly resilient against those types of damage. It also has damage resistance to cold and mundane bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attacks unless made with silvered weapons. It is immune to the poisoned condition, and it possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, with a passive perception score of 11.

The Hellforged has a few notable special abilities. The Insanity ability grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, making it difficult to control in social or magical confrontations. Its Hellfire Weapons ability means that its weapon attacks are considered magical and deal additional fire damage, specifically an extra 2d6 fire damage, which significantly increases its damage output. Conversely, due to Sunlight Sensitivity, the Hellforged has disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when exposed to sunlight.

In action choices, the Hellforged can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to take three attacks using either its Battleaxe or Hurl Hellfire abilities. The Battleaxe, used as a melee weapon attack, has a +6 to hit and can deal either 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage, or if wielded with both hands, it can deal 8 (1d10+3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage, showcasing its potential for high damage output. The Hurl Hellfire action is a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, allowing it to strike targets from a distance. This attack deals 12 (3d6+2) fire damage, igniting the target if it’s a creature or flammable object. The targeted creature will then take an additional 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns, unless it takes an action to extinguish the flames.

For reactions, the Hellforged possesses the Voice of Authority ability, which can be used when it is hit by an attack. The creature can issue a one-word command to the attacker, who must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to obey the command on its next turn. This reaction functions similarly to the command spell, adding a tactical layer to the Hellforged’s capabilities in battle, especially since the command can be issued without the attacker needing to understand the Hellforged's language. The requirement for the Hellforged to see the attacker and be able to speak to use this reaction enhances the strategic importance of positioning in combat.
