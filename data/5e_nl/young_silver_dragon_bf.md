The Young Silver Dragon is a formidable creature often found soaring through the sky, embodying the classic traits of dragons with its majestic appearance and powerful abilities. As a Large dragon with a Challenge Rating of 9, it possesses robust combat capabilities and a wide range of offensive and defensive options. Its high armor class of 18, excellent hit points totaling 175, and impressive speed of 40 feet walking and 80 feet flying make it a significant threat in combat. The dragon's strength lies in its ability to inflict severe cold damage through its breath weapon and restrain opponents with freezing fog. While its physical attacks and breath abilities are powerful, the Young Silver Dragon also has the ability to change its shape into various forms, adding versatility to its tactics. However, its overall effectiveness in combat is somewhat offset by its reliance on recharge mechanics for its breath weapon, which may limit its damage output in extended encounters.

For its attributes, the Young Silver Dragon has the following statistics: Strength is +6 (good), Dexterity is +4 (average), Constitution is +9 (exceptional), Intelligence is +2 (average), Wisdom is +5 (good), and Charisma is +7 (very good). These values indicate that the dragon is physically powerful and resilient, with a notable capacity for presence and charisma, which can be particularly effective in social interactions.

In terms of actions, the Young Silver Dragon can perform multiattacks, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. It can replace the Bite attack with a use of its Paralyzing Breath if that ability is available. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 17 piercing damage (2d10 + 6) on a successful hit. The Claw attacks also have a +10 to hit but have a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 slashing damage (2d6 + 6) when they connect.

The Cold Breath is one of the dragon's primary offensive abilities, which it can use after a recharge of 5 to 6. It allows the dragon to exhale an icy blast in a 30-foot cone, forcing all creatures within the area to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in taking 54 cold damage (12d8), while a successful one halves the damage taken. This attack is particularly devastating and can significantly alter the course of combat.

Additionally, the dragon possesses the Paralyzing Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of 6. This ability functions similarly to its Cold Breath but can incapacitate opponents, effectively removing them from combat temporarily if they fail the saving throw.

As a bonus action, the Young Silver Dragon can use its Change Shape ability, allowing it to magically transform into a Beast or Humanoid of Challenge Rating no higher than its own, or revert back to its true form. This ability is particularly useful for infiltrating or escaping scenarios, as it allows the dragon to retain its health, ability to speak, and mental abilities while adopting the physical traits of a different form, making it an unpredictable opponent in both combat and role-playing situations.
