In terms of skills, the Air Elemental lacks any specific bonuses. However, it benefits from damage immunities against poison and has damage resistance against lightning, thunder, and damage from nonmagical weapons, making it particularly resilient in the face of many attacks. It is immune to conditions such as fatigue, being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, and unconscious, which means it can effectively ignore many forms of control. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light and has a passive perception score of 10, indicating its ability to notice hidden foes.

The Air Elemental's special abilities include:
- Air Form: This ability allows the elemental to move through the spaces of other creatures and through openings as narrow as one inch without becoming hindered, making it highly mobile and difficult to trap.
- Elemental Nature: This grants the elemental independence from needing air, food, or sleep, allowing it to engage in prolonged encounters without suffering from exhaustion.

In combat, the Air Elemental can perform the following actions:
- Multiattack: The elemental can make two slam attacks, increasing its offensive capabilities.
- Slam: This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit, allowing it to land strikes against enemies effectively. On a hit, it deals 14 bludgeoning damage on average (3d6 + 4).
- Whirlwind (Recharge 5-6): By transforming into a whirlwind, the elemental can move up to half its fly speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If a creature shares the same space with the whirlwind during this movement, they must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. If they fail, they are carried inside the elemental's space, taking 3 bludgeoning damage for each 10 feet moved before falling prone as the whirlwind dissipates. The whirlwind can carry one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures, making it advantageous for controlling the battlefield.

Overall, the Air Elemental is a highly mobile and encompassing creature that can provide significant challenges, especially when used strategically in combat scenarios.
