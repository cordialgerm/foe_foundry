The Boggard is a Medium humanoid creature known for its agility and amphibious nature, making it an adept swimmer and a competent stealthy combatant. With a low Armor Class of 12 and a modest hit point total of 13, the Boggard is not particularly durable in prolonged combat but can be dangerous due to its ability to move quickly and strike with advantage. It has a Challenge Rating of 1/4, making it a relatively weak opponent in terms of overall power, but its unique abilities make it an interesting addition to encounters, particularly in aquatic or swampy environments. The Boggard has a good Dexterity score, which enhances its stealth capabilities, but its other attributes are average, indicating a well-rounded but not particularly remarkable creature overall.

The Boggard has the following attributes: Strength of 12 (+1), Dexterity of 14 (+2, considered good), Constitution of 10 (+0, considered average), Intelligence of 10 (+0, considered average), Wisdom of 10 (+0, considered average), and Charisma of 10 (+0, considered average). With a stealth skill modifier of +4 (considered good), the Boggard excels in stealthy maneuvers. It also has a survival skill modifier of +2 (considered average) but lacks any special senses beyond passive Perception, which is rated at 10 (considered average). The creature can communicate using its own language, Boggard, and has specialized communication with frogs and toads, connecting it to its swampy habitat.

The Boggard possesses two notable special abilities: 
1. **Amphibious** allows it to breathe both air and water, making it an effective creature in both land and aquatic environments. This dual capability enhances its survival and combat options in varied terrain.
2. **Speak with Frogs and Toads** enables it to communicate freely with similar creatures, potentially facilitating unique interactions in the game world.

In terms of actions, the Boggard has several combat options:
1. **Vaulting Leap** is an impressive ability that allows the Boggard to jump up to its speed horizontally and half its speed vertically, without provoking opportunity attacks. If it lands within 5 feet of an opponent, it can make a melee spear attack against that target with advantage. This means the Boggard can strategically maneuver in combat, engaging allies or evading threats effectively.
2. **Spear Attack** provides a melee or ranged option with a +3 to hit (considered average), reaching 5 feet or having a range of 20/60 feet. If the attack is successful, it deals 4 piercing damage (1d6 + 1), which is a modest output for a melee attack.
3. **Bite Attack** uses its sharp teeth to strike at enemies, with a +4 to hit (considered good). This attack has a 5-foot reach and, if successful, deals 4 piercing damage (1d4 + 2), offering a decent option in close encounters.

Overall, the Boggard's combination of agility, stealth, and amphibious abilities allows it to be a strategic, if somewhat fragile, opponent, excelling in surprise and opportunistic attacks rather than direct confrontation.
