The Brown Bear is a large beast characterized by its sizable physical presence and solid capabilities. With an Armor Class of 11, it has a relatively low level of defense, relying on its natural armor to absorb damage. It possesses 44 hit points, indicating a decent amount of resilience for its Challenge Rating of 1, making it a suitable opponent for low-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its physical attributes, particularly its strong Strength score of +4, making its attacks particularly formidable, along with good Constitution at +3. However, it has very poor Intelligence at -4, indicating a lack of cunning, and a low Charisma at -2, meaning it does not exert a strong social influence. The Brown Bear's speed is impressive, allowing it to move 40 feet on the ground and 30 feet while climbing, which enhances its mobility in various terrains.

The Brown Bear's special ability, Heightened Smell, significantly increases its Perception to 18 when relying on its sense of smell, allowing it to effectively track creatures or detect hidden foes in its vicinity. In gameplay, this translates to a much higher likelihood of perceiving stealthy characters or creatures nearby.

For its actions, the Brown Bear can execute a Multiattack, a powerful feature that allows it to strike twice: once with its Bite and once with its Claws. Each of these attacks can inflict considerable damage, making it a dangerous threat in combat. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit, meaning it has a good chance of successfully connecting with its target, and deals an average of 8 piercing damage. The Claws attack is equally effective, also with a +6 to hit, but deals even more damage at an average of 9 slashing damage. If both attacks land on the same target, the creature is grappled, which means it must succeed on a DC 14 escape check to break free, adding an additional layer of threat during encounters. Overall, the Brown Bear serves as an imposing physical opponent in nature, leveraging its strength and grappling ability to dominate its foes.
