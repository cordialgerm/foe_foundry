The Elite Kobold is a small humanoid creature that embodies a cunning, resourceful, and tactical mindset typical of its kind. Operating under a lawful neutral alignment, the Elite Kobold often plays a supportive role in battles, using its skills and special abilities to aid allies and create strategic advantages. With a moderate Armor Class of 14, it is not particularly resilient but compensates with good mobility, stealth, and teamwork skills. However, it has sunlight sensitivity, which presents a significant weakness, as it hampers its abilities in bright environments. Overall, the Elite Kobold offers a mix of combat prowess and unique tactical benefits, making it a tricky adversary when encountered in groups.

The Elite Kobold has the following attributes: Strength at 10, Dexterity at 17 (good), Constitution at 14 (average), Intelligence at 12 (average), Wisdom at 14 (average), and Charisma at 10. The Dexterity score is particularly notable, as it boosts the kobold’s effectiveness in stealth and ranged attacks. It has a total of 26 hit points, which allows it to endure a moderate amount of damage before falling in battle. Its speed is 30 feet, enabling it to maneuver effectively on the battlefield.

This creature demonstrates proficiency in certain skills, specifically perception with a modifier of +4 (good) and stealth with a modifier of +5 (very good). It also possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and a passive perception score of 14, which makes it vigilant against surprise attacks. The Elite Kobold can communicate in both Common and Draconic, facilitating interaction within its tribe or with other creatures.

Among its special abilities, the Combat Tunneler allows two Elite Kobolds working together to burrow through non-rocky soil at a speed of 15 feet, providing tactical advantages for ambushes or defensive operations. Their Pack Tactics ability grants them an edge in combat, as they gain advantage on attacks against a target if at least one ally is close by, enhancing their lethality when they attack in numbers. However, their Sunlight Sensitivity creates a disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks based on sight when they are in natural sunlight, making them less effective in bright environments.

The Elite Kobold has several actions it can utilize during combat. The Mining Pick is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 6 piercing damage on a hit. The Sling is a ranged weapon attack also with a +5 to hit, and it deals an average of 5 bludgeoning damage to a target within its range of 30/120 feet.

One of its notable abilities, Lantern Splash, allows the kobold to splash burning oil in a 15-foot cone. This attack has a recharge mechanic, meaning it can be used again after rolling a 5 or 6 on a d6. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success. This ability promotes area control and can deal significant damage to multiple opponents.

Another special action is Small but Fierce, which allows two Elite Kobolds standing close to each other (within 5 feet) to combine their efforts to create a damaging area effect. They can slam their mining picks into the ground, creating a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide and requires creatures within it to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 bludgeoning damage and gets knocked prone, while on a success, they take half damage and remain standing. This synergy between kobolds showcases their tactical capabilities and can disrupt or control the battlefield effectively.
