The Clockwork Hound is a Medium Construct with an unaligned nature, serving as an efficient tracking and combat companion. With an Armor Class of 12 and Hit Points totaling 71, it exhibits respectable durability for its Challenge Rating of 2, making it a suitable foe or ally for low-level adventurers. One of the standout features of the Clockwork Hound is its high Strength score of 16 (+3), which allows it to pack a punch in melee combat with good attack modifiers. However, its Intelligence and Charisma are very low, indicating it lacks social skills and complex thought processes. The hound has a movement speed of 50 feet, enabling it to maneuver swiftly around the battlefield. Its array of damage immunities and condition immunities provide it with excellent resilience against various threats.

The Clockwork Hound's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores are 16, 15, and 14 respectively, giving it very good physical capabilities and decent defensive attributes. Its Dexterity modifier of +2 and Constitution modifier of +2 contribute to its saving throws, making its Dexterity and Constitution saving throws both very good at +4. Its skills in Athletics and Perception, at +7 and +4 respectively, reflect its ability to engage in physical challenges and to be aware of its surroundings, with a passive Perception score of 14 indicating keen senses. 

The hound also benefits from several special abilities that enhance its performance. Its Construct Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without rest. The Diligent Tracker ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks involving scent, making it exceptionally adept at following trails and detecting creatures. Upon destruction, the hound's Explosive Core activates, causing an explosion that deals fire damage to nearby creatures, demanding a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to mitigate damage. Its Immutable Form provides immunity to any spells or effects that would attempt to change its physical structure, emphasizing its robust design. Additionally, the Magic Resistance ability grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability in magical confrontations.

In terms of actions, the Clockwork Hound can perform two main attacks. Its Bite attack has a +5 to hit and deals 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage, making it a potent melee option. The Tripping Tongue attack also has a +5 to hit and allows it to strike from a distance of 15 feet, dealing 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage, while also requiring the target to succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can severely hinder an opponent's ability to fight back effectively.
