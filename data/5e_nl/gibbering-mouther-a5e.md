The Gibbering Mouther is a Medium-sized aberration that embodies chaotic and unsettling traits. With a unique combination of confusion-inducing abilities and the capacity to manipulate its environment into treacherous terrain, it serves as a formidable challenge for adventurers. Its notable ability to absorb the victims it defeats reflects its grotesque nature. While it possesses a decent pool of health and resistance to psychic damage, its low armor class and lack of dexterity make it vulnerable to physical attacks. Adventurers must be cautious, as its babbling can disorient them, while its ability to impede movement can effectively control the battlefield.

The Gibbering Mouther has the following attributes: Strength of 10 (average), Dexterity of 8 (bad), Constitution of 16 (good), Intelligence of 2 (very bad), Wisdom of 10 (average), and Charisma of 6 (very bad). Its Constitution gives it a strong base of hit points, totaling 67, which allows it to absorb significant amounts of damage. However, its low Armor Class of 9 means it is relatively easy to hit in combat. 

In terms of special abilities, the Gibbering Mouther possesses several effects that can heavily influence gameplay. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe in both air and water without penalty. The “Gibbering Mouths” ability causes living non-aberrant creatures within 30 feet that can hear its constant babble to make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw at the start of their turn. Failure results in confusion, preventing them from effectively participating in combat until their next turn. The "Reality Eater" ability alters the ground within a 15-foot radius of the mouther to difficult terrain. Non-aberrant creatures who are either in this space at the start of their turn or enter it for the first time must make a DC 10 Strength saving throw. If they fail, their speed drops to zero until the start of their next turn, effectively stalling their actions.

In terms of actions, the Gibbering Mouther has the capacity to make a Multiattack, allowing it to perform two bite attacks during its turn. Each bite attack rolls a +2 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a hit. If a target takes enough damage to be killed by this attack, they are absorbed into the mouther. 

Additionally, it can use a Bonus Action known as "Blinding Bile" that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ranged weapon attack has a +2 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 3 (1d6) acid damage and also blinds the target until the end of the mouther's next turn, making it difficult for the victim to respond effectively to further attacks.

The Gibbering Mouther's combination of confusion, environmental manipulation, and high hit points, along with its capacity to blind targets, makes it a versatile and unpredictable threat in any encounter.
