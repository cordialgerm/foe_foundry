The Pyrohydra is a formidable Huge monstrosity known for its multiple fire-breathing heads and regeneration abilities. With an impressive Armor Class of 16 and a significant pool of Hit Points totaling 218, the Pyrohydra can endure extensive damage before being taken down, making it a resilient foe in combat. Its challenge rating of 13 signifies that it poses a serious threat to adventurers, providing a substantial 10,000 experience points upon defeat. Although it possesses a low Intelligence of 2, restricting its tactical capabilities, the Pyrohydra compensates with exceptional physical stats, particularly in Strength and Constitution, both rated at +5, marking their effectiveness as very good. The hydra is adept at using its environment to its advantage, with a speed of 30 feet on land and the same aquatic capability, allowing it to engage enemies both in and out of water.

The Pyrohydra's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength of 20, a Dexterity of 12, a Constitution of 20, an Intelligence of 2, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 6. The Strength and Constitution scores indicate that it excels in physical confrontations and can withstand a significant amount of punishment, whereas its Dexterity is average, meaning its agility is sufficient but not outstanding. The hydra has skills in Perception and Stealth, both at +5, showcasing its ability to detect intruders effectively. It possesses darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 15, making it highly perceptive. 

One of the Pyrohydra's notable special abilities is "Hold Breath," enabling it to remain underwater for up to one hour, making it an excellent ambusher in aquatic environments. Its "Legendary Resistance" allows it to negate failed saving throws three times per day, although it temporarily loses coordination with its heads when this ability is used. The "Multiple Heads" feature provides it with advantages on various saving throws and makes it immune to being flanked, enhancing its defensive capabilities. The "Reactive Heads" ability grants the creature multiple reactions, allowing it to respond to threats more flexibly. With the "Regenerating Heads" trait, the hydra can grow back heads at the end of its turn unless it has received certain types of damage, making it particularly difficult to defeat. Lastly, "Toxic Secretions" poisons the water around its lair, posing a significant hazard to intruders who might attempt to drink or swim in the area.

In terms of combat, the Pyrohydra can execute a "Multiattack," where it makes a bite attack with each of its headsâ€”totaling seven bites if all heads are intact. Each bite attack is made with a +9 to hit and deals an average of 10 piercing damage (1d10 + 5) when successful. Additionally, the "Fire Breath" ability allows the hydra to unleash a devastating area-of-effect attack that deals 59 fire damage to creatures within a 30-foot radius, requiring them to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage. 

For legendary actions, the Pyrohydra has two options available at the end of another creature's turn. The "Rush" action allows it to move quickly without provoking opportunity attacks, with the potential of knocking prone any creatures it passes through. The "Wrap" action enables it to grapple and restrain a Medium or smaller creature, capturing one prey per head. If one of its grappling heads is killed, the attacker can choose to release the grappled creature of their choice, adding strategic depth to its combat interactions.
