The Shadow Demon is a Medium fiend that embodies chaos and evil, often serving as a harbinger of darkness in the Dungeons and Dragons universe. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, boasting a total of 45 hit points and a mix of physical and magical abilities that make it a cunning opponent. The demon's notable strengths include its high Dexterity and Charisma scores, providing it with a good capacity for stealth and manipulative actions. However, it is particularly vulnerable to radiant damage, which can severely hinder its effectiveness in combat. Additionally, its ability to fly grants it excellent mobility, allowing it to engage or retreat from battles as necessary.

The Shadow Demon has the following attributes: Strength 5 (very bad), Dexterity 16 (good), Constitution 10 (average), Intelligence 12 (average), Wisdom 14 (good), and Charisma 16 (good). Its Dexterity modifier allows it to perform agile maneuvers and effectively dodge attacks, while its high Charisma enables it to influence or intimidate others effectively. The demon has saving throws of +5 in Dexterity, +2 in Constitution, and +5 in Charisma, which reflect a good resilience against effects targeting these abilities. Its proficiency in Stealth (+5) allows it to excel at sneaking and ambushing unsuspecting enemies. 

The Shadow Demon has several defensive qualities that make it a formidable foe. It is immune to cold, lightning, necrotic, and poison damage, reflecting its nature as a creature of shadows. It resists acid, fire, and thunder damage, as well as damage from nonmagical weapons, while having vulnerabilities to radiant damage, which can be particularly dangerous for it. It is also immune to several conditions, including charmed, grappled, and restrained, making it hard to control in battle.

In terms of senses, the Shadow Demon can see in darkness up to 120 feet with darkvision and has a passive Perception of 12. It can communicate in Abyssal and uses telepathy to communicate with creatures within 120 feet. 

The Shadow Demon possesses several special abilities that enhance its capabilities. Its Chaotic Evil trait signifies its malevolent disposition. The Incorporeal ability allows it to move freely through objects and creatures, although it takes force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. Its Light Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Perception checks in bright light, making it less effective in well-lit areas.

In combat, the Shadow Demon can use a number of actions. With Darken Light, it can magically douse nonmagical flames or dim magical light, creating advantageous conditions for itself for up to 10 minutes. Replace Shadow allows it to target a humanoid in dim light and attempt to replace their shadow; if successful, it can share the same space as the target, splitting damage taken while they are connected. This ability effectively allows the demon to hide in plain sight while dealing with damage indirectly. The demon's Claws attack is a melee weapon attack that deals significant cold damage, making it a tangible threat in close quarters.

As a bonus action, the Shadow Demon can use Shadow Sneak to take the Hide action, effectively allowing it to engage in stealthy tactics even in dim light or darkness. This ability further enhances its role as a stealthy ambusher, making it a challenging opponent for unprepared adventurers.
