The Lemure is a Medium Fiend, typically serving as a low-ranking denizen of the infernal realms. With a notably low Armor Class of 7 and only 13 hit points, it is not particularly durable in combat. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/8, making it a minor threat in a D&D encounter. Its strengths lie in its damage immunities to fire and poison, as well as its ability to see in the dark and penetrate magical darkness. However, its physical and mental attributes are exceptionally poor, especially in Dexterity and Intelligence, where it suffers severe penalties. Overall, the Lemure is not a formidable opponent on its own but can serve as an interesting encounter due to its unholy nature and special abilities.

The Lemure has the following ability scores: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 4 (-3), Constitution 10 (+0), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 2 (-4). It possesses average Strength and Constitution, but its Dexterity is very bad, making it easy to hit. The Intelligence and Charisma scores are exceptionally poor, indicating a lack of mental acuity and social capability.

In terms of defensive capabilities, the Lemure is immune to fire and poison damage, making it resilient against those types of attacks. It has resistance to cold damage and is immune to the poisoned condition, which helps mitigate the risks of certain status effects. The creature has darkvision with a range of 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light, and it has a passive Perception score of 10, which is average for noticing hidden threats. The Lemure understands the Infernal language but is unable to speak, limiting its ability to communicate.

The Lemure possesses some notable special abilities. First, "Devils Sight" allows it to see in magical darkness, giving it a significant tactical advantage against opponents relying on such effects. The "Eerie Groan" ability adds a haunting auditory dimension; while it can see a non-devil creature within 100 feet, it emits a groan that can be heard from 300 feet away, potentially disorienting or alarming nearby characters. Lastly, its "Lawful Evil" nature radiates a palpable aura that may affect interactions with other creatures, particularly those sensitive to alignments.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Lemure can use a melee weapon attack called "Fist." It has a +2 to hit with this attack, which is average, and can reach targets 5 feet away. On a hit, it deals 2 points of bludgeoning damage (1d4), which is minimal. Overall, the Lemure is not a strong combatant; however, its unique characteristics and thematic presence as a lowly fiend could add flavor to encounters for players navigating infernal environments.
