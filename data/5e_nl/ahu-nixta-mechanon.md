The Ahu-Nixta Mechanon is a Medium-sized construct that operates independently of any moral alignment. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, providing both combat capabilities and unique restorative abilities. The construct boasts an impressive Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor and a total of 51 hit points, making it somewhat durable for its challenge level. Notably, it is immune to poison and psychic damage, as well as various debilitating conditions like exhaustion and paralysis. Its strengths lie in physical prowess with a Strength score of 16, combined with abilities that allow it to grapple enemies or incapacitate them with sonic attacks. However, it has a very low Intelligence and Charisma, resulting in poor mental capabilities and unremarkable social interactions. The Ahu-Nixta also has unique features that can either hinder it or allow it to surprise its opponents, particularly with its ability to reactivate after falling to zero hit points, regaining health from the souls of the fallen.

The Ahu-Nixta Mechanon has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 3 (-4). The Strength modifier of +3 is good, enabling strong melee attacks. The Constitution score of 18 leads to a very good +4 modifier, contributing to its reasonable hit point pool, while the Wisdom score provides an average +2 modifier that aids in perception checks. However, its Intelligence is exceptionally low with a -3 modifier, which severely hampers any academic or strategic activities. The Charisma of -4 is very bad, making it ineffective at engaging in social interactions.

The Ahu-Nixta Mechanon's actions include a Multiattack ability, allowing it to perform two attacks with its Utility Arms or to combine a Slam and a Utility Arm attack in a single turn. The Slam is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit and does 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. The Utility Arm offers several options, such as the Grabbing Claw—an attack with +5 to hit dealing 8 (2d4+3) piercing damage and the ability to grapple the target with a DC 13 escape requirement. Should the target be successful in escape, it would no longer be restrained, which can turn the tide in combat.

The Sonic Disruptor is a ranged attack that employs a spell-like ability with a +4 to hit and inflicts 9 (2d6+2) thunder damage. Targets must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the end of their next turn, making it a powerful control effect. The Telekinetic Projector allows the mechanon to move creatures or objects within a range of 60 feet, offering strategic battlefield control by displacing enemies or manipulating objects without physical contact. Its ability to adapt appendages allows it to swap Utility Arms with other nearby mechanons, enhancing its versatility in combat.

Additionally, the Ahu-Nixta possesses a special repair feature that can be used twice per day to heal constructs or itself for 11 (2d8+2) hit points with a touch. This ability not only prolongs the mechanon's effectiveness in battle but also highlights its role as a support entity among construct allies.

Lastly, the Ahu-Nixta's unique abilities include Construct Nature, meaning it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, granting it a level of reliability in long-term scenarios. The Critical Malfunction special ability introduces a chance for critical hits to affect it in a unique way—if struck critically, there is a 20% chance that the mechanon will suffer a stunning effect until the end of its next turn. The Soul Reactivation ability enables it to stop functioning upon reaching zero hit points and become inert, yet it can reactivate by absorbing a portion of a nearby deceased creature's soul, regaining all its hit points plus additional health based on the deceased creature's challenge rating. However, if it remains inactive for an hour, it will be destroyed permanently.
