The Psoglav is a formidable large fiend that embodies chaotic evil, posing a significant threat to adventurers. With a high armor class of 17 and 115 hit points, it can endure a fair amount of damage, making it a resilient opponent. The combination of its impressive physical attributes—particularly strong Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution—enables the Psoglav to be both a powerful attacker and evasive in combat. However, its reliance on melee attacks and the need to maintain concentration on its invisibility or control of shadows can be potential weaknesses if exploited by clever tactics. The creature is distinctly dangerous due to its special abilities, particularly its power to control shadows, which can confuse and turn the tide of battle by summoning additional threats.

The Psoglav has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 21 with a modifier of +5, which is very good for dealing melee damage.
- Dexterity: 23 with a modifier of +6, which is exceptional, giving it high agility for both attack and defense.
- Constitution: 20 with a modifier of +5, making it very good at withstanding damage.
- Intelligence: 16 with a modifier of +3, which is good, allowing some strategic planning in combat.
- Wisdom: 19 with a modifier of +4, also good, enhancing its perception and saving throws against certain effects.
- Charisma: 18 with a modifier of +4, again good, lending power to its magical presence.

The Psoglav has impressive saving throws with the following bonuses: Dexterity +9, Constitution +8, Wisdom +7, and Charisma +7, indicating very good resilience against physical and magical threats. It possesses skills like Acrobatics +9, Perception +7, Intimidation +7, and Stealth +9, all supporting its role as a menacing fiend.

Its damage immunities include poison, while it resistances to cold, fire, and lightning attacks provide it with a defense against various elemental powers. It is also immune to the poisoned condition, further enhancing its combat effectiveness. The Psoglav utilizes its senses through blindsight out to 30 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, paired with a passive Perception score of 17. It communicates in Abyssal and Common languages and utilizes telepathy within a range of 60 feet, expanding its ability to engage with others already in combat.

The Psoglav's special abilities grant it distinct advantages. "Magic Resistance" allows it to have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it harder to affect with magical attacks. All of its weapon attacks are considered magical, enabling increased damage against creatures that are resistant to non-magical attacks.

In terms of actions during combat, the Psoglav can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three Bite attacks per turn. The Bite is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and deals a substantial 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage on a successful hit. Its ability to turn invisible until it attacks or uses its special abilities makes it exceptionally dangerous, as it can ambush unsuspecting foes.

The "Shadow-Stealing Ray", which recharges on a roll of 5-6, allows the Psoglav to emit a beam from its eye at a target within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer consequences: being pushed 20 feet away and losing control of its shadow, which becomes a creature under the Psoglav’s command for 24 hours. If the target succeeds, it is still pushed 10 feet away, but retains control over its shadow. The ability to summon up to five controlled shadows in combat can turn the tide of battle by forcing enemies to fight additional foes.

For bonus actions, "Shadow Jump" can be used three times per day, enabling the Psoglav to vanish into the shadows and reappear up to 60 feet away. This not only allows it to escape danger but can also facilitate unexpected attacks, further illustrating its role as a treacherous fiend in a combat engaged setting.
