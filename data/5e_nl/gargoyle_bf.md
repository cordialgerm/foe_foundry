The gargoyle is a medium elemental creature known for its ability to blend in with stone environments, making it difficult to detect until it unleashes its ferocity. With a challenge rating of 2, it is a formidable foe, capable of both physical attacks and tactical maneuvers. The gargoyle possesses decent defensive capabilities and can inflict significant damage through its claws and bite attacks. However, its intelligence and charisma scores are notably low, which limits its effectiveness in areas that require mental acuity or charm. Its ability to fly adds to its mobility in combat, allowing it to engage or escape as needed.

In terms of attributes, the gargoyle has a Strength score of 15, which gives it a +3 modifier that is considered good, allowing it to deliver strong physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is average at 10 with a +0 modifier, reflecting moderate agility and acrobatic prowess. The gargoyle boasts a Constitution score of 20, providing it with a +5 modifier, which is exceptional and contributes to its impressive 52 hit points. Its Intelligence score is low at 6, which translates to a -2 modifier, considered very bad, indicating poor reasoning and problem-solving skills. Wisdom and Charisma are also both low at 10 and 6, respectively, with modifiers of +0 and -2, both categorized as average and very bad, making it ineffective in social situations and decision-making.

The gargoyle has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Diving Pounce allows it to execute a powerful attack after flying toward a target, potentially knocking them prone if they fail a Strength saving throw against a DC of 13. When a target is knocked prone, the gargoyle can utilize its bonus action to make a Bite attack, capitalizing on the target's vulnerable state. The False Appearance ability provides a strategic advantage by allowing the gargoyle to remain undetected while immobile, effectively disguising itself as a stone statue.

When it comes to actions, the gargoyle can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to strike twice: once with its Bite and once with its Claws. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 10 points of piercing damage on a hit, calculated as 2d6 plus its Strength modifier. The Claws attack functions similarly, also making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, hitting for 8 points of slashing damage, calculated as 2d4 plus its Strength modifier.

The gargoyle has a defensive reaction called Fearsome Mien, which it can use when hit by an attack. By altering its appearance to look more terrifying, it can frighten the attacker unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 13. If they fail, they remain frightened of the gargoyle until the end of their next turn, potentially disrupting their effectiveness in combat.

Overall, the gargoyle balances offensive capabilities with tactical advantages that make it a unique and sinister opponent in any encounter, particularly in environments where it can effectively utilize its camouflage and mobility.
