The Hyena is a medium-sized beast often characterized by its quick movements and pack mentality. With an Armor Class of 11, it offers minimal protection, making it vulnerable in combat. Its low hit points, totaling only 4, indicate it can be easily defeated if targeted. The Hyena's primary strength lies in its agility, as denoted by a decent Dexterity score of 12 (+1 modifier), allowing it to act more effectively in combat situations. However, its mental abilities are significantly lacking, particularly its Intelligence (2, -4 modifier), making it simple-minded and not capable of complex strategies. With a Challenge Rating of 0 and yielding only 25 experience points upon defeat, the Hyena poses a minimal threat to even low-level adventurers.

In terms of attributes, the Hyena possesses the following scores: Strength of 10 (+0 modifier) is average, while its Dexterity is good, resulting in a +1 modifier that aids in initiative and reflexes. It has a Constitution score of 10 (+0), meaning it has basic resilience to effects and attacks. The Wisdom score is 12 (+1), which contributes positively to its perception in its surroundings, effectively enhancing its ability to notice potential threats or targets. Its Charisma is exceptionally poor (4, -3 modifier), indicating its limited ability to interact meaningfully with other creatures.

The Hyena has one key action: the Bite. The attack is made as a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit, giving it a slightly below-average chance of successfully hitting a target. The reach of the bite attack is 5 feet, and if successful, it inflicts 2 (1d4) piercing damage. Notably, if this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the Hyena can use its bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a second bite attack, showcasing its capacity to deal continuous damage in a combat scenario when it successfully downs an opponent. Overall, the Hyena is a simple but effective creature that thrives in opportunistic situations, particularly when targeting weaker foes.
