The Vampire Spawn is a Medium undead creature that functions as a formidable opponent in combat. It offers a mix of durability and offensive capabilities, reinforced by its special abilities and regeneration. With an Armor Class of 15 and a significant pool of 76 hit points, the Vampire Spawn can withstand a fair amount of damage. Its challenge rating of 4 signifies it can be a strong foe for a party of low to mid-level adventurers, offering 1,100 experience points upon defeat. The creature's strengths include high strength, constitution, and dexterity scores, allowing it to hit hard and avoid damage effectively. However, it has notable weaknesses, particularly to radiant damage and specific vulnerabilities to sunlight and running water.

The Vampire Spawn possesses the following attributes: a Strength score of 18 with a +4 modifier, which is exceptionally good for melee combat; a Dexterity score of 16 with a +3 modifier, indicating good reflexes and stealth capabilities; a Constitution score of 18 with a +4 modifier, enhancing its resilience; an Intelligence score of 10 with a +0 modifier, which is average; a Wisdom score of 14 with a +2 modifier, offering a decent perception; and a Charisma score of 14 with a +2 modifier, making it reasonably persuasive. 

In terms of saving throws, the Vampire Spawn has a +5 modifier in Dexterity, which is good, and +4 in Wisdom, also good. It also excels in skills, boasting a +4 in perception and a +5 in stealth, both of which are very good. The creature is vulnerable to radiant damage, which means it takes double the damage from such attacks. It also has damage resistance to necrotic damage and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, making it tough against ordinary attacks.

The Vampire Spawn has several special abilities: 
1. Regeneration allows it to regain 10 hit points at the start of its turn, as long as it has hit points remaining and has not taken radiant damage since its last turn.
2. Spider Climb enables it to traverse even the most difficult surfaces, including climbing on ceilings.
3. Vampire Weaknesses indicate that exposure to sunlight or running water results in it taking 20 radiant damage at the end of its turn and disables its regeneration while in contact with these weaknesses.

In terms of actions:
1. The Multiattack action lets it make two melee attacks, which enhances its damage output; however, only one of these can be a bite attack.
2. The Grab action is a melee weapon attack that has a +6 to hit, allowing it to grapple a target if successful, dealing 8 bludgeoning damage and requiring an escape DC of 14.
3. The Bite action, which is potent, is a melee weapon attack that also has a +6 to hit and can deal 9 piercing damage along with 14 necrotic damage. Importantly, the necrotic damage reduces the target's maximum hit points by an equivalent amount, which the vampire regains as hit points. If the bite reduces the target to 0 hit points, that target dies.

Finally, the Vampire Spawn has a reaction called Hissing Scuttle, which can be activated once per day. If the Vampire Spawn takes radiant damage, it can move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, allowing it to reposition strategically after suffering damage.
