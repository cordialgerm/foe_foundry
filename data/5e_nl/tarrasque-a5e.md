The Tarrasque is a massive and titanic monstrosity, renowned for its incredible durability and devastating offensive capabilities. With an exceptionally high Armor Class of 25 and a staggering 1,230 hit points, the Tarrasque is an extremely formidable opponent in any combat situation, effectively making it nearly indestructible without significant power or strategy from its foes. Despite its towering stature, its Dexterity is only average, which means it may not be the quickest creature on the battlefield. However, its Strength and Constitution are exceptional, allowing it to inflict severe damage and recover swiftly during combat. With abilities that enable it to regenerate health, resist magical effects, and deal double damage to structures, the Tarrasque is a menace that adventurers would be wise not to confront without careful planning.

The Tarrasque has the following ability scores: Strength 30 (+10), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 30 (+10), Intelligence 4 (-3), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 14 (+2). The exceptional Strength and Constitution provide it with significant advantages in both attack and durability. Its saving throws are: Strength +19 (exceptional), Dexterity +10 (good), Constitution +19 (exceptional), Intelligence +6 (very bad), Wisdom +11 (good), and Charisma +11 (good). It is immune to fire, poison, and damage from nonmagical weapons, making it very resilient against many forms of attack. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, allowing it to remain a constant threat on the battlefield without being easily hindered.

The Tarrasque possesses several notable special abilities. Its **Astounding Leap** allows it to jump a distance equal to its speed, which is 60 feet. The **Bloodied Regeneration** ability enables it to regain 50 hit points at the start of each of its turns while it is bloodied, further extending its presence in combat; however, this regeneration can be suppressed for 24 hours by a wish spell. With **Immortal Nature**, the Tarrasque does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. **Legendary Resistance** (3/day) grants it the option to succeed on failed saving throws, while **Magic Resistance** provides it advantage on saving throws against spells, making it a highly resilient creature against magical attacks. Its **Reflective Carapace** allows it to potentially reflect certain spells back at the caster, adding a layer of danger to spellcasting in its vicinity. As a **Siege Monster**, it inflicts double damage to objects and structures, reinforcing its role as a destructive force.

In terms of actions, the Tarrasque can perform a **Multiattack**, using its bite, claws, horns, or tail in a single turn or opting to use its **Swallow** ability instead of biting. Its **Bite** attack has a +19 to hit and deals 42 (5d12 + 10) piercing damage; if it successfully hits a creature, it grapples and restrains them. The **Claw** attack similarly has a +19 to hit and inflicts 32 (5d8 + 10) slashing damage, while the **Horns** attack can hit for 37 (5d10 + 10) piercing damage. The **Tail** attack deals 27 (5d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and can knock smaller targets prone. The **Swallow** ability allows the Tarrasque to swallow a Large or smaller creature, dealing severe damage to them while incapacitating them from outside effects.

One of its powerful abilities is the **Radiant Breath** (Recharge 5-6), which enables the Tarrasque to exhale radiant energy in a 90-foot cone. Creatures in that area must make a DC 27 Constitution saving throw, suffering 105 (30d6) radiant damage on a failure or half damage on a successful save.

Additionally, the Tarrasque has access to **Legendary Actions**, which can be used at the end of another creature's turn. It can attack, move up to half its speed, or unleash a **Roar** that can frighten creatures within 120 feet, imposing a DC 19 Charisma saving throw to resist the effect. If a creature fails the save, they are frightened for one minute. The Tarrasque can recover from negative effects while bloodied with **Elite Recovery**, and it can even use a more powerful **Chomp** action that allows it to use its bite or swallow attack. Lastly, the **Inescapable Earth** action can disable flying creatures within 300 feet, grounding them until the Tarrasque's next turn, contributing to its dominance on the battlefield.
