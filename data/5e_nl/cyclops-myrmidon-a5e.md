The Cyclops Myrmidon is a formidable Huge Giant creature known for its physical strength, resilience, and unique combat abilities. With an impressive Armor Class of 17 and a significant pool of 126 hit points, it can withstand considerable damage in battle. The cyclops excels in melee combat, making it a dangerous opponent, particularly when threatened. However, it struggles with ranged attacks due to its Poor Depth Perception, which reduces its effectiveness at a distance. While it possesses some basic skills such as survival and animal handling, its low Intelligence suggests limited strategic thinking. Overall, it serves as a heavy-hitting melee attacker, capable of unleashing devastating blows while providing a level of support with its special abilities during encounters.

The Cyclops Myrmidon's attributes indicate high physical prowess with a Strength score of 20, providing a good modifier of +5, which translates to good effectiveness in melee combat. Its Constitution score of 20 also grants it a +5 modifier, ensuring that it remains standing in battle. Dexterity is average at 10, indicating no bonus or penalty to ranged attacks or Armor Class. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are notably low, with Intelligence at 8 (-1, very bad) and both Wisdom and Charisma at 10 (+0, average), indicating limited awareness and social skills. 

The special abilities enhance its combat capabilities. "Panicked Rage" allows the cyclops to roll its attack rolls with advantage (exceptional) when frightened, turning a potentially disadvantageous situation into a tactical advantage. In contrast, "Poor Depth Perception" affects all ranged attacks, imposing disadvantage on them, which is a significant drawback.

In combat, the cyclops can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two melee attacks in one turn, maximizing its damage output. Its primary melee attack, "Maul," has a +8 to hit and can deal up to 26 (6d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. This is a considerable threat in close quarters. For ranged combat, the "Rock" attack also carries a +8 to hit, with a range of 120 feet, but due to the Poor Depth Perception, this attack is made with disadvantage. When it connects, it deals 32 (5d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, showcasing its potential for dealing damage even from a distance, despite the inherent difficulty.

The cyclops has a useful bonus action called "Thick Skulled," which can be used once per day to end a condition that resulted from a failed Wisdom saving throw, giving it an edge in maintaining its fighting capability against debilitating effects. 

As a reaction, it can use "Big Windup" when hit by a melee attack. This allows it to prepare a powerful counterstrike; it gains advantage on its next club attack against the attacker before the end of its next turn, promoting aggressive retaliation and strategic response in combat situations. 

Overall, the Cyclops Myrmidon is a strong yet flawed giant that thrives in melee situations but struggles when required to engage ranged targets effectively. Its abilities and attacks reflect its role as a brute force combatant on the battlefield.
