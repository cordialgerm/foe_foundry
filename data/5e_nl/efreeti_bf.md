The Efreeti is a powerful elemental creature, serving as an outsider from the elemental plane of fire. It is classified as a large monster with a challenge rating of 11, making it formidable in combat. The Efreeti possesses a high armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and boasts an impressive 223 hit points, enabling it to withstand significant damage. Its strong attributes include a +6 in Strength and Constitution, a +7 in Intelligence and Charisma, and a +6 in Wisdom, giving it good overall combat effectiveness and resilience. Although its Dexterity is average at +1, it compensates for this with its special abilities and spells. The Efreeti can fly and move quickly, granting it exceptional mobility in battle.

The Efreeti has advanced senses, including darkvision to 120 feet, a perception score of 16, and proficient stealth at +11, allowing it to remain undetected when needed. It communicates in Common and Ignan. 

Among its special abilities, the Efreeti can transform into a nebulous cloud form, significantly increasing its stealth capabilities while sacrificing its ability to manipulate objects or attack. In this form, it can hover in the air and slip through small spaces, making it challenging to catch or pin down. 

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Efreeti can launch a multiattack consisting of three different actions: using its scimitar or hurling flames. The scimitar attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 slashing damage plus an additional 10 fire damage on a hit. The hurl flame attack is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit; it has a range of 120 feet and delivers a significant 24 fire damage on a successful hit. The Efreeti can summon fire elementals once per day, commanding them for an hour to serve as allies in combat. Additionally, it can shift to another plane of existence once a day, avoiding dangerous situations or entering different realms.

As a bonus action, the Efreeti can create a blazing palisade, a wall of fire that can inflict damage on any creature that fails a Dexterity saving throw. This wall can be shaped strategically to control the battlefield. The Efreeti also has the ability to switch forms between its bipedal state and a cloud of smoke filled with fire sparks, which allows for versatile tactical options and the ability to maneuver easily through challenging environments. This creature's combination of high mobility, powerful attacks, and clever defensive abilities makes it an exceptional opponent in any encounter.
