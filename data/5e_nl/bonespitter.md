The Bonespitter is a gargantuan monstrosity that embodies both fear and power, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. With a notably high armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and substantial hit points totaling 217, it presents a significant challenge to adventurers. Weighing in at challenge rating 13, it offers 10,000 experience points to those who manage to defeat it. The Bonespitter has impressive physical attributes, especially in strength with a score of 26 and a modifier of +8, signaling its strength in melee attacks. However, its dexterity is quite poor at 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, making it slow and easy to evade. Its abilities reflect its monstrous nature, affording it various dangerous actions, including strong biting attacks and a capacity to restrain opponents. Its weaknesses lie mostly in its lack of mobility and reliance on strong physical attacks rather than finesse.

The Bonespitter possesses a strong Constitution score of 21, which translates into a +5 modifier, granting it an effective saving throw bonus of +10 against effects that require Constitution saves. It has a passive perception of 10, indicating an average awareness of its surroundings. Importantly, it has unique special abilities like "Bony Body," which creates an area of danger around it, dealing piercing damage to those who come too close. 

In combat, the Bonespitter uses the Multiattack action to make both a bite and a bone spike attack. The bite attack has a +13 to hit and deals a significant 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage. If it bites a Large or smaller creature, the target may be swallowed, rendering them blinded and restrained while taking ongoing acid damage unless they are undead. The bone spike attack also has a +13 to hit and deals 18 (3d6 + 8) piercing damage. On a successful hit, a Large or smaller target is knocked prone and pinned, requiring a Strength check to remove the spike.

One of the Bonespitter's special capabilities includes "Shard Spray," which it can use after recharging (which requires rolling a 5 or 6 on a d6). This ability allows it to exhale a 60-foot cone of bone shards that deals 35 (10d6) piercing damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw. If a creature fails this save and is Large or smaller, they are also restrained by a shard. This shard can be removed with a successful Strength check or can be destroyed.

Overall, the Bonespitter is a brutal and powerful foe, thriving in its ability to damage and restrain opponents while leveraging its large size to control the flow of battle.
