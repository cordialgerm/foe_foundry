The Cherufe is a formidable and massive elemental creature with a chaotic evil alignment, boasting powerful offensive and defensive capabilities. With a high armor class of 19 and substantial hit points totaling 161, it can withstand significant damage while dealing devastating attacks to its foes. The Cherufe excels in close-quarters combat, utilizing slam attacks and its ability to manipulate magma. Its strengths lie in its formidable physical prowess, impressive speed when taking fire damage, and its ability to create dangerous fissures in the ground to trap or hinder enemies. However, it has weaknesses, including low dexterity and intelligence scores, making it less agile and less cunning compared to other creatures. Overall, the Cherufe represents a significant challenge for adventurers, requiring strategic planning and teamwork to overcome its formidable powers. 

The Cherufe has the following attributes: Strength 22 (+6), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 21 (+5), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 6 (-2). It possesses noteworthy strengths in Strength and Constitution, granting it good physical damage and resilience in battle, indicated by a strong modifier of +11 to relevant saving throws, which is considered very good. Its Dexterity score is average, providing no modifiers that aid in avoidance or agility. It also has a good Wisdom score, giving it a good passive perception of 17. The Cherufe is immune to fire and poison, resistant to acid and lightning, and it takes reduced damage from nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, making it a tough opponent to damage with common weapons. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, poison, and being prone, making it highly durable in various situations. 

The Cherufe has a special ability called Firewalker, which allows it to double its speed when it takes fire damage, and additionally enables it to Dash or Disengage as a bonus action on its next turn. This enhances its mobility significantly when faced with fire attacks. The Internal Flame ability inflicts 7 (2d6) fire damage on any creature that touches the Cherufe or attacks it in melee within a 5-foot range, creating a deterrent for close combat engagement. This ability also causes the Cherufe to emit dim light in a 30-foot radius, which can impact visibility in dark areas.

In terms of actions, the Cherufe can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make four slam attacks against a target or throw two magma balls. The Slam attack has a +11 to hit and can deal 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage, making it a powerful melee option. The Magma Ball is a ranged attack with an effective range of 60/240 feet, dealing 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 11 (2d10) fire damage. This attack poses further risk to nearby creatures, as they must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage as well.

The Fissure ability allows the Cherufe to create a dangerous opening in the ground within 120 feet, which can trap creatures and cause structures to collapse. Any creatures standing in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling in, and if another fissure is opened, the previous one closes, forcing creatures out.

Finally, the Quake ability requires a recharge period of 6 rounds. By slamming its fists into the ground, the Cherufe triggers a tremor within a 60-foot radius, forcing creatures in that area to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. Unsuccessful creatures take 45 (10d8) bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone, while successful creatures take half damage and remain standing. This ability is particularly devastating in crowded battlefield situations, effectively disrupting enemy formations and providing a tactical advantage to the Cherufe.
