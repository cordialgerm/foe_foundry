The High Priest is a powerful and versatile spellcaster, serving as a vital support figure in any party, particularly in a clerical or divine context. With a high Armor Class of 18, the priest demonstrates good defensive capabilities, while their substantial Hit Points of 82, drawn from an 11d8 hit die, indicate good survivability in combat. Possessing a Challenge Rating of 6, the High Priest can challenge mid-level adventurers effectively, providing both healing and potent offensive spells. They excel in Wisdom and Charisma, with scores of 18 (+4) and 16 (+3) respectively, making them exceptional in saving throws related to these traits. While their Strength and Constitution are decent, their Dexterity is average, meaning they are less mobile but capable of holding their ground in battle.

The High Priest has the following ability scores: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 18 (+4), and Charisma 16 (+3). They have saving throw bonuses of +4 for Intelligence, +7 for Wisdom, and +6 for Charisma, which are significantly above average, suggesting a strong resilience against mental and divine effects. Skills in medicine (+7), insight (+7), persuasion (+6), and religion (+4) indicate a well-rounded character capable of both healing and social interaction. With a passive Perception of 14, they are observant and aware of their surroundings, and they can communicate in any three languages of the player's choice.

In terms of special abilities, the High Priest is an 11th-level spellcaster, primarily relying on Wisdom as their spellcasting ability. Their spell save DC is 15, and they have a +7 bonus to hit with spell attacks. The priest has several cleric spells prepared, which include various cantrips such as light, sacred flame, and thaumaturgy, and a range of spells across multiple levels, including powerful options like flame strike and raise dead. 

The High Priest can take several actions in combat. For melee attack, they can use a mace with a +5 to hit, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. Importantly, upon hitting, they can expend a spell slot to add additional radiant damage, starting at 7 (2d6) on 1st-level spell slot and increasing by 3 (1d6) for each level above that, making this a powerful option in combat. The Sacred Flame cantrip allows them to target a creature within 60 feet, forcing the target to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) radiant damage, with the ability to ignore cover.

Among their higher-level spells, Hold Person is a significant control option, allowing the priest to potentially paralyze a humanoid for 1 minute with a failed DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. The guardian of faith spell summons a spectral defender that can deal substantial damage to any enemies that approach, presenting a potent area control element. The Flame Strike spell delivers dual damage types (fire and radiant) in a large area, making it an effective offensive choice against multiple foes.

For bonus actions, the priest can cast Healing Word, a spell that allows them or a nearby ally to regain 6 (1d4 + 4) hit points. However, they cannot cast this and a spell of 1st level or higher in the same turn, which requires strategic timing during gameplay.

Overall, the High Priest serves as a formidable entity in any encounter, providing healing, area-denial, and offensive capabilities. Their well-rounded nature makes them an asset to any adventuring party.
