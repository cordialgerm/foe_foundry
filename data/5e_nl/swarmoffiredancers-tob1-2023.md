The Swarm of Fire Dancers is a medium-sized swarm of elemental creatures embodying the chaotic and destructive nature of fire. With a challenge rating of 7, they present a significant threat to unprepared adventurers, dealing substantial fire damage while being highly resistant to various damage types. Their ability to occupy the same space as other creatures allows them to effectively swarm opponents while causing ongoing fire damage and spreading fear through their appearance. Though they possess above-average defenses and immunities, their vulnerabilities to cold damage and susceptibility to water can be exploited by clever players.

The Swarm of Fire Dancers has an Armor Class of 15, which is good for a creature of its challenge rating, and features 90 hit points, calculated as 12d8 + 36, indicating an average durability in combat situations. Its ability scores are as follows: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 20 (+5, exceptional), Constitution 16 (+3, good), Intelligence 6 (-2, very bad), Wisdom 10 (+0, average), and Charisma 7 (-2, very bad). The swarm demonstrates remarkable agility and resilience, while its low intelligence and charisma imply it lacks social interaction abilities.

In terms of skills, the swarm has no specific proficiencies but has notable immunities, including damage from fire and poison, making it highly resilient against those types. It also resists damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. The swarm is immune to several conditions, including charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralysis, and poisoned, which greatly enhances its survivability. Its senses grant it darkvision up to 60 feet, and it has a passive perception score of 10, allowing it to detect threats in dimly lit conditions. The swarm understands Ignan, the language of fire elementals.

The special abilities of the Swarm of Fire Dancers include elemental nature, which means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep. Its Fire Form ability imposes fire damage on creatures that touch it or strike it in melee combat, dealing 5 (1d10) fire damage. When the swarm enters a creature’s space, that creature also suffers fire damage and has a chance of catching fire, leading to repeated damage each turn until extinguished. With its Illumination ability, the swarm sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, potentially affecting visibility during encounters. The swarm can occupy other creatures' spaces and move through openings suitable for a Tiny Elemental, though it cannot regain health or gain temporary health. Additionally, it is susceptible to water, taking cold damage when moving through it or being splashed.

For actions, the Swarm of Fire Dancers can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to use its Frightening Visage ability if it is charged, followed by two Singe attacks. The Singe attack is a melee weapon attack, with a +8 to hit, having a reach of 0 feet and impacting a single target within the swarm’s space. On a hit, it deals 22 (4d10) fire damage; if the swarm is at half hit points or lower, the damage is reduced to 11 (2d10).

The Frightening Visage, which has a recharge time requiring a roll of 5-6 on a six-sided die, enables the swarm to transform into a terrifying, blue, flaming humanoid skull. Any humanoid within a 30-foot radius who perceives this transformation must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for up to one minute. Frightened creatures may attempt to end this effect on their turns by repeating the saving throw. This ability can disrupt enemy formations and strategies, making the Swarm of Fire Dancers a powerful opponent in both direct combat and psychological warfare.
