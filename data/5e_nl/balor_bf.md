The Balor is a powerful and imposing Huge fiend of the demon type, known for its formidable presence in combat and its ability to wreak havoc on the battlefield. With a high Armor Class of 19 and a substantial pool of 292 Hit Points, the Balor stands as a significant threat to adventurers. It can traverse the battlefield with a speed of 40 feet on the ground and 80 feet while flying. As a Challenge Rating of 19 creature, the Balor is designed to be a major encounter for experienced parties. Its strengths lie in its exceptional Strength score of +14, which contributes to its melee attacks, and its impressive Charisma of +12, making it not only a brutal fighter but also a potent spellcaster. However, despite its strengths, the Balor has some weaknesses, particularly in its reliance on fire damage, which can be mitigated by creatures immune to it.

In terms of attributes, the Balor possesses a Strength of +14 (exceptional), Dexterity of +2 (average), Constitution of +12 (very good), Intelligence of +5 (good), Wisdom of +9 (very good), and Charisma of +12 (exceptional). The Balor's formidable Senses include truesight out to 120 feet and a Perception score of 19, allowing it to detect invisible creatures and perceive its surroundings with acute awareness. It has a Stealth score of 12 (average) and speaks Abyssal in addition to communicating via telepathy within a range of 120 feet.

The Balor wields several powerful special abilities. Its Demonic Flames ability means that fire damage dealt by the Balor bypasses resistance, making it particularly dangerous against creatures that are typically resilient to fire, while immune creatures still take no damage. The Demonic Resilience grants the Balor resistance to cold and lightning damage, alongside immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. The Diving Assault can knock targets prone if the Balor flies towards them, giving it an opportunity for a bonus Longsword attack against them. The Flaming Weapons ability allows the Balor to deal extra fire damage with all its weapon attacks, and its Fire Aura inflicts fire damage to any creature within 10 feet at the start of its turn, igniting flammable objects in the area. The Balor's Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

In combat, the Balor can take multiple actions during its turn. Its Multiattack action allows it to make one Gore attack, one Longsword attack, and one Whip attack. The Gore attack is a melee weapon attack with a +14 to hit, reaching out to 10 feet, dealing 15 piercing damage plus 13 fire damage. The Longsword attack, also hitting at +14 with a 10-foot reach, can deal 21 slashing damage, or 24 slashing damage if wielded with both hands, plus 13 fire damage. Additionally, it can score critical hits that allow it to roll damage dice three times rather than twice. The Whip attack has a range of 30 feet and can pull the target toward the Balor if they fail a strength saving throw. 

As a Bonus Action, the Balor can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, enabling it to reposition swiftly on the battlefield and avoid being cornered. This combination of strength, resilience, and tactical options makes the Balor one of the most fearsome foes in the world of D&D.
