The Matriarch Serpentine Lamia is a large monstrosity embodying the essence of a cunning, deceptive character. This creature is neutral evil and thrives in the shadows, using its powers of manipulation and stealth to control and ambush its prey. With a strong ability to influence others through deception and intimidation, the Matriarch is a formidable opponent, boasting a decent armor class of 15 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 90. Its movement capabilities are versatile, allowing it to walk, swim, and climb effectively, which enhances its tactical positioning in a variety of environments. While it has a lower Intelligence score, its high Charisma and Dexterity, along with unique magical abilities, make it a dangerous creature capable of charming foes and controlling the battlefield.

The Matriarch Serpentine Lamia has the following attributes: Strength of 12, which represents a bad modifier of +1; Dexterity of 17, translating to a good modifier of +3; Constitution of 16, which indicates a good modifier of +3; Intelligence of 8, resulting in a very bad modifier of -1; Wisdom of 15, corresponding to a good modifier of +2; and Charisma of 19, giving it an exceptional modifier of +4. 

In terms of skills, the Matriarch excels in deception and intimidation with modifiers of +10, indicating exceptional proficiency in manipulating others. It can also employ stealth effectively with a modifier of +6, which is good. With darkvision that extends up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 12, it can navigate and perceive its surroundings in low-light conditions better than most creatures. The creature communicates in both Abyssal and Common, which lends it further capabilities in interactions.

The Matriarch possesses several notable special abilities. With "Serpent Strike," she gains advantage on attack rolls against surprised creatures or those charmed by her or her allies, making her even more lethal in ambush situations. The "Snake Body" ability grants her advantage on saving throws and ability checks against being knocked prone, enhancing her resilience in combat. Through "Speak with Snakes," she can communicate with serpents, which may provide valuable allies or information. Her "Innate Spellcasting" ability allows her to cast spells with a Charisma-based spell save DC of 15 and a +7 to hit on spell attacks. 

The spells she can cast include:
- At will: "Animal Friendship" (for snakes only) enables her to befriend serpentine creatures; "Disguise Self" allows her to change her appearance into any humanoid form; and "Suggestion" lets her influence a creature to follow a course of action.
- Three times per day, she can cast "Animal Messenger" (for snakes only), which allows her to send a snake as a messenger; "Charm Person," enchanting a humanoid; "Hypnotic Pattern," creating a pattern that incapacitates foes; and "Moonbeam," which creates a beam of light damaging those within its radius.
- Once per day, she can cast "Compulsion," forcing creatures to move in a direction she chooses, and "Vampiric Touch," which allows her to deal necrotic damage and gain temporary hit points based on the damage dealt.

In combat, the Matriarch can perform multiple actions. With her "Multiattack," she can make three attacks but can only use each of her "Constrict" and "Debilitating Touch" attacks once. The "Scimitar" attack allows her to strike a target for 10 slashing damage. With "Constrict," she can grapple a creature (escape DC 14) and inflict 14 bludgeoning damage, restraining the target until the grapple ends. "Debilitating Touch" allows her to curse a target, inflicting disadvantage on their Dexterity and Strength checks for 10 minutes. Additionally, her "Seduce" ability can charm one humanoid within 30 feet for up to a day, compelling them to follow her commands unless they take damage or are given a harmful order. This ability, however, can only target one individual at a time and renders previously charmed individuals immune for 24 hours after the effect ends.
