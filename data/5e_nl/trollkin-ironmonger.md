The Trollkin Ironmonger is a sturdy medium humanoid creature known for its powerful regenerative abilities and tough armor, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With a challenge rating of 5 and a significant amount of hit points, this creature can absorb a considerable amount of damage before being taken down. It excels in melee combat with its ability to make multiple attacks in a single turn, effectively threatening multiple adversaries. However, its low Charisma and average Dexterity suggest it may struggle in social interactions and with ranged attacks. The combination of regeneration and high Armor Class gives it good durability, although it's vulnerable to fire and acid damage, which can temporarily negate its regenerative abilities.

The Trollkin Ironmonger has an Armor Class of 19, which is considered very good, due to the protective plate armor it wears and the bonus from its thick skin. It possesses 105 hit points, translating to a solid average of 14d8+42. This fortitude allows it to withstand significant damage in battle. It has a speed of 30 feet, enabling average mobility on the battlefield. In terms of ability scores, its Strength is high at 18 (+4), allowing it to deal substantial melee damage. Its Constitution score is also strong at 17 (+3), contributing to its hit points and overall resilience. The Dexterity score is decent at 13 (+1), representing an average agility. Intelligence is neutral at 11 (+0), Wisdom is slightly above average at 12 (+1), but its Charisma is low at 9 (-1), indicating ineffectiveness in social situations.

The creature has one key skill: perception, with a bonus of +1. It has darkvision extending 60 feet, which helps it see in dark environments, and a passive Perception score of 11, indicating average awareness of its surroundings. It can communicate in both Common and Trollkin languages.

The Trollkin Ironmonger possesses the following special abilities:

- **Regeneration:** This ability allows the Ironmonger to regain 3 hit points at the beginning of its turn, which can significantly prolong its life in combat. However, if the Ironmonger takes acid or fire damage, it cannot heal at the start of its next turn, creating a strategic vulnerability. It can only die if it is reduced to 0 hit points at the beginning of its turn without the chance to regenerate.

- **Thick Skin:** This special trait provides an additional +1 bonus to its Armor Class, further boosting its already solid defense.

In terms of actions, the Trollkin Ironmonger can perform the following:

- **Multiattack:** The Ironmonger can either make one attack with its Greatsword and two Slam attacks or opt for three Throwing Axe attacks in a single turn, allowing it to deal damage in various forms effectively.

- **Greatsword Attack:** This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit, making it a very effective threat in close combat, and deals 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage per hit.

- **Slam Attack:** This is another melee weapon option with a +7 to hit, dealing 8 (1d8+4) bludgeoning damage, which the Ironmonger can utilize if it chooses not to use its Greatsword.

- **Throwing Axe Attack:** This attack can be made in melee or ranged form, with a +6 to hit. It deals 7 (1d6+4) slashing damage and has a range of 30 feet for normal range and 60 feet for disadvantage.

For reactions, the Ironmonger has the following ability:

- **Impregnable Counter:** If a creature within 5 feet of the Ironmonger misses with a melee attack, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. This ability can turn the tables on attackers and create opportunities for counterattacks or to escape.

Overall, the Trollkin Ironmonger is a resilient and deadly combatant that can disrupt the flow of battle with its defensive mechanics and powerful melee capabilities.
