The Angler Worm is a huge, unaligned monstrosity that serves as a formidable opponent within the realm of Dungeons & Dragons. Its primary role in combat is that of a grappler and damage dealer, with unique abilities that allow it to control the battlefield effectively. With a solid Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 104, the Angler Worm is capable of enduring significant damage while inflicting harm on its enemies. However, it has low Dexterity, making it less effective in avoiding attacks. The creature is adept at using snares to trap enemies and can manipulate its environment to gain an advantage, creating danger zones for unsuspecting adventurers. Overall, the Angler Worm is dangerous when utilized in its favored terrain but may struggle when faced with fast, dexterous foes.

The Angler Worm has a Strength score of 14, granting it a +2 modifier that provides good physical power for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is very low at 5, resulting in a -3 modifier, which greatly hinders its ability to evade attacks – considered very bad. The Constitution score of 16 provides it with a +3 modifier, resulting in good resilience and capacity to sustain damage. Intelligence is notably low at 3, with a -4 modifier, rendering it average in tactics and problem-solving capabilities. It possesses Wisdom at 14, leading to a +2 modifier that supports its perceptive abilities, while Charisma is extremely weak at 1, giving it a -5 modifier, meaning it has very poor communication and interaction skills.

The Angler Worm is immune to poison damage and conditions such as being blinded, charmed, deafened, poisoned, or prone, making it exceptionally difficult to debilitate in traditional ways. It has tremorsense that extends up to 60 feet, which allows it to perceive movements and vibrations effectively, alongside a passive Perception score of 12.

Among its special abilities, the Angler Worm possesses Keen Touch, which grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks reliant on vibrations, thus enhancing its awareness in combat. The Snare Walker ability allows it to ignore any movement restrictions caused by its own snares or those of other Angler Worms, maintaining its mobility in a trapped environment. With the Spider Climb ability, it can scale difficult surfaces without needing to roll for checks, making it a versatile threat in battle. The Transparent Trap ability permits the Angler Worm to create nearly invisible snares, which present a hazard for creatures attempting to traverse the area without detecting them; this requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice.

In terms of actions, the Angler Worm can utilize a Multiattack, allowing it to perform either two Bite attacks or one Bite attack coupled with a Coils attack in a single turn. The Bite attack rolls with a +4 modifier and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 9 piercing damage plus an additional 3 acid damage on a successful hit. The Coils attack reaches 10 feet and similarly has a +4 to hit, inflicting 12 bludgeoning damage while also grappling its target with an escape DC of 13. While grappled, the victim is restrained and unable to breathe, suffering ongoing bludgeoning damage as long as the grapple remains in effect.

The Angler Worm can also use its Ethereal Lure ability, which recharges on rolls of 4 to 6. This ability creates an appealing orb of faint blue light within a range of 20 feet. Creatures within 60 feet that can see the light must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed, moving towards the light directly. Charmed creatures do not avoid opportunity attacks but can reattempt the save before entering dangerous terrain, adding an additional layer of strategy to encounters with the Angler Worm. If they wander into its snares, they suffer a disadvantage on their saving throw, further increasing the chance of being captured.
