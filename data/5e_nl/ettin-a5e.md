The Ettin is a Large Giant known for its brute strength and unique two-headed physiology. With a challenge rating of 4, it possesses a considerable amount of hit points at 85, making it a formidable opponent in combat. The Ettin's primary strengths lie in its high Strength score of 20, yielding a very good +5 modifier, along with exceptional endurances due to a Constitution score of 16, providing it with a +3 modifier. However, it suffers from low Dexterity (8, -1 modifier), resulting in poor agility and speed when it comes to dodging attacks. One of the notable features of the Ettin is its two heads, which grant it various advantages in perception and saving throws, making it difficult to incapacitate. 

The Ettin has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average and allows for some susceptibility to hits. It has a walking speed of 40 feet, enabling it to close in on targets effectively. In terms of saving throws, the Ettin has +7 for Strength and +5 for Constitution, both of which are good, enhancing its ability to withstand physical challenges. It also has an average Passive Perception of 12, which increases to 17 due to the advantages conferred by its two heads.

The Ettin's special abilities include Reactive Heads, which allow it to take two reactions per round, affording it greater opportunities to respond to threats. Its Two Heads ability grants it advantage on Perception checks and numerous saving throws, making it significantly harder to incapacitate through common conditions such as being frightened or stunned. Additionally, its Wakeful trait ensures that if one head is asleep, the other remains vigilant, preventing the Ettin from being easily ambushed.

When it comes to combat, the Ettin can utilize its Multiattack feature, allowing it to perform a battleaxe attack and a club attack in one turn. Both of these melee weapon attacks have a +7 to hit, reach of 5 feet, and inflict 14 slashing or bludgeoning damage respectively. The Club attack also has the potential to knock prone a creature if the Ettin is bloodied, requiring a DC 15 Strength check from the target. For ranged attacks, the Ettin can throw a rock, dealing a hefty 21 bludgeoning damage with a +7 to hit over a range of 30 feet up to 90 feet. Additionally, the Ettin has a powerful special attack called Axe Whirl, available once per day, which lets it strike all creatures within a 10-foot radius with its battleaxe, making it a dangerous foe in close quarters.

Overall, the Ettin serves as a formidable opponent for adventurers with its unique abilities and robust physical capabilities, while its weaknesses lie in its low Dexterity and susceptibility to ranged attacks.
