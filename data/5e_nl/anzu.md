The Anzu is a large monstrosity that embodies a formidable presence in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it has the potential to deal significant damage while also exhibiting resilience through its natural armor, which grants it an Armor Class of 16. Anzu's strengths lie in its impressive array of attacks and unique abilities, allowing it to engage effectively in both melee and ranged situations. However, it has a low Intelligence score, making it less adept at problem-solving or casting spells. The creature is particularly hazardous when it can surprise its opponents with its mobility, enabling it to deal substantial damage while evading counterattacks. This monster is also resistant to fire and lightning damage, granting it an advantage against many forms of magical attacks. 

The Anzu's attributes include a Strength of 20 (+5), which is very good, enabling strong physical attacks; a Dexterity of 14 (+2), which is average, allowing for decent agility; a Constitution of 18 (+4), which is good, giving it substantial hit points; an Intelligence of 7 (-2), which is very bad, limiting its cognitive abilities; a Wisdom of 15 (+2), which is average, providing reasonable perception; and a Charisma of 10 (+0), which is average. The creature has a total of 152 hit points, calculated as 16d10+64, reflecting its resilience in combat. 

The Anzu has proficiency in the perception skill, with a modifier of +6. This, combined with its keen sight ability, grants it significant advantages in detecting hidden or invisible creatures, as it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. It also possesses darkvision that extends to 90 feet and speaks Common and Primordial languages.

In terms of actions, the Anzu can make three attacks during its turn with its Multiattack feature: one bite attack and two talon attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, reaching out to 5 feet and dealing 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage along with an additional 7 (2d6) lightning damage on a hit. The Talons attack also has a +9 to hit and similarly reaches 5 feet, dealing 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

The Anzu can utilize Breath Weapons, which recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. It can choose between Fire Breath, which allows it to exhale fire in a 60-foot cone, requiring creatures in that area to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 45 (10d8) fire damage, while successful saves result in taking half damage. Alternatively, it can use Water Breath to exhale a wave of water in a 60-foot cone, also requiring a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 38 (11d6) bludgeoning damage and are pushed up to 30 feet away from the Anzu and knocked prone, while those who succeed take half damage without any additional effects.

Lastly, the Anzu has an ability called Lightning Relocation, allowing it to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Upon teleporting, it momentarily transforms into a bolt of lightning. Creatures within 5 feet of its starting or ending location must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success. If a creature lies within 5 feet of both locations, it only makes the saving throw once. This ability not only provides mobility but can also deal damage and disrupt enemy positions when executed effectively.
