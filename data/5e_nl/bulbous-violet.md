The Bulbous Violet is a Medium-sized plant creature that operates without alignment, making it a neutral entity in its interactions. It possesses a relatively low Armor Class of 12 and has 38 hit points, which consist of a combination of 7d8 plus a Constitution modifier. The violet can move at a speed of 20 feet on the ground and can also climb at the same pace. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it is considered a minor threat, granting 200 experience points upon defeat. The Bulbous Violet has notable physical attributes, particularly good Strength and Dexterity scores, indicating its capabilities in grappling and mobility. However, it has exceptionally low Intelligence and Charisma, reflecting its primal nature as a plant.

The Bulbous Violet has a Strength score of 15, which provides it a good modifier of +2. This allows the creature to be quite effective in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity score of 14 also grants a good modifier of +2, improving its agility and making it somewhat harder to hit. The Constitution score of 13 yields an average modifier of +1, providing the creature with decent hit points and resilience. However, its Intelligence score of 2 results in a very bad modifier of -4, indicating that it has minimal capacity for reasoning, learning, or problem-solving. Similarly, with a Wisdom score of 10, the creature has an average modifier of +0, which allows it basic perception skills. Its Charisma is also very low at a score of 2, giving it a very bad modifier of -4, showing it has no social capabilities.

In terms of special abilities, the Bulbous Violet has several noteworthy features. Its Acid Sacs ability allows it to retaliate when taking damage. If it suffers bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, any creature within a 5-foot radius must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 2 points of acid damage (1d4). The False Appearance ability allows it to blend in with its surroundings when it remains motionless, making it indistinguishable from other large flowering plants. The Flesh Sense ability gives the Bulbous Violet the ability to detect flesh-based creatures within a 60-foot range by scent, allowing it to be aware of potential prey nearby.

For actions, the Bulbous Violet can use its Tendril attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. When it successfully strikes a target, it inflicts 4 points of bludgeoning damage plus an additional 2 points of acid damage (1d4), and the target is grappled with an escape DC of 12. While grappling, the target becomes restrained and incurs 2 points of acid damage at the beginning of each turn until the grapple ends. The Bulbous Violet has two tendrils available, allowing it to grapple one target with each. If the acid damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the Bulbous Violet regains 7 hit points through a healing effect.

Overall, the Bulbous Violet presents a unique blend of environmental camouflage, grappling power, and retaliatory damage that can surprise unprepared adventurers. Its low hit points and lack of tactical intelligence may make it less formidable than other creatures, but its ability to deal persistent damage while grappling can lead to significant threats in larger encounters.
