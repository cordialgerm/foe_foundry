The Animated Instrument, Quartet is a large construct that exudes an aura of musicality and creation, serving as both an entertainer and a formidable opponent in combat. These constructs are typically unaligned, which means they do not lean towards good or evil, operating purely on their programmed intent. The quartet has a respectable Armor Class of 14, making it moderately difficult to hit due to its natural armor. With 102 hit points resulting from a robust combination of 12d10 plus 36, it can endure a fair amount of damage before being incapacitated. The creature’s movement combines a walking speed of 30 feet and a flying speed of 50 feet, providing it with good maneuverability. With a challenge rating of 4, the Animated Instrument can present notable challenges to relatively lower-level adventurers, rewarding 1,100 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of physical attributes, the Animated Instrument possesses a Strength score of 10, which provides it with average physical might. It has a Dexterity of 16, granting a good modifier of +3, allowing it to evade attacks effectively. With a Constitution score of 17, it has a good resilience, reflected in its ability to withstand damage. Its Intelligence is notably low, at 4, giving it a very bad modifier of -3, indicating that it possesses very limited cognitive abilities. The creature's Wisdom is also low, sitting at a score of 5, translating to an equally poor modifier. However, it excels in Charisma with a score of 18, providing an exceptional modifier of +4, which enhances its performance in musical abilities and interactions.

The Animated Instrument has proficient skills in perception, with a modifier of +3, allowing it to notice things more easily. It is immune to poison and psychic damage, making it resilient against specific attacks. Additionally, it is immune to several conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or paralyzed, which enhances its effectiveness in combat. The creature has blindsight up to 60 feet, which means it can sense its surroundings without needing sight, although it cannot perceive beyond that range. It does not communicate through language, aligning with its nature as a construct.

Special abilities of the Animated Instrument include Antimagic Susceptibility, which indicates that it becomes incapacitated in an antimagic field and risks falling unconscious if hit with dispel magic. Its Construct Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously. The False Appearance ability helps it blend in with a group of musical instruments when motionless, providing a tactical advantage in ambush situations. With the Four-Part Harmony ability, if the quartet takes a significant hit causing at least 25 damage, one of its instruments becomes unconscious, reducing its damage output from its attacks.

In terms of actions in combat, the Animated Instrument can perform a Multiattack action, enabling it to make two attacks using either its Trouble Clef or Orchestra Hit actions in a single turn. The Trouble Clef is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and deals a solid amount of bludgeoning damage at 13 on a successful strike. The Orchestra Hit acts as a ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit, allowing it to attack targets within 60 feet and dealing 18 thunder damage upon a successful hit.

Furthermore, the quartet can perform a Musical Arrangement, where it plays one of three songs. The Dreadful Dirge song produces a terrifying melody, compelling each hostile creature within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 14, failing which they become frightened until the end of their next turn. The Oppressive Overture plays a heavy melody that can cause all hostile creatures within the same range to attempt a Strength saving throw against DC 14, and upon failure, they are knocked prone. Lastly, the Seditious Sonata encourages rebellion through its melody, challenging hostile creatures to make a Charisma saving throw against DC 14, with failure resulting in disobedience and disruption, potentially altering the dynamics of combat encounters.
