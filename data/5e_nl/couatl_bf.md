The Couatl is a Medium celestial creature that embodies a fusion of beauty and power. With its celestial heritage, it serves as a guardian and protector, often aiding good-aligned beings in their quests. The Couatl possesses a remarkable degree of resilience against various forms of damage, making it a difficult opponent to defeat in combat. Its ability to fly enhances its mobility, allowing it to engage or disengage with ease. However, its challenge rating of 4 indicates that while it is potentially powerful, it is not invincible and can be overwhelmed if caught by surprise or outmatched by a coordinated attack. Notable abilities such as Magic Resistance and the ability to heal allies make the Couatl a valuable companion in any adventuring party.

The Couatl has an Armor Class of 17, which is considered good for a creature of its kind, providing it with a solid defense. It has 77 hit points, allowing it to withstand a reasonable amount of damage before falling in battle. The Couatl's speed is 30 feet on the ground and an impressive 90 feet when flying, giving it exceptional maneuverability.

In terms of ability scores, the Couatl has the following values: Strength 16 (+3, good), Dexterity 20 (+5, very good), Constitution 16 (+3, good), Intelligence 18 (+4, good), Wisdom 20 (+7, exceptional), and Charisma 18 (+6, very good). The very high Wisdom score enhances its effectiveness in tasks requiring perception and insight, while its Charisma aids in social interactions.

The Couatl's senses include truesight up to 120 feet, allowing it to see the invisible and perceive the true form of creatures and objects, making it exceptionally alert and aware. Its Perception score of 17 is good, while its Stealth score of 15 is considered average, indicating it can move quietly but is not specifically designed for stealth.

The Couatl understands all languages and can communicate telepathically within 120 feet, allowing for effective communication without the need for speech. 

Its special abilities include Celestial Resilience, granting it resistance to radiant damage and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The ability Inscrutable makes it immune to emotional sensing and divination spells, complicating attempts to discern its thoughts or intentions and giving it advantages in social interactions and stealth scenarios. Magic Resistance allows the Couatl to have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very resilient against magic. Finally, its Magic Weapons ability ensures that all its weapon attacks are considered magical, which is crucial for overcoming resistance to nonmagical attacks.

In combat, the Couatl can employ its Multiattack feature, allowing it to take one Bite attack and one Constrict attack in a single action. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage plus 14 poison damage on hit. If the poison damage reduces a target to 0 hit points, the Couatl can choose to make the target stable but poisoned for 1 hour, which is a powerful control option in battle. The Constrict attack, a melee weapon attack with the same +7 hit bonus and a reach of 10 feet, deals 12 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target if it is Medium or smaller. This ability restrains the target until the grapple ends, significantly limiting their actions.

The Couatl also has Healing Hiss, an ability usable three times per day, which allows it to heal a creature within 5 feet for 10 hit points and free them from any disease or poison, providing valuable support during combat.

As a bonus action, the Couatl can Change Shape, transforming into a Large or smaller beast or humanoid of equal or lower challenge rating. This ability allows it to adapt to various situations while retaining its key traits and capabilities.

Finally, the Couatl possesses the Rainbow Shield reaction, which can be triggered when it sees a creature within 30 feet being targeted by an attack. This allows it to create a shield that imposes disadvantage on the attack roll. Notably, if the protected creature has not attacked another creature in the last minute, the attack automatically misses, offering incredible defensive utility.

Overall, the Couatl is a powerful celestial being with excellent combat abilities, support capabilities, and impressive defenses, making it a formidable presence in any encounter.
