The Bugbear is a medium humanoid creature known for its brutish strength and cunning nature. With a challenge rating of 1, it serves as a formidable opponent for low to mid-level adventurers. The Bugbear excels in melee combat, thanks to its high Strength score of +5, which grants it exceptional damage potential when it strikes with its weapons. However, it is somewhat vulnerable to ranged attacks due to its moderate Dexterity and Constitution scores. The Bugbear specializes in stealth, making it an effective ambusher, and it has a significant advantage when attacking surprised foes, allowing it to inflict additional damage and potentially stun them in the process.

The Bugbear has the following attributes:
- Strength: +5 (exceptional), which enhances its melee attack rolls and damage output.
- Dexterity: +2 (good), improving its ability to avoid attacks and its effectiveness with ranged weapons.
- Constitution: +1 (average), offering a small bonus to its hit points and resilience against damage.
- Intelligence: -1 (bad), indicating a limited capacity for complex thought and strategy.
- Wisdom: +0 (average), providing a baseline for perception and insight checks.
- Charisma: -1 (bad), indicating social and interactional weaknesses.

The Bugbear has darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light and darkness as if they were bright light. Its passive perception is 10, which is quite basic, indicating it may notice threats rather well if alert, but not extraordinarily so. The Bugbear is stealthy, with a Stealth score of 16 (very good), making it adept at sneaking and ambushing unsuspecting targets. It can communicate in Common and Goblin, allowing it to interact with a variety of creatures.

Among its special abilities, the Bugbear has a notable feature called Brutal. This ability allows its melee weapons to deal one extra die of damage upon hitting a target, enhancing its already high damage output effectively.

When it comes to actions, the Bugbear wields a Spiked Club as a melee weapon and has an attack bonus of +5 to hit. The club has a reach of 5 feet and can inflict 12 piercing damage (2d8 + 3) on a successful hit. Notably, if the target is caught by surprise, it receives an additional 4 piercing damage (1d8) and must pass a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 13 or be stunned until the end of its next turn. This can significantly alter the course of combat, as a stunned target cannot take actions, potentially leaving it vulnerable to follow-up attacks.

Additionally, the Bugbear can throw a Javelin, which can either be a melee or ranged attack. It shares the same attack bonus of +5 to hit and can be used in melee range (5 feet) or at a distance with a range of 30/120 feet. When thrown, the Javelin deals 10 piercing damage (2d6 + 3) in melee, or 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2) at range, giving the Bugbear versatility in combat situations.

Overall, the Bugbear combines brute strength with stealth, making it a dangerous adversary when encountered, especially under the right conditions.
