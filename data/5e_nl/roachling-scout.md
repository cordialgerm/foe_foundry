The Roachling Scout is a small humanoid creature known for its chaotic neutral alignment. This creature operates as a scout, often navigating through environments with exceptional stealth and agility. With an Armor Class of 14 and 63 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of punishment while engaging in hit-and-run tactics. The Roachling Scout's strengths lie in its dexterity and perceptiveness, boasting a Dexterity score of 18, resulting in a +4 modifier which is considered very good. This allows it to excel in stealth and acrobatics, while its perception skills make it a formidable tracker. However, its Charisma is notably low at -1, indicating disadvantages in social interactions with non-roachlings, making it less effective in roles requiring charisma.

The Roachling Scout has a climbing speed of 15 feet and a walking speed of 25 feet, allowing it to navigate various terrains with ease. The challenge rating of 2 means that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, with an experience point value of 450. 

When examining its attributes, the Roachling Scout has the following scores: Strength is average at 10 (+0), Constitution is fair at 13 (+1), Intelligence is average at 10 (+0), Wisdom is good at 14 (+2), and Charisma is poor at 8 (-1). Its saving throws show an impressive Dexterity saving throw at +6 and a decent Constitution saving throw at +3, indicating it can dodge traps and resist effects that target its constitution effectively. 

Among its special abilities, the Roachling Scout has "Keen Smell," granting it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, making it an adept tracker. The ability "Resistant" gives it advantage on Constitution saving throws, increasing its ability to resist poison and other physical ailments. "Stealthy Traveler" allows the Roachling Scout to move stealthily even at a normal pace, enhancing its scouting capabilities. However, its "Unlovely" ability imposes disadvantage on Charisma (Performance) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks when interacting with non-roachlings, limiting its social effectiveness.

In combat, the Roachling Scout can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two attacks either with a begrimed shortsword or begrimed darts. The "Begrimed Shortsword" attack, which has a +6 to hit within a reach of 5 feet, deals 7 piercing damage plus an additional 7 poison damage on a successful hit. The "Begrimed Dart," a ranged weapon attack with the same to-hit modifier, functions effectively at a range of 20 feet normally and up to 60 feet at disadvantage, dealing 6 piercing damage and 7 poison damage if it hits. This versatility in attacks allows the Roachling Scout to adapt to different combat situations, applying both melee and ranged strategies.
