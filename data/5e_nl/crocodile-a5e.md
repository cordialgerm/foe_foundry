The crocodile is a large beast that prowls both land and water, making it an effective ambush predator. With a fair amount of hit points and decent armor, it can be a threatening opponent, especially in its aquatic environment where it can utilize its swimming speed to its advantage. While it lacks intelligence and charm, its physical attributes and melee capabilities make it a dangerous encounter for lower-level adventurers. The crocodile is categorized as a challenge rating of 1/2, suggesting it is suitable for inexperienced parties or as a minor threat in an encounter. Its ability to grapple targets enhances its combat effectiveness, particularly in scenarios where it can surprise adversaries.

In terms of attributes, the crocodile possesses a Strength score of 14, which results in a +2 modifier, indicating a good capacity for physical tasks like grappling or dealing damage. It has a Dexterity score of 10, resulting in a modifier of +0, which is average and does not significantly enhance its ability to avoid attacks. The Constitution score of 12 gives it a +1 modifier, allowing it to withstand some damage effectively. Intelligence is very low at 2, with a -4 modifier, indicating it has a very bad ability to understand complex scenarios. Wisdom is average at 10, with a +0 modifier, while Charisma is quite poor at 4, resulting in a -3 modifier, meaning it cannot influence others effectively. The crocodile has a stealth skill of +2, which is considered good for sneaking up on prey, while its passive perception of 10 is average, allowing it to notice most standard threats.

One of the crocodile's noteworthy special abilities is Hold Breath. This allows the creature to remain submerged or hidden in water for up to 15 minutes, maximizing its ambush potential. 

As for actions, the crocodile's primary attack is Bite. This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit, giving it a good chance of successfully landing a blow against most foes. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and targets one opponent. Upon a successful hit, the bite inflicts 7 (1d10+2) piercing damage, which can quickly escalate a fight due to its adversary being grappled. The grappled target must succeed on an escape check with a DC of 12 to break free; otherwise, it becomes restrained. This means that until the grapple is resolved, the target cannot move freely, and the crocodile cannot target new foes with a bite attack, making it a strategic move in combat. This ability to restrain can significantly influence the flow of battle, especially if the crocodile employs hit-and-run tactics in water or foliage.
