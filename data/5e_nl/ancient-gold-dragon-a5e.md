The Ancient Gold Dragon is a gargantuan and powerful creature renowned for its regal presence and formidable combat abilities. With an impressive challenge rating of 26, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. Its high armor class of 22 and substantial hit points totaling 487 make it exceptionally durable in battle. The dragon possesses exceptional abilities in both offense and defense, including devastating breath weapons and a suite of spells that can shift the tide of combat. However, its reliance on legendary actions and its limited usage of certain abilities do present weaknesses. Overall, the Ancient Gold Dragon embodies both majesty and terror, serving as a fitting adversary for experienced adventuring parties.

The Ancient Gold Dragon has the following ability scores: Strength of 30 (+10 modifier, very good), Dexterity of 14 (+2 modifier, average), Constitution of 28 (+9 modifier, exceptional), Intelligence of 18 (+4 modifier, good), Wisdom of 16 (+3 modifier, good), and Charisma of 28 (+9 modifier, exceptional). Its proficient saving throw statistics include Dexterity at +10, Constitution at +17, Wisdom at +11, and Charisma at +17, all of which are good or exceptional. It has skills in insight (+11), perception (+11), persuasion (+17), and stealth (+10), allowing it to excel in both combat and social interactions.

The Ancient Gold Dragon is immune to fire damage, making it resistant to one of the more common damage types. Its senses include blindsight out to 60 feet, darkvision extending to 120 feet, and a passive perception score of 24, indicating excellent awareness of its surroundings. It understands Common, Draconic, and two additional languages of the Dungeon Master’s choice, allowing for versatile interactions.

Among its special abilities, the Ancient Gold Dragon has "Legendary Resistance," which can be used three times per day. This ability allows the dragon to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, showcasing its resilience. However, every time this ability is used, it sheds some of its scales, causing a temporary drop in its armor class to 20 until it completes a long rest. The "Valor" ability grants a +3 bonus to saving throws and immunity to the charmed and frightened conditions for allies within 30 feet, enhancing team fighting capabilities. 

The dragon's innate spellcasting ability revolves around Charisma, with a daunting spell save DC of 25. It can cast a variety of spells, including "Bless," which grants a bonus to attack rolls and saving throws; "Healing Word," which allows it to heal an ally as a bonus action; "Banishment," which can temporarily remove a creature from battle; and "Greater Restoration," which can remove debilitating effects from allies. Once per day, it can also use "Divine Word," which can incapacitate weaker creatures, as well as "Hallow," a protective spell that prevents undead from entering a specified area.

In combat, the Ancient Gold Dragon can take a "Multiattack," using its ferocious biting and clawing at enemies. The "Bite" attack has a high hit modifier of +18, dealing 32 piercing damage plus 9 fire damage, making it very dangerous. The dragon's "Claws" attack also has a +18 hit modifier, dealing 28 slashing damage. The "Tail" attack, with a +18 hit modifier and a reach of 20 feet, inflicts 23 bludgeoning damage and pushes the target away.

The Ancient Gold Dragon also wields a unique "Greatsword" in its humanoid form, providing a melee attack option that deals 17 slashing damage. Its "Molten Spit" ability targets a creature within 60 feet, dealing 27 fire damage (with a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw for half damage) while creating dangerous pools of liquid gold that can inflict additional fire damage.

The dragon's breath weapons are exceptionally powerful. It can unleash "Molten Breath" in a 90-foot cone, demanding a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw from those affected. The damage from this attack can reach up to 88 fire damage, and creatures failing the save are encased in rapidly cooling gold, reducing their speed to zero. The "Weakening Breath" ability affects all creatures in a 90-foot cone, imposing disadvantage on weapon attacks unless they succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw.

The dragon can also change its shape into a humanoid or beast and revert back to its dragon form, allowing it to adapt to various situations, though its combat capabilities are limited in forms other than its true dragon shape.

As a reaction, the Ancient Gold Dragon can perform a "Tail Attack" when struck by a melee attack, countering with its powerful tail. The "Vanguard" reaction allows it to deflect attacks targeting allies, converting a hit into a miss.

The dragon has access to legendary actions that enhance its combat effectiveness. It can use "Roar" to frighten creatures within 120 feet, compelling them to save against its intimidating presence. The "Wing Attack" enables it to knock enemies prone and reposition itself, while the "Fiery Reprisal," which costs two legendary actions, lets it use its "Molten Spit" against the last creature that damaged it, showcasing its capability for retaliatory strikes.
