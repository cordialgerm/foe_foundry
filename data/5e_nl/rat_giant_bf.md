The Giant Rat is a small beast known for its agility and pack tactics, making it a noteworthy foe for low-level adventurers. It has an Armor Class of 13 and 14 hit points, which is modest but manageable for new characters. While its strength score is poor at -2, its dexterity at +3 allows it to swiftly evade attacks. With a challenge rating of 1/4, the Giant Rat is suitable for lower-tier encounters. Its special abilities, including heightened perception and pack tactics, enhance its effectiveness when fighting alongside allies. Though not particularly formidable individually, when working with others, it poses a greater threat through coordinated attacks.

The Giant Rat has the following attributes:
- Strength: -2 (very bad)
- Dexterity: +3 (good)
- Constitution: +0 (average)
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +0 (average)
- Charisma: -3 (very bad)

In terms of senses, the Giant Rat possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, but only in shades of gray. It has a Perception score of 10, which is average, and a Stealth score of 15, indicating good ability to hide from opponents. It does not speak any languages.

The Giant Rat has several special abilities that enhance its capabilities in combat:
- Accustomed to Filth: This ability grants the rat advantage on saving throws against diseases, making it more resilient in environments where diseases abound.
- Heightened Smell: The rat has an enhanced sense of smell, allowing its Perception to rise to 15 when relying on this sense, making it effective in tracking and detecting creatures.
- Pack Tactics: This ability allows the rat to have advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one ally is within 5 feet of that target and is not incapacitated, greatly increasing its chance of landing a hit when working in a group.

For its actions, the Giant Rat can execute a Bite attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. Upon a successful hit, it deals 5 piercing damage, which is decent damage for such a low-level creature. Additionally, the targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failure results in either contracting the rat plague disease or being poisoned until the end of its next turn, adding a toxic effect that can hinder opponents in combat. 

Overall, the Giant Rat serves as an effective minion in numbers, using its speed, stealth, and pack tactics to overwhelm unsuspecting adventurers with its disease potential and coordinated attacks.
