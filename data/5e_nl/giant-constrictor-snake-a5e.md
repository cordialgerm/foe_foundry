The Giant Constrictor Snake is a formidable creature, classified as a Huge Beast that thrives in various environments, including land, water, and trees, with a notable speed of 30 feet for walking, climbing, and swimming. This snake has an Armor Class of 12 and total Hit Points of 52, which means it can withstand a moderate amount of damage in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it poses a moderate threat to parties but can be particularly dangerous when it employs its characteristics effectively. The snake's Strength is very good at 18, providing it with significant physical power, while its Dexterity and Constitution are average. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma values are surprisingly low, which reflects its primitive nature. The Giant Constrictor Snake excels at grappling opponents, constricting their movements, and dealing with substantial biting damage.

The Giant Constrictor Snake's Strength score of 18 grants it a +4 modifier, making its physical attacks very effective. Its Dexterity score of 14 provides it with a +2 modifier, giving it a good initiative. The Constitution score of 12 offers it a +1 modifier, allowing for an average amount of hit points. The snake’s skills include perception with a +2 modifier, which is average and allows it to notice details and track movements in its vicinity. It possesses blindsight within 10 feet, allowing it to sense its surroundings even in total darkness, which enhances its combat effectiveness in dimly lit or dark areas. Its passive perception of 12 is good, enabling it to detect ambushes or hidden creatures. The snake cannot communicate in any known languages.

In combat, the Giant Constrictor Snake has two main actions: Bite and Constrict. 

The Bite action functions as a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. If successful, it inflicts 13 points of piercing damage, which can be significant against unsuspecting foes. 

The Constrict action also utilizes a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit but has a shorter reach of only 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 11 points of bludgeoning damage. More importantly, upon hitting, the target is grappled, presenting an escape challenge with a DC of 16. While the target is grappled, it becomes restrained, limiting its actions and significantly hindering its ability to escape.

Overall, the Giant Constrictor Snake poses a serious threat in combat due to its substantial physical damage and grappling capabilities, making it a dangerous encounter for adventurers who underestimate its size and strength.
