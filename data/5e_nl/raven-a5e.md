The Raven is a tiny beast known for its distinctive ability to mimic sounds, making it a useful companion or scout for adventurers in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. With a low challenge rating of 0, it poses minimal threat in combat but can be regarded as a creature of intelligence and curiosity. The Raven's highlights include a decent Dexterity score, allowing for good maneuverability, and a special ability to imitate sounds, which can be strategically advantageous. However, its frail hit points and weak attributes in Strength, Constitution, Intelligence, and Charisma demonstrate its vulnerability and lack of direct combat prowess.

The Raven has a very low Armor Class of 12, making it relatively easy to hit in combat. It possesses only 1 hit point due to a roll of 1d4-1, resulting in an exceptionally fragile state that means it can be taken out with almost any hit. The Raven has a walking speed of 10 feet and a flying speed of 50 feet, which provides it with good mobility, allowing it to escape combat situations effectively.

In terms of ability scores, the Raven has a Strength of 2, reflecting a very bad physical capability, and a Constitution of 8, which indicates a bad resilience. It demonstrates average Dexterity with a score of 14, granting it a plus 2 modifier, enhancing its agility and ability to evade attacks. Intelligence and Charisma are both very bad with scores of 2, while its Wisdom score of 12 and a plus 1 modifier gives it heightened perception skills.

The Raven is skilled in Perception, with a skill modifier of +3, enabling it to notice things in its environment effectively. Its passive perception is 13, meaning it can quietly observe its surroundings and detect hidden creatures or objects without actively searching. Ravens do not possess any inherent languages, which limits their communication abilities outside of mimicry.

The special ability of Mimicry allows the Raven to imitate familiar sounds it has heard, such as simple phrases or other animal calls. This can be useful for distraction or deception during interactions or role-playing scenarios. To recognize the sounds as imitations, a listener must succeed on a DC 10 Insight check, adding a layer of complexity to its use.

In combat, the Raven can take the action of a Beak attack, which is a melee weapon attack. It has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. The attack deals 1 piercing damage, but if the damage would bring a Small or larger target to 0 hit points, that target takes no damage from the attack, highlighting the Ravenâ€™s non-lethal combat style. Overall, the Raven serves as an amusing and versatile creature in various scenarios, capable of aiding players with its unique abilities despite its fragility in battle.
