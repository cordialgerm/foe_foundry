The Ghillie Dubh is a Medium Celestial creature that embodies the essence of good within forested environments. With a lawful good alignment, it is known for its strong connection to nature and its protective role over its woodland domain. This creature has several notable strengths, including a solid mix of Wisdom and Charisma, allowing it to excel in perception and social interactions. Its natural armor gives it a decent level of protection, while its special abilities enhance its stealth and adaptability in forested areas. However, despite its abilities and moderate hit points, the Ghillie Dubh can sometimes struggle against powerful foes due to its relatively low overall damage output. 

The Ghillie Dubh has an Armor Class of 13, which provides it with a good level of defense against attacks. With 52 hit points, reflecting the average durability of a creature of its level, it can withstand a reasonable amount of damage before being incapacitated. It has a movement speed of 30 feet on land and also possesses the ability to climb and swim at a rate of 20 feet each.

In terms of attributes, the Ghillie Dubh has the following values: Strength is 15 (+2, which is good), Dexterity is 13 (+1, which is average), Constitution is 14 (+2, also good), Intelligence is 12 (+1, average), Wisdom is 19 (+4, which is exceptional), and Charisma is 16 (+3, which is very good). It is proficient in saving throws for Wisdom (+6, which is very good) and Charisma (+5, which is good), and has several useful skills, including nature (+3, which is average), perception (+6, exceptional), stealth (+3, average), and survival (+8, which is very good).

The Ghillie Dubh has some immunities and resistances that make it tougher against certain threats. It is immune to poison damage, resistant to cold and radiant damage, and completely immune to the poisoned condition. Its passive perception score of 16 means it can notice hidden creatures fairly effectively.

It can communicate in several languages, including Celestial, Common, and Sylvan, and it can also use telepathy within a range of 60 feet to convey its thoughts to others.

Among its special abilities, the Ghillie Dubh can use Forest Camouflage to gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while hiding in forested terrains. Its One with the Trees ability allows it to gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks when it has spent at least 24 hours in a forest, and it can create a sapling-shaped sensor to see and hear within the forest for one minute. This sensor provides valuable reconnaissance, albeit at the cost of its own senses while concentrating on it. The Speak with Beasts and Plants ability allows the Ghillie Dubh to communicate effectively with creatures of the forest, enhancing its role as a protector of nature.

In terms of actions, the Ghillie Dubh can make a Slam attack, which has a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage upon a successful strike. Additionally, it possesses the unique ability Forest Knowledge, which has a recharge time of 6. This ability can manipulate creatures' understanding of the forest: by using Remove Knowledge, it can potentially cause nearby creatures to become lost within the forest, imposing disadvantage on their Wisdom (Survival) checks and increasing their travel time. Alternatively, utilizing Share Knowledge grants nearby allies advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks and allows them to navigate forest terrains more quickly.

All these traits make the Ghillie Dubh a formidable and insightful guardian of the woods, capable of aiding its allies and hindering its foes effectively in combat and exploration scenarios.
