The Caustic Charger is a huge monstrosity that serves as a formidable opponent in combat, boasting high hit points and effective damage output. With a challenge rating of 7, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who are unprepared for its abilities. The creature has a strong physical presence, with a Strength score of 19, granting it a good melee attack modifier of +7 to hit. However, its Dexterity and Charisma scores are average to bad, indicating a lack of finesse and social prowess. The Caustic Charger is immune to acid damage, making it resistant to any attacks of that nature, while its burrowing speed allows it to maneuver effectively through terrain. It possesses unique abilities that enhance its role in combat, particularly in disrupting enemy positioning and inflicting debilitating effects through its Tentacles attack.

The Caustic Charger has an Armor Class of 15, which is average for its challenge rating, and it has 133 hit points, derived from rolling 14d12, with an additional 42 added. This makes it relatively durable during encounters. It can walk 10 feet normally and burrow up to 30 feet, allowing for flexible mobility options on the battlefield.

The creature's attributes include a Strength of 19 (+4 modifier, which is good), Dexterity of 11 (+0, average), Constitution of 16 (+3, good), Intelligence of 4 (-3, very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0, average), and Charisma of 6 (-2, very bad). Its skills are not specified, but it has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 10, enabling basic sensory awareness in low-light conditions. It does not speak any languages.

The Caustic Charger has two special abilities: 

1. **Straddler:** This allows the Charger to occupy the space of a prone creature, thereby affecting movement dynamics when enemies attempt to stand up. If a creature stands from prone within the same space, it can only move 5 feet as part of that action, potentially limiting its options.

2. **Wastes Walk:** This ability grants the Charger normal movement through difficult terrain made of rocks or sand, meaning it does not have to expend extra movement points to traverse such areas. This is a good benefit that enhances its strategic positioning ability.

In combat, the Caustic Charger can perform a **Multiattack**, making two Ram attacks and optionally replacing one with a Tentacles attack. 

- **Ram:** This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit, reaches 5 feet, and deals an average of 22 bludgeoning damage (4d8 + 4). If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone; if the Charger moved at least 10 feet toward it beforehand, the target rolls with disadvantage on this saving throw.

- **Tentacles:** Also a melee attack with a +7 to hit and reaching 5 feet, it inflicts 7 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 4) combined with 14 acid damage (4d6). Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute, with the possibility to end this condition through repeated saving throws at the end of their turns. If the target is outside the Charger’s space when attacked, it takes half the acid damage and gains an advantage on its saving throw.

Additionally, the Caustic Charger has a **Bonus Action** called **Slurp.** This action allows it to feed on a creature that is paralyzed from the Tentacles attack. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by half the acid damage dealt, and the Charger regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction in hit point maximum lasts until the target completes a long rest. If the effect reduces the target's hp maximum to 0, it dies. 

These attributes and abilities create a complex and dangerous creature capable of dominating the battlefield with its unique mechanics, making it a noteworthy adversary for any adventuring party.
