The Guardian Naga is a large monstrosity that serves as a guardian deity, often found in sacred sites or ancient temples. With a challenge rating of 10, it possesses a robust combination of physical strength, magical abilities, and resilience that makes it a formidable opponent in combat. The Guardian Naga has a high Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, alongside a substantial hit point pool of 176, which allows it to withstand significant damage. One notable feature of this creature is its ability to return to life after death, demonstrating its tenacity.

In terms of special abilities, the Guardian Naga has Divine Strikes, making its weapon attacks magical and adding an extra 3d8 damage, chosen between necrotic or radiant, enhancing its threat during encounters. Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, ensuring it remains effective under duress. Additionally, its Rejuvenation ability allows it to return to life in 1d6 days unless a wish spell is cast to prevent it, making it a persistent threat.

When it takes actions, the Guardian Naga can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Slam or Spit Poison attacks, or one Constrict attack followed by two Slam attacks, showcasing its versatility in both ranged and melee combat. The Constrict attack has an attack modifier of +8 and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 8 bludgeoning damage plus 13 necrotic or radiant damage of its choice. If it successfully hits, it grapples the target, leaving them restrained unless they escape (DC 16).

It has the capability to cast bestow curse and cure wounds three times a day, freedom of movement and hold two times a day, and geas once per day, allowing it to exert some control over its environment and the actions of others.

The Naga also possesses a unique bonus action called Protector's Step, enabling it to teleport up to 120 feet within its protected site, accompanied by visual effects of swirling golden light or inky shadow, providing tactical movement options to evade or reposition during battle. This mobility can enhance its role as a protector, making it an even more formidable guardian.
