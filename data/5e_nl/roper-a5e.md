The Roper is a large monstrosity that embodies the ambush predator archetype within the Dungeons & Dragons universe. It is proficient in both melee attacks and grappling, making it a formidable opponent in close quarters. With an impressive armor class of 20 and a substantial hit point total of 93, the Roper can withstand significant damage. Its challenge rating of 5 indicates that it is designed for mid-level adventurers, presenting a serious threat to unprepared characters. The Roper's ability to disguise itself as a stalactite or stalagmite allows it to ambush unsuspecting foes. However, its low mobility with a speed of only 10 feet can be a weakness, making it reliant on its ranged attacks with tendrils and static positioning.

The Roper possesses the following attributes: a Strength of 18 (+4), which enables it to deliver powerful physical attacks; a Dexterity of 8 (-1), indicating a very bad ability to evade attacks; a Constitution of 16 (+3), which contributes to its good durability; an Intelligence of 6 (-2), reflecting a limited ability to strategize; a Wisdom of 14 (+2), allowing for good perception; and a Charisma of 4 (-3), suggesting it has very bad social skills. The creature is equipped with blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, along with a passive perception of 12, enhancing its ability to detect prey in dark environments.

The Roper has notable special abilities including False Appearance, which allows it to maintain the illusion of a stalactite or stalagmite while motionless, making it very difficult for adventurers to notice until it attacks. Its Spider Climb ability permits it to traverse vertical and difficult surfaces seamlessly. Each of its eight tendrils possesses an armor class of 20 and 15 hit points. They are vulnerable to slashing damage but immune to psychic attacks. Creatures can break a tendril by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. Any tendrils that are destroyed will regrow after a long rest.

In combat, the Roper can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make up to four tendril attacks before using its ability called Reel and concluding with a bite attack. A Tendril attack has a +7 to hit and a reach of 50 feet, grappling a target if successful (escape DC 15). A grappled target becomes restrained, limiting its mobility and making it easier for the Roper to attack. The Reel ability pulls all creatures it is grappling up to 25 feet closer, setting them up for additional attacks. The Roper's bite attack also has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 piercing damage (from 2d8 + 4) along with an additional 9 acid damage (from 2d8). This combination of abilities makes the Roper a tactically dangerous foe, capable of limiting the actions of multiple characters while dealing substantial damage.
