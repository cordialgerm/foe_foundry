The Wyvern is a large dragon-like creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat due to its blend of flight capabilities and powerful physical attacks. With an Armor Class of 13, the Wyvern has decent protection thanks to its natural armor, making it reasonably resistant to attacks. It boasts 147 hit points, which provide it with a good amount of durability in battle, allowing it to withstand several hits before being taken down. The Wyvern’s challenge rating of 6 indicates that it is a suitable encounter for medium-level adventurers. It is notably strong in physical attributes, particularly with a Strength score of +4, which is considered very good, and a Constitution score of +3, also regarded as good. However, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are low, -3 and -2 respectively, marking them as very bad, meaning it is not adept at social interactions or complex problem-solving outside of combat.

The Wyvern has darkvision extending 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, although it cannot discern color in darkness. Its Perception score of 14 indicates a good awareness of its surroundings, and a Stealth score of 10 suggests it is average at hiding from view. It does not communicate with any languages.

A key special ability of the Wyvern is called "Clumsy," which makes it vulnerable to conditions like grappled, prone, and restrained while it is not flying. This means that if enemies can knock it down or restrain it while it’s on the ground, it will suffer additional disadvantages.

In terms of actions, the Wyvern can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make both a Bite attack and a Stinger attack in one turn. When flying, the Wyvern can swap one of these attacks for a Claws attack, adding flexibility to its combat style. The Bite attack allows the Wyvern to make a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 11 piercing damage on a hit. The Claws attack also has a +7 to hit, deals 13 slashing damage, and has the same reach. The Stinger attack has a reach of 15 feet and inflicts 15 piercing damage, along with an additional 18 poison damage. The target of this attack must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute, which adds a significant tactical element to the Wyvern's abilities as poisoned creatures are hindered until they can shake off the effect.

As a reaction, the Wyvern can utilize "Reflexive Tail Whip." When an enemy enters a space within 15 feet of the Wyvern, it can make a tail attack against that creature. If the target fails a DC 15 Strength saving throw, it is knocked prone, creating potential tactical opportunities for the Wyvern and complicating matters for opposing characters. Overall, the Wyvern is a powerful and agile monster, capable of leveraging its mobility and attacks to dominate in combat scenarios.
