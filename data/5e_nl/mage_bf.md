The Mage is a Medium humanoid creature that can belong to any lineage, representing a powerful spellcaster in combat. With an impressive challenge rating of 6, the Mage boasts a substantial hit point pool of 140, which indicates its durability in battle. It has a base Armor Class of 10, but it can enhance this with the spell mage armor, raising it to 13. The Mage is primarily an offensive character, using its high Intelligence modifier of +6 to enhance spellcasting effectiveness. However, its physical attributes are notably weak, with a Strength modifier of -1, Dexterity at average levels with a +0 modifier, and Constitution also at a +0 modifier. The Mage is particularly vulnerable to direct physical combat but excels in dealing damage and controlling the battlefield with magical abilities. 

In terms of abilities, the Mage has several noteworthy features. Its Arcane Weapons ability allows weapon attacks to deal an additional 3d8 force damage, making its physical attacks significantly more potent, effectively giving it a strong offensive capability despite its low Strength. The Mage also possesses Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which enhances its overall survivability in encounters dominated by magic.

The Mage can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Dagger or Arcane Bolt attacks in a turn. The Dagger attack has a +3 to hit, can be used at melee range or from a distance with limited effectiveness (20 ft. range for normal and 60 ft. at disadvantage), dealing a base of 2 piercing damage and the added 13 force damage due to the Arcane Weapons ability. The Arcane Bolt attack, which has a +6 to hit and a range of 60 ft., deals a significant hit of 16 force damage on a successful hit.

The Spellcasting ability of the Mage allows it to cast several spells by using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 14. Its spell options include cantrips like detect magic, light, mage hand, and prestidigitation, which offer utility rather than direct combat effectiveness. The Mage can cast 3 times per day spells like fly, mage armor, and mirror image, allowing for tactical positioning and defensive options. Additionally, it has access to powerful spells such as fireball, haste, and slow, castable 2 times per day, and more potent spells like cone of cold and greater invisibility, which can be used once per day. These spells can greatly impact gameplay by providing area-of-effect damage, crowd control, and mobility.

Overall, the Mage combines magical prowess and utility in combat, maintaining a balance between dealing damage and protecting itself with magic. Its strength lies in spellcasting and magical attacks, while its weaknesses include low physical defenses and hit points in melee combat scenarios.
