Cyonaxin's special abilities enhance its effectiveness in combat and exploration. The "Blur of Motion" ability means when it moves at least 30 feet during its turn, ranged attacks against it have disadvantage, making it harder to hit. The "Chain Breaker" ability allows Cyonaxin to deal double damage to objects that restrain creatures, emphasizing its role as a liberator. Its "Evasion" ability lets it avoid damage from effects that allow a Dexterity saving throw for half damage; on a success, it takes no damage, making it exceptionally agile. Cyonaxin can also move freely regardless of obstacles, thanks to its "Freedom of Movement," which allows it to escape grapples by using just 5 feet of movement. The "Keen Smell" ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, enhancing its sensory capabilities. "Magic Resistance" gives Cyonaxin advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, reinforcing its resilience against spellcasting foes. Additionally, all of Cyonaxin's weapon attacks are considered magical. Its "Pounce" ability allows it to knock a target prone if it moves at least 20 feet straight toward it before striking, giving it the chance for an extra attack.

In combat, Cyonaxin can utilize its "Multiattack" feature to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 bonus to hit, dealing 16 piercing damage plus an additional 10 radiant damage. The Claw attack also has a +9 to hit and deals 13 slashing damage. Cyonaxin can unleash a "Frightful Yowl" as an action, which recharges on a roll of 6. Any hostile creature within 60 feet that hears it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. A frightened creature grappling or restraining another has disadvantage, adding a tactical advantage to Cyonaxin's allies, who can attempt to re-save at the end of each of their turns. The "Liberating Churr," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, empowers each friendly creature within 90 feet by granting them the benefits of "Freedom of Movement," along with special claws for unarmed strikes. These claws deal 1d6 + the creature's Strength modifier in slashing damage instead of the typical bludgeoning damage for unarmed strikes, providing a significant enhancement to their combat effectiveness. This effect lasts until the start of Cyonaxin's next turn. As a bonus action, Cyonaxin can take the Dash action, enabling it to maximize its movement and reposition on the battlefield swiftly.
