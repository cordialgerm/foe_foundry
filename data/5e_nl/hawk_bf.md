The hawk is a tiny beast with a delicate physique and keen sensory abilities. With an Armor Class of 11 and only 7 Hit Points, it is not a formidable opponent in a direct confrontation, reflecting its role as a scout or messenger rather than a combatant. The hawk possesses a flying speed of 60 feet, allowing it to dart swiftly through the air. Its Challenge Rating of 0 indicates that it is not designed to pose a threat to adventurers but can serve purposes such as reconnaissance or distraction. Notably, the hawk has heightened sight, enhancing its perception capabilities, making it an excellent companion for spotting dangers from a distance.

The attributes of the hawk are as follows: Strength is -3, which is very bad, indicating it lacks physical power. Dexterity is +1, considered average, which enables it to have a slight edge in agility. Constitution is -1, reflecting a bad stamina, resulting in vulnerability to attacks. Intelligence is -4, revealing it has very bad cognitive abilities, limiting its capacity for complex thought. Wisdom is +2, categorized as good, allowing it to be perceptive and aware of its surroundings. Charisma is -2, indicating a bad social presence, making it ineffective in establishing rapport or command.

The hawk has a Perception score of 14, which is good, and a Stealth score of 11, also average. This makes it capable of detecting threats and moving silently, useful for evasion and scouting purposes. However, it does not have the capacity to communicate in any languages, limiting its interaction with other creatures.

One of its special abilities is "Heightened Sight," which increases the hawk's Perception to an impressive 19 when using its sight. This makes it exceptional at spotting hidden threats or observing faraway targets, providing valuable information to its allies.

In terms of actions, the hawk can utilize its talons for a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, which is a good modifier for a creature of its size. It has a reach of 5 feet and deals 3 slashing damage (1d4 + 1) on a successful hit, allowing it to potentially harm an opponent if necessary, though it is more likely to rely on its evasion and reconnaissance abilities in combat.

The hawk can also perform a bonus action called "Evasive Flight," which enables it to take the Disengage or Dodge action while flying. This ability allows the hawk to escape from threats or avoid damage, enhancing its survivability in encounters and emphasizing its role as a nimble and elusive creature.
