The Specter is a Medium undead creature often encountered in dark and foreboding locations. It serves as a haunting and dangerous apparition, capable of draining the life force of its victims. The Specter has a unique ability to move through solid objects, which makes it especially elusive and difficult to target. However, it struggles in sunlight, suffering penalties to its attacks and perception. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, but its life-draining capabilities can significantly weaken opponents if not handled carefully.

The Specter has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average, and it has 22 hit points, giving it a decent amount of durability for its challenge level. The creatureâ€™s movement is particularly noteworthy because it cannot walk but can fly at a speed of 50 feet, making it agile in combat. In terms of its attributes, it has the following scores: Strength 2 (very bad), Dexterity 14 (+2 - good), Constitution 10 (+0 - average), Intelligence 10 (+0 - average), Wisdom 10 (+0 - average), and Charisma 14 (+2 - good). 

The Specter possesses several immunities and resistances that enhance its survivability in battle. It is immune to necrotic and poison damage, resistant to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, and also immune to damage dealt by nonmagical weapons. Furthermore, the creature is immune to a wide range of conditions, including charmed, fatigued, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 10, allowing it to navigate through the dark effectively. While it understands the languages it knew in life, it cannot speak, further emphasizing its otherworldly nature.

The Specter's special abilities contribute to its ghostly theme. The Incorporeal trait enables it to move through creatures and objects; however, it incurs 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. If the Specter takes radiant damage, it temporarily loses this trait until the end of its next turn. It also suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which inflicts disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks while in sunlight. As an undead creature, it does not require air, food, or sleep, which adds to its ghostly endurance.

In combat, the Specter can perform several actions. Its primary attack is Life Drain, a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. If it hits, it inflicts 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the target's hit point maximum being reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until it finishes a long rest. If a target's hit point maximum is reduced to 0, it dies, making this ability exceedingly dangerous.

The Specter also has the Hurl action, which allows it to target a Medium or smaller creature or an object weighing no more than 150 pounds within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be hurled up to 30 feet in any direction, taking 3 (1d6) damage for every 10 feet hurled. If the target is an object, it travels in a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, potentially taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage on a failure.

Finally, the Fade ability enables the Specter to become invisible when not in sunlight. It can use the Hide action while invisible, remaining hidden for up to 1 minute or until it uses Life Drain or takes damage. If it takes radiant damage, it cannot use this ability until the end of its next turn, making it vulnerable in specific conditions. Overall, the Specter is a fearsome presence on the battlefield, capable of imposing significant risks to unwary adventurers.
