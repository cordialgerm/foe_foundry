The Water Elemental is a formidable Large elemental creature known for its affinity with water. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it presents a balanced threat in combat, utilizing both melee and ranged attacks effectively. Its notable strengths include strong resistance to most types of physical damage from nonmagical sources, immunity to various debilitating conditions, and the ability to navigate through tight spaces effortlessly. However, it’s somewhat vulnerable to cold damage, which can hinder its mobility. The Water Elemental often serves as a defensive barrier for water bodies or as a protector of aquatic environments, reflecting its innate connection to elemental water.

The Water Elemental has an Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor, providing it with a good level of defense against attacks. With 104 hit points, it can withstand substantial damage before being defeated. Its Speed of 30 feet allows for average mobility on land, but its swimming speed of 90 feet makes it exceptionally capable in aquatic environments.

In terms of physical attributes, the Water Elemental has a Strength score of 18, translating to a +4 modifier, which is very good for dealing damage and grappling. Its Dexterity is 14, providing it with a +2 modifier, which is average and contributes to its Stealth ability. Constitution is also strong at +4, enhancing resilience against damage. However, it has a low Intelligence score of 6 (-2 modifier), indicating poor problem-solving skills; Wisdom and Charisma are average with scores of 10 and 8, respectively, leading to modifiers of +0 and -1.

The creature possesses several special abilities. Its **Elemental Nature** allows it to exist without air, food, drink, or sleep, which means it can remain active indefinitely in most environments. **Elemental Resilience** grants the elemental resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, while making it immune to poison damage and several debilitating conditions like exhaustion and paralysis. If the elemental suffers cold damage, it activates its **Freeze** ability, resulting in a speed reduction of 20 feet until the end of its next turn.

One of its remarkable abilities, **Purify Water**, enables the Water Elemental to cleanse a body of water of poison and disease if it remains in the water for at least one hour. The purification has different durations depending on the flow of water, which can be instrumental for adventurers needing safe drinking water.

In combat, the Water Elemental can use its **Water Form** to occupy a creature's space, allowing it to engage in close-quarters combat without squeezing. With **Water Camouflage**, its Stealth score is enhanced to 17 while submerged in a Medium or larger body of water, making it very difficult to detect.

For actions, the Water Elemental excels with its **Multiattack** ability, allowing it to strike twice using either the **Water Tendril** or **Water Bolt**. The Water Tendril attack has +7 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, delivering an average of 17 bludgeoning damage and grappling targets if they are Large or smaller. It can grapple up to three targets simultaneously. The **Water Bolt** is a ranged attack with +5 to hit, which can hit targets up to 120 feet away, dealing 16 bludgeoning damage, making it effective at range.

Its **Whelm** ability (which can be used after recharging on a 4-6 roll) allows the Water Elemental to engulf a grappled creature, restraining it and causing ongoing bludgeoning damage while preventing it from being directly attacked by the elemental’s Water Tendril.

Additionally, the Water Elemental has a bonus action called **Purify Blood**, usable three times per day, which allows it to cure a willing creature of the poisoned condition and any diseases afflicting them, highlighting its utility beyond just combat.
