The Ettin is a large giant known for its dual-headed nature and formidable presence in combat. With an armor class of 12 and hit points totaling 95, it relies on its natural armor for protection while being able to move swiftly at a speed of 40 feet. The Ettin's challenge rating of 4 signifies it as a mid-level threat, capable of dealing heavy damage with its two weapon attacks each round. The Ettin's physical attributes show strong strength with a +5 modifier, average constitution at +3, and poor dexterity at -1, making it tough but somewhat slower in evasion. Its dual heads give it significant advantages in combat and resistance to various conditions, though it is particularly vulnerable when prone.

The Ettin has several notable attributes and abilities. It possesses darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and has exceptional perception with a score of 14, indicating a good awareness of its surroundings. It can speak Giant and Orc, enabling communication with certain creatures in the game.

Among its special abilities, "Giant Attributes" provides the Ettin with resistance to being stunned, though it becomes vulnerable when prone. The "Multiple Heads" ability allows it to resist being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and unconscious. Its "Obstinate" trait gives it advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws, making it very resilient against mental effects. The "Wakeful" ability ensures that when one head is asleep, the other remains alert, preventing it from taking undue disadvantage during encounters.

In combat, the Ettin can make a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike twice in a single turn: once with its Knobbed Club and once with its Spiked Club. The Knobbed Club attack has a +7 to hit on a melee weapon attack, reaching a target within 5 feet, and deals an average of 18 bludgeoning damage on a hit—this attack can potentially incapacitate the target if they fail a DC 15 Strength saving throw. The Spiked Club, likewise wielded by the other head, also has a +7 to hit, deals 18 piercing damage, and if the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, they become poisoned for 1 minute. This poison inflicts ongoing effects until the target succeeds in a saving throw at the end of each of their turns.

The Ettin also possesses a "Bonus Action" called "That One!" where one of its heads can choose a visible target within 30 feet to gain advantage on the next attack against that target. However, the other head becomes resistant to this command and suffers disadvantage on its next strike against the same target. This duality in its actions makes the Ettin a complex and unpredictable foe on the battlefield.
