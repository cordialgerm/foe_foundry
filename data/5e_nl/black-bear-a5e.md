The Black Bear is a medium-sized beast known for its strong physical presence and formidable combat abilities. It has a challenge rating of 1/2, indicating that it poses a moderate threat to lower-level adventurers. The bear's primary strengths lie in its physical attacks and keen senses. With a speed of 40 feet on land and the ability to climb at 30 feet, it can navigate various terrains effectively. However, its weaknesses include a low armor class of 11 and limited versatility, as it relies primarily on its strength in combat without any ranged attacks or magical abilities.

Regarding actions, the Black Bear has a Multiattack feature that allows it to make two distinct attacks in one turn, one with its bite and one with its claws.
