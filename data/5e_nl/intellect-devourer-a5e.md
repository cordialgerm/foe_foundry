The Intellect Devourer is a Tiny Aberration known for its cunning and insidious nature. Its primary role in encounters is that of a stealthy manipulator and mental assailant, making it a formidable foe despite its small size. With an Armor Class of 14, it provides decent defense, while its 36 hit points offer moderate durability in combat. This creature thrives on exploiting the minds of opponents, and its ability to possess others through its Body Thief ability makes it particularly dangerous. However, despite its strengths, the Intellect Devourer has low physical attributes, most notably a Strength score of only 6, which means its physical attacks are weak. Its challenge rating of 3 suggests it poses a significant threat to parties of low to moderate level.

The attributes of the Intellect Devourer showcase a range of mental acuity and dexterity, with a Strength of 6 translating to a very bad modifier of -2, making it inept in physical confrontations. Yet, it boasts a Dexterity of 16 (+3), which indicates it has a good ability to evade attacks and operate stealthily. Its Constitution of 14 (+2) provides average resilience against physical harm, while an Intelligence of 16 (+3) ensures effective use of its magical and mental abilities. Wisdom and Charisma are both at 14 (+2), reflecting a good capability for insight and deception.

The Intellect Devourer has proficiency in saving throws for Intelligence (+5), Wisdom (+4), and Charisma (+4), indicating it is exceptional in resisting mental attacks or manipulation. In skills, it has a proficiency in deception (+4), insight (+4), and stealth (+5), demonstrating its cleverness and ability to move unnoticed.

When it comes to senses, the creature possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, meaning it can perceive its environment without relying on sight but cannot see beyond that range. Its passive perception score of 12 is average, while it understands Deep Speech and communicates telepathically within 120 feet, allowing it to strategize silently with allies or intimidate foes.

In combat, the Intellect Devourer can use its Claws attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, allowing it to reach a target within 5 feet and deal 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. This attack is average in terms of damage output.

The Ego Whip is a powerful ability that targets a creature within 60 feet with a brain, forcing its target to make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. If the target fails the save, it suffers 14 (4d6) psychic damage and becomes rattled for 1 minute. If the target is already rattled by Ego Whip, it becomes stunned, giving the Intellect Devourer a significant advantage in combat. The target can attempt to break free by repeating the saving throw at the end of its turns, resolving both effects on success.

Perhaps the most sinister ability is the Body Thief. This allows the Intellect Devourer to invade the nose and mouth of an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet, provided they have a brain and an Intelligence of 4 or higher. The Intellect Devourer consumes the target's brain and takes control, retaining its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while using the possessed target's statistics and abilities. It dissolves the possession if the target is reduced to 0 hit points or if specific magic is used against it. Although under control, the Intellect Devourer gains limited knowledge of the target's life and must make a DC 15 Intelligence check to remember specific details.

This combination of psychological manipulation, stealth, and the ability to control other beings makes the Intellect Devourer a unique and deadly adversary in any D&D campaign, where mental battles can prove just as important as physical confrontations.
