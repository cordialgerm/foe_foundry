The Mordant Snare is a formidable and grotesque aberration known for its chaotic evil nature. With a gargantuan size, it poses a significant threat in combat and is an expert in ambush tactics. One of its greatest strengths lies in its substantial hit points, allowing it to absorb considerable damage before being defeated. Its high Armor Class and resistance to physical damage from nonmagical sources further enhance its survivability. The creature's ability to create Mordant Puppets from deceased humanoids adds a strategic layer to its offensive capabilities, allowing it to control additional combatants. However, the Mordant Snare struggles with low Charisma and has average Wisdom, affecting its interactions outside of combat. 

The Mordant Snare has an Armor Class of 18, which is good, indicating that it is relatively difficult to hit in combat. It possesses 248 hit points, calculated as 16d20 plus 80, reflecting an exceptional level of durability, allowing it to endure prolonged fighting. Its movement includes a walking speed of 30 feet and a burrowing speed of 10 feet, facilitating tactical positioning. With a Challenge Rating of 15, it is a potent foe for mid-level adventurers.

In terms of attributes, the Mordant Snare has a Strength score of 23, which equals a +6 modifier, making its physical attacks very good. Its Dexterity is 16 (+3), giving it a decent agility compared to others, while its Constitution is 21 (+5), contributing to its high hit points and resilience. The Intelligence score is 15 (+2), showing above-average cunning, and its Wisdom score is 14 (+2), reflecting an average perception or insight. Notably, its Charisma is merely 6 (-2), resulting in very bad social skills. 

The creature has proficiency in Deception, associated with a +8 modifier, which makes its attempts at deception good. It has immunities to damage from acid and resistance to bludgeoning damage from nonmagical attacks, providing significant protection against many physical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to being prone, enhancing its effectiveness when grappling opponents. With darkvision and tremorsense, it has a keen ability to navigate its surroundings, making it a strategic combatant in both dark and burrowing environments. The Mordant Snare can communicate in Common and Primordial, and it possesses telepathy within a 60-foot range.

Special abilities of the Mordant Snare include Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which is very good. Its unique ability, Mordant Puppets, allows it to convert slain humanoids into puppets that act under its control. This requires an investment of 8 hours but results in a potent ability to manipulate additional combatants, with a limit of twelve puppets at one time.

During combat, the Mordant Snare can execute a Multiattack, where it can choose to perform either one Bite attack and four Tentacle attacks or four Acid Spike attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +11 to hit, and it inflicts 17 piercing damage plus an additional 18 acid damage, making it quite devastating. Each Tentacle attack also has a +11 to hit, has a reach of 20 feet, and deals 15 bludgeoning damage, while grappling smaller creatures. This adds depth to its combat strategy by potentially restraining opponents. Its Acid Spike is a ranged attack with a +8 to hit, dealing 10 piercing damage along with 13 acid damage. Finally, its Hidden Trap ability allows it to conceal itself underground and launch a surprise attack when a creature enters its space, adding to its ambush potential. 

Overall, the Mordant Snare is a complex creature that embodies both strength and cunning, making it a dangerous adversary for any adventuring party.
