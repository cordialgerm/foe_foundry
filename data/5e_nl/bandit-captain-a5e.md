The scimitar deals 6 points of slashing damage when it hits, while the dagger delivers 5 points of piercing damage on a successful strike, emphasizing the Captain's effectiveness in close combat. In addition, the Bandit Captain can use the Parry reaction to enhance its Armor Class against a melee attack, adding +2 to its AC if it can see its attacker, potentially turning a hit into a miss.
