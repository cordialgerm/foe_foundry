The Roper is a large monstrosity that lurks in caves and rocky landscapes, blending in with its environment to ambush prey. With an impressive Armor Class of 20, it is quite resilient, thanks to its natural armor. The Roper has a substantial pool of Hit Points at 111, making it a formidable opponent. It excels at grappling and restraining enemies using its unique Grasping Tendrils, allowing it to control the battlefield effectively. However, it is somewhat hindered by its low Dexterity and a speed of only 15 feet, which can make it less maneuverable compared to other creatures. The Roper's challenge rating is 5, indicating a moderate challenge for parties of adventurers. 

In terms of attributes, the Roper has a Strength score of 20, granting it a good modifier of +7, enabling powerful melee attacks. Its Constitution modifier of +3 is also good, contributing to its survivability. The Roper has a very bad Dexterity score of 9, leading to a -1 modifier, which indicates a poor ability to dodge attacks. Intelligence is very low at -2, making it incapable of complex thought processes; Wisdom at +3 is good, which aids in perception and awareness. Charisma is equally low at -2, indicating a lack of social effectiveness. The Roper possesses darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a solid Perception score of 16, which offers advantages in detecting intruders. Additionally, its Stealth score of 15 indicates a good ability to remain hidden while motionless.

The Roper has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. With Climbing Tendrils, it can move at a climbing speed of 30 feet if it has fewer than four tendrils engaged in grappling, providing flexibility in mobility. Its False Appearance feature allows it to remain motionless and appear as a natural cave formation, leading unsuspecting foes into its attack range. The Grasping Tendrils can successfully grapple multiple characters, each with an Armor Class of 20 and 10 HP, and they can be easily replaced if destroyed. The Roper is resistant to exhaustion and the frightened condition due to its Monstrosity Resilience, and its Spider Climb ability allows the creature to traverse difficult surfaces effortlessly, including ceilings.

In combat, the Roper can perform a Multiattack, executing one Bite attack and three Grasping Tendril attacks. The Bite is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, reaching for up to 5 feet and inflicting an average of 22 piercing damage on a successful hit. Each Grasping Tendril attack also has a +7 to hit, reaching up to 50 feet, causing 6 bludgeoning damage, and grappling the target if they fail to break free with a DC 15 Strength check. While grappled, the victim is restrained and has disadvantage on Strength checks and saves, which effectively limits their actions. If the target is immune to the poisoned condition, they are not affected by the disadvantage.

As a bonus action, the Roper can use the Reel feature, pulling each creature it has grappled up to 25 feet closer, potentially setting them up for further attacks. In reaction to the destruction of a Grasping Tendril, the Snapping Tendril ability allows the Roper to snap back the remains, potentially knocking foes nearby prone on a failed DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

Overall, the Roper is a patient ambusher with tactics centered around controlling opponents with its grappling abilities while maintaining a strong defense, making it a dangerous creature in any encounter.
