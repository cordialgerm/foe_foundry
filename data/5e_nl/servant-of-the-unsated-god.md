The Servant of the Unsated God is a formidable undead creature that embodies the vile hunger and malice of its dark deity. It serves as a challenging adversary with a mix of melee attacks and spellcasting abilities, making it a versatile foe in combat. With a solid Armor Class of 17 and 82 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage before being taken down. Its primary strengths lie in its ability to deal necrotic damage that ignores resistances, as well as its advantageous positioning when using its special abilities. However, it suffers from disadvantages in sunlight, which can limit its effectiveness during the day. This creature is particularly dangerous in darker environments where its abilities can freely unleash terror upon unsuspecting adventurers.

The Servant of the Unsated God has the following attributes:
- Strength: 17 (+3), which is considered good for melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), regarded as average, providing some ability to avoid attacks.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), characterized as good, allowing for a strong pool of hit points and resilience.
- Intelligence: 11 (+0), which is below average, indicating limited cognitive capabilities.
- Wisdom: 16 (+3), evaluated as good, enhancing its spellcasting effectiveness and ability to resist effects.
- Charisma: 12 (+1), seen as average, affecting its interaction capabilities.

Its skills include deception at +3 (good), history at +2 (average), religion at +2 (average), and stealth at +3 (good). The Servant possesses damage immunities to poison and resistance to necrotic damage; this bolsters its survivability, especially against lower-level attacks. It is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, or poisoned. With darkvision up to 60 feet and passive perception of 13, it can effectively navigate and detect threats in low-light conditions. The languages it knows include Common and Darakhul.

The Servant has several notable special abilities:
- Inescapable Hunger allows its necrotic damage to ignore any resistance, making it exceptionally dangerous to those who might usually mitigate such damage.
- Master of Disguise grants it advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks when masquerading as a living creature, although it must sacrifice its stench when utilizing this form.
- The Stench ability requires nearby creatures to succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned, limiting their actions and effectiveness in combat.
- Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based Wisdom (Perception) checks when exposed to sunlight, which can be exploited by clever players.
- Turning Defiance provides advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, significantly enhancing its resilience against clerical spells.
- As a 4th-level spellcaster, it possesses a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 bonus to hit with spell attacks. Its prepared spells include various effective cleric options.

The following spells are available:
- Cantrips: Guidance (provides bonuses to ability checks), Mending (repairs minor damage), Resistance (grants a temporary bonus to a saving throw), Thaumaturgy (creates minor magical effects).
- 1st-level spells: Bane (afflicts targets with disadvantage on attack rolls and saves), Command (forces a creature to follow a one-word command), Inflict Wounds (a melee spell attack dealing necrotic damage), Protection from Evil and Good (grants protection against certain creature types).
- 2nd-level spells: Blindness/Deafness (temporarily blinds or deafens a target), Hold Person (paralyzes a humanoid), Spiritual Weapon (creates a magical weapon that acts independently in combat).

In combat, the Servant can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two separate attacks: one with its bite and one with its Mace of the Devourer. The bite inflicts 6 piercing damage and may cause the target to contract darakhul fever, requiring a Constitution saving throw. The Mace of the Devourer deals 6 bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 9 necrotic damage, reflecting the weapon's magical nature. Additionally, it can fire a Light Crossbow, inflicting 5 piercing damage with a ranged attack. Once it recharges on 5 or 6, it can use Hungering Strike to unleash a shadowy jaw that reaches out within 30 feet, penalizing creatures with a high DC 13 Constitution saving throw for significant necrotic damage.

Overall, the Servant of the Unsated God presents a menacing figure, with its unique mix of combat prowess and magical abilities, making it a noteworthy foe for adventurers facing the forces of darkness.
