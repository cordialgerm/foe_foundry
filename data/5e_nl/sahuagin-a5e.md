The Sahuagin is a medium humanoid creature often found in aquatic environments. They serve as fierce combatants known for their relentless aggression and swimming prowess. With a challenge rating of 1/2, they are relatively easy to defeat for experienced adventurers, but their ability to exploit wounded foes through their Blood Frenzy makes them dangerous in skirmishes. While their armor class is average at 12, their total of 22 hit points provides them sufficient durability in battle. Notably, their limited amphibiousness allows them to thrive both in water and on land, giving them a tactical advantage in diverse environments. They also have the unique ability to communicate telepathically with sharks, which can further enhance their combat capabilities if they are near these creatures.

The Sahuagin has the following attributes: Strength of 12 with a modifier of +1 (average effectiveness), Dexterity of 10 (average effectiveness), Constitution of 12 with a +1 modifier (average effectiveness), Intelligence of 10 (average effectiveness), Wisdom of 12 with a +1 modifier (average effectiveness), and Charisma of 10 (average effectiveness). 

Their skills include a Perception score of +3, indicating good sensory awareness, complemented by darkvision that extends to 120 feet, which allows them to see in dim light and darkness as if it were bright light. Their passive Perception score of 13 shows that they can notice details in their environment effectively.

The special abilities of the Sahuagin are as follows: Blood Frenzy grants them advantage on melee attack rolls against creatures that are bloodied, which means if a foe has taken damage, the Sahuagin becomes more dangerous, increasing the chances of landing successful hits. Their Limited Amphibiousness allows them to breathe both air and water, but they must return to the water every four hours to avoid suffocating. Shark Telepathy enables them to command any shark within 120 feet, creating opportunities for coordinated attacks with these aquatic creatures.

In terms of actions, the Sahuagin can make a Claw attack, which allows them to roll a +3 to hit and deal 5 slashing damage on a successful hit. They can also use a Trident for melee or ranged attacks; the Trident offers the same +3 to hit and inflicts piercing damage of either 4 when thrown or 5 when used in melee with two hands. Additionally, as a bonus action, the Sahuagin can use a Bite attack, which adds +3 to hit and deals 3 piercing damage. 

Overall, the Sahuagin's combination of mobility, combat abilities, and special features makes them useful foes in aquatic settings, able to engage effectively in both melee and ranged combat while also calling on sharks for assistance.
