The Necrotic Tick is a tiny, unaligned beast that poses a unique threat due to its ability to drain life and manipulate its host. Although it has low health and damage potential, its nefarious abilities allow it to linger on a host, causing significant harm over time. The Necrotic Tick's outstanding strength lies in its ability to regenerate the host's health at the cost of necrotic damage, and its capacity to incite aggression toward other living beings makes it a considerable tactical challenge for adventurers. Its main weaknesses are its low armor class and frail constitution, making it vulnerable to attacks if noticed early.

The Necrotic Tick has the following attributes: Strength 2 (mod -4, very bad), Dexterity 14 (mod +2, good), Constitution 12 (mod +1, average), Intelligence 1 (mod -5, very bad), Wisdom 12 (mod +1, average), and Charisma 8 (mod -1, bad). It boasts an Armor Class of 15, which is quite good for a creature of its size, and has 3 hit points, reflecting its vulnerability. The creature can climb and walk at a speed of 10 feet. Its Constitution saving throw modifier is +3, which is good for maintaining its ability to regenerate health. The Necrotic Tick has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 11, allowing it to detect threats in dim light relatively well.

One of the most notable special abilities of the Necrotic Tick is "Necrotic Regeneration." This ability allows it to heal its host by 2 hit points at the start of the host's turn if the host has at least 1 hit point and does not possess regeneration itself. This healing is counted as "necrotic hp"; however, magical healing will reduce these accumulated necrotic hp. If these necrotic hp equal the host's maximum hit points, the host transforms into a zombie. This ability effectively allows the Necrotic Tick to create new minions if not addressed rapidly.

Another special ability, "Ride Host," activates when a host has lost three-quarters of its total hit points due to the effects of the tick's "Blood Drain." At that point, the necrotic tick causes the host to become fixated on attacking other living creatures, forcing it to attempt to grapple a creature within 5 feet unless it succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. This saving throw can be repeated at the end of each turn if the host takes damage from the tick's draining effects, adding another layer of danger for the host.

The Necrotic Tick's main action is "Blood Drain." This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. Upon a successful hit, the tick inflicts 1 piercing damage and attaches itself to the target. While attached, its primary role transitions from dealing damage to draining blood; the host loses 5 hit points at the start of each of the tick's turns due to blood loss. The host must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw; failure means the host will not attempt to remove the tick and will even replace it if dislodged unless that removal is actively prevented for 1 minute. The tick can detach itself using 5 feet of movement if it seeks a new host or if its target dies. Detaching deals 1 necrotic damage to the previous host.

Overall, the Necrotic Tick is a small but deadly foe that can alter the dynamics of an encounter through its regenerative and manipulative capabilities.
