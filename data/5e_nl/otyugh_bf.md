- Constitution: +7 (very good) 
- Intelligence: -2 (bad) 
- Wisdom: +1 (average)

The creature possesses darkvision with a range of 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light. Its passive Perception score is 11, meaning it has an average chance to notice hidden creatures, and it has a Stealth score of 10, indicating a lack of effectiveness in remaining undetected. The Otyugh can communicate in its own language, but it is unable to understand languages spoken by others.

Among its special abilities, the Otyugh exhibits Aberrant Resilience, granting it resistance to being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned. This ability allows it to effectively ignore many debilitating effects from spells and abilities, thus enhancing its survival in combat. Through Limited Telepathy, it can convey simple messages and images to allies within 120 feet, facilitating non-verbal communication during encounters without allowing for direct responses. The Stench ability requires nearby creatures to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn if they are within 10 feet; failure results in poisoning, which can hinder their performance in fights until cured.

In terms of actions:
- The Otyugh can perform a Multiattack, making one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks, or it can replace both Tentacle attacks with a Tentacle Slam.
- For its Bite attack, it uses a +6 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 12 piercing damage (2d8 + 3) and forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against infection from a disease. If infected, the target becomes poisoned and must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours with the risk of losing additional hit points.
- The Tentacle attack also uses a +6 to hit, has a reach of 10 feet, and deals a combination of 15 damage (6 bludgeoning and 9 piercing). If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled, requiring a DC 13 escape check to break free.
- The Tentacle Slam allows the Otyugh to slam grappled creatures against each other or objects. Creatures must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw; failure results in 14 bludgeoning damage (4d6) and being stunned until the end of their next turn, while success results in half damage and no stunning effect.

This combination of defensive and offensive capabilities makes the Otyugh a formidable opponent in the depths of its layers, capable of controlling the battlefield and potentially debilitating multiple foes simultaneously.
