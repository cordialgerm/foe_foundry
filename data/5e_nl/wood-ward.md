The Wood Ward is a medium-sized construct that serves as a magical guardian or protector of natural spaces, constructed from wood and enchantments. It has an armor class of 13, making it reasonably hard to hit, and possesses 19 hit points, allowing it to endure modest amounts of damage before being defeated. With a challenge rating of 1, it is a suitable encounter for lower-level adventurers, offering 200 experience points upon defeat. The Wood Ward has some notable strengths, including its high Constitution which gives it a very good ability to absorb damage, and its damage immunities, which protect it from most forms of attacks. However, it is vulnerable to fire, which is a significant weakness that clever adventurers can exploit. 

The abilities of the Wood Ward are designed to make it a resilient opponent. It has a Strength score of 11 (average), a Dexterity score of 12 (average), and a Constitution score of 18 (+4, very good). Its Intelligence score is low at 3 (-4, very bad), indicating a lack of cognitive function, while Wisdom is average at 12 (+1). It has an exceptionally low Charisma score of 1 (-5, very bad), representing its inability to engage socially or evoke emotions. The Wood Ward is immune to several conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it very hard to incapacitate. Additionally, it is not affected by any spell or effect that would alter its form due to its Immutable Form ability, which emphasizes its stability as a construct. It has Magic Resistance, providing it with an advantage on saving throws against magical effects, which makes it particularly robust against spellcasters.

In combat, the Wood Ward can utilize a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two slam attacks. The slam attack has a +3 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and deals an average of 3 bludgeoning damage per hit. One intriguing action available to the Wood Ward is the Horror Gaze, which can be used once per day. This ability releases an eerie glow in a 30-foot cone, forcing creatures in that area to make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. Those who fail the throw become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can attempt to shake off this fright at the end of each of its turns, making this ability a substantial source of crowd control in combat.

Overall, the Wood Ward is a durable and fear-inducing protector with specific vulnerabilities and immunities that can make for interesting tactical encounters, particularly in settings where fire-based damage can be utilized against it.
