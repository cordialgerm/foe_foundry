The Guardian Naga is a formidable large monstrosity that serves as a mystical protector that dwells in watery locales. Known for its intelligence and capabilities in spellcasting, this creature combines potent defenses and healing abilities with its capacity to manipulate its surroundings and foes alike. It boasts considerable hit points and strong defensive stats, making it a challenging encounter for adventurers. However, it has weaknesses, particularly to radiant damage, and its reliance on magic means it can be vulnerable to anti-magic effects. The Guardian Naga's rejuvenation ability adds to its formidable nature, allowing it to return to life after a short period unless specific magical means are used to prevent this.

The Guardian Naga has a strong physical presence, with a Strength score of 16 (+3), which is good for melee attacks, and a Dexterity score of 18 (+4), providing it with good agility and evasiveness. Its Constitution score of 16 (+3) grants it good resilience, with a total of 136 hit points, calculated as 16d10 plus 48, resulting in very good survivability in combat. The Naga is wise and charismatic, boasting Wisdom and Charisma scores of 18 (+4), allowing it to be a strong spellcaster and capable of influencing creatures in social encounters. Its Intelligence score of 16 (+3) further supports its spellcasting capabilities, with an effective spell save DC of 16 due to its Wisdom.

The Guardian Naga possesses several special abilities that provide unique advantages. It is amphibious, able to breathe both air and water, enhancing its versatility in various environments. Its lair is protected by the Forbiddance ability, which prevents teleportation and planar travel within, and inflicts significant radiant damage on fiends and undead that do not have the naga as an ally. The Rejuvenation ability means it can recover from death over a period of 1d6 days unless dealt with by a wish spell, making it a persistent threat. 

As an 11th level spellcaster, the Guardian Naga has a selection of spells prepared that greatly enhance its combat effectiveness and versatility. Among its cantrips, it knows Mending, which allows it to repair minor damages, and Thaumaturgy, which can create minor magical effects. At 1st level, it can cast Command, forcing targets to move away, and Cure Wounds to heal itself or allies. For 2nd-level spells, it can use Calm Emotions to quiet hostile creatures or Hold Person to paralyze a humanoid enemy temporarily. It has access to 3rd-level spells like Clairvoyance for remote viewing and Create Food and Water for sustenance. Its 4th-level spells include Divination for gaining insight into future events and Freedom of Movement for unobstructed mobility. The 5th-level spells Flame Strike allows it to summon a devastating column of fire and radiant damage, while Geas compels targets to follow commands. Its single 6th-level spell, Forbiddance, reinforces the protection of its lair.

In combat, the Guardian Naga has melee attacks including a vicious bite, with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. This attack deals 11 piercing damage plus a potential 35 poison damage on a failed DC 15 Constitution saving throw. In addition, it can use its Spit Poison ability, a ranged attack with a 20-foot range that deals the same poison damage and requires the same saving throw. When the Guardian Naga opts to use spells like Command or Hold Person, it can significantly disrupt enemy strategies, forcing them into vulnerable positions or incapacitating them entirely. Finally, Flame Strike adds an area of effect attack that can devastate multiple foes within a 10-foot radius.

The Guardian Naga also has a unique bonus action called Shapeshift, which allows it to change form into a Medium humanoid or a hybrid between human and snake, but its core statistics remain unchanged. If the naga is reduced to zero hit points, it always reverts to its true form, showcasing its adaptability in combat and adding layers to its role as a magical guardian.
