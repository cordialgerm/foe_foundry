The Cave Ogre's special ability, **Elite Recovery**, allows it to end one condition or effect on itself at the end of each of its turns while it is bloodied. This ability can be utilized even if the ogre is unconscious or incapacitated, making it a resilient foe that can recover from debilitating effects during battle.

In terms of its actions, the ogre has the **Greatclub** attack, which is a melee weapon strike with a +6 to hit. If successful, it deals an average of 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone, hindering its movement and combat effectiveness.

If a target of this attack is Medium or smaller, it must also make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. Failing the save results in being pushed 10 feet away from the ogre, creating distance and possibly leaving the target vulnerable to further attacks.

It has a reach of 5 feet for melee or a range of 30 feet for ranged, hitting a target for 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.
