Its main weaknesses include lower physical strength and average magical abilities, but its resistance to magic makes it resilient in magical confrontations.

In terms of special abilities, the Deep Gnome Scout has Keen Hearing and Sight, which allows it to utilize its exceptional perception more effectively. In rocky terrain, its Camouflage ability provides it with advantage on stealth checks, making it hard to detect. The Deep Gnome Resistance grants it advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic, making it quite resilient when facing magical threats. Additionally, the scout can utilize Deep Gnome Magic, enabling it to cast spells such as blindness/deafness (only the blindness effect), disguise self, and nondetection once per long rest, enhancing its versatility and ability to conceal itself.

For actions, the scout can make a melee weapon attack with its War Pick, which has a +4 to hit against one target within reach. On a successful hit, it deals 6 piercing damage (1d8 + 2), making it capable of contributing to physical confrontations. The scout can also cast Blindness (2nd-Level; V) targeting a creature within 30 feet. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being blinded for one minute, causing a significant disadvantage in combat. The affected creature has a chance to repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, creating tension and potential for tactical advantage in battles.
