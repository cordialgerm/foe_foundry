The bulette is a large monstrosity known for its formidable presence and ability to ambush unsuspecting prey. With a formidable challenge rating of 5, it boasts a combination of strong physical traits and unique abilities that allow it to excel in both combat and surprise attacks. With a solid armor class of 17 due to its natural armor, and substantial hit points totaling 108, the bulette can withstand a significant amount of damage. It moves at a speed of 40 feet and possesses the unique ability to burrow at the same speed, making it a dangerous foe that can surprise adventurers by emerging from the ground. While it has excellent strength and constitution scores, it has a low intelligence and poor charisma, which impacts its defensive capabilities in social interactions. The bulette's strengths include its resistance to exhaustion and fear, as well as its dangerous attack capabilities, but it has moderate vulnerabilities due to its slow dexterity.

In terms of attributes, the bulette has the following scores: Strength of +7 (exceptional), Dexterity of +0 (average), Constitution of +5 (very good), Intelligence of -4 (very bad), Wisdom of +0 (average), and Charisma of -3 (bad). Its senses include darkvision and tremorsense, each extending 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures in the dark or through vibrations. It has a perception score of 16 (good) and a stealth score of 10 (average), making it reasonably perceptive, although not particularly stealthy. The bulette does not understand or communicate in any languages.

The bulette has special abilities that enhance its survivability and mobility. With "Monstrosity Resilience," it is resistant to both exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it harder to debilitate. Additionally, its "Standing Leap" ability allows it to jump impressive distances—up to 30 feet with a run and up to 15 feet high—giving it extraordinary mobility.

In combat, the bulette utilizes the "Multiattack" action to make two "Bite" attacks, each with a +7 to hit and dealing an average of 20 piercing damage when successful. A notable ability is "Deadly Leap," which has a recharge of 5-6 turns; the bulette can leap onto a target, dealing bludgeoning and thunder damage while potentially knocking enemies prone if they fail a DC 15 Strength saving throw.

Additionally, the bulette can use the bonus action "Seek Prey" to detect a target within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, and on failure, they become frightened until the end of their next turn, giving the bulette advantage on its next attack against that creature. 

Overall, the bulette presents a formidable challenge in combat, relying on both its brute strength and fear-inducing presence to dominate its foes.
