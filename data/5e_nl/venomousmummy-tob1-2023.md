The creature is immune to necrotic and poison damage, which grants it very good protection against those damage types. It possesses resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, further enhancing its survivability. Additionally, it is immune to several conditions, including being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned, making it exceptionally durable against various control effects in combat.

Among its special abilities, the Toxic Smoke ability triggers if the mummy takes fire damage. It creates a poisonous smoke cloud that affects creatures nearby, requiring them to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or incur poison damage and the poisoned condition. This smoke also obscures vision in its area and lasts until the end of the mummy's next turn. The Venom-Soaked Wraps ability causes anyone who touches the mummy or successfully strikes it with a melee attack to suffer poison damage, creating a deterrent for close-range combat. Finally, its Undead Nature ensures that the Venomous Mummy does not require basic needs such as air, food, drink, or sleep, making it a relentless foe.

In terms of actions during combat, the Venomous Mummy can make a Venomous Fist melee attack, which has a +5 to hit. Upon a successful strike, the attack deals 10 bludgeoning damage in addition to 10 poison damage. If the target is hit, they must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to avoid being cursed. This curse inflicts ongoing poison damage and reduces the target's hit point maximum until the curse is removed or the target completes a long rest. If the curse reduces the maximum hit points to zero, the target will die, making this attack particularly dangerous in extended engagements.
