The Young Brass Dragon is a large dragon known for its playful and friendly demeanor, often embodying the characteristics of a trickster. It serves as a formidable opponent in combat, with a good mix of magical abilities and physical attacks. Possessing a notable Challenge Rating of 6, it is well-equipped to take on lower-level adventurers with its high hit points of 119 and an excellent Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor. The dragon has some strengths in Constitution, providing resilience, and in Charisma, which aids in social interactions. However, it lacks in Intelligence compared to other dragons, making it average in its ability to strategize and solve complex problems. 

The Young Brass Dragon has a variety of attributes that define its capabilities in gameplay. Its Strength is +4, which is good for melee attacks, while its Dexterity of +3 offers it average mobility and evasion. With a Constitution of +6, it has exceptional durability, making it hard to defeat in battle. It has +1 Intelligence, which is considered very bad, impacting its ability to perform knowledge-based tasks. It boasts a Wisdom modifier of +3, considered good, which aids in perception checks and will saves, while its Charisma of +5 is exceptional, allowing for effective persuasion and social interaction.

In terms of senses, the dragon possesses darkvision up to 120 feet and keen senses extending to 30 feet, contributing to its great awareness of its surroundings with a Perception score of 16 and a Stealth score of 13. It communicates in Common and Draconic languages. 

The Young Brass Dragon has a special ability called "Suffocating Heat," which activates after it uses its Fire Breath. When Fire Breath is unavailable, the area within 10 feet of the dragon becomes devoid of moisture and air. Any creature requiring air that starts its turn there must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they will begin to suffocate; failing this save for two consecutive rounds causes them to fall unconscious until they take damage or are awakened by another creature.

In combat, the Young Brass Dragon utilizes several actions, including a Multiattack, which consists of making one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it can use Sleep Breath if available in place of the Bite. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 15 piercing damage on a hit. The Claw attack also has a +7 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 11 slashing damage on a successful hit.

The dragon's signature power is its Fire Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. It can exhale a torrent of fire in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide, compelling each creature in that line to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in 35 fire damage, while a successful save halves that damage. The dragon also possesses Sleep Breath, which has a recharge of 6. This ability unleashes sleep gas in a 30-foot cone, requiring creatures within to succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for one minute, with the effect ending if they take damage or are awakened by another creature.

As a bonus action, the Young Brass Dragon can use "Change Shape" to magically transform into a Beast or Humanoid form that has a challenge rating no higher than its own. In this new form, it retains its hit points, ability to speak, proficiencies, and scores in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, while adopting the statistics and capabilities of the new form. It will revert to its true form upon death. This flexibility allows the dragon to engage in combat or interaction in various ways, making it an unpredictable and versatile creature in any encounter.
