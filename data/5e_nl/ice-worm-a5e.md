The Ice Worm is a gargantuan monstrosity, formidable in its environment and terrifying to face in combat. With a high Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of Hit Points at 247, this creature is notoriously resilient. Its Challenge Rating of 15 indicates that it poses a significant threat, capable of dealing considerable damage while absorbing a lot of punishment. The Ice Worm excels in melee combat with powerful attacks, particularly its bite, which can swallow smaller opponents, and its tail stinger, which inflicts debilitating poison damage. Its capabilities include burrowing through earth and rock, making it adept at ambush tactics and navigating environments that hinder movement for other creatures. However, despite its physical power, both its Dexterity and Intelligence are notably low, suggesting that it may struggle with certain dexterity-based tasks or intelligence checks. 

The Ice Worm has the following abilities: 

- **Strength:** 28, which provides a very good modifier of +9, making it exceptionally powerful in physical melee attacks and grappling foes. 
- **Dexterity:** 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, indicating poor agility and reflexes. 
- **Constitution:** 22, yielding a very good +6 modifier, ensuring durability and resilience against many forms of damage. 
- **Intelligence:** 2, resulting in a very bad -4 modifier, making the creature incapable of complex thought or strategies. 
- **Wisdom:** 10 with a +0 modifier, representing average perception. 
- **Charisma:** 4, giving it a very bad -3 modifier, signifying an uncharismatic presence.

In terms of saving throws, the Ice Worm has a +14 bonus on Strength saves, making it exceptionally hard to grapple or shove. It has a +11 on Constitution saves, which assists in resisting adverse effects from spells or effects that require a Constitution save. Its Intelligence save is weak at +1, while its Wisdom save stands at a good +5 due to its average Wisdom, and Charisma saves are very bad at +2.

The Ice Worm possesses the following special abilities:

- **Tunneler:** This allows the Ice Worm to create a 10-foot-diameter tunnel through earth and solid rock, enabling it to quickly change locations or ambush its enemies. 
- **Sense Heat:** This ability enables the Ice Worm to detect warm-blooded creatures and warm objects within 60 feet, making it a dangerous predator that can track down its prey effectively. 

In terms of actions during combat, the Ice Worm can take the following actions:

- **Multiattack:** The Ice Worm can make two different attacks, targeting two separate creatures in one turn. This considerably increases its damage output in a single round.
- **Bite:** With a +14 to hit and reach of 10 feet, the bite attack can deal 25 piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, they must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, suffering from 24 acid damage at the start of each of the Ice Worm’s turns. If it takes 35 or more damage in one turn or if the Ice Worm is slain, it ejects any swallowed creatures, allowing them to escape.
- **Tail Stinger:** This attack also has a +14 to hit and deals 19 piercing damage. On a failed DC 19 Constitution saving throw, the target takes 42 poison damage, which can significantly weaken or incapacitate them if they fail the save, while successful saves still result in half damage. 

Finally, the Ice Worm has a reaction called **Fighting Retreat.** When it is the target of an opportunity attack, it can respond by making an attack with either its bite or its tail stinger, maintaining its offensive capabilities even when trying to escape from threats. This feature enhances its durability in dynamic combat situations, where mobility may be crucial for survival.
