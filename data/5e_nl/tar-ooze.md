The Tar Ooze is a formidable Large ooze creature, categorized as unaligned, capable of both melee and ranged attacks. With an Armor Class of 9 and a substantial pool of 120 hit points, the ooze is quite durable in combat. It operates effectively both on the ground and climbing, moving at a speed of 20 feet. It has a Challenge Rating of 6, indicating it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. The ooze's most notable strengths include its immunities to fire, necrotic, and poison damage, as well as various condition immunities, making it a resilient opponent. However, it also displays weaknesses, particularly in its low Dexterity score and limited offensive capabilities. Its unique abilities, such as causing fire hazards and creating sticky tar, can greatly influence combat dynamics.

The Tar Ooze has the following attributes: 

- Strength: 18 (+4), indicating an exceptional ability to grapple and deal physical damage.
- Dexterity: 8 (-1), which is very bad and limits its effectiveness in dodging attacks.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), which is good and grants it a solid resistance to damage.
- Intelligence: 1 (-5), signaling it has very limited cognitive abilities and is unlikely to solve puzzles or understand complex commands.
- Wisdom: 8 (-1), reflecting a very bad perception and insight, making it predictable in some situations.
- Charisma: 2 (-4), indicating it has negligible social influence or ability to interact in a meaningful way.

In terms of skills, the Tar Ooze is not particularly proficient in any area. Its damage immunities to fire, necrotic, and poison make it a resilient opponent against those types of attacks. It is also immune to being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, poisoned, and prone. Its senses are limited to blindsight out to 60 feet, meaning it cannot see but can perceive its surroundings within that radius. The ooze does not have any spoken languages.

Special abilities of the Tar Ooze include:

- **Fire Hazard:** When the ooze suffers fire damage, it ignites and continues burning until it receives cold damage or is submerged in water. This burning condition causes any creature that touches it or attacks it with a melee weapon while within 5 feet to take 5 fire damage. Additionally, while ablaze, the ooze's weapon attacks gain an extra 5 fire damage. This ability can significantly damage unwary attackers and change the battlefield dynamics.

- **Sticky Situation:** When a creature comes into contact with the ooze, it becomes covered in tar, which halts movement speed by half for 1 minute. If the tar is ignited—whether from contact with fire or by damage dealt by the creature covered in tar—it burns, causing 10 fire damage at the start of each affected creature's turn. Furthermore, any humanoid that dies while under the tar's effects will rise as a tar ghoul in an hour unless their body is destroyed or returned to life. This ability can create long-lasting consequences for adventurers.

In terms of actions, the Tar Ooze can perform the following:

- **Multiattack:** It can make two pseudopod attacks. Hitting both against the same target results in the target being covered in tar, which can activate its Sticky Situation ability.

- **Pseudopod:** This is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit inflicts 7 bludgeoning damage plus 14 necrotic damage, making the Tar Ooze dangerous in close quarters.

- **Hurl Tar:** This is a ranged weapon attack with a +2 to hit, with a range of 60 feet. If successful, it deals 14 necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or become covered in tar, activating the effects of Sticky Situation.

Overall, the Tar Ooze is a tactically challenging adversary due to its control over fire and movement, as well as its potential to create lasting effects on characters unfortunate enough to encounter its tar.
