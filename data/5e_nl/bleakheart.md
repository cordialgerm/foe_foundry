The Bleakheart is a Medium-sized undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It embodies a haunting presence that instills despair in its victims. With a focus on stealth and manipulation, the Bleakheart is uniquely adept at infiltrating locations undetected and weakening its enemies spiritually. While it possesses a decent level of durability with a moderate armor class of 12 and 66 hit points, its major vulnerability lies in its exposure to sunlight, where it becomes significantly less effective. Overall, the Bleakheart is capable of delivering both psychic damage and debilitating effects to enemies, making it a formidable foe in darker settings.

The Bleakheart has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 10 (0 modifier, average)
- Dexterity: 15 (+2 modifier, good)
- Constitution: 12 (+1 modifier, average)
- Intelligence: 10 (0 modifier, average)
- Wisdom: 10 (0 modifier, average)
- Charisma: 16 (+3 modifier, very good)

In terms of skills, the Bleakheart is proficient in persuasion (+5, which is good) and stealth (+6, very good), allowing it to navigate social situations and remain unseen when necessary. It is immune to necrotic and poison damage and has resistance to cold and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, offering an edge in combat. The Bleakheart is also immune to the charmed, exhausted, frightened, and poisoned conditions, making it rather resilient against various forms of mental and physical manipulation. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and understands the Common language.

The Bleakheart possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in darkness and stealth. "Indiscernible in Shadows" allows it to become invisible while in dim light or darkness, making it exceptionally difficult to detect. With "Silent Entry," it can unlock a door held shut by a mundane lock without creating any noise, up to three times a day. However, when exposed to sunlight, it suffers a significant disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, which can severely hinder its performance during the day. 

Innate spellcasting is another noteworthy feature of the Bleakheart. Its spellcasting ability is based on Charisma with a save DC of 13. It can cast "detect thoughts" and "minor illusion" at will, providing it with valuable information and the ability to create deceptive hindrances. Additionally, it can cast "disguise self" three times a day, allowing it to change its appearance, making it even more adept at infiltration or escaping detection.

In combat, the Bleakheart has two main attacks. The first is "Disheartening Touch," which is a melee spell attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 10 (3d6) psychic damage to a single target. The second attack, "Steal Joy," has a recharge time of 5-6 and affects all creatures within 20 feet that are aware of the Bleakheart. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or suffer a reduction in their Charisma score by 1d4. Notably, creatures that have taken psychic damage from "Disheartening Touch" within the last minute will have disadvantage on this saving throw. If a creature's Charisma is reduced to 0, it is compelled to end its life, and after 1d4 hours, it will rise as a new Bleakheart, ensuring the cycle of despair continues.

The Bleakheart thrives in environments where shadows loom and is a true embodiment of dread, making it a unique and challenging adversary for adventurers.
