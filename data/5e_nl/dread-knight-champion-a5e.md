The Dread Knight Champion is a formidable Medium Undead creature, serving as a powerful antagonist in the world of Dungeons & Dragons. With an impressive Armor Class of 18, it boasts a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 346, derived from a 33d8 Hit Dice plus a significant Constitution modifier of +6. This challenge rating of 23, equivalent to 50,000 experience points, indicates that it is highly dangerous and should be approached with caution. Notable for its high strength and charisma, the Dread Knight has a Strength score of 22 (+6) and a Charisma score of 20 (+5), allowing it to be both physically strong in combat and commanding in social situations. Its weaknesses are minimal, as it possesses immunities to cold, fire, necrotic, and poison damage, as well as several conditions like being charmed, frightened, or stunned. The Dread Knight's ability to deal necrotic damage can severely weaken its enemies by reducing their hit point maximums, posing a continual threat. 

The Dread Knight Champion has exceptional modifiers for its saving throws: Dexterity +9, Constitution +12, Intelligence +8, Wisdom +10, and Charisma +11, making it very resilient against a host of effects. Its skills further enhance its capabilities; it has expertise in history (+8), high intimidation (+11), and keen perception (+10). The dread knight's senses include truesight up to 60 feet, allowing it to see normally in darkness and magical darkness, and a passive Perception score of 20, which makes it extremely difficult to surprise. It can communicate in the languages it knew in life, maintaining a connection to its past.

The Dread Knight possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and tactical options. Its Undead Nature means it does not require air, food, or sleep, enabling it to be active continuously. The Unholy Aura grants the Dread Knight and its allies within 30 feet advantage on saving throws against spells and magic effects, while forcing enemies within the same range to have disadvantage on such saving throws, creating a strategic advantage in battles.

Equipped with its signature weapon, the cursed greatsword named Legion, the Dread Knight benefits from a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using this weapon. The sword deals slashing and additional necrotic damage, significantly reducing the maximum hit points of any humanoid it kills, turning them into a zombie by the next dusk. This ability allows the Dread Knight a method to replenish its ranks with every foe it defeats.

In terms of actions, the Dread Knight can employ its Cursed Greatsword to make a melee attack with a +12 to hit. A successful strike inflicts 13 slashing damage plus 14 necrotic damage, causing lasting consequences by permanently reducing the target’s hit point maximum by the necrotic damage dealt. Additionally, once per day, the Dread Knight can unleash a Fire Blast, which shoots a fiery mote within 120 feet, expanding into a 20-foot radius of black fire. Creatures within this area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking a massive 63 fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success, while bypassing fire resistance.

The Dread Knight can also conjure Ice Walls, creating a solid barrier that lasts for one minute or until destroyed. These walls can push creatures aside if they appear in their space, potentially causing cold damage to those caught in the effect. Another potent ability, Soul Wrack, allows the Dread Knight to target a creature within 60 feet, compelling it to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, dealing 70 necrotic damage while potentially knocking it prone.

Moreover, the Dread Knight can summon a Fiendish Steed, such as a fell nightmare or wyvern, which adheres to its commands and can attack on the turn it’s summoned, providing an additional threat on the battlefield. Lastly, as a bonus action, the Dread Knight can strike with its cursed greatsword again or employ Break Magic to dispel any spell effects of 5th-level or lower within 30 feet, showcasing its versatility and strong magical capabilities. This combination of strength, tactical prowess, and commanding abilities makes the Dread Knight Champion a formidable opponent for any adventuring party.
