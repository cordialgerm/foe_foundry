The Pact Drake is a small, lawful neutral dragon renowned for its cunning and magical abilities, functioning primarily as an overseer of pacts and agreements. With a solid defense thanks to its natural armor and a commendable health pool of 45 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of punishment in battle, making it a moderate threat to adventurers at its challenge rating of 1. The drake's key strengths lie in its spellcasting, which includes divination spells that enhance its ability to monitor and influence creatures' decisions. It possesses very good intelligence and charisma, allowing it to both sense deceit and influence outcomes through magic. However, its physical strength is average, which limits its direct combat effectiveness. 

The Pact Drake has a variety of attributes that contribute to its overall effectiveness:

- Strength: 9, with a modifier of -1, making it very bad for physical attacks and heavy lifting.
- Dexterity: 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is regarded as average and allows for decent reflexes.
- Constitution: 17, providing a +3 modifier, considered good, contributing to its hit points and health.
- Intelligence: 17, also giving it a +3 modifier, rated as good, facilitating its spellcasting and skill checks.
- Wisdom: 18, providing a +4 modifier, which is very good, enhancing its perception and insight abilities.
- Charisma: 20, with a +5 modifier deemed exceptional, bolstering its spellcasting potency and social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Pact Drake has advantages: a +4 in Dexterity saves (which is good) and +6 in Wisdom saves (which is very good). It excels in several skills, with insight at +8 (very good), investigation at +5 (good), and perception at +6 (very good). The drake benefits from damage immunities against psychic and radiant damage, and it has resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, making it moderately durable. It is immune to being charmed and frightened, increasing its reliability in stressful situations.

The Pact Drake boasts advanced sensory capabilities. It possesses darkvision and truesight with a range of 60 feet each, and its passive perception is notably high at 16, granting it exceptional awareness in its surroundings. The drake can understand and communicate in all languages, making it highly versatile in interactions with various creatures.

One of the notable special abilities of the Pact Drake is "Binding Witness." Creatures that enter into any form of pact in the drake's presence are subject to its magical influence, suffering from disadvantages on saving throws against the drake's scrying. Moreover, these creatures become targets for the drake's "Punish Transgressor" ability should they break their agreements. Another ability, "Sense Falsehood," allows the drake to detect lies instantly, enhancing its role as a mediator or enforcer of agreements.

As an innate spellcaster, the Pact Drake has a spellcasting capability that relies on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 15. The spells it can cast include:

- Detect Magic: This spell allows the drake to sense the presence of magic within a certain area, facilitating its role in identifying magical influences during negotiations or conflicts.
- Arcane Eye: This spell enables the drake to create an invisible floating eye that it can move around, giving it scouting and reconnaissance capabilities.
- Clairvoyance: The drake can use this spell to gain vision or hearing in a distant place, helping to monitor situations or eavesdrop on conversations far from its location.
- Scrying (three times a day): This powerful spell allows the drake to observe a creature at a distance, which can be used strategically to control or influence other beings.

The Pact Drake has several actions it can take during combat. It can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make both a claw and a bite attack in one turn. The claw attack has a +4 to hit and deals 7 slashing damage on a hit, while the bite attack also has a +4 to hit, dealing 4 piercing damage. 

The "Enforced Diplomacy" action, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6 on a six-sided die, allows the Pact Drake to exhale a calming haze in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become charmed for one minute, during which they cannot attack up to five creatures chosen by the drake. This ability can significantly alter the dynamics of a combat encounter by rendering several foes temporarily non-threatening.

Lastly, the "Punish Transgressor" action targets creatures that have violated the terms of a pact witnessed by the drake. The targeted creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become blinded, deafened, and stunned for up to 1d6 minutes, severely limiting their combat effectiveness. The effects can only be ended by dispel magic or similar magic, and when the effects conclude, the affected creature suffers disadvantages on future saving throws until it takes a long rest. This ability reinforces the drake's role as an arbiter of oaths and agreements, creating high stakes for any interactions with it.
