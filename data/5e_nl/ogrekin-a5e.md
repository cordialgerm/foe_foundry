The Ogrekin has two primary actions it can take during combat. 

The first action is a Battleaxe attack, where it makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit against a target within 5 feet. On a successful hit, the attack deals 12 slashing damage, which comes from rolling 2d8 and adding 3. This damage output is notable and can quickly incapacitate weaker opponents.

The second action is a Handaxe attack that can either be a melee attack or a ranged attack. The Ogrekin also uses a +5 to hit, and it can strike at a target within 5 feet or at a range of 20 feet for short-range or 60 feet for long-range. When it successfully hits with the handaxe, the target takes 10 slashing damage, calculated by rolling 2d6 and adding 3. This versatility enables the Ogrekin to adapt to various combat situations, making it a well-rounded combatant in melee range while still having the option to engage at a distance.
