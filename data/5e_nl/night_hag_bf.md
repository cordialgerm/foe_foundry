The Night Hag is a Medium fiend that embodies the essence of nightmare and despair, making it a formidable foe in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons. With a challenge rating of 5, the Night Hag is recognized for its magical abilities and psychological warfare. Its strengths lie in its solid defenses, notable speed, and ability to incapacitate foes with sorrow, while its weakness is its reliance on relatively low hit points compared to other creatures of its challenge rating. In combat, the Night Hag uses a combination of physical attacks and spellcasting, along with its unique ability to enter the Ethereal Plane, which allows for tactical retreats and ambushes.

The Night Hag has an Armor Class of 17, providing it with good protection due to its natural armor. It possesses 104 hit points, indicating moderate resilience. With a speed of 30 feet, it can maneuver efficiently in battle. Its attributes include Strength at +4 (good), Dexterity at +2 (average), Constitution at +3 (good), Intelligence at +3 (good), Wisdom at +2 (average), and Charisma at +6 (exceptional). The Night Hag also has notable sensory capabilities with truesight up to 120 feet, a Perception score of 15 (good), and Stealth at 15 (good). It can communicate in Abyssal, Common, Infernal, and Primordial languages.

One of the special abilities of the Night Hag is Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it very resilient to magic-based attacks. In terms of actions, the Night Hag can perform a Multiattack, which includes using the Cause Sorrow ability, followed by two attacks either using Claw or Arcane Bolt. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, reaching 5 feet and dealing 18 slashing damage on a hit (average), while Arcane Bolt is a ranged spell attack with +6 to hit and a range of 60 feet, dealing 19 force damage on a hit (average). 

The Cause Sorrow ability is particularly insidious, as it forces one creature within 10 feet of the Night Hag to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they become incapacitated and are filled with sorrow for one minute, experiencing distressing visions or memories. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns (if conscious) or at the end of each hour (if unconscious) to shake off the effect. 

In its spellcasting capabilities, the Night Hag can cast spells using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 14. It can cast the spells ray of enfeeblement and silent image at will, while having two daily uses each of detect thoughts, plane shift (self only), and sleep. Ray of enfeeblement weakens a target, reducing their damage output, silent image creates an illusory object or creature that can deceive foes, detect thoughts allows the hag to probe the minds of creatures, plane shift permits her to travel between planes, and sleep can incapacitate multiple creatures if they fail their saving throw.

The Night Hag also possesses a few bonus actions that enhance its versatility in combat. The Change Shape ability enables it to transform into a Medium or smaller Humanoid or revert back to its true Fiend form, with its statistics remaining unchanged aside from size. The Etherealness ability allows it to shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, thus providing a method for escape or repositioning. While on the Ethereal Plane, the Night Hag can use Cause Sorrow against unconscious targets not on its current plane.

Overall, the Night Hag combines magical prowess with psychological manipulation, making her a uniquely dangerous opponent that challenges both the combat and mental resilience of players.
