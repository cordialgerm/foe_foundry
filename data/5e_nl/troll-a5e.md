With a high hit point total of 84 and solid armor class of 15, it can endure significant damage while dishing out powerful attacks of its own. The troll's challenge rating of 5 indicates that it poses a serious threat to mid-level adventurers. Its keen sense of smell enhances its ability to detect foes, giving it an edge in stealthy environments. However, it has notable weaknesses, primarily its vulnerability to fire and acid damage, which can negate its remarkable regeneration ability. Overall, the troll is a versatile and dangerous foe that requires strategic planning to defeat effectively.

Its special abilities greatly enhance its survivability and combat options. The Keen Smell ability grants the troll advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell, allowing it to detect hidden creatures or track enemies effectively. Regeneration is a defining trait, allowing the troll to recover 10 hit points at the start of its turn, making it particularly challenging to defeat unless fire or acid damage is dealt to inhibit this regeneration. The troll's Severed Limbs ability allows it to retain some effectiveness even when injured, enabling it to control and see through its severed extremities, which can still attack. If it loses an arm, it can still make claw attacks with the severed arm, while losing its head allows the severed head to make bite attacks.
