The Ancient Black Dragon is a formidable and fearsome creature, known for its immense size and devastating power. This gargantuan dragon is typically found in dark and swampy environments. With an impressive Armor Class of 21, it is well-protected by its natural armor, making it quite difficult for opponents to hit. The dragon boasts a massive pool of Hit Points at 355, allowing it to withstand a significant amount of damage before defeat. Its Challenge Rating of 20 indicates that it poses a serious threat, suitable for high-level adventurers. The Ancient Black Dragon possesses formidable physical and magical abilities, including the ability to deal both piercing and acid damage with its attacks, as well as potent breath attacks that can devastate multiple foes. However, despite its strengths, it has a few weaknesses, such as being vulnerable to certain types of magic and tactics that can exploit its fearsome presence.

In terms of attributes, the Ancient Black Dragon excels in most physical statistics with a Strength modifier of +9, which is very good for melee attacks, a Dexterity modifier of +8, which is good for agility-based actions, and a Constitution modifier of +13, representing its exceptional resilience. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are also present with modifiers of +3, +9, and +10 respectively, with Wisdom being good for perception checks while Charisma is exceptional, making it potent in any social interactions that involve intimidation or persuasion.

The dragon has various special abilities that enhance its threat level. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water. Its Acidic Vapors ability creates a poisonous aura after it uses its Acid Breath, forcing creatures nearby to make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of their next turn. This adds an ongoing area of effect that punishes foes for getting too close. Moreover, with Legendary Resistance available three times a day, the dragon can automatically succeed on saving throws, mitigating its vulnerability against certain spells or effects.

In combat, the Ancient Black Dragon's Multiattack action allows it to initiate its Frightful Presence, attempting to frighten its foes, and then follow up with a Bite attack, which does 20 piercing damage plus 9 acid damage, and two Claw attacks, each dealing 16 slashing damage. Its Bite and Claw attacks' high hit bonuses of +15 ensure that it is likely to land hits on most opponents. The Tail attack, also at +15 to hit, deals 18 bludgeoning damage, further ensuring that it can effectively deal damage from different positions.

The Fear Aura, or Frightful Presence, can incapacitate adventurers by forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) or be frightened for one minute. This adds significant crowd control to its combat tactics, and frightened creatures may struggle to approach or attack the dragon.

Its Acid Breath, which can be used after a recharge of 5 to 6, unleashes a 90-foot line of acid that requires a Dexterity saving throw (DC 21) or face 67 acid damage, with half damage on a successful save. This area effect can decimate enemy ranks, forcing them to spread out or suffer the consequences.

The dragon can also take legendary actions, allowing it to take actions outside its turn. It can detect creatures and traps within 30 feet automatically, make a Tail attack, or use powerful elemental abilities like Elemental Roar, which can make enemies vulnerable to acid damage, or Wing Attack, which knocks enemies prone within reach and allows for tactical repositioning without provoking opportunity attacks.

Finally, the Ancient Black Dragon's presence can alter its surroundings significantly. After its death, various regional effects may fade, depending on how many days it had established its domain, leaving a lasting impact on the environment.
