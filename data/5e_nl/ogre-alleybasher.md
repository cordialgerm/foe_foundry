The Alleybasher Ogre is a large, chaotic evil giant known for its brute strength and terrifying presence. With a challenge rating of 4, this creature is formidable in combat, possessing a high Strength score of 19, which allows it to deliver powerful attacks. Its Constitution of 16 grants it a significant number of hit points—85 in total—which makes it resilient in battle. However, the Alleybasher has weaknesses; its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores indicate that it is not particularly clever, perceptive, or charming. Additionally, while it has decent speed and is capable of ranged attacks, its reliance on raw power means it might struggle against more agile or tactically minded opponents. 

The Alleybasher’s attributes are as follows:
- Strength: 19, giving it a +4 modifier which is exceptional and enhances its attack and damage rolls.
- Dexterity: 12 with a +1 modifier, classified as average, providing a small boost to initiative and Armor Class.
- Constitution: 16 yields a +3 modifier, rated as good, contributing to its durability with additional hit points.
- Intelligence: 8 results in a -1 modifier, which is bad, limiting its reasoning and problem-solving abilities.
- Wisdom: 7 leads to a -2 modifier, also bad, restricting its perception and insight into situations.
- Charisma: 7, with a -2 modifier, is bad as well, indicating a lack of social skills and charm.

The Alleybasher possesses the following skills and senses:
- It has a perception skill score of -2, indicating a very bad capacity for noticing hidden or subtle details.
- The ogre has darkvision, allowing it to see up to 60 feet in darkness, and its passive perception score is 8. 
- It can communicate in both Common and Giant languages.

The creature’s special abilities include:
- Imposing Figure: This allows the Alleybasher to use its Strength modifier instead of Charisma when making Intimidation checks, making it notably more intimidating in social confrontations.
- I Work for the Boss (3/Day): This special ability enables the Alleybasher to utilize its superior's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier for any saving throw that it must make against effects requiring those stats, provided it is within 30 feet of its superior. This mechanic enhances its resilience and can potentially turn the tide in difficult situations.

When it comes to actions, the Alleybasher can perform:
- Multiattack: It can make two Fist attacks or three Throw Brick attacks in a single turn, maximizing its offensive capabilities. If it successfully hits a medium or smaller creature with both Fist attacks, it can knock them prone, which is advantageous in melee combat.
- Fist: This melee attack has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 14 (2d8+4) bludgeoning damage, making it a strong close-range option.
- Throw Brick: This ranged attack, also with a +6 to hit, allows it to deal 9 (2d4+4) bludgeoning damage at a range of 20 feet normally and up to 60 feet at disadvantage, enabling it to engage foes from a distance.
- Handful of Sandy Rocks (Recharge 6): This ability allows the Alleybasher to scatter a cone of rocks and blinding sand. Creatures in a 15-foot cone take 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and are blinded until the end of their next turn, with a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13) reducing damage and negating blindness. This area attack can significantly impact the battlefield by hindering multiple foes.

Lastly, the Alleybasher has a reaction:
- Intimidating Rebuff: This reaction is triggered when an enemy within 30 feet of the Alleybasher targets it with an attack. The ogre makes a Strength (Intimidation) check and can potentially force the attacker to reroll their attack, using the lower result. This ability can shift the momentum in combat, creating openings for counterattacks or defensive maneuvers.
