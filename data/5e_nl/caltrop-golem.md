The Caltrop Golem is a medium-sized construct that serves as a unique defensive and offensive entity in combat. With its ability to ambush unsuspecting foes, the golem can quickly become a formidable adversary. Its strengths lie in its high Dexterity score, granting it exceptional stealth and a good Armor Class of 16, making it difficult to hit. It also possesses a significant pool of hit points totaling 75, allowing it to endure considerable damage before being defeated. However, the Caltrop Golem's weaknesses include the inability to take actions while scattered and vulnerability to adamantine weapons, which can bypass its damage resistances. Overall, the golem excels at controlling the battlefield by immobilizing opponents while delivering solid melee and ranged attacks.

The Caltrop Golem has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 9, which results in a very bad modifier of -1, making it ineffective in physical strength contests. 
- Dexterity: 18, leading to a very good modifier of +4, enhancing its agility and stealth capabilities. 
- Constitution: 16, providing a good modifier of +3, contributing to its overall resilience. 
- Intelligence: 8, translating to a very bad modifier of -1, indicating a lack of cognitive ability. 
- Wisdom: 12, resulting in an average modifier of +1, giving it decent perception skills. 
- Charisma: 3, which yields a very bad modifier of -4, reflecting an inability to influence or charm others.

Additionally, the Caltrop Golem possesses a variety of special abilities. Its Ambusher ability grants it advantage on attack rolls against surprised creatures during the first round of combat, making it particularly deadly. The False Appearance ability allows it to appear as an ordinary pile of caltrops, aiding in ambush tactics. Immutable Form ensures that it is immune to any form-altering spells or effects, preserving its integrity on the battlefield. With Magic Resistance, the golem has advantage on saving throws against spells, making it resilient to magical attacks. The golem’s weapon attacks are classified as magical, allowing them to bypass damage resistances.

The golem can also reform itself if scattered and has at least 1 hit point. This bonus action allows it to reconstitute in a space containing some of its caltrops, providing strategic flexibility during combat. Upon reforming within 5 feet of a prone opponent, it can make a slam attack against that creature as a part of the same action. The Scatter ability allows it to disperse caltrops in a 15-foot cube, creating an area of control. Opponents moving through this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take piercing damage and suffer a reduction in speed until they regain hit points.

In terms of actions, the Caltrop Golem can make two slam attacks or utilize its Steel Shot ranged attack. The slam attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 13 piercing damage, making it a reliable choice for melee combat. The Steel Shot also has a +7 to hit, dealing 11 piercing damage at range. Another powerful move is Scattershot, which can be used when recharged, allowing the golem to explode and deal significant piercing damage to surrounding foes while potentially knocking them prone, making it a dangerous entity in close quarters.
