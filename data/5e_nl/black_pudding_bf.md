The Black Pudding is a Large ooze creature known for its corrosive and resilient nature, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 7 and 122 hit points, it has average defenses but can absorb a significant amount of damage before being neutralized. The Black Pudding's Challenge Rating of 4 suggests it is a challenging encounter for lower-level adventurers. Among its most notable traits are its ability to dissolve metal and wood, rendering nonmagical weapons and armor ineffective over time. Although its Dexterity modifier is very bad at -3, it compensates with decent strength and constitution, possessing good physical durability and adaptability. Its unique abilities allow it to navigate tight spaces and resist various conditions that typically hinder other creatures.

In terms of attributes, the Black Pudding has the following statistics: Strength at +5, Dexterity at -3, Constitution at +3, Intelligence at -5, Wisdom at -2, and Charisma at -5. The Strength modifier is exceptional, allowing it to deal powerful melee damage, while its Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers are all very bad, indicating it lacks finesse, insight, and social prowess. The Constitution modifier is average, allowing for solid durability against physical attacks but not exceptional resilience against status effects.

The special abilities of the Black Pudding enhance its combat effectiveness significantly:
- Amorphous: This ability allows the Pudding to slip through openings as narrow as 1 inch, granting it exceptional mobility.
- Corrosive Form: Touching or hitting the Pudding with a melee attack results in 4 (1d8) acid damage. Additionally, weapons made of metal or wood that hit it incur a cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls, risking destruction if reduced to -5. This mechanic can severely impact melee fighters.
- Ooze Nature: The Pudding does not require sleep, allowing it to remain active and ready for an encounter.
- Ooze Resilience: It is resistant to the restrained condition and immune to exhaustion as well as various debilitating conditions, rendering it a robust foe.
- Spider Climb: This ability allows the creature to effortlessly navigate surfaces, even upside down, making it unpredictable in its movements.

For actions in combat, the Black Pudding can perform the following:
- Multiattack: The creature can make two attacks with its Pseudopod.
- Pseudopod: This melee attack has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. Upon hitting, it deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and an additional 9 (2d8) acid damage. The acid also degrades nonmagical armor worn by the target, imposing a penalty that can lead to destruction.

The Black Pudding also has several notable abilities related to light and reacting to incoming damage:
- Dampen Light: This bonus action reduces the radius of nearby light sources within 60 feet by half until the start of its next turn, creating tactical advantages in dim environments. However, this ability cannot be used in sunlight, which limits its effectiveness.
- Split: As a reaction to taking lightning or slashing damage, the Pudding will split into two smaller puddings if its hit points are still above 10. This ability allows it to continually multiply, contributing to its threat level in prolonged encounters. Each split pudding has its hit points reduced to half of the original, making it a persistent challenge on the battlefield. 

Overall, the Black Pudding is a dangerous foe that combines acidic attacks with the ability to render weapons and armor useless, making strategic combat necessary for adventurers who encounter it.
