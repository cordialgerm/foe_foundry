The Violet Fungus is a Medium plant creature known for its ability to blend seamlessly into its surroundings, resembling ordinary fungi when motionless. This creature serves as a minor hazard in dungeon environments or areas of decay. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is fairly weak, making it more of a nuisance than a significant threat. Its strengths lie in its resistance to certain conditions like exhaustion and paralyzed status, allowing it to endure longer than expected in combat. However, it possesses low physical attributes, resulting in very bad strength (-4), constitution (+0), intelligence (-5), wisdom (-4), and charisma (-5), meaning it lacks both combat capability and intellectual prowess. It compensates for these weaknesses by utilizing its special abilities effectively.

The Violet Fungus has an Armor Class of 10, which makes it easy to hit, and it has only 14 hit points, indicating that it can be defeated quickly if targeted. Its movement speed is 15 feet, restricting its ability to engage with threats from a distance. The creature has a keen sense of perception within a range of 30 feet and can attempt to hide with a stealth score of 5, but its effectiveness in these regards is limited.

One of the Violet Fungus's notable special abilities is False Appearance, which allows it to remain motionless and appear as regular fungus, making it difficult for adventurers to notice it until they are close. Additionally, with Plant Resilience, it is resistant to exhaustion and the conditions of being paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious, granting it exceptional durability against specific types of threats.

In terms of combat actions, the Violet Fungus can use Rotting Touch, which involves a melee weapon attack roll with a +2 modifier, allowing it to reach up to 10 feet to strike a target. On a hit, it deals 5 necrotic damage, calculated with 2d4 damage dice, making this a modest attack but with a necrotic damage type that might affect certain character types differently.

As a bonus action, the Violet Fungus can utilize Necrotic Spores if it has 8 hit points or fewer. This ability sends out a burst of spores within a 10-foot radius, targeting creatures that are not constructs. Those affected must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 10, suffering 5 necrotic damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful save. This adds an area-of-effect dynamic to its combat style, making it particularly dangerous to groups of adventurers who venture too close.
