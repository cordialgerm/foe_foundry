The Astralsupial is a Medium Beast with unaligned traits, known for its unique blend of capabilities that allow it to occupy a versatile role in combat and exploration. With an armor class of 14, derived from its natural armor, and a robust pool of hit points totaling 82, this creature can withstand a considerable amount of damage, marking it as a decent threat in encounters where it is featured. The Astralsupial is capable of both terrestrial and arboreal movement, with a walking and climbing speed of 30 feet each. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it provides an encounter worth 1,100 experience points for adventurers. It possesses a mix of strengths, particularly in dexterity with a score of 17, giving it a good chance of dodging attacks and performing nimble maneuvers. However, its intelligence is very low, which limits its tactical capabilities in battle, and while it has an average wisdom score for perception, it is unremarkable in physical strength.

In terms of attributes, the Astralsupial exhibits the following scores: Strength at 8 (-1 modifier, very bad), Dexterity at 17 (+3 modifier, good), Constitution at 14 (+2 modifier, average), Intelligence at 4 (-3 modifier, very bad), Wisdom at 12 (+1 modifier, average), and Charisma at 14 (+2 modifier, average). Its saving throws reflect these attributes, with bonuses of +5 for Dexterity and +4 for Charisma, highlighting good evasive capabilities.

The creature has certain special abilities that enhance its performance. Its apposable thumbs grant it advantage on climb-related Strength (Athletics) checks, allowing for exceptional agility in climbing scenarios. Keen Hearing and Smell provide it with advantage when making Wisdom (Perception) checks related to hearing and smell, making it more adept at detecting nearby creatures.

When it comes to actions, the Astralsupial is able to perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two claw attacks and also utilize its unique Astral Pouch ability in a single turn. Its Claws attack has a +5 to hit and deals 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage on a successful strike, making it fairly effective in close-range combat. The Astral Pouch is a particularly interesting ability that allows the creature to pull various objects from an extradimensional space and affect creatures in a designated area based on a d6 roll. Depending on the object chosen, effects can vary significantly. Ball bearings can knock creatures prone, cooking utensils can inflict bludgeoning damage, tangled threads can restrain targets, an astral mirror can inflict psychic damage and blindness, putrid trash can poison, and magical beans can cause fire damage.

As for its bonus actions, the Astralsupial can use Astral Traveler twice per day to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, facilitating tactical repositioning during combat. 

Finally, the creature has a reaction ability known as Playing Dead, which it can activate when its hit points drop to 10 or fewer. It feigns death, attempting to deceive attackers. Opponents have a chance to perceive the ruse through a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The ruse can last for up to 8 hours unless the Astralsupial ends it, and the first attack it makes immediately afterward has advantage, making it a strategic option for surprise attacks.
