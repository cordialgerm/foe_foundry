The Green Dragon Wyrmling is a cunning and agile creature often found in forested or mountainous areas. As a young dragon, it embodies the characteristics of its kind, being proficient in both physical and magical attacks. This medium dragon has a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating it presents a moderate threat to adventurers. The wyrmling possesses a good balance of offensive capabilities, particularly through its poison breath attack, while also demonstrating decent defense with its natural armor. Its amphibious nature allows it to thrive both on land and in water, making it a versatile opponent. However, while its physical attributes grant it advantages in combat, its relatively low hit points can make it vulnerable if targeted effectively.

The Green Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: Strength is +2 (average), Dexterity is +3 (good), Constitution is +3 (good), Intelligence is +4 (very good), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +3 (good). These modifiers influence its combat effectiveness and skill checks, particularly in Dexterity for stealth and Intelligence for spells.

The creature has some notable special abilities. It is amphibious, meaning it can breathe in both air and water without any limitations. It can also execute a Pounce attack; if it moves at least 15 feet directly towards a target and successfully lands a Claw attack, the target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 12. Failure to do so results in the target being knocked prone, allowing the wyrmling to attack the downed foe with an additional Claw attack as a bonus action, which can be tactic used to establish combat dominance.

In terms of actions, the Green Dragon Wyrmling can perform a multiattack, allowing it to strike once with its Bite attack and once with its Claw attack in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +4 to hit and can deal 7 piercing damage, in addition to 3 poison damage on a successful hit. The Claw attack also has a +4 to hit and can inflict 5 slashing damage. 

One of its most formidable abilities is its Poison Breath. This attack recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. The dragon can exhale a poisonous gas in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures within that area to make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 11. A failed save results in a hefty 21 poison damage, while a successful save results in taking half that amount. This ability can disrupt enemy positioning and severely injure unprepared parties.

Overall, the Green Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable youthful dragon that relies on its speed, agility, and poisonous offense to overwhelm its foes, making it a dynamic addition to any encounter in a D&D campaign.
