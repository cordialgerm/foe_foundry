The Giant Goat is a Large beast notable for its physical strength and aggressive behavior. It serves as a lower-tier encounter for adventurers, being particularly effective in charging at foes and causing extra damage. With its ability to frighten enemies with its Terrifying Scream, the Giant Goat can create opportunities for its allies or itself to gain the upper hand in combat. While its defensive capabilities are average with an Armor Class of 11 and modest hit points, its offensive potential is bolstered by its Charge ability and Ram attack, making it a threatening foe for low-level characters.

The Giant Goat has the following attributes: Strength of +3 (good), Dexterity of +0 (average), Constitution of +1 (average), Intelligence of -4 (very bad), Wisdom of +1 (average), and Charisma of -2 (bad). It lacks senses beyond a basic perception score of 11 and has a stealth score of 10, implying it is not particularly sneaky. It does not communicate with language.

The Giant Goat has a special ability called Charge. When the goat moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and hits with a Ram attack on the same turn, the target suffers an additional 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is another creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, making this ability quite effective in disrupting opponents' positions.

For its main action, the Giant Goat performs a Ram attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully hits, it deals 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, demonstrating its strong physical capability.

In terms of reactions, the Giant Goat can emit a Terrifying Scream when it takes damage. This high-pitched scream frightens creatures within a 10-foot radius. Each creature that can hear it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn. A creature affected by this ability cannot be frightened by the same Giant Goat's scream again for the next 24 hours, providing a tactical advantage in managing threats in close proximity.
