The Flutterflesh is a formidable Large Undead creature that embodies the chaotic evil alignment. This monster is notable for its high mobility, being able to walk at a speed of 60 feet and fly at 10 feet, allowing it to maneuver around the battlefield effectively. With an impressive pool of 187 hit points generated from 22d10 plus 66, it is quite resilient. Although it has a good Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, it is vulnerable to radiant damage while immune to necrotic and poison damage. The Flutterflesh presents a significant challenge, rated at a Challenge Rating of 12, making it a dangerous encounter for parties of adventurers.

The creature's attributes show a strong dexterity of 18, which provides it with a very good modifier of +4, thus enhancing its agility in combat and its ability to remain stealthy, as indicated by its skill in Stealth (+8). It has a constitution score of 17, granting it a good modifier of +3 which aids in its resilience against various effects. The Flutterflesh also possesses an average intelligence of 12 (+1), a very good wisdom of 16 (+3) which enhances its perception (+7), and a charisma of 10 (+0), indicating neither strength nor weakness in social interactions. The creature has saving throw bonuses of +4 for Strength and +7 for Wisdom.

In terms of special abilities, the Flutterflesh employs several tactics that significantly enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Merciful Exchange ability allows it to reduce a creature to 1 hit point when it would normally have died from a melee attack, offering a chance for conservation rather than outright killing. Its Necrotic Weapons ability ensures that all its weapon attacks deal an additional 2d8 necrotic damage, making its strikes particularly lethal. The Regeneration ability allows it to regain 10 hit points at the start of its turn, as long as it does not take fire or radiant damage, enabling it to persist through combat longer than most foes. Additionally, it has Turn Resistance, granting advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, which is critical against certain spells. Lastly, it enjoys Undead Nature, allowing it to function without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep.

During combat, the Flutterflesh is capable of making multiple attacks through its Multiattack action, typically using its Bone Spur and Tormenting Gaze attacks. The Bone Spur attack is a melee attack that involves a +8 to hit. When successful, it inflicts 17 piercing damage plus an extra 9 necrotic damage, while simultaneously grappling the target, requiring an escape DC of 16. The Tormenting Gaze is a ranged attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing significant psychic damage of 21 on a successful hit. If both Tormenting Gaze attacks hit the same target, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute, creating a tactical opportunity for the Flutterflesh or its allies.

The Flutterflesh can also unleash Creeping Death, a powerful area effect ability that requires a recharge roll of 5 or 6 to use. This ability emits necromantic energy in a 20-foot radius, requiring each affected creature to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in taking 45 necrotic damage, while successful saves reduce the damage by half. A creature’s current health level influences this saving throw, as those below half health face disadvantage, making this ability terrifyingly effective in group encounters. Overall, the Flutterflesh is a multidimensional antagonist that combines resilience, healing, and debilitating offensive capabilities.
