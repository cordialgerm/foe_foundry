The Cave Sovereign is a formidable Huge Aberration with a chaotic evil alignment, designed to terrify and dominate its surroundings. With an impressive Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor and a staggering total of 253 hit points, it proves to be a tough adversary in combat. Its Challenge Rating of 16 indicates that it should pose a significant threat to well-prepared adventurers. The creature features a range of strengths, such as resistance to various damage types and a unique ability to incapacitate foes with its mesmerizing Deathlights. However, it has weaknesses as well; for instance, its low Dexterity score reflects a below-average agility, making it less effective in dodging attacks. The Cave Sovereign is notable for its telepathic communication, which allows it to manipulate and control its environment without the need to speak.

The Cave Sovereign has the following attributes: 

- Strength: 25 (+7), which is exceptional, facilitating powerful physical attacks. 
- Dexterity: 8 (-1), which is very bad, resulting in poor reflexes and agility. 
- Constitution: 20 (+5), which is very good, providing it with high hit points and resilience. 
- Intelligence: 16 (+3), which is good, allowing for strategic thinking and effectiveness with spells. 
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), which is average, providing basic awareness and insight. 
- Charisma: 20 (+5), which is very good, enhancing its spellcasting and dominating presence.

For Saving Throws, the Cave Sovereign exhibits the following effectiveness: 
- Constitution: +1, which is very bad, considering its high Constitution score.
- Intelligence: +8, which is very good, indicating strong defenses against mental attacks.
- Wisdom: +6, which is good, providing decent resistance against various effects.

The creature also possesses the following skills and immunities:
- Perception: +1, which is very bad, reflecting limited awareness.
- Damage Immunities: It is immune to psychic damage.
- Damage Resistances: It has resistance to poison and radiant damage, and against non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage if not made with adamantine weapons.

- Senses: It has darkvision up to 120 feet and tremorsense up to 60 feet, with a passive Perception of 16.
- Languages: It understands all languages but cannot speak, and it can communicate via telepathy within 120 feet.

The Cave Sovereign's special abilities further enhance its formidable presence:
- Deathlights: This ability causes creatures that can see the Sovereign's glowing antennae and start their turn within 30 feet to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail by 5 or more, they are stunned until the start of their next turn. On a regular failure, their speed is reduced to 0, leaving them incapable of movement due to being transfixed. A creature can attempt to avert its eyes to avoid this effect, which creates tactical opportunities for both the Sovereign and its foes.
- Illumination: The creature's antennae emit dim light in a 5-foot radius, which expands to 20 feet if a creature is incapacitated or stunned. At the start of its turn, it can suppress this light if no creatures are incapacitated or stunned, which can add a layer of strategy to combat scenarios.
- Inscrutable: This ability renders the Sovereign immune to any effort to sense its emotions or read its thoughts, making it difficult for opponents to predict its actions. Insight checks against it are made with disadvantage, adding to its enigma.
- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): It can choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, ensuring it remains resilient against powerful spells or effects.
- Magic Resistance: The Sovereign has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, enhancing its survivability against spellcasters.
- Spider Climb: This ability allows the creature to climb difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without needing to make ability checks, enhancing its maneuverability in various environments.
- Sinuous Form: Given enough space, the Cave Sovereign can squeeze through openings large enough for a Small creature, allowing it to navigate tight spaces effectively.

In combat, the Sovereign can perform the following actions:
- Multiattack: It can make one Bite attack and two Slam attacks, or it can replace one of its Bite attacks with a Tail attack.
- Bite: It performs a melee weapon attack with a +12 to hit, dealing 25 piercing damage plus an additional 11 poison damage.
- Slam: This melee attack also has a +12 to hit, inflicting 23 bludgeoning damage.
- Tail: This melee attack inflicts 26 slashing damage and can grapple a Large or smaller creature with an escape DC of 18, restraining the target until the grapple ends.
- Consume Soul (Recharge 5-6): This potent ability allows the Sovereign to target up to three incapacitated or stunned creatures within 60 feet. Each target must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 55 psychic damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. If a humanoid is slain by this attack, it rises as a zombie under the Sovereign's control within 1d4 rounds unless the body is destroyed or the humanoid is restored to life. The Sovereign can control a maximum of thirty zombies at once.
- Spellcasting (Psionics): The Sovereign can cast spells with a Charisma saving throw DC of 18 without the need for any spell components. It can use the following spells: At will - detect thoughts and mage hand (invisible); three times per day - dimension door and telekinesis; and once a day - hallucinatory terrain.

Additionally, the Cave Sovereign can take legendary actions after other creatures have acted:
- Move: The Sovereign can move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- Telekinetic Reel: It can magically pull an incapacitated or stunned creature toward it by up to 20 feet.
- Cast a Spell (2): It can use its spellcasting ability for an action.
- Tail Attack (2): The Sovereign can make one additional Tail attack.

Overall, the Cave Sovereign is a complex and dangerous adversary whose combination of damage-dealing capabilities, control over its opponents, and diverse spellcasting makes it a notable challenge in any encounter. Adventurers should be wary of its stunning abilities and the potential rise of undead minions if they are not cautious in their approach.
