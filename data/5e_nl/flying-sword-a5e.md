The Flying Sword is a small construct that serves primarily as a magical guardian or combatant in various scenarios. With an armor class of 17, it has decent defenses for its size and a moderate hit point total of 10, making it relatively fragile but capable of taking a few hits. Its primary mode of movement is flying, allowing it to maneuver easily across the battlefield with a flying speed of 30 feet. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/4, indicating that it can be faced by low-level adventurers, providing a manageable threat that can still be dangerous in the right circumstances. Notably, it has considerable resistances and immunities to various forms of damage and conditions, making it a resilient opponent.

The Flying Sword has the following ability scores: Strength of 12, Dexterity of 12, Constitution of 10, Intelligence of 1, Wisdom of 10, and Charisma of 1. The Strength and Dexterity scores give it a good modifier of +1 for physical actions, meaning its effectiveness in melee combat is above average. Its Constitution score ensures that its hit points are stable, but since it's a construct, it cannot be affected by many debilitating conditions like poison or psychic attacks. The Intelligence and Charisma scores, being very low, render it incapable of thinking strategically or interacting socially.

In terms of skills, the Flying Sword does not possess any special skills but benefits from immunities—it is immune to poison and psychic damage, resistant to piercing damage, and immune to conditions like being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. It has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its environment in that radius, though it cannot see beyond. Its passive Perception score is 10, which is average, meaning it can perceive threats that are near to it but is not particularly alert.

The Flying Sword features a couple of special abilities: "Spell-created," which means that its destruction requires a dispel magic with a difficult DC of 19, making it harder to eliminate through magical means. The "False Appearance" ability allows it to remain motionless and appear indistinguishable from a regular sword, providing a strategic advantage by hiding its true nature when not engaged in combat.

For its actions, the Flying Sword can execute a melee attack with its longsword. It rolls a +3 to hit, making it capable of landing hits consistently against foes of low to average defenses. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage on a hit, providing it with the potential to inflict respectable damage for its size. In combat, this means that, while it may not have many hit points, it can pose a threat to unsuspecting or unguarded targets.
