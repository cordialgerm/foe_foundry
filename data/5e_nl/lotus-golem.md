The Lotus Golem is a large construct that possesses both resilience and unique spellcasting abilities, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an Armor Class of 14 and 82 hit points, it is capable of sustaining a fair amount of damage, classified under Challenge Rating 9 which indicates it presents a significant challenge for party members. This creature is agile, boasting a Dexterity score of 19 (+4), allowing it to evade attacks well, while its Strength of 14 (+2) makes it somewhat effective in melee combat. However, its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores limit its interaction and effectiveness with mental and social skills, making it very bad in these areas. Notably, the Lotus Golem has multiple damage immunities and resistances, allowing it to withstand various types of damage, and its special abilities provide it with enhanced capabilities in magical contexts.

The Lotus Golem has a Strength saving throw modifier of +6, which is considered good, and a Dexterity saving throw modifier of +8, which is very good. It is skilled in Athletics with a +6 modifier (good) and has exceptional Perception, reflecting a +9 modifier that allows for keen awareness of its surroundings. This construct is immune to damage types such as cold, fire, poison, and psychic, and it is resistant to nonmagical physical damage, thereby increasing its survivability in battle. Furthermore, the golem is immune to conditions like charm and fright, making it highly effective against typical crowd control spells.

One of the Lotus Golem's standout abilities is its Arcane Pool, which allows it to absorb energy from nearby spellcasting. It typically holds up to 1 charge point but can accumulate a maximum of 4. The controller of the golem can utilize these charge points to cast spells without the need for spell slots, expending a number of charge points equivalent to the spell's level. This makes the golem an invaluable ally for spellcasters. The Immutable Form ability grants the golem immunity to any spell or effect that would alter its form, ensuring its durability in facing shape-shifting foes. Additionally, it possesses Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells, further enhancing its magical resilience. Its weapon attacks are classified as magical, allowing it to bypass certain damage resistances encountered in combat. The Water Walker ability allows the golem to traverse water effortlessly, functioning similarly to the water walk spell, showcasing its versatile mobility.

In combat, the Lotus Golem can execute a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two melee attacks known as Arcane Water. Each Arcane Water attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 15 bludgeoning damage (2d12 + 2) coupled with an additional 7 force damage (2d6). This powerful combination allows it to deliver significant damage in close quarters.

For reactions, the Lotus Golem has the Arcane Absorption ability. When a spell is cast within a 30-foot range, the golem can absorb some of the potency of that spell, decreasing the saving throw DC by 2 if applicable, or imposing disadvantage on attack rolls if itâ€™s an attack spell. In addition to weakening enemy spells, the Lotus Golem regains 20 hit points and obtains one charge point for its Arcane Pool, allowing it to maintain its presence on the battlefield and continue supporting its allies through casting spells.

Overall, the Lotus Golem serves as an effective frontline fighter, capable of dealing damage while simultaneously manipulating magical powers for its allies, creating a unique dynamic in combat scenarios.
