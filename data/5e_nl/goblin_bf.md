The Goblin is a small humanoid creature, known for its cunning nature and agility. Typically found in groups, Goblins are low in strength, but they excel in dexterity, making them agile opponents in combat. With an Armor Class of 15 due to their leather armor and shield, they possess decent defenses for their size. Their low hit points of 12 mean that they can be quickly taken down if caught by surprise. As a Challenge Rating of 1/4 indicates, they are generally not a major threat individually but can become dangerous when working in concert with other Goblins. Their notable special ability, "Gang Up," allows them to coordinate attacks effectively, leveraging their numbers for increased damage against a target.

The Goblin has the following ability scores: Strength -1 (very bad), Dexterity +4 (very good), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence +0 (average), Wisdom -1 (very bad), and Charisma -1 (very bad). Their high Dexterity makes them exceptionally proficient in Stealth, providing a Stealth score of 14 (good), while their Perception is a modest 9 (average). Goblins can see in the dark up to 60 feet thanks to their darkvision, allowing them to navigate effectively in low-light conditions. They can communicate in Common and Goblin languages.

In terms of actions, the Goblin can attack with a scimitar or a shortbow. Their melee attack with a scimitar has a +4 to hit and deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage. Similarly, their shortbow attack also has a +4 to hit, with a range of 80 feet for normal and 320 feet for disadvantage. It inflicts 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage on a successful hit. 

The Goblin's special ability, “Gang Up,” allows them to move stealthily towards a visible target, initiating a coordinated attack. This ability can be used once per day and enables all friendly Goblins within 30 feet to react and join in the assault, moving half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If the initiating Goblin is within 5 feet of the target, the target must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage, while success halves the damage. Each additional Goblin joining the attack increases the damage by 1 for weapons thrown from various angles, though these Goblins cannot use this ability again until they complete a short or long rest.

As a bonus action, the Goblin can take "Nimble Escape," allowing it to use either the Disengage or Hide action to enhance its mobility in combat, enabling Goblins to avoid retaliation effectively.

Overall, the Goblin might seem weak when on its own, but in a group, its speed, stealth, and ability to work together make it a more formidable foe than one might expect.
