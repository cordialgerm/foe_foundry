The Trollkin Fire Shaman is a medium humanoid creature that embodies a unique blend of elemental fire magic and innate regeneration abilities. Positioned as a challenge rating 2 creature, it is relatively formidable for adventurers, possessing 45 hit points derived from rolling 7 eight-sided dice plus a constitution modifier of 14, which offers a good buffer in combat. The creatureâ€™s armor class of 14, achieved through leather armor and its thick skin ability that adds a bonus, makes it reasonably difficult to hit. With capabilities focused on fire spells and magical effects, it excels in ranged combat while still being able to engage in melee. However, its weaknesses are its vulnerability to acid and fire, which temporarily disables its regenerative abilities. 

The Trollkin Fire Shaman has the following attributes: Strength 10, Dexterity 14 with a +2 modifier which is average, Constitution 14 with a +2 modifier that is good, Intelligence 9 with a -1 modifier considered bad, Wisdom 16 with a +3 modifier that is very good, and Charisma 8 with a -1 modifier which is also bad. 

In terms of skills, the shaman has a perception score of +3, making its ability to notice hidden creatures or objects quite effective, resulting in an average capability. It also possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet and passive perception of 15. The languages spoken by this creature include Common and Trollkin.

The shaman features a noteworthy regeneration ability that allows it to regain 3 hit points at the start of its turn. However, this ability is impeded when the creature suffers damage from acid or fire, making it vulnerable if foes can exploit this weakness. The thick skin trait provides a +1 bonus to its armor class, which has already been included in its overall AC value.

In combat, the Trollkin Fire Shaman can perform a multiattack action, using its Mark Foe ability first, followed by either two Hurl Flame attacks or three melee Staff strikes. The Staff operates as a melee weapon attack, which has a +2 to hit and deals either 3 bludgeoning damage for a single-handed use or 4 bludgeoning damage when wielded with two hands. 

The Hurl Flame action allows the shaman to execute a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit at a distance of up to 120 feet, dealing 8 fire damage, making it a powerful option for ranged engagements. 

The Mark Foe ability targets a creature that the shaman can see within a 60-foot radius, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 13. If the target fails, they become wreathed in magical fire for one minute. While affected, they cannot take the Hide action or become invisible, and they suffer an additional 7 fire damage the next time they take damage, after which the effect ends.

Finally, the shaman has a special reaction called Fiery Escape, which can be used twice per day. When it takes damage, every creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against the same DC of 13 or receive 7 fire damage. The shaman then becomes wreathed in flames and has the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, allowing for tactical repositioning in combat.
