The Void Dragon Wyrmling has notable special abilities. "Chill of the Void" allows it to deal cold damage that bypasses resistance, making it particularly formidable against creatures that might typically resist such damage, although immunity still applies. With "Expert Void Traveler," the wyrmling is freed from basic needs, such as air and sleep, and can traverse the Void effortlessly, enabling it to participate in otherworldly encounters and maneuvers. 

In terms of actions available to it, the Void Dragon Wyrmling can make a melee attack with its bite, which has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, this attack deals 8 piercing damage and adds 3 cold damage. The dragon can also utilize powerful breath weapon attacks that recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. 

The "Gravitic Breath" allows the wyrmling to exhale a wave of localized gravity in a 15-foot cube, causing significant bludgeoning damage to creatures that fall within its area. Affected creatures must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in being restrained, while success results in halved speed until they exit the area. This ability creates a strategic advantage by controlling movement on the battlefield. Meanwhile, "Stellar Breath" allows the dragon to unleash a fiery and radiant assault in a 15-foot cone, prompting creatures within that area to make another DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in taking 10 fire damage and 10 radiant damage, while success means taking half of that total.

Lastly, the wyrmling can respond to threats with its reaction "Void Twist," which provides it with a +2 bonus to Armor Class against one attack while it twists reality to create a protective rift. This ability emphasizes its capacity to manipulate space in its favor, reinforcing its role as a cunning and agile combatant.
