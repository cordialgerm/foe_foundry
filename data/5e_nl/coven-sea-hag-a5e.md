The Coven Sea Hag is a Medium fey creature that presents a formidable blend of magical prowess, combat efficacy, and cunning. It holds a Challenge Rating of 4, making it a moderately challenging opponent for adventurers. With a solid Armor Class of 14 and an impressive pool of 75 hit points, the Coven Sea Hag can hold its own in combat. It is noteworthy for its amphibious nature, allowing it to navigate both air and water with ease. The hag's strengths lie in its ability to inflict curses and wield powerful spells that can manipulate the environment and affect the minds of those who oppose it. Though robust in its approach to battle, it is not without weaknesses, as its reliance on spellcasting means it can be disrupted by foes who can silence or incapacitate its magic. 

The physical attributes of the Coven Sea Hag include a Strength of 16, which gives it a good modifier of +3 for melee attacks; a Dexterity of 12 for an average modifier of +1; a Constitution of 16, granting it a good +3 bonus to saving throws; an Intelligence of 12 for an average +1 modifier; a Wisdom of 12 for an average +1 modifier; and a Charisma of 16, resulting in a good +3 modifier. The hag has saving throws of +5 in Constitution and +3 in Wisdom, both of which are relatively effective against various threats.

In terms of skills, the Coven Sea Hag boasts an arcana skill of +3, allowing it to have a good understanding of magical concepts, a deception skill of +5, which is exceptional for tricking or manipulating others, and an insight skill of +3, giving it a good ability to read intentions. Its darkvision extends up to 60 feet, providing the creature with the ability to see in dim conditions as if they were bright light. The hag understands Aquan, Common, and Giant languages, enabling communication with a variety of beings.

Special abilities include Amphibious, allowing the hag to breathe in both air and water, and Curse, which enacts a magical compulsion upon any creature making a bargain with it. This curse lasts for 30 days and results in automatic failure of saving throws against the hag's scrying and geas spells. Additionally, its innate spellcasting, reliant on Charisma with a spell save DC of 13, enables it to cast minor spells at will, such as dancing lights and disguise self, while it can cast more impactful spells like control weather, geas, and scrying once per day without needing material components.

During combat, the Coven Sea Hag can use its claws as a melee weapon attack, which has a +5 to hit and reaches out to 5 feet, dealing an average of 10 slashing damage per hit using a 2d6 + 3 damage roll. The Death Glare ability allows the hag to frighten one creature within 30 feet, either incapacitating them by reducing them to 0 hit points on a failed DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or causing them psychic damage on a success, representing the hag's terrifying presence. Utilizing a Multiattack, the hag can strike twice with its claws in a single turn.

The Lightning Blast is a powerful attack that can be used when recharged, allowing the hag to unleash an 80-foot long, 5-foot wide bolt of lightning. Affected creatures are given a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, with failure resulting in 21 lightning damage or half that amount on a success, emphasizing its dangerous potential for area control and damage dealing.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Coven Sea Hag can invoke Horrific Transformation, scaring nearby creatures within 30 feet who can see her. Affected creatures must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw—those under her curse cannot succeed. Failing this throw frightens them until the end of their next turn, while success grants immunity to the effect for 24 hours, showcasing the hag's tactical use of intimidation in combat.
