The Pyrite Pile is a large elemental creature that resembles a mound of gold nuggets, making it an elusive and deceptive foe. With an armor class of 18, it boasts strong defenses due to its natural armor, and with 136 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage in combat. Its presence on the battlefield is intimidating, particularly with its ability to charm nearby humanoids and xorns, compelling them to draw closer in the hopes of acquiring its precious façade. Despite its impressive physical attributes, its low Intelligence and Wisdom scores suggest that it relies on instinct rather than strategy, leaving it vulnerable to more cunning opponents. The Pyrite Pile fits into mid-level encounters, providing challenges not only through its combat abilities but also its ability to manipulate the actions of adventurers who come too close.

The Pyrite Pile has the following attributes: Strength is at 20 (+5), making it exceptionally strong, allowing it to deal considerable damage in melee combat; Dexterity is at 10 (+0), which is average and indicates that its agility is not notable; Constitution also sits at 20 (+5), giving it an exceptional level of endurance; Intelligence is very low at 5 (-3), showing it has poor reasoning ability; Wisdom at 8 (-1) is also poor, suggesting it may be somewhat oblivious; and Charisma at 19 (+4) is very good, reflecting its allure and capabilities in charming others. It possesses skills in perception with a modifier of -1, which is bad, diminishing its awareness in its surroundings. The creature has resistances to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, making it sturdy against physical strikes from unenhanced weapons. It is immune to conditions such as exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, poisoning, and unconsciousness, rendering it particularly difficult to incapacitate. Its darkvision extends 60 feet and it has tremorsense up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect movement in its vicinity, with a passive Perception score of 9, which is average. The Pyrite Pile understands Dwarvish and Terran languages but cannot speak, limiting its interactions with other creatures.

The Pyrite Pile has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat and encounters. The "False Appearance" ability makes the Pyrite Pile indistinguishable from regular piles of gold when it remains motionless, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting characters. "Gold Fever" compels any humanoid or xorn that can see the pile and starts its turn within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 15. If they fail, they become charmed until the end of their next turn, during which they must use the Dash action to move towards the Pyrite Pile, attempting to get as close as possible, creating opportunities for further attacks. “Metal Sense” enables the Pyrite Pile to sniff out precious metals within 60 feet and detect larger deposits within one mile, giving it a strong connection to its environment and enhancing its intimidation factor.

When it comes to actions, the Pyrite Pile can engage in a multiattack, delivering two Slam attacks. Should both of these attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, that creature becomes grappled, with an escape DC of 16. While grappled, the target suffers 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns, showcasing the Pile's relentless nature in combat. The Slam attack itself is a melee weapon action that hits with a +8 to hit and deals 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage, making it a formidable close-combat attacker. Additionally, it can perform the "Hurl Nugget" ranged weapon attack, which also has a +8 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet, dealing 14 (2d8+5) bludgeoning damage to a single target. Finally, the "Eat Gold" action allows the Pyrite Pile to absorb up to 52 (8d12) gold pieces worth of nonmagical items and coins made of precious metals from a creature it has grappled, restoring hit points equal to half the value of the gold absorbed. This ability destroys the absorbed metal, adding an economic layer to the creature's attacks, as it denies potential loot to adventurers.
