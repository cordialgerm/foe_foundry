The Qiqirn is a small monstrosity known for its stealth and agility on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 14 and 38 hit points, it can endure a moderate amount of damage, making it a cunning opponent for adventurers. It possesses a Challenge Rating of 2, which indicates it can provide a decent challenge for lower-level parties, offering them 450 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the Qiqirn has very high Dexterity with a value of 18 (+4), allowing it to excel in stealth and ranged maneuvers. However, its intelligence is quite low, sitting at 5 (-3), making it relatively easy to outwit. Despite its weaknesses, the Qiqirn can inflict significant damage and is capable of causing fear in its adversaries. 

The Qiqirn has the following ability scores: Strength 15 (+2), Dexterity 18 (+4), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 13 (+1). The modifiers indicate that its Dexterity and Strength are very good, contributing to its effective attack and defense capabilities. The Constitution modifier is good, helping it maintain hit points in a fight. Its Intelligence is very bad, making it weak in mental challenges. Wisdom is average, providing a decent saving throw capability, while Charisma is average, which allows it some effectiveness in related interactions.

In terms of defenses, the Qiqirn has additional saving throw bonuses: +4 to Constitution saves and +3 to Wisdom saves. It is skilled in perception and stealth, with values of +3 and +6 respectively, enhancing its capabilities to remain hidden and notice threats. It also has resistance to necrotic damage, which helps protect it from certain spell effects. The Qiqirn can see 60 feet in darkness due to its darkvision, and it has a passive perception of 13.

The Qiqirn’s special abilities include Keen Smell, which grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, allowing it to detect hidden foes. Another interesting ability, Self-loathing, allows a creature that the Qiqirn can hear to potentially frighten it by saying "qiqirn" and making a Charisma (Intimidation) check. The Qiqirn must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to the check; failure results in being frightened until the end of its next turn, while success means it cannot be frightened by that creature for 24 hours.

For its actions, the Qiqirn has a melee attack option called Bite, which has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it hits, the attack deals 7 piercing damage plus an additional 4 necrotic damage. Furthermore, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, adding an element of control to its offensive capabilities. The Qiqirn can also use an ability called Spirit-infused Yip, which allows it to unleash a necrotic damage spell at a single creature within 30 feet that can hear it. The target must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or take 9 necrotic damage, halved on a success.

The Qiqirn also has a reaction called Horrifying Wail that triggers when it takes damage. If the source of the damage can hear the Qiqirn, it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the Qiqirn's next turn. This ability highlights the Qiqirn’s connection to the spirits that inhabit it, adding a layer of psychological warfare to its combat style. Overall, the Qiqirn is a sneaky and resourceful creature that can surprise opponents with its agility and fear-based abilities.
