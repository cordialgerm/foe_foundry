The Jackalwere Pack Leader is a medium fiend known for its cunning and deceptive capabilities. Functioning as a charismatic and manipulative leader of both jackalweres and other fiends, it employs its skills in deception and stealth to outmaneuver opponents and control encounters. The creature has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for its challenge rating of 2, and it possesses 36 hit points, providing it with decent endurance in combat. With a movement speed of 40 feet, it can navigate the battlefield effectively, and its challenge rating indicates it can provide a moderate challenge for adventurers. While it is resilient to damage from nonmagical or non-silvered weapons, its weaknesses lie in its inability to resist magical attacks and its reliance on allies to enhance its combat effectiveness.

The Jackalwere Pack Leader has the following attributes: Strength of 10, Dexterity of 14 (good), Constitution of 10, Intelligence of 12 (average), Wisdom of 10, and Charisma of 14 (good). Its skills include deception at +4 (very good), perception at +2 (average), and stealth at +4 (very good). 

Notably, the Jackalwere possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in both social and combat situations. It has a Chaotic Evil aura that can intimidate foes. Its Keen Hearing and Smell ability grants it advantage on Perception checks based on hearing and smell, making it very capable of detecting hidden enemies. Utilizing Pack Tactics, it gains advantage on its attack rolls against foes if at least one ally is within 5 feet, significantly increasing its threat level when engaging in group combat. The Truth Aversion ability forces the Jackalwere to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to speak the truth; failure results in the telling of a lie, making it unreliable in conversation.

In terms of actions, the Jackalwere can bite in either its jackal or hybrid form, with a melee weapon attack bonus of +4 to hit, dealing 4 piercing damage on a hit. When in human or hybrid form, it can wield a scimitar, also attacking with a +4 to hit and inflicting 5 slashing damage per hit. The Jackalwere's ability, Sleep Gaze, allows it to charm a creature within 30 feet that fails a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If charmed, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of the Jackalwere's next turn, and failure results in the creature falling unconscious for 10 minutes. This ability can significantly incapacitate enemies, but it won't work on undead or creatures immune to charm.

For combat strategy, the Jackalwere can utilize a Multiattack feature that allows it to make two scimitar attacks or to combine a scimitar attack with Sleep Gaze. As a bonus action, it can Shapeshift into a Medium humanoid, a jackal-human hybrid, or revert to its true form as a Small jackal without changing its statistics. This ability greatly enhances its versatility, as it can adapt to different combat situations or evade threats. The Jackalwere is courageous against mundane weapon users but will retreat if outnumbered by foes that can bypass its resistances. This combination of abilities makes it a formidable opponent, especially when it has allies to back it up.
