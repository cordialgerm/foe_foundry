The Ankheg is a large monstrosity that embodies both the ferocity and resilience of an aggressive subterranean predator. With a challenge rating of 2, it is a formidable opponent for low-level adventurers. Its significant strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks, which deal both slashing and acid damage, as well as its ability to immobilize enemies through grappling. Furthermore, the Ankheg is resilient against exhaustion and fear effects, allowing it to remain a consistent threat in combat. However, its lack of intelligence and charisma makes it less effective in social interactions and strategic planning.

The Ankheg has the following attributes: Strength is +5, which indicates very good physical power, making it a capable melee fighter; Dexterity is +0, indicating average agility; Constitution is +1, representing average durability; Intelligence is -5, signifying very bad cognitive abilities; Wisdom is +1, indicating average perception and insight; and Charisma is -2, signifying bad social influence. 

In terms of senses, the Ankheg possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and tremorsense up to 60 feet, enabling it to sense the location of vibrations in the ground, allowing it to detect creatures even when they are obscured. Its perception score is 11, which is average, and it has a stealth score of 12, also indicating average capability in remaining unnoticed.

The Ankheg's special ability, Monstrosity Resilience, grants it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, enhancing its survivability in combat scenarios.

For its actions, the Ankheg can perform a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 10 slashing damage in addition to 9 acid damage, which can be quite devastating for opponents. Additionally, if it successfully bites a target that is Large or smaller, it can grapple that creature, preventing it from being attacked by the Ankheg until the grapple is resolved. 

Another of its actions is Acid Spray, which it can use if it is not grappling a creature. This ability allows the Ankheg to spit acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. All creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 13. On a failed save, they take 18 acid damage, which is substantial, while a successful save reduces the damage to half.

Lastly, the Ankheg can use a bonus action called Save for Later. This allows it to quickly dig a hole and bury a creature it has grappled, rendering that creature restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. The buried creature can attempt to escape by making a successful Strength check with a DC of 13 during its turn. This ability not only removes an opponent from the battlefield temporarily but also adds a unique strategic element to the Ankheg's combat style.
