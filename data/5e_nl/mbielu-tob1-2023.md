The Mbielu possesses a few special abilities that highlight its resilience in combat. The ability to hold its breath for 30 minutes allows it to survive in aquatic environments, making it adaptable to various terrains. Its Toxic Skin grants a strong deterrent against melee attackers; anyone who comes into contact with it or targets it from close range takes 2 poison damage and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the poisoned condition for one minute, resulting in disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws due to hallucinations, significantly impacting their ability to act rationally in combat.

In terms of actions, the Mbielu can make a melee attack with its tail, which has a +6 to hit with a reach of 10 feet. If successful, it deals an impactful 20 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 2 poison damage. Furthermore, Large or smaller creatures struck must successfully pass a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, impairing their combat effectiveness. 

The Mbielu has a powerful special attack known as Rumbling Bellow, which recharges on rolls of 5 or 6. This action unleashes a deep bellow that resonates through nearby creatures, requiring them to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 18 thunder damage or half as much on a successful one. If a creature is already poisoned by the Mbieluâ€™s Toxic Skin and fails the saving throw, it becomes incapacitated until the end of its next turn, compounding the threat the Mbielu poses within combat.
