The Tyrannosaurus Rex is a massive and fearsome beast that serves as a formidable opponent in combat situations. With an impressive 184 hit points, this creature can absorb significant damage before being taken down. Its challenge rating of 8 indicates it is suitable for high-level encounters where its raw power can be a decisive factor. With a good Armor Class of 13 from natural armor, it provides decent protection against attacks. The T. Rex excels in melee combat, utilizing its powerful Bite and Tail attacks to deal substantial damage. However, its relatively low Dexterity means it is not particularly agile, making it vulnerable to more nimble foes. With its ability to grapple and throw enemies, it poses a serious threat in close quarters.

The Tyrannosaurus Rex has the following ability scores: Strength at +8 (exceptional), Dexterity at +0 (average), Constitution at +4 (good), Intelligence at -4 (very bad), Wisdom at +1 (average), and Charisma at -1 (very bad). Its exceptional Strength allows it to deal devastating blows and overpower opponents. The average Dexterity suggests that while it is not the most agile creature, it can still hold its ground in combat. Its high Constitution ensures it has stamina to endure prolonged fights. However, its poor Intelligence means it cannot comprehend complex instructions and makes it limited in non-combat scenarios. The creatureâ€™s perception score of 14 indicates it can notice things well, while a Stealth score of 10 indicates its average ability to remain undetected.

The T. Rex has a special ability called Hardy, which allows any critical hit against it to be treated as a normal hit. This significantly mitigates the impact of critical strikes, making it more resilient in combat.

In terms of actions, the Tyrannosaurus Rex can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and one Tail attack, but not both against the same target. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 modifier to hit, has a reach of 10 feet, and inflicts 31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage. On a successful hit against a Large or smaller creature, the target is grappled with an escape DC of 16, which restrains them from moving until the grapple is released. The Tail attack also has a +8 to hit, deals 23 (4d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and has the same reach of 10 feet.

Additionally, the T. Rex has a bonus action called Rending Shake. While grappling a creature, it shakes its head violently, causing the grappled creature to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6 (1d12) slashing damage and is thrown up to 20 feet in a random direction, knocking it prone. If the thrown target strikes a solid surface, it takes additional bludgeoning damage based on the distance thrown. If the creature is thrown at another, that second creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the same damage and potential knockdown. This ability adds a layer of chaos to combat, allowing the T. Rex to disrupt enemy formations and deal additional damage.
