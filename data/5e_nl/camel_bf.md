The camel is a large beast characterized by its hardy constitution and swift movement. With an Armor Class of 10 and a modest Hit Point total of 10, it is not particularly difficult to damage, making it relatively weak in combat encounters. However, its speed of 50 feet per round allows it to traverse distances effectively and can be advantageous in escaping threats or navigating challenging terrains. The camel's main strengths lie in its resilience to exhaustion and lower water requirements, making it a reliable mount for desert treks or long journeys. Despite its physical advantages, the camel possesses poor offensive capabilities, reflected in its average to low attack modifiers.

In terms of attributes, the camel has a Strength score of 14, granting it a modifier of +2, which is considered good; this means it can manage a fair amount of melee damage. Its Dexterity score of 10 yields a modifier of +0, marking it as average for dodging attacks. Constitution is also a strong point with a score of 14, translating to a good +2 modifier, enhancing its durability. However, the camel has a very low Intelligence score of 2 (-4 modifier), indicating its basic instincts and limited understanding of complex tasks. Its Wisdom and Charisma scores are weak, with values of 8 (-1) and 4 (-3), respectively, making it poor in perception and interpersonal interactions.

The camel has a few notable special abilities. The first is **Camel Resilience**, which gives the camel resistance to exhaustion and reduces its water consumption needs by half compared to similar-sized beasts. This ability is particularly useful in settings where resources are scarce, like arid environments.

During combat, the camel can take two actions. Its **Bite** attack functions as a melee weapon action with a +4 to hit, allowing it to effectively target another creature within 5 feet. If it connects, it deals 4 bludgeoning damage, which, while not substantial, can contribute to its overall share in combat scenarios. The second action, **Bile Spit**, allows the camel to spit a blob of bile at a distance of up to 60 feet, using a +2 to hit. If it is successful, it inflicts 2 acid damage and forces the target to make a Constitution saving throw against a Difficulty Class of 12. Failure on this save results in the target becoming "smelly" for one hour, giving it disadvantage on any Charisma checks until it is cleaned. This can have implications for social interactions or stealth situations, potentially affecting how the target is perceived by others.

Overall, the camel is not just a simple beast but can be utilized effectively in specific scenarios, especially in environments where speed and endurance are crucial.
