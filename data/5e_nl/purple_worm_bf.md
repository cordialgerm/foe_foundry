The purple worm is a gargantuan monstrosity renowned for its incredible size and strength, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. With an Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, it is quite resilient during combat. It possesses a massive pool of hit points totaling 255, reflecting its durability on the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 15, the purple worm presents a significant threat to adventurers. Its speed of 50 feet grants it mobility in open terrain, while its burrowing speed of 30 feet allows it to navigate underground effectively. Notably, the purple worm's strengths include impressive physical attributes, with a Strength score of +9 that signifies exceptional prowess in melee combat, coupled with a Constitution of +11 which reinforces its hit point pool. However, its Dexterity score of -2 indicates a weakness in agility, making it less effective in situations requiring finesse. The worm's keen senses and tremorsense allow it to detect creatures in its vicinity, enhancing its effectiveness as a predator.

The purple worm has several special abilities. Its Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and fear, making it a persistent and fearless foe. The Tunneler ability enables it to create expansive tunnels in solid rock, which can influence the battlefield by providing advantageous terrain for ambushes or mobility.

In terms of actions, the purple worm can perform multiple attacks in a turn. It can execute a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack and one Tail Stinger attack. The Bite attack has a +14 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 22 piercing damage and forces any Large or smaller creatures to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Failing this throw results in being swallowed by the worm, effectively removing the creature from the combat for a duration while also incurring ongoing acid damage. The Tail Stinger attack also carries a +14 to hit and deals 19 piercing damage, along with a DC 19 Constitution saving throw for additional poison damage on a failed save.

The purple worm can also use its Thrash ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. In this action, the worm convulses violently, affecting all creatures within 20 feet, who must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. Those who fail take high bludgeoning damage and are stunned, while those who succeed take half damage and avoid being stunned.

As a bonus action, the purple worm can utilize its Rapid Digestion ability. This allows it to regain hit points by absorbing the life force of any swallowed creatures. For each creature it has swallowed, the worm regains an additional amount of hit points, thereby increasing its survivability further.

Overall, the purple worm's combination of powerful melee attacks, significant resilience, the ability to control the environment with its burrowing, and the healing potential from its swallowed victims makes it a terrifying foe for any adventuring party.
