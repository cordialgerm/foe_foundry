While their physical strength is average, their dexterity is exceptional, allowing them to evade attacks effectively. The Puffinfolk's primary weaknesses lie in their lower Hit Points and average Charisma, which limits their interactions that rely on charm or intimidation.

With darkvision that extends up to 60 feet, they can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, up to a limit, supporting their stealthy nature.

The Puffinfolk has several unique abilities that enhance their survival and exploration capabilities. The "Blessings of the Sea Gods" ability grants them advantage on saving throws while they are either swimming or flying over ocean waters, making it easier for them to evade dangers in these environments. They are considered a Medium creature for carrying capacity due to their "Hardy Ocean Explorers" trait, allowing them to support themselves better than others of their size; additionally, they can hold their breath for 30 minutes, providing them with significant advantages underwater. "Oceanic Recall" enables them to flawlessly remember any path they have traveled in or above oceanic waters, enhancing their navigation skills.

In terms of actions, the Puffinfolk can use a "Peck" attack as a melee weapon. This attack has a +6 to hit, indicating a very good chance of landing a hit against most opponents. When it successfully strikes, it deals 7 piercing damage (which is calculated as 1d6+4), showcasing its capability to inflict solid damage during combat. 

For reactions, the Puffinfolk benefits from the "Quick and Nimble" ability, which allows them to evade attacks effectively. When a creature that the Puffinfolk can see targets it with a melee or ranged attack, they can swiftly dart out of the way, imposing disadvantage on the attack. This ability significantly increases their survivability in combat, allowing them to avoid being hit more reliably.
