The Light Eater is a small aberration that thrives on consuming light, making it a unique and formidable creature in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it poses a moderate threat to low-level adventurers. A blend of stealth and cunning, the Light Eater can camouflage itself as ordinary rock while motionless, effectively ambushing unsuspecting foes. It boasts a solid Armor Class of 14 thanks to its natural armor and can absorb light to weaken its opponents, while also being immune to fire and radiant damage. However, its low Strength and Intelligence scores leave it vulnerable in physical confrontations and limit its strategic options. Its special abilities allow it to sense light, manipulate it, and emit blinding flashes when threatened.

The Light Eater has the following attributes: Strength of 8, which is a very bad modifier (-1), Dexterity of 14 with a good modifier (+2), Constitution of 16 giving it an exceptional modifier (+3), Intelligence of 4 resulting in a very bad modifier (-3), Wisdom of 17 providing a very good modifier (+3), and Charisma of 8, which is a very bad modifier (-1). It has a total of 26 hit points, determined by rolling 4d6 and adding 12, which makes it relatively resilient for its size. It has a walking speed of 10 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet, enabling it to navigate the battlefield effectively.

The Light Eater has a passive Perception of 15, which indicates a good level of awareness, allowing it to detect creatures nearby. It possesses the following special abilities:
- **False Appearance:** While motionless, the Light Eater appears indistinguishable from a normal rock, allowing it to blend into its surroundings flawlessly.
- **Light Absorption:** This ability allows it to diminish any source of light within a 5-foot range at the start of its turn. As it remains within 100 feet of a light source, bright light turns into dim light, and dim light transforms into darkness. If the Light Eater manages to absorb light completely, it sheds its own multicolored bright light in a 20-foot radius and an additional dim light for another 20 feet for one hour. Moreover, it extinguishes any nonmagical flames and dispels lower-level magical light (2nd level or lower).
- **Light Sense:** This ability enables it to pinpoint the location of any light source within a 100-foot range and sense the general direction of any sources within a mile.

In combat, the Light Eater can use its primary action to make a **Tentacle** attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit against a target within 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. 

In terms of defensive reactions, the Light Eater can unleash an **Emergency Flare**, which recharges after a short or long rest. When it takes damage, it can emit a brilliant flash of light affecting each creature within 30 feet, blinding them for one minute unless they succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Blinded creatures can attempt to save again at the end of each of their turns to end the effect.

Overall, the Light Eater is a crafty foe that uses its abilities to control the battlefield and create opportunities for escape or ambush. It serves as a unique challenge for parties that rely heavily on light-based spells and abilities, adding an interesting dynamic to encounters.
