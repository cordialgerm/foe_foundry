The Fragrite is a medium-sized elemental creature with a chaotic neutral alignment, embodying the essence of sand and glass. As a challenge rating 6 monster, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, boasting a solid hit point pool of 91, along with good armor class and innate resistances. It excels in its unique ability to shift between forms—sand and glass—allowing it to evade attacks and effectively control the battlefield. However, it is notably weak to thunder damage while in glass form. With a blend of melee attacks and explosive abilities, the Fragrite is versatile in combat, posing challenges that require strategic thinking to overcome.

The Fragrite possesses the following ability scores: Strength at 16 (+3), Dexterity at 13 (+1), Constitution at 15 (+2), Intelligence at 6 (-2), Wisdom at 8 (-1), and Charisma at 8 (-1). The Strength and Constitution scores indicate it is physically strong and fairly resilient, while its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores suggest an average to poor ability to engage in mental or social challenges.

The creature has some important resistances and immunities. It is immune to poison damage, and it resists fire and lightning damage. Additionally, it is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. The Fragrite has a number of condition immunities, including exhaustion, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and has a passive Perception of 9, which indicates a very bad ability to notice hidden or sneaky creatures. The Fragrite communicates in the Terran language.

The Fragrite has several special abilities: 

1. **Sand Camouflage (Sand Form Only):** This ability grants the Fragrite advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in sandy terrain, making it relatively good at using its environment to remain undetected.

2. **Sand Glide (Sand Form Only):** The Fragrite can burrow through sand without causing disturbances, allowing it to navigate beneath the surface easily.

3. **Shapechanger:** As a bonus action, the Fragrite can transform into either a mass of sand or a glass humanoid. The statistics remain unchanged, and any gear it possesses stays with it. In sand form, it gains a burrow speed of 50 feet, can move through very narrow spaces without penalty, and is immune to being grappled. However, in glass form, it becomes vulnerable to thunder damage.

In terms of actions, the Fragrite can perform the following:

1. **Multiattack:** It can make two strike attacks in one turn, enhancing its offensive capabilities.

2. **Strike:** This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit, reaches a distance of 5 feet, and deals 12 damage (2d8 + 3) in bludgeoning damage. If it is in glass form and has fewer than half of its total hit points left, this attack deals 16 damage (3d8 + 3) instead, now categorized as slashing damage, making the attack considerably more dangerous when wounded.

3. **Spontaneous Explosion (Glass Form Only; Recharge 5-6):** This ability allows the Fragrite to explode into shards of glass, inflicting 27 slashing damage (6d8) on creatures nearby unless they succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, which reduces the damage to half. The explosion costs the Fragrite 5 hit points and forces its transformation back into sand form, effectively allowing it to damage enemies while changing its tactic in battle.

Overall, the Fragrite is a formidable opponent, harnessing its unique elemental forms to evade damage and launch potent attacks, making it a unique encounter in any campaign.
