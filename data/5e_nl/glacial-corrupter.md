The Glacial Corrupter is a formidable undead creature characterized by its medium size and lawful evil alignment. This monster possesses a unique blend of offensive capabilities and resilience, making it a noteworthy opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 34, it can endure a fair amount of damage while dealing consistent harm through its melee and ranged attacks. The Glacial Corrupter is imbued with chilling cold powers that inflict ongoing damage and can potentially transform victims into undying versions of itself, adding a level of threat to encounters. However, it has significant weaknesses stemming from its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, rendering it less effective in mental contests and social interactions.

The Glacial Corrupter's attributes showcase its physical prowess and durability. It has a Strength score of 14 (+2), which is considered good, allowing it to hit hard in combat. Its Dexterity score of 13 (+1) is average, providing a slight bump in initiative but not significantly impacting its defense. The Constitution score of 18 (+4) is exceptionally high, granting it an abundance of Hit Points and resilience against effects that may harm its vitality. Conversely, its Intelligence score of 6 (-2) is very bad, indicating a lack of mental acuity, while its Wisdom score of 8 (-1) implies below-average perceptiveness. Its Charisma score of 5 (-3) is very bad, suggesting it would be ineffective in any social or charismatic encounters.

In terms of skills, the Glacial Corrupter does not have any specific bonuses but benefits from damage immunities, being immune to cold and poison damage. It is also immune to exhaustion, poisoned, and petrified conditions, allowing it to maintain its combat effectiveness under various circumstances. With darkvision extending to 60 feet, it can navigate in darkness effectively, although its passive Perception score of 9 is quite low.

The creature has the ability to understand all languages it knew in life, although it cannot speak. This aspect may provide some insight into its background should characters attempt to communicate with it through means other than speech.

The Glacial Corrupter has several actions it can utilize in combat. Its longsword attack is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, allowing it to reach enemies within 5 feet, causing 6 slashing damage, or 7 slashing damage if wielding the sword with two hands. It also has a longbow attack, functioning as a ranged weapon attack with the same +4 to hit, effective at a range of 150 feet and 600 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage upon a successful hit.

One of its most fearsome abilities is Glacial Touch, which can be used once per round after a recharge on rolls of 5 or 6. This melee weapon attack also has a +4 to hit and inflicts 9 cold damage. Significantly, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 13. Failure results in an additional 2 cold damage at the start of each of its turns until the shard lodged in the wound is removed, which requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If the target receives magical healing, the shard crumbles to snow. Any humanoid that falls to this attack will rise again in one week as a Glacial Corrupter unless its body is destroyed or it is restored to life, creating a persistent threat for adventurers who do not act quickly in combat.
