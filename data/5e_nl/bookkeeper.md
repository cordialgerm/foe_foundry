The Bookkeeper is a diminutive construct that plays a unique role in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. Its primary purpose revolves around guarding and maintaining a specific book, making it a protector of knowledge and information. It boasts a flying speed and is exceptionally stealthy, which allows it to navigate through its environment with ease. However, despite its advantages, the Bookkeeper is quite fragile, having low hit points, which makes it susceptible to damage if not properly protected by its creator. Additionally, while it cannot speak, it possesses a surprising level of skill in perception and stealth. The Bookkeeper's abilities center around its connection to the book it safeguards, enhancing its combat effectiveness while near it.

The Bookkeeper has an Armor Class of 12, which offers it average protection. It possesses 5 hit points, determined by rolling 2d4, making it very fragile in combat situations. The creature has a fly speed of 30 feet and a walk speed of 20 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, it provides 25 experience points to those who defeat it.

Its ability scores are as follows: Strength 8 (-1), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 10 (+0), Intelligence 6 (-2), Wisdom 8 (-1), and Charisma 3 (-4). The Dexterity score is good, allowing it to excel in stealth and evasion, while the low Strength and Intelligence scores indicate significant weaknesses.

The Bookkeeper is skilled in perception, granting it a +1 modifier, which is average, and stealth, providing a +4 modifier, which is very good. It has damage immunities to cold or fire (depending on its creation), poison, and psychic damage, making it resilient against various forms of attacks. Its damage resistances include bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as charm, exhaustion, fright, paralysis, petrification, and poison, allowing it to maintain its operational effectiveness.

In terms of special abilities, the Bookkeeper can utilize 'Between the Lines' as a bonus action when within 30 feet of its book. This allows it to hop inside the book and gain a flying speed of 30 feet while blending in with the ink, making it undetectable. The 'Book Bound' ability allows it to make all attacks, saving throws, and skill checks with advantage when its creator is nearby. However, if it strays more than 60 feet from its book for a minute, its hit point maximum decreases by 1, potentially leading to its demise.

The Bookkeeper's death triggers the 'Disintegrate' ability, which ensures that the book it is bound to is also destroyed. At its disposal are two actions: 'Ink Splash' and 'Bite.' The 'Ink Splash' is a ranged weapon attack with a +4 modifier to hit, with a range of 20 feet that deals 3 poison damage on a hit. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or suffer blindness until the end of their next turn. The 'Bite' action is a melee weapon attack with a +4 modifier to hit that has a 5-foot reach and inflicts 1 piercing damage plus 1 poison damage.

Finally, the ability 'Elusive Pages' allows the Bookkeeper, while inside its book, to magically render both itself and the book invisible until it attacks or until it ends its concentration, making it very difficult for enemies to target it while it remains hidden and undetected.
