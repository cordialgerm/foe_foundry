The Fallen Solar excels at both melee combat and spellcasting, leveraging its high Strength and Charisma scores to enhance its physical attacks and magical abilities. Notably, it can soar through the skies at a flying speed of 150 feet and possesses remarkable resilience against various damage types. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage, which can be exploited by cunning foes.

It is skilled in athletics (+16, exceptional), history (+16, exceptional), insight (+17, exceptional), perception (+17, exceptional), and religion (+17, exceptional). 

The Fallen Solar's damage vulnerabilities include radiant, while it is immune to necrotic and poison damage. It resists radiant damage and damage dealt by nonmagical weapons. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, or poisoned. With truesight extending out to 120 feet and a passive perception score of 27, the Fallen Solar is adept at detecting its surroundings and potential threats. It can communicate in all languages and utilizes telepathy within a 120-foot range.

Among its special abilities, the Fallen Solar possesses the "Champion of Truth" trait, enabling it to automatically detect lies and rendering it incapable of lying itself. This ability can greatly influence interactions with other characters and enforce a strong sense of integrity in its actions. Furthermore, the Fallen Solar has innate spellcasting, with a spellcasting ability based on Charisma. It can cast powerful spells, including commune, control weather, and resurrection once per day each, with a high spell save DC of 25, which makes resisting its spells challenging for foes.

In terms of actions, the Fallen Solar can utilize a "Multiattack" option, allowing it to strike twice with its holy sword. The holy sword attack is a melee weapon attack with a +16 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 23 slashing damage as well as an additional 21 radiant damage, making it a powerful option in close combat. Another potent ability is "Column of Flame," in which flames erupt in a cylinder, dealing 21 fire damage and 21 radiant damage to creatures within a 10-foot radius, contingent on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. 

The "Consume Life Energy" ability allows the Fallen Solar to absorb life energy from a humanoid it has slain within the last hour, granting it temporary hit points based on half the dead creature's maximum hit points. This ability emphasizes the creature's role as a life-draining force on the battlefield, while also imposing a restriction that only a 9th-level spell can resurrect the fallen.

For defensive capabilities, the Fallen Solar can invoke "Forceful Parry" as a reaction when bloodied. If an enemy misses their melee attack against it, the Fallen Solar retaliates, dealing 21 lightning damage and pushing the attacker 10 feet away, causing them to fall prone on a failed DC 24 Constitution saving throw.

The Fallen Solar also possesses legendary actions, allowing it to perform powerful abilities outside its regular turn. It can teleport up to 120 feet to a visible space, providing exceptional mobility. It can also heal others for 60 hit points, removing various status ailments with the "Heal" action, usable three times per day. The "Deafening Command" action, which costs two legendary actions, lets it issue an echoing command that may force creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 24 Charisma saving throw or suffer 21 thunder damage and potentially perform a specified reaction such as falling prone, using their reaction to approach the solar, fleeing, or surrendering by dropping their held items. 

Overall, the Fallen Solar is a powerful and complex entity capable of both dealing significant damage and providing healing effects, making it a strategically valuable creature in any encounter.
