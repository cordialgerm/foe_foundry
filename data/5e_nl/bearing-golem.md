The Bearing Golem is a Medium construct that operates independently and does not have alignment. It possesses an Armor Class of 16, which is classified as natural armor, and has a total of 75 hit points, calculated by rolling ten eight-sided dice and adding thirty. With a walking speed of 30 feet, it is agile in combat settings. The challenge rating for this creature is 6, indicating that it provides a moderate challenge, awarding 2,300 experience points upon defeat. 

In terms of attributes, the Bearing Golem has a Strength of 9, which is rated as bad, a Dexterity of 18, rated as exceptional, a Constitution of 16, rated as good, an Intelligence of 8, rated as bad, a Wisdom of 12, rated as average, and a Charisma of 3, rated as very bad. The golem excels in Dexterity, granting it a +4 modifier, which makes it highly effective at tasks that require agility and stealth.

The Bearing Golem has a variety of skills, notably with a +3 modifier to Perception and a +7 modifier to Stealth, reflecting its ability to hide and observe effectively. It is immune to poison and psychic damage, and it also resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks unless made with adamantine weapons. Additionally, it is immune to a range of conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, or paralyzed, making it a very resilient opponent. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and tremorsense up to 30 feet, with a passive Perception score of 13. While it understands the languages of its creator, it cannot speak.

The Bearing Golem has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. As an ambusher, it gains advantage on attack rolls against surprised creatures in the first round of combat. Its false appearance allows it to blend in with mundane ball bearings when it is scattered. The golem also has an immutable form, granting it immunity to any spell or effect that would alter its physical shape. Magic resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells, making it less susceptible to magical effects. Its weapon attacks count as magical, which is essential for bypassing certain defenses that creatures might have.

One of its notable special mechanics is the "Reform" ability. Even if it is scattered, as long as it has at least one hit point, it can reform into a cohesive shape within any space that contains its ball bearings, without provoking opportunity attacks. If it reforms near a prone creature, it can make an additional slam attack as part of this action. The "Scatter" ability allows the Bearing Golem to disperse its form into a 15-foot cube, causing creatures within that area to potentially trip unless they succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If they move through the area at half speed, they automatically avoid falling prone. While scattered, it cannot perform attacks but can still sustain damage from area spells.

In combat, the Bearing Golem can make multiattacks, executing either two slam attacks or using its Steel Shot ability twice. The slam attack has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The Steel Shot is a ranged attack that also uses the +7 modifier, with a range of 30 feet up to 120 feet and deals 11 bludgeoning damage. Moreover, it has a powerful ability called "Scattershot," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. When activated, the golem's body explodes, forcing all creatures within 15 feet to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that fail take 36 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone, while successful creatures take half the damage and remain standing. After using this ability, the golem immediately scatters, which can influence the dynamics of the battlefield significantly.
