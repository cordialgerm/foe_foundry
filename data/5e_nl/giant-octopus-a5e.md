The Giant Octopus is a large aquatic beast that excels in stealth and grappling opponents. With a moderate armor class of 11 and a total of 32 hit points, it can withstand some damage but is not particularly durable compared to larger creatures. Its challenge rating of 1 indicates that it is suitable for low-level adventurers. The Giant Octopus is agile in water, capable of moving quickly with a swim speed of 60 feet, while its walk speed is limited to 10 feet. Notably, the Giant Octopus possesses exceptional strength with a 16 in Strength, allowing it to effectively grapple and restrain foes. Its intelligence is low, but this creature compensates with proficient stealth and the ability to camouflage itself, making it a surprising threat in underwater encounters.

In terms of attributes, the Giant Octopus boasts a Strength score of 16, which provides a +3 modifier, signifying very good physical capabilities. The Dexterity score of 12 grants a +1 modifier, representing average agility. Its Constitution score is also 12, yielding another average modifier. Intelligence is notably weak at 4, resulting in a -3 modifier, indicating very bad cognitive skills. Wisdom is average at 12, providing a +1 modifier while charisma is similarly low at 4, translating to another very bad modifier.

The Giant Octopus has the following special abilities: 
- **Camouflage:** This ability grants the octopus advantage on Stealth checks, making it very good at hiding and ambushing prey in aquatic environments.
- **Water Breathing:** It can breathe underwater without issue and can hold its breath for up to one hour when out of the water. This allows it to operate freely within its aquatic habitat without the fear of suffocation.

When it comes to actions, the Giant Octopus can use its **Tentacles** as a melee weapon attack. This has a +5 to hit, which is a good modifier, and a reach of 15 feet allows it to engage targets from a distance. On a successful hit, it deals 8 bludgeoning damage (2d4+3) and can grapple the target. The grappled creature must succeed on a DC 13 escape check to free itself. While grappled, the creature is restrained, preventing it from taking certain actions and making it vulnerable to further attacks.

Additionally, the Giant Octopus has a **Bonus Action** called **Ink Cloud**, which can be used once per day. When underwater, it can release a 20-foot-radius cloud of ink, heavily obscuring the area for 1 minute. This can provide a strategic advantage by obscuring visibility, allowing the octopus to escape or reposition without being seen, unless the ink is swept away by a vigorous current.
