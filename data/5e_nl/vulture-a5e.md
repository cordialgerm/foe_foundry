The vulture is a medium beast characterized by its scavenging attributes and keen sensory abilities. With an armor class of 10, it offers minimal protection, and it possesses just 4 hit points, indicating that it is rather frail and can be easily taken down in combat. The vulture has a flying speed of 50 feet, allowing it to escape threats quickly, but its walking speed of only 10 feet limits its mobility on the ground. It operates in a challenge rating of 0, indicating that it presents very little threat to adventurers, earning only 25 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the vulture can take advantage of its keen sight and smell, providing it with the ability to notice threats or opportunities effectively.

The vulture's attributes include a strength score of 6, which gives it a strength modifier of -2, making it exceptionally weak in physical confrontations. Its dexterity is average at 10 with a +0 modifier, indicating basic agility but no remarkable speed or evasiveness, while its constitution is also average at 10 with a +0 modifier, denoting that it can withstand typical physical strains. The intelligence score is very low at 2, giving it an intelligence modifier of -4, which suggests the vulture lacks the capacity for complex thought and reasoning. It has a wisdom score of 12, resulting in a +1 modifier, making it reasonably aware of its surroundings, complemented by a perception skill of +3. Finally, its charisma is low with a score of 6 and a -2 modifier, indicating it possesses little ability to influence others or interact socially.

One of the vulture's notable special abilities is "Keen Sight and Smell," which grants it advantage on perception checks relying on sight and smell. This ability is advantageous in detecting predators or other creatures in its vicinity, making it a proficient scavenger.

In terms of actions, the vulture can perform a melee weapon attack using its beak. This attack has a +2 to hit, allowing for a modest chance of success against foes. The beak deals 2 piercing damage on a hit, which is not substantial but can contribute to its role as a nuisance in combat.

The vulture also possesses a reaction called "Retreat." When targeted by a melee attack, it can move 5 feet away from the attacker. If this movement takes it out of the predator's reach, the attacker suffers disadvantage on their attack roll. This ability enhances the vulture's survivability, making it more difficult to strike when it senses danger. Overall, while the vulture is not a formidable foe, its abilities focus on evading threats and scavenging effectively in its environment.
