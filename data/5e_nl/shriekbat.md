The Shriekbat is a huge monstrosity that operates independently, without alignment. It showcases impressive combat capabilities combined with an ability to deliver devastating sound-based attacks, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 178, the Shriekbat is durable and capable of withstanding considerable damage. Its natural armor and strong Constitution contribute to its resilience in battle. However, the creature has average Dexterity and very low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, which reflects its primal nature. Its primary role in combat is that of a bruiser, dealing significant melee damage while also affecting the battlefield with its Shriek ability. 

The Shriekbat has an exceptional Strength score of 24, granting it a +7 modifier, which makes its physical attacks very effective. Its Dexterity is only average at +1, which contributes to a saving throw of +5, while its Constitution is quite good at +4, solidifying its Hit Points. The creature's lack of intelligence makes it incapable of understanding languages or engaging in complex reasoning. 

In terms of skills, the Shriekbat has a good Stealth score of +5, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting prey. Its perception is average at +4, giving it some awareness of its surroundings. It is immune to thunder damage, which protects it from a common form of attack found in D&D spells and abilities. With blindsight up to 60 feet, the Shriekbat can sense its surroundings without relying on sight unless it is deafened, as indicated by its special ability of Echolocation.

When the Shriekbat attacks, it can use a Multiattack to make two strikes: first with its bite and then with its talons. The Bite attack comes with a +11 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals an impressive 20 piercing damage on a hit. Meanwhile, the Talons attack also carries a +11 to hit, but has a shorter reach of 5 feet and inflicts 17 slashing damage. Additionally, when the talons hit, they grapple the target with an escape DC of 19, restraining the creature until it escapes or the Shriekbat releases it.

One of the Shriekbat's most powerful features is its Shriek ability, which recharges on a roll of 5-6. This attack lets the Shriekbat emit a cone of sound with a range of 30 feet. Any creature in this area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid taking 42 thunder damage, or half that amount on a successful save. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it becomes stunned for 1 minute, preventing it from acting. Stunned creatures can attempt to end this effect by repeating the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. This ability not only deals substantial damage but can also disrupt enemies during combat, making the Shriekbat a potent force on the battlefield.
