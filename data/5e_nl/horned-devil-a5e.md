The Horned Devil is a powerful entity within the realm of fiends, specifically designed to be a formidable foe in encounters. With its large size and a challenge rating of 11, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, showcasing both physical resilience and formidable magical prowess. The Horned Devil possesses a robust armor class of 18, paired with 168 hit points that make it difficult to take down. Its strengths lie in its high strength and constitution, making it exceptionally adept in combat while also resistant to several forms of damage. However, despite its resilience, it has weaknesses, especially against certain types of magical attacks or the right strategies from clever players. 

The Horned Devil boasts impressive physical attributes: a Strength score of 20 provides a +5 modifier, leading to very good effectiveness in melee attacks. Strength and Constitution saving throws are notable, with a +9 and +7 respectively, making the devil exceptionally hard to affect with downward effects. Dexterity is also decent at +3, enabling an average reaction to more nimble situations. The devil has high Wisdom and Charisma scores at +3 each, which enhances its capabilities in interaction and spellcasting.

The creature is immune to fire and poison damage and resistant to cold and non-magical, non-silvered weapon damage. Additionally, it is immune to the poisoned condition. Its darkvision of 120 feet allows it to see in complete darkness as if it were normal light and has a passive Perception score of 13. The Horned Devil can communicate in Infernal and can utilize telepathy over a range of 120 feet.

In terms of special abilities, the Horned Devil benefits from Devil's Sight, allowing it to see through magical darkness, giving it an edge over opponents who might attempt to obscure the battlefield. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it tougher against spellcasting adversaries. The lawful evil alignment adds an additional layer to its menacing nature.

For actions, the Horned Devil conducts a Multiattack, which allows it to make two melee attacks with its Fork weapon and one with its Tail, or to replace any melee attack with Hurl Flame, a ranged attack option. The Fork attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 15 fire and piercing damage combined. The Tail attack similarly has a +9 to hit with an average damage output of 10 piercing damage and potentially inflicts ongoing damage if the target fails a Constitution saving throw.

Hurl Flame is a ranged spell attack with a +7 bonus, capable of delivering 10 fire damage at a distance of up to 150 feet. If the target is flammable, it ignites and suffers ongoing fire damage, heightening the threat level. The Inferno ability, usable once per day while bloodied, deals a devastating 49 fire damage to creatures surrounding it, challenging even the best-prepared adventurers.

Lastly, the Horned Devil has a reaction named Pin, which triggers when an opponent misses it with a melee attack. This ability allows the Horned Devil to counterattack and potentially grapple the attacker, causing ongoing damage until the grapple is escaped or alleviated by magical healing. This makes the Horned Devil a dangerous opponent capable of punishing careless attackers.

Overall, the Horned Devil's combination of damage immunity, magical resistance, multi-attack capabilities, and powerful special abilities creates a creature that is both strategically complex and a high-stakes challenge for adventurers.
