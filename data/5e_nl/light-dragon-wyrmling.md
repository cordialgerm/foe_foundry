The Light Dragon Wyrmling has some unique special abilities that enhance its combat and movement capabilities. The Illumination ability allows it to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, which can affect visibility in dark environments. Its Incorporeal Movement ability permits it to move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, though it incurs 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

The Light Dragon Wyrmling features two powerful breath weapons, both of which operate on a recharge mechanism of 5 to 6. The Radiant Breath allows the dragon to exhale radiant energy in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures within the area to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 16 radiant damage (rolling three ten-sided dice) and half damage on a successful save. The second breath weapon, Flaring Breath, emits a blinding flash of light in a similar cone, forcing creatures in that area to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer blindness. Additionally, undead caught in the effect must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw; those who fail are turned for one minute, while undead of Challenge Rating 1/2 or lower that fail the saving throw are instantly destroyed. This dragon wields considerable power on the battlefield, particularly against undead foes, making it a formidable opponent in the hands of a creative and tactical player.
