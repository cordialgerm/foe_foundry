The Devilflame Juggler is a large, lawful evil fiend that excels in combat through its agility and magical abilities. With an Armor Class of 18 and a substantial Hit Point total of 178, it can withstand considerable punishment while dishing out damage with its unique attack options. The creature has a very good Dexterity score at +5, allowing it to be quite nimble and evasive during encounters. Its challenge rating of 13 positions it as a formidable opponent for adventurers, capable of dealing both slashing and fire damage. The Juggler's special abilities, like Devil's Sight and Magic Resistance, further enhance its effectiveness in battles, making it a dangerous adversary. However, while it is powerful, it is still a fiend with potential weaknesses, particularly against magical attacks that use silvered weapons.

The attributes of the Devilflame Juggler are as follows: Strength 17 (+3; good), Dexterity 21 (+5; exceptional), Constitution 20 (+5; very good), Intelligence 13 (+1; average), Wisdom 14 (+2; average), and Charisma 19 (+4; very good). Its saving throws are also quite robust, with bonuses of +6 for Intelligence, +7 for Wisdom, and +9 for Charisma, indicating its proficiency in resisting effects that target these stats. The creature possesses damage immunities to fire and poison, as well as resistances to cold damage and nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons. Its condition immunities include being unable to become exhausted or poisoned. The Juggler can see in darkness up to 120 feet and has a passive perception of 12. It understands Infernal and can communicate telepathically within a range of 120 feet.

The special abilities of the Devilflame Juggler enhance its combat effectiveness. With Devil's Sight, it can see through magical darkness, giving it a tactical advantage in dark environments. Its Dizzying Movement ability poisons any creature that can see it move at least 15 feet that turn, requiring a Constitution saving throw (DC 18) to resist. Magic Resistance grants the Devilflame Juggler advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it difficult for spellcasters to affect it. The Standing Leap ability allows the Juggler to jump impressive distances, up to 30 feet for long jumps and 15 feet high, enabling it to maneuver effectively in battle.

In terms of actions, the Devilflame Juggler can utilize a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks using either Deft Touch or Devilflame Sphere. If it successfully hits a target with two Deft Touches or two Devilflame Spheres, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) or become frightened until the end of its next turn. The Deft Touch is a melee attack that offers a +10 to hit and deals 15 (3d6+5) slashing damage plus an additional 9 (2d8) fire damage. Notably, the Juggler can steal an item weighing up to 15 pounds from the target as an alternative to dealing damage. The Devilflame Sphere is a ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit that deals 22 (4d8+4) fire damage.

The Fiery Flourish is a powerful ability that requires a recharge of 5 to 6 after use. It allows the Juggler to launch a hellfire ball at a target within 90 feet, dealing 45 (10d8) fire damage with a Dexterity saving throw (DC 18) for half damage. After the initial strike, the fireball can split and spread, affecting up to four additional creatures within 30 feet of the initial target, each taking 22 (5d8) fire damage with the same saving throw mechanics. This fire can ignite flammable objects that are not being worn or carried between the targets.

As a bonus action, the Juggler can perform a Nimble Leap, allowing it to take the Dash or Disengage action to reposition itself as needed. In response to incoming damage, the Devilflame Juggler can utilize its Uncanny Dodge reaction to halve the damage it takes from one attack that it can see. This versatility makes it not only a threatening opponent but also a slippery and hard-to-catch target in combat.
