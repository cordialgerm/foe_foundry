Orthrus is a Medium monstrosity characterized by its two canine heads and a serpent-like head, fitting the lawful neutral alignment. With an Armor Class of 13 and 60 hit points, it presents a moderate challenge on the battlefield, rated at Challenge Level 3, making it a suitable adversary for mid-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its high Dexterity (16) and Constitution (16), which provide both agility and durability in combat. The creature's multiple heads grant it unique advantages, including enhanced perception and resilience against various status effects. However, its Intelligence (8) and Charisma (7) are notably low, limiting its ability to engage in strategic interactions or social situations.

Orthrus has the following attributes: Strength 15, Dexterity 16, Constitution 16, Intelligence 8, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 7. Its Dexterity and Constitution are good, allowing it to be effective both offensively and defensively, while its low Intelligence and Charisma are very bad, making it poor in problem-solving or social engagements. The creature possesses saving throws for Wisdom at +3 and skills in perception (+5) and survival (+3), showcasing its proficiency in awareness and tracking.

The Orthrus has enhanced senses, featuring darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive perception score of 15, allowing it to detect threats in low light and be very aware of its surroundings. It understands Common but lacks the ability to speak, which may influence its interactions with other creatures.

In terms of special abilities, the Orthrus's "Three-Headed" trait grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and saving throws against conditions like being blinded, charmed, or stunned. This makes it exceptionally resilient to incapacitating effects. The "Wakeful" ability ensures that at least one of its heads remains alert while it sleeps, making it difficult for adversaries to catch it off guard.

For actions, the Orthrus can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three bite attacks in one turn—two from its canine heads and one from its snake head. If both canine heads manage to bite the same target, the victim is compelled to make a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, which can significantly alter the dynamics of combat.

Each bite attack functions as follows: the canine heads make a melee weapon attack with a +5 bonus to hit, reaching a distance of 5 feet, and deal 6 piercing damage (1d6 + 3) upon a successful hit. The snake head also makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and inflicts 5 piercing damage (1d4 + 3) if it hits. Additionally, the target of the snake bite must take a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails, it suffers 14 poison damage (4d6) and is poisoned for 1 minute. Success results in halving the poison damage and avoiding the poisoned condition, which can significantly affect combat performance by impairing the target’s abilities.
