The Haladron is a tiny celestial being, embodying the principles of lawful good. With a challenge rating of 1/2 and 28 hit points, it is a relatively low-powered creature designed to assist and offer support rather than engage in direct confrontations. Its flight ability allows it to maneuver freely in combat, supplemented by its special abilities like Flyby, which enables it to avoid opportunity attacks, making it agile and difficult to pin down. The Haladron is resilient with resistances to radiant damage and immunity to several conditions, allowing it to serve effectively in a supportive role. However, its offensive capabilities are modest, relying primarily on a ranged attack and a healing ability that can benefit allies.

The attributes of the Haladron are as follows: Strength is 13, which provides a +1 modifier and indicates a slightly above average physical capability; Dexterity is 12, with a +1 modifier reflecting an average level of agility; Constitution is also 12, equating to an average resilience; Intelligence is 15, giving a +2 modifier and suggesting above average mental acuity; Wisdom is equally 15, resulting in a +2 modifier that enhances its perception and intuition; while Charisma is 10, indicating average presence. The overall effectiveness of its attributes is generally average or above average, with Strength, Intelligence, and Wisdom being the standout stats.

In terms of skills, the Haladron excels in perception, with a +2 modifier, providing a good ability to notice hidden objects and creatures. It has damage resistance to radiant damage, which is common amongst celestial beings, and it is immune to conditions such as exhaustion, poison, being prone, and being unconscious. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 12, enabling it to see in dim light and detect hidden threats effectively. Language-wise, it can communicate in Celestial, Common, and via telepathy within 30 feet.

The Haladron has several notable special abilities. Its Flyby ability allows it to move past enemies without triggering opportunity attacks, providing it with exceptional mobility during combat. The Immortal Nature trait means it does not need to eat, drink, or sleep, making it an enduring presence in any scenario. Additionally, its Immutable Form grants immunity to any form-altering spells or effects, reinforcing its status as a celestial being that cannot be easily changed or corrupted.

For actions, the Haladron can use its Bolt of Law ranged spell attack, which has a +4 bonus to hit at a range of 60 feet against a single target. On a successful hit, it deals 6 radiant damage plus an additional 4 thunder damage, making this a balanced offensive option. It can also utilize its Stitch ability three times per day, which allows the Haladron to repair damage to objects or heal a creature for 3 hit points without leaving any trace of the previous damage, making it a valuable ally in both combat and exploration scenarios.
