The Megapede is a large monstrosity, notable for its formidable combination of physical attacks and unique abilities. With a high Armor Class of 15, it can withstand a decent amount of damage. The creature has a total of 75 hit points, making it moderately resilient in battle. Its challenge rating of 3 allows it to pose a genuine threat to lower-level adventurers, yielding 700 experience points upon defeat. The Megapede excels in dealing damage through its bite and stinger attacks, which can result in both slashing and poison damage. However, it has low intelligence, wisdom, and charisma, indicating a lack of mental acuity or social skills. Notably, the Megapede possesses a remarkable ability to sense metal from a distance, which can be both advantageous and thematic in gameplay, considering its ability to consume metal objects.

The Megapede has the following attributes: Strength is 17, which gives it a good modifier of +3, highlighting its physical prowess; Dexterity is 14 with a +2 modifier, providing it with an average level of agility; Constitution is 15, also translating to a good +2 modifier, contributing to its overall toughness; Intelligence is notably low at 2, resulting in a very bad modifier of -4, reflecting its inability to reason; Wisdom is at 7, yielding a bad -2 modifier, indicating poor judgment; and Charisma is at 3, with a very bad -4 modifier, showing it has very little charm or social presence.

In terms of special abilities, the Megapede has Metal Sense, allowing it to detect any metal within a 600-foot radius and identify its type. This ability could be used strategically during encounters, especially if the players are equipped with metal weapons or armor.

When it comes to actions, the Megapede can use Multiattack, which enables it to make both a stinger attack and a bite attack in a single turn, or replace the bite attack with its Consume Metal ability. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit and can deal a total of 13 damage (10 slashing and 3 acid) while grappling an enemy of size Large or smaller, making it easier to target that creature in subsequent turns. The Stinger attack also has a +5 to hit and can deliver 8 piercing damage; if the target fails a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, they become poisoned for one minute, which can seriously hinder their combat effectiveness.

The Consume Metal ability allows the Megapede to eat an unattended medium or smaller metal object, or attempt to consume an object held by a grappling opponent. The grappled creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or lose the item. If the object is magical, the creature has an advantage on the saving throw, but any magical items consumed remain intact in the Megapede's stomach for a short time before being destroyed. 

Additionally, the Megapede can unleash an Acid Spray attack once every six rounds. This attack creates a 30-foot long, 5-foot wide line of acid, forcing each creature in that area to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, causing 18 acid damage on a failed save or half that amount if successful. 

Overall, the Megapede's mixture of physical attacks, poison effects, and unique abilities related to metal make it a versatile enemy in combat, capable of applying pressure to adventurers both through direct assaults and its ability to manipulate the battlefield.
