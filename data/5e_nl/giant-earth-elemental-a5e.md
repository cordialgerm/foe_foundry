The Giant Earth Elemental is a formidable creature, embodying the raw power of the earth itself. As a large elemental, it plays a potent role on the battlefield, capable of grappling opponents and dealing substantial damage with its slam attacks and ranged rock throws. With a robust set of defenses, including damage immunities and resistances, it excels in durability while its ability to burrow gives it unique tactical mobility. However, despite its impressive attributes, its low Dexterity score means it is not particularly agile, making it vulnerable to more dexterous foes. Overall, the Giant Earth Elemental is a powerful combatant that can serve as a siege engine or a tough frontline defender.

The Giant Earth Elemental has an Armor Class of 17, which provides a good level of protection against attacks. Its hit points total 157, representing a very high degree of durability, allowing it to withstand considerable damage in combat. The creature has a base walking speed of 30 feet and can also burrow at 30 feet, giving it excellent mobility in ground-based environments. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it is considered a highly challenging opponent, typically yielding 5,000 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Giant Earth Elemental has a Strength score of 18 with a modifier of +4, which is very good for melee combat. Its Dexterity score is a mere 10, resulting in a modifier of +0, which is average, making it less agile. It has a Constitution score of 18, also with a +4 modifier, contributing to its high hit points and resilience. Its Intelligence is quite low at 6 (-2 modifier), indicating a lack of strategic thinking. Wisdom and Charisma are both also low, with scores of 10 (+0) and 6 (-2) respectively, reflecting limited sensory perception and social interaction capabilities. 

The Giant Earth Elemental possesses several special abilities. "Earth Glide" allows it to burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without leaving a trace, enhancing its mobility and surprise factor in combat. The "Siege Monster" ability allows it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it particularly effective against fortifications. "Elemental Nature" means that it does not require air, food, or sleep, allowing it to operate in environments where other creatures may be hindered.

In terms of actions, the Giant Earth Elemental can perform a "Multiattack," making two slam attacks on its turn. The slam attack features a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 22 (4d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a hit. The "Earth's Embrace" action allows it to make a melee weapon attack against a Large or smaller creature with the same +7 to hit bonus and a reach of 5 feet. This attack deals 17 (2d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if it successfully hits, the target is grappled with an escape DC of 15 until the grapple ends. While grappling, the elemental cannot burrow or use "Earth's Embrace" again, but gains advantage on slam attacks against the grappling target. The "Rock" ranged attack also has a +7 to hit with a range of 30/90 feet, dealing an average of 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage, allowing for effective ranged combat options.

This creature's combination of strong melee attacks, unique mobility, and an ability to control the battlefield make it a potent challenge for any adventuring party.
