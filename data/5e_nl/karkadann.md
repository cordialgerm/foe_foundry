The Karkadann possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. Its Impaling Charge allows it to deal significant damage to an opponent and restrain them if it moves at least 20 feet toward them and successfully hits with a horn attack. The target is then grappling the Karkadann and takes ongoing piercing damage until they escape. This ability can change the dynamics of a battle significantly, as it effectively removes a character from the fray while causing damage. Its Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, improving its survivability against spellcasting opponents.

Additionally, the Toss ability lets it hurl a creature it has impaled up to 30 feet in a random direction, potentially knocking them prone and causing additional bludgeoning damage if they strike a solid surface or another target. This is a tactical option that could disrupt the flow of combat. Lastly, the Karkadann can use its Healing Touch ability three times per day, allowing it to restore 22 (4d8+2) hit points to another creature and cure them of all diseases and poisons, making it an asset in party dynamics when allies are in danger.
