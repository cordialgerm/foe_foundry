The Tosculi Hive Queen is a formidable and sinister large monstrosity characterized by its Lawful Evil alignment. As the leader of its hive, the Hive Queen wields significant power in both combat and strategic planning. It boasts impressive speed and agility, being able to walk at a rate of 60 feet and fly at 40 feet, making it a versatile opponent. With an Armor Class of 17 and a substantial hit point pool of 189, it is highly durable and can take a considerable amount of damage before falling in battle. Its Challenge Rating of 12 indicates a significant threat level, capable of challenging seasoned adventurers. The Hive Queen's exceptional Dexterity and various abilities allow it to evade attacks and impose debilitating effects on its enemies, which can turn the tide of battle in favor of her hive. 

The Hive Queen possesses a Strength of 17 (+3), making its physical attacks moderately strong, while its Dexterity of 24 (+7) is very good, allowing for excellent initiative in combat and defense against attacks. With a Constitution of 20 (+5), it has very good resilience, enhancing its hit points and saving throws. Its Intelligence of 16 (+3) indicates above-average cognitive abilities, contributing to its tactical acumen. Wisdom and Charisma are both 16 (+3) and 18 (+4), respectively, granting the Hive Queen good willpower and some potent influence over others, both of which enhance its commanding presence in battle.

The saving throws for the Hive Queen include a +11 for Dexterity, +9 for Constitution, +7 for Wisdom, and +8 for Charisma. This provides it with exceptionally good evasion and durability against various effects. The Hive Queen's Perception skill is at +7, giving it a passive Perception of 17, which allows it to remain aware of its surroundings effectively. Notably, it has immunity to poison damage and conditions like charm and poison, meaning it can resist many debilitating spells and effects. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it can communicate telepathically up to 120 feet, alongside understanding numerous languages including Common, Deep Speech, Gnoll, Infernal, and Tosculi.

The formidable Hive Queen possesses Legendary Resistance available three times per day, allowing it to succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail. This significantly bolsters its combat effectiveness, securing its actions against powerful spells or abilities from opposing characters. The Hive Queen's Hive's Heart ability grants her a strategic advantage, as she knows the direction and distance to all members of her hive, extending her telepathy range to an impressive 20 miles with her hive's members.

In combat, the Hive Queen can perform a multiattack, allowing her to make a total of four Scimitar attacks in one turn. Each Scimitar attack is at a +11 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 14 slashing damage on a successful hit. For a more powerful attack, she can strike with her Stinger, providing another melee weapon attack at +11 to hit, which deals 22 (6d4 + 7) piercing damage. If the target fails a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, it becomes poisoned and paralyzed for one minute; this adds a significant crowd control element to her combat style.

The Hive Queen can also implant an egg into an incapacitated creature, a dangerous ability that allows her to use a creature as a host. The affected creature becomes poisoned and paralyzed until the egg hatches after 30 days, leading to the hostâ€™s death as the larval Tosculi bursts out. This ability can be countered by a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check or by magic that cures disease, revealing the potential severity and urgency players face when dealing with this creature.

In terms of legendary actions, the Hive Queen can choose to fly up to half her flying speed, allowing her to reposition herself strategically without provoking opportunity attacks. Alternatively, she can use her Stinger attack as a legendary action costing two actions or create a blinding cloud of glittering particles around her using Glitter Dust, which forces non-Tosculi creatures within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being blinded until the end of their next turn. This array of offensive and defensive capabilities makes the Tosculi Hive Queen a lethal force on the battlefield, requiring careful planning and execution from any adventuring party aiming to defeat her.
