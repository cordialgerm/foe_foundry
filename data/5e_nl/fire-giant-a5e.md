The Fire Giant is a formidable Huge Giant known for its immense physical prowess and ability to wield fire with immunity to its damage. With a strong Armor Class of 18 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 162 (derived from rolling 13d12 and adding 78), it poses a considerable threat in battle, rated with a Challenge Rating of 11 equating to 7,200 experience points for defeating it. This creature’s exceptional Strength of 25 grants it a +7 modifier, making its melee attacks particularly devastating, while its Constitution of 22 ensures high durability in combat. However, it is notably vulnerable to cold damage, which can slow it down. The Fire Giant's range and area of effect, combined with its potential to knock opponents prone and push them away, make it an intimidating presence on the battlefield.

The Fire Giant has the following attributes: Strength 25 (+7), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 22 (+6), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 12 (+1). The giant’s saving throw bonuses reflect its formidable physical capabilities: +11 for Strength, +4 for Dexterity, +10 for Constitution, and +5 for Charisma, indicating very good resistance against physical challenges. In terms of skills, it excels in athletics with a +11 modifier, perception with a +6 modifier, and intimidation with a +5 modifier, showcasing its dominant presence both in and out of combat. The giant has an immunity to fire damage and a passive perception score of 16, allowing it to notice hidden creatures effectively. It is fluent in the Giant language.

The Fire Giant possesses a unique special ability called “Cold Weakness,” which reduces its speed by 10 feet until the end of its next turn whenever it takes cold damage, making it a strategic target for cold-based attacks.

In combat, the Fire Giant utilizes a “Multiattack” action, allowing it to make two melee weapon attacks with its greatsword. The greatsword attack roll is +11 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 28 (6d6 + 7) slashing damage on a successful strike. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed back up to 10 feet and knocked prone. Additionally, the giant can also throw a rock, making a ranged attack with a +11 modifier and a range of 60/240 feet, dealing substantial bludgeoning damage averaging 42 (10d6 + 7). Targets of this attack that are Large or smaller must also make a DC 19 Strength saving throw to avoid falling prone.

The giant has a devastating special move called "Sword Sweep," usable once a day while it is bloodied. This move allows it to make a greatsword attack against every creature within a 10-foot radius, maximizing its threat level in close quarters.

Furthermore, as a reaction, the Fire Giant can use a “Kick” ability when struck by a melee attack from a Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet. This move forces the attacker to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw; on a failed save, the attacker suffers 14 (3d4 + 7) bludgeoning damage, is pushed back 20 feet from the giant, and falls prone, which can significantly alter the positioning and strategy of combat.
