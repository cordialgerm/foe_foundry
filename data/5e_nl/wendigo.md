The Wendigo is a Medium monstrosity characterized by its chaotic evil alignment and fearsome abilities. Operating at a Challenge Rating of 11, it presents a significant threat to adventurers with its high hit points, strong melee attacks, and devastating magical abilities. The Wendigo possesses a high Armor Class of 16, allowing it to withstand considerable damage, and its immunities and resistances provide it with formidable defense against common forms of attack. Notably, its Aura of Starvation can incapacitate multiple foes at once, creating opportunities for it to strike with its powerful claw and bite attacks. However, its intelligence and charisma scores are relatively low, potentially limiting its effectiveness in more strategic roles or social encounters.

The Wendigo has several key attributes: it has a Strength of 21, giving it an exceptional melee attack modifier of +5, which is very good for dealing damage. Its Dexterity of 18 grants it a good +4 modifier, enhancing its stealth and agility. Its Constitution of 16 means it has an average +3 modifier, making it durable but not exceptionally tough. The Intelligence score of 11 provides a bad +0 modifier, while its Wisdom of 16 offers a good +3 modifier, contributing to its perception skills. Lastly, the Charisma of 12 gives it an average +1 modifier, impacting its interaction capabilities.

The Wendigo's skills enhance its effectiveness in combat and survival situations. It boasts a very good +9 modifier in athletics, allowing it to perform physical feats with ease. Its perception is bolstered by a +7 modifier, providing it with keen awareness of its surroundings, while a +8 modifier in stealth allows it to approach targets unnoticed. With a +7 modifier in survival, the Wendigo is adept at navigating and thriving in challenging environments.

In terms of damage immunities, the Wendigo is entirely immune to cold and fire damage, making it particularly resistant to elemental attacks. It also benefits from damage resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, allowing it to withstand many conventional assaults. Additionally, it is immune to exhaustion and being stunned, enabling it to remain in combat longer without the risk of incapacitation. With darkvision extending 120 feet and a passive perception of 17, the Wendigo is highly aware of its environment even in low-light situations. It communicates using the Common language.

The Wendigo's special abilities further enhance its menacing presence in combat. The Aura of Starvation affects any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of it, requiring a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid being paralyzed for 1 minute. This paralysis is caused by the intense cold and insatiable hunger emanating from the Wendigo. The affected creature can attempt to break free at the end of each of its turns. If they succeed or the effect ends, they gain immunity to this aura for 24 hours. Additionally, the Wendigo has Magic Resistance, granting it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, significantly increasing its resilience in magical confrontations.

When it comes to actions, the Wendigo can make multiple attacks in a single turn. It employs a Multiattack option, allowing it to make three separate attacks: two using its Icy Claw and one using its Bite, or it can opt to use its Frozen Spittle ability twice. The Icy Claw attack, with a +9 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet and inflicts 12 slashing damage along with 14 cold damage on a successful hit. The Bite attack is similarly effective, also with a +9 to hit, delivering 14 piercing damage. Alternatively, the Frozen Spittle is a ranged attack that also utilizes a +7 to hit and targets foes up to 100 feet away, dealing an impressive 28 cold damage. If the target fails a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, they become restrained until the end of their next turn, providing the Wendigo with strategic control over the battlefield.
