The Coralfish is a small monstrosity known for its unique aquatic abilities and a dangerous bite that can petrify its foes. With an armor class of 12 and hit points totaling 27, it can be considered moderately resilient for its challenge rating of 1/2, making it a creature that can pose a significant threat to unprepared adventurers. The Coralfish primarily operates in water, as it has an excellent swimming speed of 40 feet but is limited to walking only 20 feet on land. Its notable strength lies in its petrifying bite, which can incapacitate opponents, rendering them helpless for a full day if not treated. However, it has very poor strength and intelligence, indicating that its physical power is minimal and its cognitive abilities are exceptionally limited. 

The Coralfish has the following attributes: 

- Strength: 6, which gives it a modifier of -2, indicating very bad physical capabilities.
- Dexterity: 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is good and contributes to its agility.
- Constitution: 12, providing a +1 modifier, categorized as average; this gives it decent stamina in combat.
- Intelligence: 2, yielding a -4 modifier, suggesting exceptional lack of reasoning and understanding.
- Wisdom: 12, granting a +1 modifier, indicative of average perception and insight.
- Charisma: 5, resulting in a -3 modifier, signaling very bad personal charm and social abilities.

The Coralfish possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light and darkness as if it were bright light. Its passive perception score of 11 enables it to notice hidden creatures or objects, but it does not have the capacity for language.

In gameplay, the Coralfish has a special ability called Aquatic, which means it can only breathe underwater. This limits its functionality outside of aquatic environments, making it less effective on land.

For its actions during combat, the Coralfish can perform a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, and it has a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to engage targets fairly close to it. On a successful hit, the attack deals 4 piercing damage, calculated with the roll of a 1d4 plus 2. Importantly, the target also must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw to avoid being petrified. If the target fails this saving throw, it becomes restrained by the petrifying effect as it begins to turn into a brightly colored statue. The creature can end this effect with a lesser restoration spell. If still restrained, it can make another saving throw at the end of its next turn; if it succeeds this time, the effect ends, but if it fails, it remains petrified for a full 24 hours.

Additionally, the Coralfish has a reaction called Frenzy, which it can use once per day. When it is attacked by a creature within 20 feet that it can see, it can move up to half its speed and make a bite attack against the attacking creature, optimizing its chances of striking back swiftly after being provoked. 

Overall, the Coralfish’s combination of aquatic abilities, petrifying bite, and relatively good dexterity makes it a strategic foe, particularly in water, where its threats are amplified.
