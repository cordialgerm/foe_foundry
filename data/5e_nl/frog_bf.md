The frog is a tiny beast known for its simplicity and adaptability. With a low challenge rating of 0, it serves as a minor creature that can be found in various environments, particularly near water. Its ability to breathe both air and water makes it quite versatile. However, the frog possesses very low physical attributes, with notable weaknesses in strength, intelligence, and charisma. Its defensive capabilities are minimal, reflected in a low armor class and hit points, placing it in a role that is more suited to being a harmless creature in a D&D adventure rather than a formidable opponent.

In terms of attributes, the frog has the following stats: Strength is -5, Dexterity is +0, Constitution is -1, Intelligence is -5, Wisdom is -1, and Charisma is -4. The frog’s Dexterity of +0 is average, making it neither particularly nimble nor clumsy. Its other attributes are very bad, indicating significant limitations in physical power and mental acuity.

The frog possesses special abilities, including Amphibious, which allows it to breathe in both air and water, making it capable of thriving in aquatic environments. Its Standing Leap allows it to make considerable jumps—up to 10 feet horizontally and 5 feet vertically—whether it has a running start or not, offering it good mobility for a small creature.

In terms of actions, the frog can perform a Bite attack. This melee weapon attack has a +2 modifier to hit, which is considered average in effectiveness. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and can target one creature. Upon hitting, it deals 2 bludgeoning damage, determined by a roll of 1d4, which is quite minimal in combat scenarios. Overall, while the frog may not be a threat, its unique abilities and low challenge rating make it an interesting creature within its ecological niche.
