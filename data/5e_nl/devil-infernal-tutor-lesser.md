The Infernal Tutor, Lesser is a Medium fiend characterized by its lawful evil nature. This creature plays the role of a cunning manipulator in combat and social interactions, using its intelligence and charm to influence others. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it possesses notable strengths such as high Charisma and effective spellcasting capabilities, making it a formidable foe when manipulating the minds of its enemies. Its natural armor grants it a decent Armor Class of 15, while its 110 hit points provide substantial durability. However, it does exhibit weaknesses, particularly against magic attacks and silver weapons, reflecting its connection to fire and poison immunity. The Infernal Tutor excels in social situations, showing exceptional prowess in deception and persuasion, but it can be vulnerable when directly attacked.

- Constitution: 15, giving a +2 modifier for good resilience and saving throws.
- Intelligence: 14, yielding a +2 modifier, indicating above-average cunning.
- Wisdom: 17, resulting in a +3 modifier, which enhances its perception and saving throws against certain effects.

- Intelligence: +5, average against mind-affecting spells.
- Wisdom: +6, very good in defending against wisdom-based effects.

Its skills include a +3 modifier in perception, indicating an average ability to notice hidden threats. The creature has immunities to fire and poison damage and resistance to cold damage and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, unless made with silver weapons. It is immune to conditions such as being charmed, frightened, or poisoned. The Infernal Tutor has darkvision that extends to 120 feet and a passive perception of 13.

The special abilities of the Infernal Tutor include:
- Devil’s Sight, which allows it to see in magical darkness as if it were normal light, thus giving it a significant advantage in dimly lit environments.
- Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it very tough to control or damage through magic.
- Weaken Resolve is a manipulative ability where the Infernal Tutor gains advantage on deception and persuasion rolls against humanoids. If it speaks with a humanoid for a minute or more, that creature has disadvantage on saving throws against its enchantment spells, making this ability particularly effective for turning others to its cause.

In combat, the Infernal Tutor can make multiple attacks through its Multiattack option, allowing it to strike with three Claws or Tutor's Batons, or mix one Claw with two Tutor's Batons. The Claw attack has a +6 to hit and delivers 12 slashing damage, while the Tutor's Baton also has a +6 to hit and deals 10 bludgeoning damage.

The Fiendish Tutelage ability, which recharges on rolls of 5 or 6, allows the Infernal Tutor to emit psychic damage, dealing 35 (10d6) psychic damage to creatures within a 15-foot radius that can hear it, with a DC 15 Charisma save to take half damage. 

Its spellcasting capability allows it to cast spells using its Charisma with a DC of 15, requiring no material components. It can cast the following spells: 
- At will: Bane, which imposes a penalty on affected creatures’ attack rolls and saving throws; Calm Emotions, which can suppress strong emotions in those around it; and Detect Thoughts, enabling the tutor to read minds.
- Three times a day: Command to compel a single target to follow a command; Enthrall to captivate an audience; and Suggestion, allowing it to plant a suggestion in a target's mind.
- Once per day: Compulsion, a potent spell that forces targets to act according to its commands.

The Infernal Tutor also possesses a Bonus Action called Change Shape, allowing it to transform into a Small or Medium Humanoid or back to its original fiendish form, maintaining its stats but altering its appearance. It reverts to its true form upon death.

As a reaction, the Infernal Tutor can respond to a successful save with its Strength of Character ability, imparting a psychic insult that deals 7 (2d6) psychic damage to a creature within 60 feet, imposing disadvantage on its next saving throw against the tutor's spell, unless it successfully makes a DC 15 Wisdom save. 

Overall, the Infernal Tutor, Lesser is a complex and versatile creature, capable of both dealing damage and manipulating its opponents through charm and deceit.
