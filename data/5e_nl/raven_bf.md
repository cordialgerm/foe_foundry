The raven is a tiny beast known for its agility and unique abilities, making it a versatile creature in various contexts. With an Armor Class of 11 and only 8 hit points, it is not particularly strong in combat, but its high flying speed of 50 feet grants it excellent mobility in the air. As a Challenge Rating of 0 signifies, it poses little threat to adventurers, yet its capacity to sense carrion and mimic sounds makes it a curious companion or an observer in the wilds. While its physical statistics reveal very low strength and constitution, it possesses average dexterity, good wisdom, and exceptional stealth, allowing it to evade notice in the right conditions.

The raven's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength score of -4, which is very bad and means it struggles to exert force; a Dexterity of +1, which is average, allowing it some nimbleness; a Constitution of -1, also very bad, indicating poor endurance; an Intelligence of -3, which is very bad and reflects its limited reasoning ability; a Wisdom score of +1, which is good, providing a level of perception; and a Charisma of +0, which is average with no significant impact in social interaction.

In terms of special abilities, the raven can use the following:

- **Carrion Sense:** This ability allows the raven to sense the location of dead creatures or Undead within a 60-foot range by smell, providing it an edge in locating food or sensing danger.
- **Mimicry:** The raven can imitate simple sounds it has heard, such as musical notes or cries. An opponent who hears the imitation can determine it's not genuine by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check, making this ability useful for distraction or misdirection.
- **Recollection:** This ability allows the raven to remember and repeat up to 20 words from any language it has heard, mimicking the voices of those who spoke them, thus adding to its utility in communication.

For its actions, the raven can perform the following:

- **Beak:** The raven has a melee weapon attack using its beak, with a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully hits a target, it deals 3 piercing damage (1d4 + 1). This attack can be effective against small creatures or in swarming situations, despite its low damage output.

Overall, the raven is a clever and nimble creature, well-suited for tasks involving stealth, reconnaissance, or communication, rather than direct confrontation.
