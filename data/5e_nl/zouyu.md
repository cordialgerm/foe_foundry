The Zouyu is a huge chaotic good monstrosity that exudes an aura of wild energy and unpredictable tactics. Its exceptional Dexterity and ability to manipulate luck make it a formidable foe in combat, while its high Armor Class and significant hit points allow it to endure substantial damage. The creature excels in mobility, boasting the ability to quickly cover vast distances, but it has vulnerabilities, particularly to thunder damage. With access to a variety of abilities that enhance its attack effectiveness and disrupt opponent actions, the Zouyu is both a resilient combatant and a strategic supporter for its allies.

The Zouyu has an Armor Class of 17, which is considered good, providing it with a decent level of protection against attacks. It has a total of 114 hit points, calculated as 12d12 + 36, showcasing its durability in extended encounters. The Zouyu has a walking speed of 60 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it poses a moderate challenge to adventurers, providing 2,300 experience points upon defeat.

The Zouyuâ€™s Strength is high at 18, giving it a +4 modifier, which is good for physical attacks. Its Dexterity is exceptionally high at 24, providing a +7 modifier, allowing it to maneuver and dodge effectively in combat situations. The Constitution score of 16 yields a +3 modifier, contributing positively to its hit points and saving throws. However, its Intelligence is low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, which reflects its limited cognitive capabilities. Its Wisdom score is average at 12, with a +1 modifier, and its Charisma is very high at 18, giving it a +4 modifier, making it effective in social interactions and abilities that rely on charm.

For saving throws, the Zouyu has a +10 modifier for Dexterity saves, which is very good, and a +4 for Wisdom saves, which is average. It possesses skills in perception at +7 and stealth at +10, both of which are very good, enabling it to navigate unnoticed and detect hidden threats efficiently. The creature is vulnerable to thunder damage, meaning it will take double damage from thunder-based effects. It has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, which lets it see in darkness as if it were dim light, and its passive Perception is 17, indicating it has a keen ability to perceive its surroundings. The Zouyu understands Common, but it cannot speak, limiting its ability for verbal communication.

The Zouyu has several special abilities that reflect its nature. The Distance Runner ability allows it to run an astonishing 310 miles in a day when traveling at a fast pace, which is exceptional for travel speed. Its Keen Sight and Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell, enhancing its tracking capabilities. The Pounce ability allows it to knock an opponent prone if it charges at least 20 feet toward them and successfully attacks, creating opportunities for additional attacks against prone targets.

In combat, the Zouyu can use its Multiattack action to unleash a torrent of attacks by first utilizing its Alter Luck ability, which manipulates the luck of nearby creatures before attacking. It can execute one bite attack with a +10 to hit, dealing 16 piercing damage on a successful hit, and two claw attacks, each also at +10 to hit, dealing 14 slashing damage per hit. 

Alter Luck is a unique and strategic ability where the Zouyu can influence the outcome of combat or skill checks. It can bestow luck upon an ally, granting them advantage on their next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, which can be game-changing in critical moments. Conversely, it can steal luck from an enemy, imposing disadvantage on their next roll unless they succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails, the Zouyu can gain advantage on its own attack roll or saving throw, further enhancing its effectiveness in the encounter.
