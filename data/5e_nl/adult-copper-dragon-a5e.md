The Adult Copper Dragon is a huge and formidable creature that serves as an iconic representation of powerful dragons in Dungeons & Dragons. With a challenge rating of 17, it possesses significant offensive and defensive capabilities. Its impressive armor class of 18 and robust hit points totaling 253 render it a challenging adversary in combat. This dragon has strengths in both melee attacks and spellcasting, making it versatile in various tactical scenarios. Despite its formidable nature, it has a few weaknesses, notably its reliance on its legendary resistances, which, when depleted, lowers its Armor Class. With its unique ability to blend into terrain and the potential to frighten foes, the Adult Copper Dragon is a master of battle who can control the battlefield's dynamics effectively.

In terms of attributes, the Adult Copper Dragon has a Strength of 22, which offers a +6 modifier, categorizing it as exceptional in physical power. Its Dexterity is average at 12, providing a +1 modifier that is not particularly strong but still decent for a creature of its size. Constitution is high at 20 (+5), granting it good resilience against damage. It has an Intelligence of 18 (+4), indicating good tactical thinking, and Wisdom of 14 (+2), which is above average for perceptiveness. Charisma is also strong at 16 (+3), enhancing the dragon's innate spellcasting effectiveness.

The dragon’s saving throw bonuses are noteworthy: it has a +7 to Dexterity saves, +11 to Constitution saves, +8 to Wisdom saves, and +9 to Charisma saves, indicating that it is very good at avoiding effects that target these attributes. It excels in several skills, including deception (+10), perception (+9), and stealth (+7), showcasing its cunning and ability to remain undetected.

The dragon is immune to acid damage and has several notable senses, including blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive perception of 20. It can communicate in Common, Draconic, and two additional languages, indicating its ability to engage with various beings.

The dragon’s special abilities enhance its stealth and survivability. "Flow Within the Mountain" enables it to hide more effectively in mountainous areas and allows it to merge with stone surfaces, enabling strategic movement across the battlefield. The "Legendary Resistance" allows the dragon to negate failed saving throws three times per day, although failing to use them reduces its Armor Class temporarily. 

The dragon's innate spellcasting is bolstered by a high Charisma score (save DC 17), allowing it to cast several powerful spells without needing material components, specifically "hideous laughter," "suggestion," "mislead," and "polymorph," each of which can significantly influence encounters, disrupt opponents, or provide strategic advantages.

In combat, the dragon utilizes multiattack, delivering powerful strikes with its bite (with a +12 to hit, dealing 22 piercing damage plus 4 acid damage on a success) and two claw attacks (also with +12 to hit, dealing 19 slashing damage). It can also use its tail attack to push targets away or employ the Acid Spit ability, forcing a Dexterity saving throw (DC 19) that can inflict significant acid damage and ongoing damage if the target fails. Its breath weapons - Acid Breath and Slowing Breath - provide area-of-effect attacks that can damage or incapacitate multiple foes.

The dragon can magically change shapes, allowing it to become a humanoid or beast, though it sacrifices some of its capabilities in that form. In terms of reactions, the Tail Attack allows it to retaliate against melee attackers within close proximity.

The dragon has access to legendary actions, enabling it to exert control over the battlefield even out of turn. These include a fear-inducing Roar, a disruptive Wing Attack to push creatures back while gaining flight, and a tactical Tricksters Gambit which enables it to teleport and create illusory duplicates to confuse enemies.

Overall, the Adult Copper Dragon is a powerful and versatile foe that poses a significant challenge to adventurers, utilizing a blend of physical attacks, strategic movement, and spellcasting to dominate encounters.
