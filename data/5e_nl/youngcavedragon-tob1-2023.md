The Young Cave Dragon is a formidable creature embodying the classic traits of dragonkind but is notably characterized by its connection to subterranean landscapes. As a Large Neutral Evil dragon, it possesses a cunning and a predatory nature, making it a significant threat to adventurers who venture into its lair. With a robust armor class of 17 and a remarkable pool of hit points amounting to 189, the dragon can withstand considerable punishment before being defeated. Its power is amplified through its impressive stats, including a Strength score of 23, which translates to a very good +6 modifier, and it showcases solid resilience with a Constitution score of 21, also yielding a +5 modifier. While it has some weaknesses due to its low Dexterity score of 12 (average +1) and Intelligence score of 10 (average +0), its defensive and offensive capabilities more than compensate.

The Young Cave Dragon has several special abilities that highlight its unique characteristics in combat and interactions. Its Darkness Shroud ability allows it to dim the light around it, creating a tactical advantage by turning bright light into darkness, which can disrupt spellcasting that relies on light. With Magical Tunneler, the dragon can burrow through earth and stone, either leaving the terrain undisturbed or crafting a tunnel, allowing for swift movement and strategic positioning during encounters. The Spiked Climb ability grants it exceptional climbing prowess, enabling traversal on difficult surfaces without penalty.

In combat, the Young Cave Dragon uses its Multiattack action to make one Bite and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, delivering 17 piercing damage along with an additional 7 poison damage, while each Claw attack also boasts a +10 to hit and inflicts 13 slashing damage. The dragon’s most devastating ability is its Poison Breath (Recharge 5–6), where it can unleash a 30-foot cone of poisonous gas, forcing affected creatures to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take substantial poison damage (42, or 12d6) and become poisoned for a minute, severely hampering their combat effectiveness.

In addition to its attacks, the Young Cave Dragon can react to nearby movements with its Ruff Spikes ability. If a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the dragon, it can use a reaction to intimidate the creature, requiring a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking piercing damage (4, or 1d8) and preventing entry into that space. Overall, the Young Cave Dragon is a diverse and formidable opponent with multiple layers of offense, defense, and battlefield control, making it a challenging adversary for groups of adventurers.
