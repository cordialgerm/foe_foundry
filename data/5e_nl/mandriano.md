The Mandriano is a large, lawful evil plant creature known for its formidable combat abilities and dark powers. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it possesses a strong mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. Its natural armor provides a decent Armor Class of 13, and it boasts 60 hit points, making it durable in battle. The Mandriano excels in grappling and draining the life force from its enemies, using its exceptional Strength score and ability to potentially turn defeated foes into undead minions. However, it is notably vulnerable to fire damage, which can exploit its weaknesses. Furthermore, its low Dexterity impacts its agility, making it relatively less effective at avoiding attacks.

The Mandriano has the following ability scores: Strength 15 (+2), Dexterity 6 (-2), Constitution 15 (+2), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 7 (-2). Its weaknesses are reflected in its poor Dexterity, which yields a very bad modifier for dexterous tasks, while its Strength and Constitution provide it with a good foundation for attack and resilience.

The creature has proficiency in athletics (+5), perception (+3), and stealth (+1), allowing it adequate capabilities to grapple opponents and perceive its surroundings. It is vulnerable to fire damage, meaning it takes double damage from fire attacks. Conversely, it has immunity to poison damage and resistance to necrotic damage as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. Additionally, it is immune to exhaustion and the poisoned condition, giving it an edge in prolonged encounters. With darkvision that allows it to see in dim light up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 13, the Mandriano is quite aware of its environment. It understands Common and Sylvan languages but lacks the ability to speak.

In terms of actions, the Mandriano can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two swipe attacks in one turn. The Swipe action serves as a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 11 slashing damage on a successful hit. If the target is Medium or smaller, they are grappled with an escape DC of 14, and remain restrained until freed. The Mandriano can grapple up to three creatures simultaneously.

Its special ability, Consume the Spark, allows it to drain the essence of any grappled target. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; failure results in a substantial 13 necrotic damage, while a successful save halves the damage. Additionally, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the Mandriano heals for that same amount. This reduction lasts until the target completes a long rest, and if the target's hit point maximum drops to 0, they die and rise as an undead servant under the Mandriano's control within 24 hours, provided their body is not destroyed and they are not resurrected. The Mandriano can command up to twelve undead simultaneously, making it a formidable foe on the battlefield.
