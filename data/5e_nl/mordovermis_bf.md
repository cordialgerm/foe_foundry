Mordovermis is a large aberration known for its eerie and otherworldly presence. With a challenge rating of 3, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. It has a solid armor class of 13, protecting it adequately in combat, and possesses 72 hit points, allowing it to withstand several attacks. Its ability to fly at 40 feet (hover) gives it exceptional mobility, though its walking speed is limited to 10 feet. Notably, the mordovermis excels in mental manipulation and crowd control through its special abilities as well as maintaining versatility in attacks thanks to its multiattack feature. However, it is sensitive to sunlight, suffering disadvantages when operating in such conditions, which can lead to strategic vulnerabilities.

The mordovermis's attributes include a Strength score of 16 (+3), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 14 (+2), Intelligence of 6 (-2), Wisdom of 14 (+2), and Charisma of 16 (+3). This results in good physical capabilities, particularly in melee combat and quick movement, while its Intelligence is notably weak, providing a very bad score for intelligence-related checks. Its Wisdom and Charisma scores, however, are very good, enhancing its perceptions and ability to influence others.

The creature has darkvision that extends 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception bonus is +2, granting an average ability to notice hidden things, and a Stealth bonus of +2 indicates an average ability to remain unnoticed. It communicates in Deep Speech and has telepathy up to 60 feet, enabling effective exchanges with other creatures of intelligences.

The mordovermis possesses several special abilities. Its Aberrant Resilience grants it resistance against the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, along with advantage on saving throws against spells or effects that alter its form, making it quite resilient against many forms of debilitation. Sinuous Form allows it to navigate through tight spaces, squeezing through openings large enough for Tiny creatures, which can be particularly useful in tight environments or during ambushes. However, it has Sunlight Sensitivity, granting it disadvantage on attack rolls and limiting its perceptual capabilities in sunlight, effectively reducing its effectiveness to below average in bright conditions.

In combat, the mordovermis can perform a Multiattack, executing two Sting attacks against a foe. Each Sting attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, making it good at landing its strikes, with a reach of 5 feet and dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage on a hit. If both attacks are successful against a Large or smaller creature, it can use its Consume ability on that creature regardless of incapacitation. 

The Consume action involves wrapping its body around an incapacitated target, requiring the target to succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw. If the target fails, they take 5 (2d4) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) acid damage, and are grappled with an escape DC of 13. On a success, the target takes half damage and is not grappled. While grappled, the target is restrained and takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the beginning of its turns until the grapple ends. This ability can devastate an opponent and leave them helpless against further attacks.

As a bonus action, the mordovermis can use its Transfixing Gaze, targeting a creature within 30 feet. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the end of its next turn, during which it becomes incapacitated and has a speed of 0. This ability can be a powerful control tool in combat, allowing the mordovermis to disable a foe temporarily.

Together, these qualities make the mordovermis a unique adversary, blending offensive and defensive capabilities with psychological manipulation, emphasizing the need for strategic planning from any adventurers who might confront it.
