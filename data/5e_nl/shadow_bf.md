The Shadow is a Medium undead creature that excels in stealth and mobility. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it serves as a subtle threat in combat, often stalking its prey from the shadows. Its strengths lie in its agility, enhanced by a high Dexterity score of +4, which enables it to move swiftly and remain unnoticed. However, its weaknesses are significant; notably, it suffers in the presence of sunlight, which hampers its abilities. Shadows are particularly dangerous due to their Strength Drain attack, which not only inflicts necrotic damage but can also diminish the strength of their victims, leading to potential death if their strength score falls to zero.

The Shadow possesses an Armor Class of 12, which provides a baseline level of defense. With 17 hit points, it can endure some damage before being taken down, but this is relatively low compared to sturdier monsters. The creature has a movement speed of 40 feet, allowing it to close distance quickly, and it can climb at 20 feet due to its Spider Climb ability, making it exceptionally mobile in various environments.

The Shadow's ability scores are:
- Strength: -2 (very bad), which means it is physically weak.
- Dexterity: +4 (very good), granting it excellent agility.
- Constitution: +1 (average), giving it decent resilience.
- Intelligence: -2 (very bad), indicating a lack of mental capability.
- Wisdom: +0 (average), suggesting standard perception and insight.
- Charisma: -1 (bad), reflecting its minimal social presence.

In terms of senses, the Shadow has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception score is 10, denoting an average ability to notice hidden objects or creatures. The Shadow excels in stealth with a Stealth score of 14 (good), making it proficient at hiding in dimly lit or dark areas. Although it understands languages it knew in life, it cannot communicate verbally.

The Shadow has several notable special abilities:
- Amorphous: It can move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, allowing it to infiltrate tight spots.
- Spider Climb: The Shadow can climb difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without needing to perform any checks, enhancing its tactical options.
- Sunlight Weakness: If exposed to sunlight, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, making it vulnerable in bright conditions.
- Undead Nature: It does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, which could be advantageous in long-term scenarios.
- Undead Resilience: It is immune to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, enhancing its durability against specific types of attacks.

In combat, the Shadow can engage with its key action:
- Strength Drain: This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it connects, it deals 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage. More importantly, the attack reduces the target's Strength score by 1d4, which can be critical for characters who rely on physical power. If a target's Strength is reduced to zero, they die, further increasing the Shadow's lethality. If a humanoid dies from this effect, it can rise again as a new Shadow after a period of 1d4 hours.

The Shadow also has two bonus actions to enhance its combat tactics:
- Shadow Bond: One creature within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become bonded with the Shadow's own shadow for 1 minute. This bond allows the Shadow to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bonded creature, enabling quick repositioning during combat as long as the creature remains within 120 feet.
- Shadow Stealth: The Shadow can take the Hide action, which is particularly effective in dim light or darkness, allowing it to stealthily evade detection and launch surprise attacks.

Overall, the Shadow is a cunning adversary that thrives in low-light conditions, making it a formidable challenge for adventurers unprepared for its ambush tactics.
