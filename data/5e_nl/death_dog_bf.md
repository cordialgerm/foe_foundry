The Death Dog is a medium-sized monstrosity with a menacing presence, characterized by its two heads and agile physique. It acts primarily as an ambush predator, utilizing its high speed and effective bite attacks in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 1, the Death Dog presents a moderate threat to adventurers. Its notable strengths include resilience against various conditions, ability to inflict disease, and the power to deafen opponents through its barking. However, its weaknesses lie in its average armor class and the potential vulnerability of its hit points, which, when diminished, leads to a quick downfall.

The Death Dog has the following attributes: Strength at +2 (average effectiveness), Dexterity at +2 (average effectiveness), Constitution at +2 (average effectiveness), Intelligence at -4 (very bad effectiveness), Wisdom at +1 (average effectiveness), and Charisma at -2 (bad effectiveness). Its armor class of 12 is average, but it has a decent pool of hit points totaling 40, allowing it to sustain some damage before falling in battle. The creature possesses darkvision with a range of 120 feet, enabling it to see in dim light and darkness as if they were bright light. Its perception score is 15, which reflects a good awareness of its surroundings, while a stealth score of 14 indicates that it can move quietly when necessary.

The Death Dog's special abilities enhance its survivability and combat effectiveness. Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it difficult to demoralize. Additionally, the Multiple Heads feature provides resistance against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and unconscious, allowing it to remain a persistent threat.

In combat, the Death Dog can make a Multiattack, allowing it to use its Bite attack twice in one turn. The Bite attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage on a successful hit (calculated as 2d4 + 2). Crucially, if the Bite attack hits a creature, that target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease that poisons it until cured. This disease can severely hinder a target's health, reducing its maximum hit points by 5 (2d4) every day until it successfully saves or rests after curing the disease. If the poison effect reduces the creature's maximum hit points to 0, it dies.

As a bonus action, the Death Dog can use its Dual Bark ability. By barking from both of its heads, it creates two 15-foot cones of sound, forcing creatures within these areas to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the creature being deafened until the end of its next turn. If the cones overlap, targets caught in the overlapping area make one save with disadvantage, complicating the threat the Death Dog poses.

Overall, the Death Dog is a formidable opponent with not only offensive capabilities but also significant defensive and debilitating attributes that can create chaos in encounters.
