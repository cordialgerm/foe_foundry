The ghast is a Medium-sized undead creature that lurks in the shadows, embodying a terrifying presence on the battlefield. With a challenge rating of 2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, especially with its paralyzing attacks and the foul stench that it emits, which can hinder and debilitate opponents. Although it has decent combat abilities, featuring strong strength and dexterity scores, the ghast also has notable weaknesses, including limited hit points and a reliance on close combat to deliver its devastating effects. Players should be cautious when engaging a ghast, as it can swiftly incapacitate numerous foes, but it remains vulnerable to radiant damage and effects that disrupt undead.

The ghast has an armor class of 13, making it relatively easy to hit but not defenseless. It possesses 36 hit points, calculated from rolling eight eight-sided dice, providing it with a modest buffer in combat. The creature moves at a speed of 30 feet, allowing for reasonable mobility. The strength and dexterity scores both stand at 16, giving it a +3 modifier for attack rolls and enhancing its effectiveness in physical confrontations, regarded as good. Its constitution score is average at 10, providing no bonus to saving throws and hit points, while intelligence, wisdom, and charisma are all scored at 10 or lower, denoting average or bad effectiveness in related skills and interactions.

The ghast exhibits notable special abilities that increase its threat level. One such ability is Stench, which activates when a creature begins its turn within five feet of the ghast. Those affected must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they become poisoned until the beginning of their next turn; if they succeed, they gain immunity to the ghast's Stench for 24 hours. This ability can force players to stay away or risk being impaired throughout the encounter.

Another ability is Turning Defiance, which gives the ghast and any nearby ghouls a significant advantage when making saving throws against effects that would turn them away. This makes the ghast resilient against certain clerical or divine magics that typically affect undead creatures. Additionally, the Undead Nature ability signifies that ghouls and ghasts do not require air, food, or sleep, enabling them to be relentless foes.

In terms of actions, the ghast has a Paralyzing Claw attack that allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit against a target within five feet. If the attack connects, the ghast inflicts 7 slashing damage and forces the target to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. A failed throw results in the target being paralyzed for 1 minute, during which it can attempt to save at the end of its turns. Success on a saving throw, or the effect naturally ending, grants immunity to the Paralyzing Claw for 24 hours, encouraging careful planning from player characters.

The ghast also has a Bite attack that can target incapacitated creatures, allowing it to make another melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. If it hits, the attack deals 8 piercing damage. This ability can prove particularly deadly in combination with the ghast's other attacks, threatening players who are already down or immobilized. Overall, the ghast is a formidable undead foe that utilizes its abilities to control the flow of battle and frustrate its enemies.
