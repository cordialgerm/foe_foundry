The Wight is a formidable Medium undead creature that embodies the typical traits of a malevolent spirit returned from the grave. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, particularly due to its ability to drain life and create servitors from fallen foes. The Wight features solid defensive capabilities with an Armor Class of 14 and 69 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage. However, it has a notable weakness in sunlight, which impairs its effectiveness in combat. With good physical attributes and a range of offensive actions, it is standout in combat scenarios, making it a challenge for lower-level parties.

The Wight possesses a Strength score of 16 (+3), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 16 (+3), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 14 (+2). Its physical attributes are generally good, with Strength and Constitution providing very good stress durability and attack power. Its Dexterity, while helpful for initiative and ranged attacks, is only average. The Wight has a good Perception score of 13, which aids in noticing hidden creatures or traps.

With darkvision of 60 feet, the Wight can see in dim light as if it were bright light, which is an advantage in shadowy conditions. It also has exceptional stealth with a Stealth score of 14, making it capable of ambushing an unsuspecting party. It understands the languages it knew in life, enabling basic interaction with intelligent adversaries or allies.

The Wight has several special abilities. The Martial Adept ability allows the Wight to deal an additional die of damage with its manufactured weapon attacks, making its strikes particularly deadly. However, the Wight suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and severely hampers its perception in direct sunlight, representing a very bad state in those conditions. The Undead Nature ability means that it does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, giving it exceptional resilience in prolonged encounters. Lastly, Undead Resilience grants it immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, making it difficult to disable through common status effects.

In combat, the Wight utilizes the Multiattack action, allowing it to strike twice with either its Longsword or Longbow, and it can substitute one of these attacks with a powerful Life Drain attack. The Life Drain is a melee spell attack that adds +5 to hit and deals 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage if successful. Not only does this damage hurt the target, but they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer a decrease in their hit point maximum equal to the damage dealt, lasting until the target finishes a long rest. This effect can lead to death if it reduces the targetâ€™s hit point maximum to zero, adding a significant strategic element in combat. Additionally, if a humanoid is slain by this attack, they rise as a zombie under the Wight's control after 24 hours, provided their body remains intact.

The Wight can use its Longsword for melee attacks, which has a +5 to hit and inflicts either 12 (2d8 + 3) or 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage when wielded with one or two hands respectively. It can also employ its Longbow for ranged attacks with a +4 to hit, inflicting 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage within a range of 150 feet, and up to 600 feet at disadvantage.

As a bonus action, the Wight can activate Command Horde, allowing it to command up to five friendly skeletons or zombies to perform various tactical maneuvers. This includes the Protect action, which enhances the defenses of nearby allies; the Overwhelm option, granting advantage on attack rolls for coordinated strikes; and the Shamble action, allowing minions to reposition themselves effectively while minimizing the risk of opportunity attacks by granting disadvantage on such attacks. This capability makes the Wight not just a dangerous foe in direct combat, but also a strategic commander on the battlefield, directing its minions to enhance their chances of victory.
