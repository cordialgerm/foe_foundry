The Great Wyrm Blue Dragon is a gargantuan creature that exemplifies the formidable power of draconic foes in Dungeons & Dragons. With an exceptionally high Armor Class of 22 and impressive Hit Points totaling 814, this dragon is a very durable opponent who can take significant punishment. Its slightly average Dexterity and high Constitution lend it durability in battle. It excels in ranged combat with a flight speed of 80 feet and lightning-based abilities that inflict severe damage. The dragon’s strengths include its devastating breath weapon, powerful melee attacks, and a host of unique abilities that allow it to manipulate the battlefield. However, its average Dexterity suggests potential weaknesses in avoiding certain attacks and spells. 

The Great Wyrm Blue Dragon has an impressive Strength score of 28, providing a +9 modifier which makes it exceptionally good at physical attacks. Its Constitution score of 26 gives it a +8 modifier, which is good for maintaining concentration on spells and surviving hits. The dragon possesses an Intelligence of 18 (+4), a Wisdom of 16 (+3), and a Charisma of 20 (+5), contributing to its moderate spellcasting abilities and exceptional presence in combat interactions. 

The Great Wyrm Blue Dragon has saving throw bonuses of +8 for Dexterity, +16 for Constitution, +11 for Wisdom, and +13 for Charisma. These values indicate good to exceptional resilience against attacks and effects that target these abilities. 

In terms of skills, the dragon has a +11 bonus for perception, +8 in stealth, and +11 in survival, demonstrating its ability to navigate and recognize threats in both combat and exploration settings. The dragon is immune to lightning damage and has senses including blindsight and tremorsense within 60 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet, making it very aware of its surroundings.

The dragon's special abilities include "Desert Farer," allowing it to move effortlessly through sandy terrains while ignoring extreme heat and difficult terrain. With "Dune Splitter," the dragon can hide within sand for up to 4 hours, gaining advantage on stealth checks and potentially blinding nearby foes when it emerges if they fail a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. The "Legendary Resistance" feature lets it succeed on failed saving throws three times per day, shedding sand-like scales when it does so. Additionally, "High Voltage" ensures that upon being bloodied, the dragon recharges its breath weapon and creates an electric field around it that punishes those who come too close.

The dragon possesses innate spellcasting capabilities, using Charisma for spellcasting which comes with a DC of 21. The spells it can cast include "blur" and "silent image," both of which provide strategic advantages without requiring any material components, and powerful spells like "blight" and "hypnotic pattern." "Control water," "mirage arcane," and "antipathy/sympathy" can affect the battlefield in significant ways, allowing the dragon to manipulate terrain and influence creatures.

In combat, the dragon can execute a "Multiattack," using a combination of a bite and claw attacks or utilizing its "Arc Lightning" attack to strike multiple foes with lightning. Its bite attack has a +17 to hit, deals substantial damage, and adds additional lightning damage on a hit. The claw attacks also carry a +17 to hit, dealing significant slashing damage. The tail attack can push opponents away, altering positioning on the battlefield. 

The "Lightning Breath" is a devastating area attack that deals a potential 94 lightning damage to creatures in its cone, severely hindering their combat ability if they fail the saving throw. The "Quake" ability allows the dragon to create tremors that can knock foes prone or partially restrain them in sand, affecting mobility and stance in combat. 

As a reaction, when an enemy hits the dragon with a melee attack, it can retaliate with a tail attack, further increasing its offensive capabilities. 

For legendary actions, the dragon can frighten foes with a mighty "Roar" that compels them to make a Charisma saving throw or become frightened for one minute; it can use "Wing Attack" to create a gust that pushes enemies away or it can enact "Quake" if it’s cost two actions. Overall, this dragon brings a mix of power and strategy to combat, making it a formidable opponent for any adventuring party.
