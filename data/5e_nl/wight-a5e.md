The Wight is a Medium undead creature typically found in dark and ominous locations. As an undead entity, it has the ability to drain the life force of its victims, thereby gaining strength and power. With an Armor Class of 15 and 45 hit points, the Wight is moderately resilient, making it a formidable foe for lower-level adventurers. Its attack abilities include both melee and ranged options, allowing it to adapt to various combat situations. However, the Wight is significantly hindered in sunlight, suffering disadvantages that may leave it vulnerable in well-lit areas. Its various resistances, including to cold and necrotic damage, further add to its defensive capabilities.

The Wight has the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2) indicating good physical power, Dexterity is also 14 (+2) showcasing its agility, Constitution is notable at 16 (+3), offering very good resilience, Intelligence is at 10 (+0), making it average in cunning, Wisdom is 12 (+1), giving it a slight edge in perception, and Charisma is 14 (+2), which is quite good for interactions related to undead abilities. 

It has the following skill proficiencies: Perception at +3, which is average, and Stealth at +4, which is good. Its damage resistances include cold, necrotic, and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, making it an effective combatant against many physical attacks. The Wight has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 13, allowing it to see in darkness and be aware of its surroundings effectively. It understands the languages it knew in life.

The Wight has several special abilities: 
- **Cold Aura:** Any creature that starts its turn grappled by the Wight, touches it, or strikes it with a melee attack within 5 feet takes 3 (1d6) cold damage, which can only occur once per turn. This ability is negated if the Wight has been affected by fire damage recently. 
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** In sunlight, the Wight experiences disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks reliant on sight, rendering it less effective in bright conditions.
- **Undead Nature:** This ability allows the Wight to not require air, food, or sleep, making it a relentless opponent.

In terms of actions, the Wight has three primary attack options:
- **Longsword:** Acts as a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage on a successful hit.
- **Seize:** Another melee weapon attack that also has a +4 to hit, dealing 3 (1d6) cold damage and grappling the target (escape DC 12). The grappled target is restrained and the Wight can only use its Life Drain attack on them until the grapple ends.
- **Longbow:** A ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a range of 150/600 feet. It deals 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage along with 3 (1d6) cold damage.

As a bonus action, the Wight can use **Life Drain:** This ability also requires a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) necrotic damage. The target then makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, their hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount of necrotic damage dealt, and this reduction persists until the target completes a long rest. Additionally, if a humanoid or beast is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, they die and rise as a zombie under the Wight's control within 24 hours.

The Wight, with its assortment of offensive and defensive capabilities, serves as a dangerous adversary, especially in dark, cold environments where its abilities can be utilized effectively.
