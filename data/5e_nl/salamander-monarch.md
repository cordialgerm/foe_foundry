The Salamander Monarch is a formidable creature within the elemental realm, embodying a blend of fire and authority. This large elemental is aligned with neutral evil, showcasing both combat prowess and powerful spellcasting abilities. With an impressive armor class of 17 and a substantial hit point pool of 161, the Salamander Monarch is a durable opponent who can endure significant damage. Its strengths lie in its high strength and dexterity, as well as its potent fire-related abilities. However, it has a vulnerability to cold damage, which can be exploited by clever adventurers. As a challenge rating 13 creature, it poses a significant threat to lower-level parties but can be managed with strategic planning.

The Salamander Monarch has the following attributes: strength 20 (+5), dexterity 18 (+4), constitution 18 (+4), intelligence 15 (+2), wisdom 14 (+2), and charisma 18 (+4). Its saving throws are particularly robust, with a +9 in Constitution and a +7 in Wisdom, categorizing them as very good. It also shows proficiency in arcana and intimidation skills, with +7 and +9 modifiers, respectively, making its interactions in social or knowledge-based scenarios average to good. This creature has damage vulnerabilities to cold, is immune to fire, and is resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. Its senses include darkvision up to 90 feet and a passive perception of 12, allowing it to remain aware of its surroundings even in darkness.

The Salamander Monarch possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The *Heated Body* ability allows any creature that touches it or strikes it in melee range to suffer 14 (4d6) fire damage, making it dangerous to engage up close. Its *Heated Weapons* ability provides an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage with any metal melee weapon it wields, which is already factored into its attacks. The *Inspiring Sovereign* ability grants advantage on melee attack rolls and saving throws to each salamander within 30 feet that can see the monarch, increasing the effectiveness of its allies significantly. Lastly, its *Innate Spellcasting* utilizes its high charisma modifier, allowing it to cast spells without material components. The spells it can cast three times per day are *flaming sphere* and *heat metal*, which can create significant area damage and inflict ongoing harm, respectively. It can also summon a fire elemental once per day with *conjure elemental*.

In terms of actions, the Salamander Monarch can perform a *Multiattack*, allowing it to strike twice in one turn with its powerful abilities. The *Tail* attack hits with a +9 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet, dealing 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage and an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage. It grapples its target, making escape particularly challenging with an escape DC of 18. The *Trident* attack also utilizes a +9 to hit, capable of being used either at a reach of five feet or at range, dealing 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage or 16 (2d10 + 5) when wielded with two hands, along with 7 (2d6) fire damage. Finally, *Immolating Crest* is a powerful area effect with a recharge of 6, forcing creatures in the vicinity to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 28 (8d6) fire damage and potentially igniting the target, which leads to additional fire damage each turn until extinguished. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield by creating zones of danger and forcing tactical repositioning from opponents.
