The Lou Carcolh is a Medium monstrosity that serves as a formidable foe in combat due to its unique abilities and deceptive tactics. With an Armor Class of 14, it can withstand significant damage, boasting 78 hit points derived from a total of 12d8 plus an additional 24. Its movement capabilities include climbing at 10 feet, swimming at 20 feet, and walking at 30 feet, making it versatile in various environments. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. While it possesses decent physical attributes, such as Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are notably lower. The Lou Carcolh excels in stealth and possesses a unique mixture of maneuvers for both offense and control in battle, but it is particularly vulnerable if its sticky tongues are targeted.

The Lou Carcolh's attributes are as follows: Strength is 15, which adds a +2 modifier, considered good for melee attacks; Dexterity is 14, also good, making it fairly agile; and Constitution is 14, providing good resilience. Its Intelligence is very low at 3, giving it a -4 modifier, which is very bad for cognitive tasks; its Wisdom is average at 10, reflecting normal perception; and its Charisma is also average at 10. The creature has skills in perception with a +2 modifier and stealth with a +6 modifier, making it quite adept at hiding.

This creature has tremorsense within a 60-foot radius, allowing it to detect nearby movement through vibrations, and a passive perception score of 12. The Lou Carcolh does not speak any languages, relying instead on its physical abilities to communicate its threats.

The Lou Carcolh boasts special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its **Sticky Tongues** allow it to extend six tongues up to 60 feet away, which can ensnare creatures. Any creature touching a tongue must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. The tongues themselves can be attacked, having an Armor Class of 12 and 10 hit points. Damage done to a tongue also affects the Lou Carcolh itself. If one of the tongues is killed, the restrained condition is lifted, and that particular tongue cannot be used for the next 24 hours.

Another ability, **Slime Trail**, can be used once per day. When activated, the Lou Carcolh leaves a trail of slime as it moves, creating difficult terrain. Any creature crossing through the slime must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. This slime remains for one hour, providing a strategic hindrance to pursuing foes.

In combat, the Lou Carcolh can make several attacks. Its primary melee attack is a **Bite**, which uses a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 11 piercing damage from 2d8 plus 2 and 2 additional poison damage from a 1d4 roll. The target must also pass a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its turn.

The creature can also **Spit Venom**, which is a ranged attack that also has a +4 to hit and a range of 30 feet to 120 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 16 poison damage (3d10).

With its **Sticky Tongue** melee attack, the Lou Carcolh can strike from a distance of 60 feet to ensnare a target, restraining them as it cannot use the same tongue on another target during that time.

Finally, the **Reel** action allows the Lou Carcolh to pull each creature of Large size or smaller that is restrained by its tongues. The creature is knocked prone and dragged up to 30 feet closer to the Lou Carcolh. If a creature gets within 5 feet, the Lou Carcolh is allowed a bonus action to make one bite attack against the dragged creature, potentially capitalizing on their vulnerability. 

Overall, the Lou Carcolh is a cunning and engaging opponent that utilizes a mix of physical attacks and special abilities to control the battlefield and threaten adventurers.
