The Void Constructor has special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The Mobile Grappler ability allows it to maintain its full movement speed while grappling a creature, enabling it to reposition while carrying adversaries. The Tainted Aura is a particularly dangerous ability, which activates when it has completed a Void henge, granting it necrotic energy. At the beginning of each of the Void Constructor's turns, any creature within 10 feet must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take 2 (1d4) necrotic damage. This ability can be tactically advantageous in group encounters. Notably, the Void Constructor can choose to exempt a creature it is grappling from this aura, showcasing its strategic options in battle.

In terms of actions, the Void Constructor can make a Multiattack, delivering two Slam attacks in one round. Each Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and deals 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage upon success. Additionally, it has a Tentacles attack, which also has a +5 to hit and can reach targets from 10 feet away. This attack deals 13 (4d4+3) bludgeoning damage and grapples the target, forcing them to escape with a DC of 13 if they wish to break free. Once grappled, the Void Constructor cannot use its tentacles on another target until the current grapple ends, emphasizing its potency in holding down single foes while potentially dealing continuous damage.
