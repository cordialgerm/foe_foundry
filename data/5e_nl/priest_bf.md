The Priest is a Medium humanoid creature that embodies a spiritual and combat-ready figure, often serving as a healer and support character in various settings. With a Challenge Rating of 2, the Priest is moderately powerful, able to both sustain allies through healing and deal respectable damage thanks to their divine powers. Their strengths lie in their high Wisdom score of +5, which enhances their spellcasting ability and perception. With 57 hit points and a decent armor class of 13 provided by a chain shirt, they can withstand a fair amount of punishment in combat. However, their weaknesses include relatively low attack modifiers, particularly for their melee attacks, along with certain vulnerabilities that come with being a humanoid. 

The Priest has the following attributes:
- Strength: +1, which is considered average, indicating they can handle physical tasks reasonably well but are not exceptional.
- Dexterity: +0, which is very bad in terms of agility, providing no benefit to their speed.
- Constitution: +1, categorized as average, granting moderate durability during physical altercations.
- Intelligence: +1, also average, suggesting some knowledge but not outstanding intellect.
- Wisdom: +5, which is exceptional, making them very perceptive and a strong spellcaster.
- Charisma: +1, considered average, which does not significantly enhance interactions with others.

The Priest has special abilities that enhance their combat effectiveness and survivability:
- **Divine Blessing:** This ability grants the Priest resistance to either necrotic or radiant damage based on their deity, allowing them to withstand specific types of damage better than others.
- **Divine Weapons:** Their weapons are infused with divine energy, adding an extra 2d6 damage of either necrotic or radiant type whenever they successfully hit an opponent. This makes their weapon attacks more potent and versatile depending on the situation.

In terms of actions during combat:
- **Multiattack:** The Priest can make two attacks in a single turn, either using their Mace or their Divine Bolt, allowing them to maintain consistent damage output.
- **Mace Attack:** This melee attack has a +3 to hit modifier, giving it a good chance to succeed against most targets. It deals 4 bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 7 damage of either necrotic or radiant, totaling a significant potential hit.
- **Divine Bolt:** This is a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, making it quite effective at range. It deals 10 necrotic or radiant damage on a hit, making it a strong option for engaging foes from a distance.

As a spellcaster, the Priest uses Wisdom for their spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 13. They can cast the following spells:
- At will, they can use **guidance** (providing a bonus to ability checks), **light** (creating a source of illumination), and **thaumaturgy** (altering minor sensory effects).
- Twice a day, they can cast **bane** (reducing enemy effectiveness), **bless** (enhancing allies' attack rolls and saving throws), and **cure wounds** (healing an ally's injuries).
- Once per day, they can cast **dispel magic** (ending spells), and **restoration** (removing ailments and restoring ability scores).

The Priest serves as a multifunctional character capable of contributing both in combat and out of it through healing, support spells, and straightforward attacks, making them a valuable addition to any party.
