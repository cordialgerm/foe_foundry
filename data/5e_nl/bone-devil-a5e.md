The Bone Devil has access to several actions during combat. Its primary attack is the "Barbed Spear," which can be used both in melee and ranged capacities. When it strikes, it has a +8 to hit with a reach of 10 feet or a range of 20/60 feet. If it successfully hits, it deals an average of 15 piercing damage (2d10 + 4) and can grapple the target if the attack is made in melee, making it difficult for the target to escape. 

The Bone Devil can also employ its "Claw" attack, which has the same +8 to hit modifier and can deal a significant 17 piercing damage (2d12 + 4) in melee. 

In addition to its standard actions, the creature can become invisible as an action, vanishing from sight along with any items it carries. However, this invisibility will end if it attacks, falls unconscious, or chooses to dispel the effect.

As a bonus action, the Bone Devil can use its "Sting" attack, which involves a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, capable of dealing 13 piercing damage (2d8 + 4) and 14 additional poison damage (4d6). If the target is hit, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they become poisoned for one minute, significantly impairing their performance in combat. The poisoned creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to attempt to shake off the effect.

The Bone Devil combines a lethal offensive presence with strategic stealth, making it a challenging and engaging adversary in any campaign.
