The Cunning Artisan Ogre is a large, neutral evil giant known for its unexpected intelligence and magical prowess, distinguishing it from typical ogres. With a significant challenge rating of 5, this creature poses a notable threat to adventurers, boasting high hit points and effective combat abilities. Its special abilities allow it to utilize magic with its weapon attacks, as well as to detect and manipulate magical items, making it a formidable opponent. However, its weaknesses lie in its limited mobility and average dexterity, which can be exploited by agile foes. The Cunning Artisan's unique combination of brute strength and cunning intelligence makes it a versatile adversary in any encounter.

The Cunning Artisan Ogre has notable ability scores: Strength is exceptionally high at 18, granting a +4 modifier, which reflects its capacity for melee combat. Constitution is also good at 17, with a +3 modifier, allowing it to absorb damage effectively. Intelligence is good at 16 with a +3 modifier, highlighting its craftiness, while Dexterity stays average at 10, with a +0 modifier, indicating that it is not particularly nimble. Wisdom is average at 12, with a +1 modifier, providing decent perception, and Charisma is good at 15, giving it a +2 modifier, which aids in interactions. 

For saving throws, the Cunning Artisan has +6 in Constitution, +6 in Intelligence, and +4 in Wisdom, making these areas strong against various types of attacks and spells. Its skill in perception is also limited, with a +1 modifier, resulting in average awareness. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, which can be advantageous in low-light conditions, and it has a passive perception score of 14.

In terms of special abilities, the Cunning Artisan has "Arcane Weapons," allowing its weapon attacks to deal an extra 1d8 force damage, providing additional damage that makes it very dangerous in combat. The "Artisanâ€™s Prowess" ability enables it to activate magic items as a bonus action instead of taking an action, allowing for more strategic combat decisions. Additionally, the "Sense Magic" ability enables the ogre to detect magic within 120 feet at will, providing tactical advantages by revealing unseen magical threats or items, functioning similarly to the detect magic spell.

In combat, the Cunning Artisan uses the "Multiattack" action to either strike twice with its battleaxes or launch three arcane bolts, which is quite versatile. The battleaxe attack has a +7 to hit and can do 13 slashing damage or 15 slashing damage when wielded with two hands, along with an additional 4 force damage from the Arcane Weapons ability. The Arcane Bolt, a ranged spell attack with +6 to hit, delivers 12 force damage at a range of 60 feet, allowing it to engage enemies from a distance.

Lastly, the "Curse Item" ability can inflict a curse on a magic item within 60 feet, forcing the wearer or carrier to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to avoid the curse. This curse lasts for one minute and can impose detrimental effects based on the cursed item's type, providing the Cunning Artisan with a way to incapacitate foes or reduce their effectiveness significantly.
