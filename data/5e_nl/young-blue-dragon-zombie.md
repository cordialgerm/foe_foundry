The Young Blue Dragon Zombie is a large undead creature that embodies a neutral evil alignment, serving as a potent adversary in combat. This formidable opponent possesses a commendable Armor Class of 18, making it difficult to hit, and boasts a considerable pool of hit points totaling 152. Its challenge rating of 10 indicates that it presents a significant threat to adventurers, while its strengths lie in its high Strength and Constitution scores, allowing it to inflict substantial damage and endure attacks. However, its low Dexterity and Intelligence scores reveal weaknesses, making it susceptible to ranged attacks and limiting its strategic capabilities in battle. Notably, the creature's abilities allow it to rise again even after sustaining fatal damage, making it a challenging foe to dispatch.

The Young Blue Dragon Zombie has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 21 (+5), which is exceptionally strong and enhances its melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 6 (-2), a very bad score that indicates slowness and vulnerability to ranged attacks.
- Constitution: 19 (+4), an exceptional score that contributes to its overall durability and hit points.
- Intelligence: 3 (-4), a very bad score reflecting its diminished cognitive abilities post-mortem. 
- Wisdom: 8 (-1), a bad score that limits its perception and awareness.
- Charisma: 5 (-3), a very bad score indicative of its poor presence and social capabilities.

Regarding saving throws, the Young Blue Dragon Zombie has the following modifiers: Dexterity +2 (average), Constitution +8 (very good), Wisdom +3 (good), and Charisma +1 (bad). It has immunity to lightning and poison damage, and it is immune to the poisoned condition, making it resilient against certain effects. The creature can sense its surroundings with blindsight up to 30 feet and has darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to operate effectively in low-light conditions. While it understands the languages it knew in life, it cannot speak.

One remarkable ability this creature has is Undead Fortitude, which grants it the chance to avoid being killed outright. If damage reduces it to 0 hit points, it can make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 5 plus the damage taken. If it succeeds, it drops to 1 hit point instead, unless the damage was radiant or from a critical hit.

In terms of actions during combat, the Young Blue Dragon Zombie employs a Multiattack ability, allowing it to make three attacks in a single turn. This includes one bite attack and two claw attacks:
- The Bite attack has a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 16 piercing damage and an additional 5 necrotic damage.
- Each Claw attack also has a +9 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 12 slashing damage on a successful hit.

In addition to its melee attacks, the Young Blue Dragon Zombie can unleash a special ability called Rotting Breath, which has a recharge mechanic and can be used on a roll of 5 or 6. This attack allows the zombie to exhale rotting breath in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature that is within this line must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 16. On a failure, they take 55 necrotic damage, but if they succeed, they take half damage. Notably, if a humanoid is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, they die and immediately rise again as a zombie under the control of the one commanding the Young Blue Dragon Zombie, adding additional threats to the battlefield.
