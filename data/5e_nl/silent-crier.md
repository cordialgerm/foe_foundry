The Silent Crier is a medium-sized neutral evil fiend that excels in psychological and area control tactics during combat. With a respectable armor class of 15 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 105, it presents a solid challenge to adventurers. Its challenge rating of 6 makes it a formidable opponent, capable of dealing significant damage while also possessing strong crowd control abilities through its unique Bell Toll action. The creature has a well-rounded set of attributes, showcasing good strength, above-average constitution, and exceptional wisdom, making it both durable and threatening in combat. However, it has a weakness in speed, only being able to walk 30 feet per turn, which may restrict its ability to reposition effectively in battle.

The Silent Crier has the following statistics: it possesses a Strength of 17, granting it a good modifier of +3, which enhances the damage dealt with physical attacks. Its Dexterity is average, sitting at 10 with a +0 modifier, indicating no significant advantage or disadvantage in agility. The Constitution score is 16 with a +3 modifier, providing it with very good resilience against physical attacks and effects that require constitution saves. Its Intelligence is average at 10 (+0), which suggests a lack of surprising tactical acumen. The creature has a Wisdom of 18, granting it an exceptional +4 modifier, making it adept at sensing threats and unusual occurrences, reflected in its perception skill of +4. Finally, it has a Charisma of 16 with a +3 modifier, indicating it can exert a strong influence in interactions where it lacks the ability to speak.

The Silent Crier has damage resistance to cold, fire, lightning, and psychic attacks, thereby absorbing a portion of damage from these sources. Additionally, it enjoys immunity to several conditions such as being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, and poisoned. Its unique sense of blindsight allows it to perceive its surroundings within a 120-foot radius, despite being blind beyond that range, giving it a passive perception of 17 that makes it difficult to surprise. It understands several languages, including Abyssal, Common, and Infernal, enhancing its capability to interact with various beings, although it cannot speak.

In terms of special abilities, the Silent Crier's "Broken Silence" ensures that its bell's significance is understood by all creatures, meaning its Bell Toll action remains effective regardless of a creatureâ€™s hearing state, making it a haunting presence on the battlefield. 

When it comes to actions, the Silent Crier can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make two Slam attacks as well as using its Bell Toll ability in one turn. The Slam attack functions as a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing an average of 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage to a single target.

The Bell Toll action is particularly threatening, producing one of four effects on its turn, with the stipulation that it cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row. The Concussive Knell causes creatures within a 20-foot radius of the Silent Crier to be stunned until the end of the Crier's next turn unless they succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The Crushing Toll unleashes a wave of thunder that deals an average of 18 (4d8) thunder damage to all creatures within the same radius, again subject to a DC 15 Constitution save for half damage. The Endless Ringing ability allows the Silent Crier to create a continuous, piercing ringing sound, requiring creatures entering a 60-foot range to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be deafened, which disrupts their ability to cast spells with verbal components. This ringing limits the Crier as it cannot move or perform other actions while it is active. Lastly, the Herald of Dread sends a chilling note that can frighten creatures within a 60-foot radius. Victims can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to resist the fear for one minute, with the option to retry at the end of each of their turns. Successfully saving makes the creature immune to this fear effect for 24 hours.

Overall, the Silent Crier is a complex adversary whose abilities can control the flow of battle, disrupt spellcasting, and instill fear in weaker-minded foes, making it a noteworthy opponent in any encounter.
