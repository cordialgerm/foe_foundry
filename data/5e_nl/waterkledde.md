The Waterkledde is a large chaotic evil fiend that embodies the destructive forces of nature with its swift waterborne capabilities, making it a formidable adversary in combat. With an impressive Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor, it boasts 123 hit points, making it quite resilient, though its challenge rating of 5 indicates that it is of moderate difficulty for adventurers. This creature excels in mobility, possessing a walking, flying, and swimming speed of 40 feet, allowing it to navigate various terrains effectively. As a fiend, it brings fear and chaos, often using its manipulative abilities to terrorize opponents.

In terms of attributes, the Waterkledde has a Strength score of 19, which provides a +4 modifier, indicating very good damage output in melee. Its Dexterity of 15 grants a +2 modifier, offering average agility and defensive capabilities. With a Constitution of 18 (+4 modifier), the Waterkledde has very good stamina, contributing to its substantial hit points. Its Intelligence is average at 10 (modifier of +0), while its Wisdom of 12 (+1) is also average, suggesting a basic awareness. Its Charisma is decent at 14 (+2), which is beneficial for its interactions and abilities, particularly its saving throw modifier of +5 for Charisma.

Regarding resistances, the Waterkledde takes reduced damage from cold and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, which enhances its survivability in battle. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 11, enabling it to see in darkness and be somewhat aware of its surroundings. It can communicate using the Common language.

The Waterkledde possesses a few special abilities. The Hold Breath ability allows it to stay submerged or hidden in water for up to 15 minutes, making it tricky to locate and eliminating the need for air while in aquatic settings.

During combat, it can execute a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. If it successfully strikes a medium or smaller creature with both Claw attacks, it can grapple that creature with its Beak, making it restrained, which increases its efficacy by allowing automatic Beak hits while it is grappling. Its Beak attack has a +7 to hit and deals 13 piercing damage, while the Claw attack also has a +7 to hit, dealing 11 slashing damage.

A notable action is the Frightening Call ability, which has a recharge mechanic (requiring a roll of 5 or 6 to activate). When it uses this ability, it emits a terrifying screech in a 30-foot cone, causing psychic damage of 22 (5d8) and instilling fear in the afflicted creatures. Those affected must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to half the damage and avoid the frightened condition, which can be repelled with additional saving throws at the end of each turn.

As a bonus action, the Waterkledde can magically Change Shape, transforming into a smaller beast or reverting to its true fiendish form. This ability retains its statistics but alters its size and speed. Importantly, its eyes remain an unnatural green regardless of form. Additionally, it has Supernatural Speed, enabling it to take a Dash or Disengage action as a bonus, enhancing its ability to maneuver quickly in combat situations. This adaptability, combined with its array of potent attacks and abilities, makes the Waterkledde a terrifying encounter for any adventuring party.
