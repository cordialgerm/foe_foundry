The Yann-An-Oed is a huge aberration known for its dual adaptability in both water and land environments. With a neutral alignment, it serves a role as a powerful aquatic predator capable of grappling and swallowing foes, while also presenting a curious challenge for adventurers through its unique abilities. The creature holds a challenge rating of 2, indicating it poses a moderate threat to parties. Its physical attributes show that it has notably good strength and constitution, allowing it to endure damage, while its intelligence and charisma are significantly below average making it less effective in social interactions or spellcasting. The Yann-An-Oed excels in its stealth capabilities, especially underwater, making it an ambush predator. Overall, it presents both an intriguing combat challenge and a unique encounter with its hooting call mechanic.

The Yann-An-Oed has an armor class of 12, which is average for its challenge rating, and possesses 47 hit points, derived from 5d12 plus a constitution modifier of +3, which provides it with good durability in combat. Its movement speed is 30 feet on land and 40 feet while swimming, granting it good mobility in aquatic environments. 

In terms of ability scores, the Yann-An-Oed has a strength of 15, granting it a +2 modifier, which is effective for physical attacks. Its dexterity is average at 11, thus it does not receive bonuses or penalties in this regard. With a constitution score of 17, it has a +3 modifier, which is very good for resisting damage and maintaining hit points. Its intelligence is low at 8, leading to a -1 modifier, making it ineffective in complex thinking tasks. A wisdom score of 14 provides it with a +2 modifier, allowing it to perceive threats effectively. Finally, its charisma at 7 results in a -2 modifier, indicating a very bad proficiency in social interactions.

The Yann-An-Oed has skills in perception (+4) and stealth (+2), showcasing its ability to sense its surroundings and move quietly, particularly advantageous while submerged. It possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, meaning it can sense creatures without needing to see them, which is exceptional in dark or murky waters. The creature has a passive perception score of 14. It can communicate in Aquan and has the ability to use telepathy within a range of 120 feet.

The special abilities of the Yann-An-Oed include being amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water without hindrance. Its underwater camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when submerged, making it a formidable ambush attacker.

In combat, the Yann-An-Oed can take several actions. Its bite, a melee weapon attack, has a +4 to hit and can deal 11 piercing damage on a successful hit, making it a solid primary attack. Additionally, it can use its tentacles to make a melee weapon attack, which also has a +4 to hit and can inflict 7 bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it can grapple them, requiring an escape DC of 12, which can hinder opponents effectively.

The swallow action allows the Yann-An-Oed to make a bite attack against a grappled creature. If successful, the creature is swallowed and blinded while taking ongoing acid damage each turn. The swallow ability introduces high stakes; if the Yann-An-Oed sustains enough damage, it may regurgitate the swallowed creature, providing opportunities for rescue.

The Hoot ability, which recharges after a short or long rest, enables the Yann-An-Oed to emit a sound that compels creatures within 120 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in those creatures mimicking the hoot, which allows the Yann-An-Oed to track them for one hour, enhancing its predatory skills.

In summary, the Yann-An-Oed is a strong aquatic opponent adept at stealth and grappling, making it an interesting creature for adventurers to contend with both in combat and through unique interactions. Its physical prowess and innate abilities make it a noteworthy challenge, particularly in its preferred environments.
