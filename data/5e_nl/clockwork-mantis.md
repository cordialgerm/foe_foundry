The Clockwork Mantis is a large construct that operates without alignment, serving as a mechanical guardian or enforcer in various settings. It boasts an impressive Armor Class of 15, indicating good defenses, and possesses 68 hit points, giving it decent durability in combat. With a walking speed of 40 feet, it is agile for its size. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 6, making it a moderate threat to adventurers, offering 2,300 experience points. Notably, the Clockwork Mantis has enhanced dexterity, allowing it to excel in stealth and perception, which makes it a formidable opponent in ambush situations. However, it has very low intelligence and charisma, reflecting its mechanical nature and lack of social interaction.

In terms of attributes, the Clockwork Mantis has a Strength score of 13, which provides a good modifier of +1 for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is exceptionally high at 19, granting a +4 modifier that significantly improves its agility and effectiveness in stealth. The Constitution score of 16 yields a good +3 modifier, boosting its resilience. It has very low intelligence at 3, leading to a -4 modifier, resulting in very bad cognitive abilities, and a very low Charisma score of 1 with a -5 modifier, indicating an utter lack of social skills. Its Wisdom score of 15 grants a good +2 modifier, enhancing its perceptive abilities.

The Clockwork Mantis is immune to several damage types, including poison and psychic damage, and it cannot be harmed by non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attacks unless made with adamantine weapons. This makes it especially resilient to common attacks in combat. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, which allows it to maintain its operational integrity regardless of most magical effects. It possesses darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and it has a passive Perception score of 15.

The special abilities of the Clockwork Mantis enhance its combat effectiveness and survivability. Its "Hobbling Strike" ability allows it to reduce the speed of a target to zero if it makes a successful opportunity attack, effectively immobilizing foes. Its "Immutable Form" grants it immunity to spells or effects that would change its physical form, ensuring it remains unchanged during battles. The "Magic Resistance" ability provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells, making it more difficult to affect through magical means. Additionally, the "Standing Leap" ability allows it to jump impressive distances, up to 20 feet in a long jump and 10 feet in a high jump, even without a running start.

When it comes to actions in combat, the Clockwork Mantis can perform a "Multiattack," enabling it to make two serrated blade attacks against a target. If both attacks land, it can make a bite attack as a bonus action against another target within reach. The "Serrated Blade" is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, reaching 5 feet, and dealing an average of 11 slashing damage upon a successful hit. The "Bite" attack also has a +7 to hit and deals higher average damage of 13 piercing damage. Finally, it can turn invisible until it attacks or its concentration ends, causing it to become impaired in terms of visibility but maintaining effectiveness in combat due to its surprise potential. Any items it carries or wears also become invisible, enhancing its stealth capabilities.
