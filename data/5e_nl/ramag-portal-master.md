The Ramag Portal Master is a medium neutral humanoid and a formidable spellcaster whose abilities are centered around manipulation of space and magic. With a challenge rating of 5, it serves as a mid-level adversary capable of both dealing significant damage and controlling the battlefield. Its strengths include its impressive spellcasting capabilities, particularly in crowd control and area denial, as well as its natural resistance to magic. However, its moderate armor class of 12, which can be increased to 15 with the use of mage armor, makes it somewhat vulnerable to physical attacks, particularly if caught off-guard. The Ramagâ€™s intelligence and magical prowess make it a cunning opponent, one that can outmaneuver and outwit adventurers trying to close the distance.

The Ramag Portal Master has an armor class of 12, rising to 15 with mage armor, which provides a good level of protection, making it slightly below average compared to other creatures of similar challenge ratings. It has 71 hit points, equivalent to an average durability for its level, calculated from 13d8+13. The Ramag's speed is a normal walking speed of 30 feet. The creature's attributes include a strength score of 10, which is average and indicates no particular advantage in melee combat, while its dexterity of 14 gives it a good level of agility. Its constitution of 12 is slightly below average, while its intelligence is exceptional at 18, allowing for powerful spellcasting. It has wisdom and charisma scores of 12 and 13, respectively, both of which are average, making it competent but not exceptional in those areas.

The Ramag possesses several unique abilities. Magic Resistance provides it with an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very good at resisting magical assaults. As a 7th-level spellcaster, it can cast spells with a spell save DC of 15 and has a spell attack bonus of +7, which is considered good. The Ramag has access to a range of spells including cantrips such as fire bolt, light, prestidigitation, and shocking grasp, and various prepared spells, such as burning hands, which creates a cone of fire, and magic missile, which automatically hits its target. Its 2nd-level spells include hold person, which could paralyze enemies, and misty step for quick teleportation. When it reaches 3rd-level spells, it can cast powerful spells like fireball, which deals damage in a significant area, and counterspell to negate opposing spellcasters. At 4th level, it can use banishment, which can send a creature to a different plane of existence.

In its actions, the Ramag can make two lightning stroke attacks, demonstrating good consistency in damage output. The Gate Seal allows it to deal moderate melee damage while also inflicting substantial force damage and providing effective control with a chance to lock the target down. The Lightning Stroke ranged attack is particularly powerful, capable of dealing 14 (4d6) lightning damage and preventing the target from taking reactions until the start of the Ramag's next turn, serving as a tactical advantage in combat. 

The Ramag also possesses the Dimensional Seal ability, which it recharges after a short or long rest. This power hinders teleportation and planar travel within a 60-foot radius, forcing creatures attempting to teleport to succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or have their attempts fail. This ability significantly influences battlefield strategy, as it can negate many escape mechanisms and conjuration spells for its opponents. Additionally, the Weave Dimensions ability allows the Ramag to create two magical gateways that facilitate movement between them, enhancing mobility and tactics for both itself and allies. These gateways last for 1 minute unless concentration is broken, allowing for rapid repositioning of characters in combat. Overall, the Ramag Portal Master is a versatile and strategic foe that requires careful tactics from adventurers to overcome its various advantages.
