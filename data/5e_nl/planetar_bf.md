Its Angelic Senses ability allows it to detect Aberrations, Celestials, Fiends, and Undead within 30 feet, providing insights into nearby threats. Another notable feature is Angelic Weapons, which makes the Planetar's weapon attacks magical and adds an additional 7d8 radiant damage on a hit, significantly enhancing its offensive capabilities. Divine Awareness gives the Planetar the ability to discern lies, which can be pivotal in negotiation or combat tactics.

For actions, the Planetar can employ a Multiattack option, which allows it to perform two Greatsword attacks or three Radiant Bolt attacks in a single turn while also using Spellcasting. The Greatsword attack is a melee weapon attack with a +12 to hit and a damage output of 21 slashing damage plus the extra 31 radiant damage, making it highly dangerous in close quarters.

Healing Touch, usable four times a day, allows the Planetar to restore 30 hit points to another creature and remove conditions like curses and poisons, making it an invaluable support ability. 

The Planetar can also cast spells without needing material components, using its Charisma as the spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 19. It can cast at will spells like Command and Invisibility (on itself only) and has the ability to cast Daylight and Raise Dead three times per day each. These spells provide tactical options for various scenarios, from combat to healing the fallen, enhancing the Planetar's versatility in battle.
