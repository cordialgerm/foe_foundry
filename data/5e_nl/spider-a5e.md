The Spider is a tiny beast that serves as a common and minor threat in the realms of Dungeons & Dragons. Although its challenge rating is low, indicating that it poses little danger to experienced adventurers, the Spider's agility and stealth make it an effective ambush predator in the right environment. Its ability to climb surfaces easily and to sense creatures in contact with its webs adds a layer of tactical advantage in encounters. However, with only 1 hit point and very low physical abilities, it is easily defeated. In combat, the Spider's primary strength lies in its stealth and the potential for a surprise attack, although its low damage output limits its effectiveness against stronger foes.

In terms of attributes, the Spider possesses a Strength of 2, resulting in a very bad modifier of -4, making it physically weak. Its Dexterity is 14, allowing for a good modifier of +2, which enhances its nimbleness and ability to avoid attacks. The Constitution score is 8, translating to a bad modifier of -1, meaning it has poor resilience. It has an Intelligence of 1, which is exceptionally low, resulting in a -5 modifier that signifies a complete lack of cognitive ability. Its Wisdom is average at 10, with no modifier, and its Charisma is 2, also with a very bad modifier of -4.

The Spider has proficiency in stealth, giving it a total skill value of +4 in that area, marking it as fairly good at moving unnoticed. It also has darkvision up to 30 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, which increases its chances of ambushing prey at night or in dark places. Its passive Perception is 10, which is average, meaning it can notice things that are typical for a creature of its size.

Among the special abilities, the Spider has Spider Climb, which allows it to move on difficult or vertical surfaces, including climbing upside down on ceilings. This ability enables the Spider to navigate terrain in ways that many other creatures cannot, making it a versatile hunter in various environments. Web Sense grants the Spider the ability to know the location of any creature touching a web it is in contact with, providing tactical awareness during encounters. Lastly, Web Walker means that the Spider is completely unaffected by the movement restrictions that webs impose on other creatures, allowing it to move freely while others may be hindered.

For actions, the Spider's Bite is its primary attack, executed as a melee weapon attack against a target with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 1 piercing damage. Additionally, the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw; if they fail this saving throw, they take an additional 2 poison damage, rolled from 1d4. This damage is notable for a creature of its level, but ultimately, with its low health, the Spider's survivability may not be sufficient in the face of tougher adversaries.
