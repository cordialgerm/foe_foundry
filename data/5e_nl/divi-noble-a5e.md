The Divi Noble is a formidable Large Elemental creature, embodying the raw and unyielding power of earth. Its high Armor Class of 18 and significant Hit Points totaling 345 make it a tough opponent in combat, allowing it to endure significant damage. With a Challenge Rating of 11, it is suitable for mid-level adventurers who may find themselves challenged by its unique capabilities. The Divi Noble possesses an impressive Strength score of 22, making its physical attacks particularly devastating, while its Constitution score of 22 further enhances its resilience. However, it suffers from very low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, limiting its interaction capabilities and utility in social situations. Overall, the Divi Noble is a powerhouse in melee combat and terrain control, particularly in environments featuring earth or stone.

The Divi Noble has the following attributes:

- Strength: 22 (+6) - This is an exceptional score, giving the Divi a significant advantage in physical combat.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1) - This is an average score, providing modest agility that may be enough for certain basic maneuvers.
- Constitution: 22 (+6) - This is an exceptional score, contributing to its high hit points and durability.
- Intelligence: 5 (-3) - This is a very bad score, resulting in severe drawbacks in any intelligence-based checks.
- Wisdom: 6 (-2) - This is a very bad score as well, limiting its perception and insight into situations.
- Charisma: 6 (-2) - This is similarly a very bad score, affecting any attempts at social interaction or influence.

The Divi Noble's saving throws highlight its strengths: it has a +10 modifier to Strength and Constitution saves, providing very good chances to resist physical and physiological effects. It also has a +6 bonus to Wisdom and Charisma saves, which is good, but its low base scores hinder its effectiveness in mental duels. Additionally, it has a +5 Intelligence saving throw, which is average.

In terms of skills, the Divi Noble excels particularly in athletics with a +10 modifier, demonstrating very good physical prowess. It has a +6 to perception, which is also good, allowing it to be aware of its surroundings, supported by its darkvision up to 120 feet and tremorsense up to 30 feet.

Regarding its special abilities, the Divi Noble has:

- **Earth Glide**: This ability allows the Divi to burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without leaving any trace, offering it an advantage in maneuvering through hidden tunnels or avoiding detection.
- **Innate Spellcasting**: The Divi can use its Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 14, allowing it to cast several spells without requiring material components. Its spells include:
  - At will: **alter self** (which enables it to assume Medium or Large sizes), **detect magic**, **stone shape**.
  - Three times a day: **creation**, **move earth**, **passwall**, **tongues** (which aids in communication).
  - Once a day: **conjure elemental** (only able to summon an earth elemental) and **plane shift** to the Elemental Plane of Earth.

In terms of actions, the Divi Noble can perform the following:

- **Multiattack**: It can make two melee attacks during its turn.
- **Crushing Hand**: This attack allows the Divi to make a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it inflicts 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage and grapples the target, making it difficult for that target to breathe unless they escape the grapple, which has a DC of 18. While grappling, the Divi has advantage on further Crushing Hand attacks against that target.
- **Stone Club**: This melee weapon attack has a +10 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 24 (4d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit.
- **Quake**: This ability requires a recharge of 5-6 and causes deafening rumblings while shaking the ground in a 10-foot radius around a chosen point within 90 feet. This creates difficult terrain and forces each non-elemental creature in the area to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, suffering 24 (7d6) thunder damage if they fail, and falling prone. Success results in halved damage.

Lastly, the Divi Noble has a bonus action that is:

- **Stone Wall (1/Day)**: This ability allows the Divi to create a permanent stone wall from an earth or stone surface within 60 feet, measuring 6 inches thick, up to 20 feet high and 30 feet long. If it is placed in a creature's space, that creature can choose which side of the wall to move to. Each 10-foot by 10-foot section of the wall acts as an object with an AC of 18 and 30 hit points, providing strategic options for control and defense.
