The special abilities of the Ravenfolk Doom Croaker enhance its combat and support roles significantly. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it difficult for casters to incapacitate it. With Mimicry, it can imitate animal sounds and humanoid voices, adding a layer of versatility in social situations, though listeners can discern the imitations with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature's Rune-Powered Weapons allow any weapon attack to deal additional 2d8 radiant damage, making its attacks not only powerful but also magical.

In combat, the Ravenfolk Doom Croaker can utilize its Multiattack to either make one Peck attack and one Runestaff attack or two Rune Blast attacks. The Peck attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit that deals 7 piercing damage plus 9 radiant damage. The Runestaff attack also has a +5 to hit, dealing 6 bludgeoning damage and an additional 9 radiant damage. Its Rune Blast is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 120 feet, inflicting a substantial 17 radiant damage.

The special actions include Ghost Wings, where the Doom Croaker can create phantasmal wings that force creatures within 5 feet to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded until the start of their next turn. Prophetic Magic allows the Doom Croaker to cast the augury spell and the thaumaturgy cantrip at will, utilizing Wisdom as the spellcasting ability without requiring material components. 

Finally, the Prophetic Caw action has a recharge time of 6 turns, in which the Doom Croaker can caw a prophecy that affects nearby creatures within 30 feet. Affected creatures must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, with ravenfolk receiving advantage. On a failure, they hear a dire prophecy, becoming frightened for 1 minute; on a success, they hear a positive prophecy, gaining advantage on their first attack roll each turn for the same duration. Frightened creatures may repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to try to overcome the effect. This complex interplay of abilities makes the Ravenfolk Doom Croaker a dynamic creature to encounter in any campaign.
