The Harpy is a Medium monstrosity known for its alluring songs and dual assaults in combat. With an Armor Class of 13 and Hit Points totaling 38, it possesses moderate durability in battle but is primarily designed for agility, boasting a flying speed of 40 feet and a ground speed of 20 feet. As a Challenge Rating 1 creature, the Harpy presents a moderate threat to adventurers. Its attributes reflect a balance between dexterity and strength, with a decent +3 modifier in Dexterity, which contributes to its agility and ability to evade attacks, rated as good. The Harpy is particularly notable for its ability to charm opponents, making it a cunning foe that can manipulate the tides of battle. However, its weaknesses include a low Intelligence score of -2, denoting very bad reasoning skills, which limits its strategic capabilities outside combat.

In terms of attributes, the Harpy has the following scores: Strength of 12 (+1, which is average), Dexterity of 16 (+3, good), Constitution of 12 (+1, average), Intelligence of 8 (-2, very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0, average), and Charisma of 12 (+1, average). With a darkvision range of 120 feet, the Harpy can effectively see in darkness, enhancing its stealth, which has a modifier of +3, classified as good.

Special abilities include "Monstrosity Resilience," granting the Harpy resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, allowing it to sustain its performance in prolonged encounters and avoid panic effects.

In action economy, the Harpy has a "Multiattack" ability, enabling it to make two attacks in one turn, either Claw or Screech. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit that can deal 8 slashing damage (2d4 + 3), which is effective against softer targets. The Screech is a ranged spell attack that targets one enemy within 30/120 feet, also scoring a +4 to hit and dealing 8 thunder damage (2d6 + 1). 

The Harpy can also use its "Luring Song" as a bonus action. This magical melody influences all Humanoids and Giants within 300 feet who can hear the song, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 11. If they fail, they become charmed until the song ends. The Harpy must spend subsequent turns as a bonus action to continue singing, but can stop at any point, and the effect ceases if the Harpy becomes incapacitated. This ability is particularly powerful as it can incapacitate foes, allowing the Harpy and its allies to seize control of the encounter.
