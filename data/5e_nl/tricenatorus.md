The Tricenatorus is a formidable Huge Monstrosity that poses a significant threat in combat due to its high hit points and strong melee capabilities. With an Armor Class of 15 and a total of 184 hit points, it is well-equipped to withstand damage while delivering devastating attacks. The creature excels in physical confrontations, utilizing its powerful attacks and gaining advantages over weakened foes. It has impressive Strength and Constitution scores, with a Strength of 26 (+8, considered exceptional) and a Constitution of 20 (+5, very good), making it a powerhouse on the battlefield. Its Intelligence, Charisma, and Dexterity are below average, with Dexterity at 10 (+0), which presents opportunities for ranged attackers but doesn't significantly hinder its performance in melee. The Tricenatorus has access to several powerful abilities that enhance its offensive capabilities, but it lacks any spells or language comprehension, emphasizing its brutal, physical nature. 

The Tricenatorus has a Challenge Rating of 13, indicating it can provide substantial experience points when defeated, and is suitable for a party of high-level adventurers. It resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, making it more challenging for conventional melee fighters and reinforcing its role as a tough adversary against physical assaults.

In terms of special abilities, the Tricenatorus possesses Blood Frenzy, granting it an advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that is not at full health. This ability allows it to target weakened enemies more effectively, reinforcing its aggressive combat style. Its Relentless trait enables the Tricenatorus to remain standing when it would otherwise be knocked unconscious, as long as it takes 40 damage or less. Instead of falling to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point, allowing it to continue fighting effectively even in dire situations. The Siege Monster trait allows it to deal double damage to structures and objects, making it a significant threat in any environment where destruction is a valid tactic. Finally, Tail Spike Regrowth allows it to use tail spikes in combat (it has 24 available), which regenerate after a long rest, providing it with consistent ranged options.

The Tricenatorus uses Multiattack to take two offensive actions during its turn, whether with its bite and gore attacks or utilizing two tail spikes. The Bite attack hits with a +12 modifier and can deal significant piercing damage of 34 (4d12 + 8). If the target is Medium or smaller, it grapples them, imposing an escape DC of 18, thus restraining them until the grapple is broken. The Gore attack also uses a +12 modifier and extends its reach to 10 feet, dealing 26 (4d8 + 8) piercing damage while potentially knocking the target prone if they fail a DC 18 Strength saving throw. The Tail Spike attack serves as a ranged option, also with a +12 modifier, able to reach targets up to 150 feet away and dealing 26 (4d8 + 8) piercing damage upon a successful hit. Overall, the Tricenatorus is a terrifying presence on the battlefield, combining impressive durability with powerful melee and ranged capabilities.
