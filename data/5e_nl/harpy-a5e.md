The Harpy is a Medium-sized monstrosity known for its alluring and dangerous presence. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly through its ability to charm and manipulate enemies. Although its physical attributes are average, its strength lies in its Luring Song ability, which can incapacitate foes, rendering them vulnerable to its attacks. However, the Harpy is relatively fragile, with only 38 hit points and an armor class of 11, making it susceptible to damage if enemies can successfully save against its charms or if they can close the distance and engage in combat. 

The Harpy has decent attributes, with a strength of 12 (+1), dexterity of 12 (+1), constitution of 12 (+1), intelligence of 10 (+0), wisdom of 10 (+0), and a charisma of 14 (+2). The Harpy's saving throw modifier for Wisdom is +2, which is considered average, meaning it can withstand some mental effects, but it is not exceptionally resilient. Its skills and senses are limited, with passive perception resting at 10, indicating average awareness. The Harpy can speak Common, which allows it to communicate with adventurers.

In combat, the Harpy can use its Multiattack ability to strike twice with its claws. Each claw attack has a +3 to hit, which is average, and can reach targets within 5 feet, dealing 4 (1d6 + 1) slashing damage. While this attack can be a nuisance, it will likely be overshadowed by its more potent Luring Song ability.

The Luring Song is a powerful bonus action that allows the Harpy to sing a magical tune. Any humanoid or giant within 300 feet who can hear this song must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails, it becomes charmed by the Harpy and is incapacitated, meaning it cannot take actions or reactions. Charmed creatures are compelled to move directly toward the Harpy, which can create a dangerous or distracting situation for the party. The charm lasts as long as the Harpy continues to sing and can recur every turn if the victim is not damaged. The creature can attempt its saving throw again whenever it takes damage or faces environmental hazards like lava. Success on the saving throw or ending of the charm effect grants immunity to future songs from that Harpy for 24 hours, allowing players to strategically handle their approach to this creature.
