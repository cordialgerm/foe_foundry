The Young Spinosaurus is a formidable creature in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, categorized as a Huge Beast that remains unaligned. With a challenge rating of 5, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, boasting robust stats with high strength and constitution. The creature's natural armor grants it a good armor class of 14, complemented by impressive hit points totaling 105, which translates to a solid durability in combat. While its intelligence and charisma are very low, its physical prowess, especially its strength, makes it an imposing force. A key characteristic is its non-aggressive stance towards reptilian humanoids, making it a potentially valuable ally if handled correctly. However, it also has a limited speed of 30 feet for a creature of its size, which may play a factor in mobility during encounters.

The Young Spinosaurus has the following attributes: Strength is 21, providing it with a very good attack potential; Dexterity is 11, rendering it average in agility; Constitution is 19, which offers exceptional resilience; Intelligence is 2, indicating very bad cognitive abilities; Wisdom is 11, making it average in perception and instinct; and Charisma is 8, suggesting bad social interaction potential.

In terms of special abilities, the Young Spinosaurus can hold its breath for an hour, allowing it to remain submerged for extended periods without the need for air. Additionally, it possesses a unique trait called Reptilian Affinity, meaning it will avoid engaging reptilian humanoids unless provoked. If forced to attack such creatures through magic, it suffers disadvantage on its attack rolls against them, although this trait can be overridden if directed by a rider or tamer.

During combat, the Young Spinosaurus can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make one Bite attack and one Claw attack in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage on a successful hit. If the target is Medium or smaller, it becomes grappled, requiring an escape DC of 15. The grappled target is restrained, preventing any movement until the grapple ends, which can make the spinosaurus very effective against smaller foes. The Claw attack also receives a +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage. Given these capabilities, the Young Spinosaurus serves as a powerful adversary in the wilds or as a potential companion for those able to communicate and bond with it appropriately.
