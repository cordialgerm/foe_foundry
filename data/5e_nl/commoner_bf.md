The Commoner is a basic humanoid creature representing the unremarkable citizenry of a fantasy setting. With a challenge rating of 0, it is not built for combat or special abilities, making it a low-threat opponent. Its strengths lie in its sheer numbers, especially when it can coordinate with other commoners for a surprise attack through its Angry Mob ability. Despite its lack of individual prowess, when rallied together, commoners can become surprisingly effective against a single target. They are not likely to be durable in combat, with limited hit points and subpar defenses.

The Commoner has an Armor Class of 10, indicating it is easy to hit. It possesses 8 hit points, making it very fragile and easily defeated in combat. The Commoner has a movement speed of 30 feet, which is average for humanoids. The creature has no additional traits or special senses beyond standard human capabilities, with a Perception score of 10 and a Stealth score of 10, both of which are average. It can speak any one language, commonly Common, which might make it relatable in social interactions.

The Commoner's ability scores include Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, all of which are +0. This reflects that it is an average humanoid without any particular physical or mental advantages, categorizing its overall effectiveness in dire terms, mostly very bad.

The Commoner’s actions are simplistic. The Club is a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit, allowing it to involve itself in close-range combat. On a successful hit, it deals 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, which is minimal and represents a very weak offensive capability. Similarly, the Sling allows for ranged attacks at +2 to hit against targets up to 120 feet away, again dealing 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. This capability reinforces the notion that commoners rely on numbers rather than strength.

The most notable special ability of the Commoner is Angry Mob, which can be used once per day. This ability allows the Commoner to move towards a visible creature, provoking reactions from friendly commoners within 30 feet to join in the attack. Each of these participants can also move half their speed toward the target without provoking opportunity attacks. If the initial Commoner ends within 5 feet of the target, that target must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, and for every additional Commoner joining the mob and within 10 feet of the target, the damage increases by 1. This ability can create a chaotic group assault and can potentially escalate damage as more commoners join in, although they cannot reuse this ability until they complete a short or long rest.
