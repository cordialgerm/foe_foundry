Xecha is a medium-sized fiend of chaotic evil disposition, marked by its versatility in combat and deceptive abilities. With a solid armor class of 15, it can withstand considerable damage, bolstered by its impressive 133 hit points, which makes it durable in encounters. The creature's overall challenge rating of 6 suggests it is a formidable opponent, especially for parties that are not adequately prepared. One of Xecha's notable strengths lies in its ability to manipulate its form and environments, making it difficult to pin down or predict. However, its tendency to rely on clever tactics, rather than pure strength, means it can struggle against opponents who can foresee its deceptions.

Xecha possesses a noteworthy set of attributes: a strength of 12, which translates to an average modifier, making it reasonably capable in physical confrontations. Its dexterity is at 17, granting a good modifier of +3, which enhances its agility and reflexes. With an exceptional constitution score of 20, it benefits from a +5 modifier, showcasing its resilience against physical and magical assaults. Intelligence is fairly average at 11 with a +0 modifier, while its wisdom stands at a good 14 (+2) and charisma at 16 (+3), further enhancing its abilities to deceive and manipulate situations. 

In terms of saving throws, Xecha excels with a Dexterity save of +6, a Wisdom save of +5, and a Charisma save of +6, which all demonstrate its good ability to resist various effects. The creature possesses skills in perception at a level of +2, which might provide it an edge in detecting hidden foes. Xecha is immune to damage from acid and poison, as well as conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or frightened, showcasing its resilience. It has blindsight that extends to 120 feet, allowing it to sense its environment in total darkness, and is capable of communicating using Abyssal, Common, and Infernal languages, as well as telepathy.

Xecha has several special abilities that enhance its survivability and adaptiveness in combat. The Amorphous ability allows it to squeeze through narrow spaces without being hindered, leaving its equipment behind, which can enable strategic movements in tight environments. The Assume the Dead ability allows Xecha to inhabit the corpse of a recently deceased creature, impersonating it for a period of up to 2d4 days. However, should it take 15 or more damage in a single turn while inside the body, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) or be ejected, causing the body to decay. This ability allows Xecha to manipulate situations by pretending to be another creature. Its Magic Resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it a challenging foe for spellcasters. Finally, the Transparent ability allows it to remain undetected unless opponents succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check, which can provide ample opportunities to ambush or surprise unsuspecting foes.

In terms of actions, Xecha can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike with two Pseudopod attacks or three Slams in a single turn. The Pseudopod attack, in its true form, has a +6 to hit, dealing an average of 13 bludgeoning damage in addition to 7 acid damage. The Slam attack also has a +6 to hit, inflicting an average of 12 bludgeoning damage, which makes it a reliable physical attack option. Additionally, it has a powerful special attack called Sensory Overload, which requires recharge on rolls of 5 or 6. This move unleashes a psychic pulse that deals an average of 24 psychic damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius that are not constructs or undead. It also blinds and deafens these creatures until the end of their next turn, unless they succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw, which can significantly hinder opponentsâ€™ capabilities during combat.
