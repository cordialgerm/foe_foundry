The Lizardfolk is a medium humanoid creature renowned for its resilience and aquatic adaptability. With an armor class of 14 and a modest pool of hit points totaling 22, this creature is capable of sustaining itself in combat while delivering formidable attacks. Its strengths lie in its physical abilities, particularly its strength score of 14, which translates to a good modifier of +2, allowing it to deal consistent damage. However, its low charisma score of 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, indicates that it is not skilled in social interactions or magical influences. The Lizardfolk excels in survival and stealth, making it well-suited for ambush tactics and navigating its natural environments.

The Lizardfolk possesses the following attributes: strength at 14 (+2), dexterity at 12 (+1), constitution at 12 (+1), intelligence at 10 (+0), wisdom at 10 (+0), and charisma at 8 (-1). These scores blend strengths and weaknesses, with a particularly high strength allowing for effective physical attacks, while its average mental scores imply limited capacity for complex problem-solving or social maneuvering.

In terms of abilities, the Lizardfolk's special ability, "Hold Breath," allows it to remain submerged underwater for up to 15 minutes. This ability is particularly useful in aquatic environments, enabling the Lizardfolk to ambush foes or evade detection.

In combat, the Lizardfolk can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike with both a club and a shield. Its main attack option is the "Bite," which has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 5 piercing damage on a hit. If the attack is made with advantage, it deals 9 piercing damage, enhancing the creature's lethality. Additionally, the Lizardfolk can employ a "Club" or "Shield," both of which are melee weapon attacks that deal 4 bludgeoning damage on a hit. For ranged options, the Lizardfolk can throw a "Javelin," which also has a +4 to hit and can be used effectively at distances up to 120 feet, adding versatility to its attack strategy.

Overall, the Lizardfolk is a physically capable combatant adept at utilizing both melee and ranged attacks while benefiting from its natural adaptation to environments where stealth and survival are key.
