The Deep One Priest is a formidable medium humanoid creature characterized by its chaotic evil alignment. Known for its aquatic origins, this priest embodies a mix of both charm and menace, adept at manipulating and overpowering its foes. With a robust constitution and a high strength rating, it excels in melee combat, while its spellcasting abilities provide it with strategic options in various encounters. However, it is vulnerable to fire damage, which can exploit its weaknesses in combat. As a creature capable of fascinating listeners and altering their memories, it presents a unique challenge in both social interactions and conflict situations.

The Deep One Priest has an Armor Class of 14, primarily due to its natural armor. It possesses 105 hit points, which gives it a significant amount of durability during encounters, calculated from 14d8 plus a constitution modifier of +3. The creature has a movement speed of 30 feet and a Challenge Rating of 4, indicating that it is a moderately dangerous opponent, typically yielding 1,100 experience points when defeated. 

The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 16 (+3). This allows the Deep One Priest to excel in physical confrontations, demonstrated by its good Athletics skill modifier of +6 and decent skill in Deception at +5. It also has a passive Perception of 13, making it average at noticing hidden threats.

The Deep One Priest has specific saving throw bonuses, with a +5 in Constitution, +3 in Wisdom, and +5 in Charisma, making it strong against various effects targeting these abilities. The priest is particularly vulnerable to fire damage but is resistant to cold damage, providing it some protection against specific elemental attacks. It has the ability to see in the dark up to 120 feet.

One of its notable special abilities is Amphibious, allowing it to breathe both water and air, which contributes to its versatility in aquatic adventures. The Frenzied Rage ability allows the Deep One Priest to gain advantage on melee attack rolls and a +4 bonus to damage rolls until the end of its next turn if it takes significant damage from an attack. Finally, with the Voice of the Deeps, it can entrall listeners for a duration, potentially making them forget events or manipulating their perception for a short time.

In combat, the Deep One Priest can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike with a Claws attack and a Jolting Touch attack in a single turn. The Claws attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing an average of 13 slashing damage on a successful hit, while the Jolting Touch is a melee spell attack with a +5 to hit that deals 10 lightning damage and reduces the target's speed by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

As for its spellcasting capabilities, the Deep One Priest has access to several spells. It can cast Guidance and Thaumaturgy at will, allowing it to provide assistance in various situations or create minor magical effects. It can cast Command and Sleep three times per day each, the former enabling it to compel a single target to follow a command, while the latter can incapacitate creatures by inducing sleep. It has the ability to cast Spirit Guardians once per day, which summons spectral allies to protect it and deal damage to any foes within range, adding to its prowess in controlling the battlefield. The Deep One Priest's spellcasting ability uses Charisma with a spell save DC of 13, indicating a modest effectiveness in preventing others from resisting its spells.
