The Angatra is a Medium-sized undead creature embodying a neutral evil alignment. It possesses a notable blend of speed and resilience, with an effective armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and substantial hit points totaling 85. This monster is particularly dangerous due to its ability to incapacitate foes with its painful attacks, making it a formidable opponent in combat. While it has some weaknesses, particularly to magical weaponry, it compensates with remarkable agility and powerful abilities that target the vulnerabilities of its enemies. The Angatra commands a challenge rating of 6, reflecting its proficiency in combat and its potential to overwhelm unprepared adventurers.

The Angatra has the following attributes: Strength of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 20 (+5), Constitution of 18 (+4), Intelligence of 8 (-1), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 15 (+2). Its high Dexterity indicates exceptional speed and evasiveness, contributing to a good overall initiative and making it difficult to hit. The Constitution shows it can withstand damage well, while its Charisma allows it to exert a certain degree of influence in encounters. Its Intelligence is below average, meaning it isn't strategic or cunning, but it compensates with powerful skills. The Angatra has proficiency in Perception (+4) and Stealth (+8), giving it good capabilities for both observation and remaining hidden. It is immune to poison damage and resistant to necrotic damage as well as to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Additionally, it cannot be affected by conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, or poisoned. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 14, allowing it to see in dim light and detect hidden creatures effectively.

The Angatra possesses several special abilities that enhance its danger. With the Agonizing Gaze ability, it can target any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet, forcing them to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw if the Angatra can see them. A failed save diminishes the target’s pain threshold, rendering them vulnerable to all damage types until the end of their next turn, significantly increasing the potential damage from subsequent attacks. Ancestral Wrath allows the Angatra to identify descendants of its tribe, granting it advantage on attack rolls against them while imposing disadvantage on their saving throws against its abilities. This makes it particularly lethal in combat against its kin. Additionally, the Undead Nature ability means the Angatra has no need for air, food, drink, or sleep, enabling it to endure on the battlefield without the normal biological constraints.

In terms of combat actions, the Angatra can make a Multiattack, allowing it to strike twice with its Claw attacks. The Claw attack itself is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, the attack inflicts 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. Furthermore, the target of this attack must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed due to the intense pain until the end of its next turn, making it a dangerous opponent that can quickly incapacitate multiple foes in a single turn.
