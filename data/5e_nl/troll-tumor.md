The Tumor Troll is a large chaotic evil giant characterized by its horrifying regenerative abilities and the chaos brought about by its unique teratomas. With a high number of hit points, it stands as a formidable adversary in battle, proving difficult to defeat unless targeted effectively with fire or acid. Its strength and vitality make it dangerous, while its low dexterity and intelligence present opportunities for smarter combat strategies. This creature thrives in chaotic encounters, constantly adapting through its unpredictable special abilities, which can significantly alter the dynamics of a fight.

The Tumor Troll has an Armor Class of 13, represented by its natural armor. It possesses 125 hit points, calculated from rolling 10d10 and adding 70, which indicates a very good capacity for sustaining damage in combat. Its speed is 30 feet, allowing it to move through the battlefield at a good pace. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 6, rewarding 2,300 experience points upon defeat.

Its ability scores are as follows: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 7 (-2), Constitution 24 (+7), Intelligence 5 (-3), Wisdom 7 (-2), and Charisma 5 (-3). This gives the Tumor Troll exceptional strength and constitution, making it powerful in melee combat and resilient to damage. Its dexterity is very bad, indicating that it might struggle with ranged attacks or saving throws that rely on quick reflexes. The trollâ€™s saving throw bonus in Wisdom is +1, which is average, and it has a passive perception of 8, indicating its ability to notice details in its environment is also low, but with a perception skill modifier of -2. The creature is immune to poison damage and cannot be poisoned, adding to its durability in battle. It can see in the dark up to 60 feet and communicates in the Giant language.

The special abilities of the Tumor Troll enhance its already formidable presence in combat. The Regeneration ability allows it to regain 10 hit points at the start of its turn, making it hard to keep down. However, if it takes acid or fire damage, this regeneration does not function until the start of its next turn. The troll can only die if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and does not regenerate.

Another unique feature is the Uncontrolled Growth ability. Whenever the troll regains hit points from regeneration, it acquires a random teratoma, enhancing its capabilities until they are removed or replaced, with a maximum of three teratomas at any one time. Each teratoma provides various effects, such as increased perception, the inability to be knocked prone, immunity to fear or exhaustion, attaching to targets to deal poison damage, gaining blindsight, or imposing disadvantages on certain rolls.

In combat, the Tumor Troll can perform a Multiattack, making two Bite attacks and two Claw attacks, or it can replace one Claw with a Fling Limb action. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit and deals 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage along with 3 (1d6) poison damage. The Claw attack also has a +7 to hit, inflicting 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. The Fling Limb is a ranged weapon attack with a +7 to hit at a distance of 20 feet for normal range and 60 feet for disadvantage, dealing 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. If the troll has a teratoma, it can remove it while using this action.

Overall, the Tumor Troll is an unpredictable monster that thrives on chaos and regeneration, making it an exciting and dangerous opponent in any encounter.
