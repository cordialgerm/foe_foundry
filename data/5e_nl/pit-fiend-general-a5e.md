The Pit Fiend General is a formidable foe in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, classified as a Huge Fiend with an impressive challenge rating of 20. This creature possesses high armor class and massive hit points, making it extremely durable in battle. Its strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks, devastating magical abilities, and a fear-inducing aura that can incapacitate adversaries before combat even begins. However, despite its immense power, the Pit Fiend can be vulnerable to specific conditions, particularly those that can capitalize on its lower dexterity and intelligence when compared with its other formidable attributes. Its innate spellcasting capabilities enhance its versatility in combat, allowing it to inflict significant damage while also controlling the battlefield.

The Pit Fiend General has the following attributes: Strength of 26, Dexterity of 16, Constitution of 24, Intelligence of 22, Wisdom of 18, and Charisma of 24. This translates into modifiers that are exceptional to very good across the board, showing particular strength in physical prowess and magical influence. The creature's saving throws further exemplify its toughness: it has exceptional bonuses to Constitution and Charisma saving throws (+13), good Dexterity and Intelligence bonuses (+9 and +12, respectively), and average Wisdom saving throws (+10). Its skills in athletics, insight, and perception are also notable, with values of +14, +10, and +10, respectively, allowing it to excel in physical endeavors and sensing threats.

In terms of damage resistances and immunities, the Pit Fiend is immune to fire and poison damage, showcasing its resilience against elemental threats. It has resistance to cold damage and damage from non-magical, non-silvered weapons. Furthermore, it has immunity to being poisoned, and its senses provide it with truesight up to 120 feet and a high passive perception score of 21. The creature can communicate using Infernal and possesses telepathy that extends out to 120 feet.

The Pit Fiend General has several special abilities that enhance its threat level. The Fear Aura affects any creature hostile towards it within 20 feet, imposing a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. A failure results in the creature becoming frightened until the start of its next turn, which may significantly impact combat dynamics. Notably, the Pit Fiend can cast spells innately without needing material components, with a spellcasting ability based on Wisdom (saving DC 18). It can cast detect magic and fireball at will, and hold monster and sending three times per day.

The Pit Fiend can perform multiple attacks with its Multiattack option, using its bite and mace weapon simultaneously. The Bite attack has a +14 to hit and deals 22 piercing damage (4d6 + 8). If the target is hit, it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being poisoned for one minute, during which the target cannot regain hit points and suffers ongoing damage at the start of its turns. The Mace attack similarly has a +14 to hit but deals a combination of bludgeoning damage (22, 4d6 + 8) and additional fire damage (21, 6d6). If a Medium or smaller creature is hit, it must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed away and knocked prone.

One of the most fearsome abilities is the Circle of Fire, usable once per day while the Pit Fiend is bloodied. This creates a 15-foot-tall ring of fire that damages creatures within it and continues to do so for the duration of its existence. When it appears, any creature intersecting the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take substantial fire damage.

The Pit Fiend also demonstrates its magical prowess through its Fireball spell, casting it with a 3rd-level capability. This spell explodes in a wide area, and any creature caught in it makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw to mitigate damage. Lastly, the Hold Monster spell allows the Pit Fiend to paralyze a creature it can see within a range of 60 feet for up to one minute, requiring the target to continuously attempt saving throws to escape the effect.

In addition to its main actions, the Pit Fiend can use bonus actions such as its Claw attack or Tail attack. The Claw attack hits with a +14 to attack and deals significant slashing damage, also allowing the Pit Fiend to grapple the target if successful. The Tail attack offers an alternative option for dealing bludgeoning damage with the same attack bonus.

Overall, the Pit Fiend General is a compelling adversary characterized by its significant power, magical capabilities, and an array of attacks that can severely hinder or outright incapacitate its foes, making it a formidable opponent in any campaign.
