The Sunset Raptor is a Medium-sized monstrosity characterized by its unaligned nature and unique abilities that revolve around charm and illusion. With a moderate armor class of 13 and 32 hit points, it poses a significant challenge to low-level adventurers, offering 200 experience points upon defeat. The creature excels in dexterity and charisma, boasting good movement speed and impressive stealth capabilities, making it an agile opponent. However, it has a weakness in intelligence, which is very bad, leaving it vulnerable to certain tactics. Notably, its special ability, Hypnotic Plumage, allows it to incapacitate opponents who fail a Wisdom saving throw, effectively controlling the battlefield. 

The Sunset Raptor exhibits the following attributes: Strength is 12, which is average; Dexterity is 15, rated as good; Constitution is 14, which is good; Intelligence is 4, categorized as very bad; Wisdom is 12, classified as average; and Charisma is 16, marked as very good. The creature has a passive perception of 13, indicating it can effectively notice hidden threats or ambushes. It also possesses proficiency in perception (+3) and stealth (+4), further enhancing its capabilities. 

One of its most noteworthy special abilities is Hypnotic Plumage. This ability activates when a creature that can see the Sunset Raptor's tail starts its turn within 100 feet. The raptor can force this creature to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, it becomes charmed until the start of its next turn, suffering from surreal hallucinations and having to move towards the raptor using its full speed. This includes the risk of taking opportunity attacks. The charmed individual can attempt to break free from the effect when it takes damage or before entering hazardous terrain; however, it can avert its eyes at the start of its turn to avoid making the saving throw. 

The Sunset Raptor also has the Pack Tactics feature, which provides it a tactical advantage. It gains advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of that creature and not incapacitated. This makes the raptor particularly dangerous when engaging in combat as part of a group.

In combat, the Sunset Raptor can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claw. The Bite attack requires a melee weapon attack roll of +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet against one target, dealing 9 piercing damage with a roll of 2d6 + 2 on a hit. The Claw attack also requires a +4 to hit with the same reach, dealing 6 slashing damage with a roll of 1d8 + 2 on a hit. 

Overall, the Sunset Raptor is a cunning and agile adversary, utilizing its charm-inducing abilities to manipulate opponents while taking advantage of its strengths in combat alongside allies.
