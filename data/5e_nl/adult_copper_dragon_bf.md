The Adult Copper Dragon is a formidable creature known for its cunning, agility, and magical abilities. This huge dragon boasts a solid Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of hit points at 252, making it a durable opponent in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 14, it poses a significant threat to adventurers due to its combination of powerful physical attacks, particularly its multiattack capabilities, and devastating breath weapons. Its strong ability scores include a noteworthy Constitution of +10, granting it excellent resilience, while its Charisma of +8 enhances its social interactions and spellcasting. However, like all dragons, it has specific weaknesses that can be exploited if opponents plan strategically. 

The dragon's attributes include the following: Strength at +6, Dexterity at +6, Constitution at +10 (exceptional), Intelligence at +4 (average), Wisdom at +7 (very good), and Charisma at +8 (very good). The dragon possesses darkvision with a range of 120 feet and keensense up to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its environment more acutely than many other creatures. With a high Perception score of 22, it can detect hidden enemies or traps easily, and it has a decent Stealth modifier of +16, indicating it can maneuver quietly when necessary. The creature can communicate in Common and Draconic.

Among its special abilities, the Adult Copper Dragon has Corrosive Scales, inherited from its younger stage, which likely contribute to its overall resilience in combat. Its Legendary Resistance, usable three times per day, allows the dragon to choose a successful save instead of failing, which is an incredibly strategic advantage during battles.

In combat, the dragon can use its Multiattack feature, which allows it to unleash its Frightful Presence, making enemies within 120 feet potentially terrified and vulnerable. Following that, it can execute a Bite attack, dealing 17 piercing damage, or two Claw attacks, each inflicting 13 slashing damage. The dragon also possesses a Tail attack, dealing 15 bludgeoning damage. The Frightful Presence forces opponents to succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute, significantly impacting their ability to fight effectively. They can repeat the save at the end of each turn to try and break free from the effect. 

Its Acid Breath, which has a recharge time of 5 to 6, allows the dragon to unleash a line of corrosive acid up to 90 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures in this line must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 54 acid damage, which can decimate low-hit-point foes quickly, while a successful save still results in half damage. Furthermore, the Slowing Breath ability, rechargeable on a 6, delivers a 60-foot cone of slowing mist that affects the speed of those caught.

For bonus actions, the dragon can Change Shape, morphing into a beast or humanoid form that matches its challenge rating. In this new form, it retains its Legendary Resistance and hit points, making it a versatile and unpredictable opponent.

The dragon also possesses a set of Legendary Actions, allowing it to take actions outside its regular turn. It can use Detect to pinpoint creatures and traps within 30 feet automatically, making it hard to ambush. The Tail Attack allows for quick retaliation during enemy turns, while Elemental Roar (costing two actions) makes targets vulnerable to acid damage if they fail a DC 16 Charisma save. Lastly, with Wing Attack (also costing two actions), it can deal damage and knock back enemies nearby, while allowing it to reposition safely. 

Should the Adult Copper Dragon perish, its regional effects will fade over the course of a year, but the exact nature of those effects requires further specification. This dragon's unique traits and abilities make it a memorable foe in any campaign, capable of challenging even the most prepared adventuring party.
