The Clay Guardian is a formidable Large Construct designed to serve as a protector on the battlefield, boasting a robust defensive capability and formidable melee attack potential. With an Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 133, this creature can withstand significant damage. Its primary strengths lie in its resistance to various damage types, including immunity to acid, poison, psychic damage, and damage from nonmagical weapons that are not adamantine. Additionally, its abilities grant it unique advantages, such as healing from acid damage, enhanced speed when bloodied, and a powerful berserking mechanic that allows it to go into a rage-like state, attacking aggressively. However, its weaknesses include a low Intelligence and Charisma, reflecting its limited ability for complex thought or social interaction. Overall, the Clay Guardian excels in unyielding physical combat, often serving as a guardian for powerful spellcasters or important locations.

The Clay Guardian has the following attributes: Strength of 20, which provides a +5 modifier, making it exceptionally strong in physical attacks. Dexterity is average at 10 with no modifier, indicating that it may not be particularly agile. Constitution is quite good at 18, giving it a +4 modifier and enhancing its hit points. Intelligence is very low, at 3, giving it a -4 modifier, signifying a lack of cognitive ability. Wisdom sits at an average 10, with no modifier, indicating typical perception and insight. Charisma is very poor, at 1, resulting in a -5 modifier, highlighting its inability in social scenarios.

The Guardian has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. It does not require air, sustenance, or sleep due to its Constructed Nature, allowing it to function continuously without rest. With Acid Absorption, if the Guardian takes acid damage, it instead regains hit points equal to the damage dealt, which can make it tougher to defeat if faced with acid-based attacks. The Berserk ability activates when the Guardian starts its turn bloodied. Upon this activation, a d6 is rolled, and if it rolls a 6, the Guardian goes berserk, attacking the nearest creature until destroyed or fully healed. Bloodied Haste grants the Guardian doubled speed and a +2 bonus to AC while bloodied, along with advantage on Dexterity saving throws and the ability to use its slam attack as a bonus action. Its Immutable Form makes it immune to any effect that would alter its physical structure. Additionally, the Magic Resistance provides it with an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further enhancing its durability in magical encounters.

In terms of combat actions, the Clay Guardian can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to execute two slam attacks in one turn. The Slam attack is a melee weapon attack using a +9 to hit, reaching 5 feet with one target. On a successful hit, the Guardian deals 16 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 2d10 plus its Strength modifier. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in its hit point maximum being reduced by the amount of damage dealt. A creature that has its hit point maximum reduced to 0 due to this effect dies, but this reduction can be removed with a Greater Restoration spell or similar magic. This combination of abilities makes Clay Guardians formidable foes, particularly in scenarios where they can utilize their unique resistances and offensive capabilities effectively.
