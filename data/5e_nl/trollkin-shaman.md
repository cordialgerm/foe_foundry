The Trollkin Shaman is a Medium humanoid with a neutral alignment known for its ability to bolster allies while also being difficult to defeat in battle. With a challenge rating of 4, it serves as a competent combatant and spellcaster, posing a moderate threat to adventurers. Its regeneration ability allows it to recover hit points each turn, making it resilient in prolonged engagements, though it is vulnerable to fire and acid damage, which can impede its regenerative capabilities. The trollkin shaman's proficiency in spellcasting combined with its support abilities makes it a strategic asset on the battlefield, though its strengths come with medium-tier physical abilities, resulting in a balanced but not overwhelming presence.

The Trollkin Shaman possesses the following attributes: Strength of 14 (+2), Dexterity of 13 (+1), Constitution of 14 (+2), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 16 (+3), and Charisma of 12 (+1). Its Constitution translates to a good endurance in battle, and its Wisdom indicates a very good capability for spellcasting. The shaman has several skills, including arcana and nature both at +2 (average), and perception at +5 (very good), making it adept at noticing hidden threats. The shaman also has darkvision for 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as though it were bright light, and speaks Common and its native Trollkin language.

The shaman's special abilities enhance its durability and combat support roles. Regeneration allows it to recover 5 hit points every turn unless it has taken acid or fire damage, which makes it exceptional at staying in the fight. Its Thick Hide provides a +1 bonus to Armor Class, contributing to its already solid defensive capability. As an 8th-level spellcaster, the shamanâ€™s spellcasting relies on its Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 bonus to hit with spell attacks. 

As for its spells, the shaman has access to the following:
- Cantrips (cast at will): Druidcraft for minor natural effects, Produce Flame for creating a fire source, and Shillelagh to enhance its staff attacks.
- 1st-level spells (four slots available): Cure Wounds for healing, Entangle to restrain foes, Faerie Fire to illuminate targets and give advantage on attacks against them, and Thunderwave to push enemies away.
- 2nd-level spells (three slots available): Flaming Sphere to create a movable fire attack, and Hold Person to paralyze a target.
- 3rd-level spells (three slots available): Dispel Magic to negate magical effects, Meld into Stone for cover, and Sleet Storm to create difficult terrain and obscure vision.
- 4th-level spells (two slots available): Dominate Beast to control a creature and Grasping Vine to entangle enemies with plants.

For its actions, the shaman can make a Multiattack, allowing it to use its staff to strike two times. It uses the Staff with a Melee Weapon Attack bonus of +4 to hit, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage on a hit, or 6 (1d8 + 2) if wielded with both hands. Additionally, once per day, it can use "Inspire Ferocity" to grant up to three trollkin allies advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn, as well as 10 temporary hit points, making it highly effective in supporting its kin during combat.
