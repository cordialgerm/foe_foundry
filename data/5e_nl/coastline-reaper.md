The Coastline Reaper is a formidable Large monstrosity that lurks in aquatic environments and is unaligned in its motives. With a robust armor class of 16, it can absorb considerable damage, boasting a substantial 144 hit points, which makes it a resilient opponent in combat. It has a unique movement capability that allows it to walk at a slow speed of 10 feet on land but swim quickly at 40 feet in water. As a Challenge Rating 9 creature, it offers a significant threat in encounters, especially to players unfamiliar with its abilities. The Coastline Reaper excels at dealing damage with its tentacles and possesses the ability to paralyze foes, making it a dangerous adversary. However, it has weaknesses, such as a very low Intelligence score, rendering it poor in problem-solving or interacting with characters outside of combat.

The Coastline Reaper has the following attributes: a Strength score of 10, which is average; a Dexterity score of 18, which is very good; a Constitution score of 17, which is also good; an Intelligence score of 4, which is very bad; a Wisdom score of 14, which is good; and a Charisma score of 8, which is very bad. Regarding saving throws, it has a good Dexterity saving throw modifier of +8 and a very good Constitution saving throw modifier of +7. Its skills include perception with a modifier of +2, which is average for noticing hidden elements in its surroundings. The Coastline Reaper has resistances to cold and poison damage, meaning it takes half damage from these types of attacks. It is immune to conditions of exhaustion and being poisoned, providing it with an edge in prolonged encounters. It can see in the dark up to 60 feet and has a passive Perception of 12, indicative of its ability to notice hidden threats effectively.

The Coastline Reaper possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness. Its Glowing Organs ability causes its internal organs to emit an eerie pale blue glow while underwater, providing dim light in a 10-foot radius, which can affect visibility. With the Hold Breath ability, it can remain out of water for up to 30 minutes, allowing it to ambush opponents who may not expect it to surface for extended periods. It can only breathe underwater due to its Water Breathing ability, making it a proficient aquatic predator.

In terms of actions, the Coastline Reaper can launch a Multiattack wherein it makes two Tentacle Lashes and one Stinging Tentacle attack in one turn. The Tentacle Lash has a melee attack modifier of +8 to hit, extends 15 feet, and deals an average of 14 bludgeoning damage (3d6 + 4) to a target on a hit. The Stinging Tentacle, also with a +8 to hit and a 15-ft. range, inflicts an average of 7 piercing damage (1d6 + 4) as well as an additional 9 poison damage (2d8). A target struck by the Stinging Tentacle must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for one minute. A frightened creature attempting this save has disadvantage, which increases the likelihood of successful paralysis. Paralyzed targets can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, with success ending the effect on themselves.

One of its most terrifying abilities is the Frightening Visage, which can be used after a recharge interval of 5 to 6 rounds. When underwater, it intensifies the glow of its organs, creating a skull-like appearance. Alternatively, if on land, it pulls its outer flesh to enhance its fleshy skull-like form. This ability targets all humanoids within 30 feet who can see it, inflicting an average of 21 psychic damage (6d6) and instilling the frightened condition for one minute, requiring a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw to halve the damage and resist the frightened status. A frightened target can also attempt to save at the end of its turns to end the effect on itself. Overall, the Coastline Reaper is a fearsome and capable predator in its aquatic domain, posing a significant challenge for adventurers brave enough to face it.
