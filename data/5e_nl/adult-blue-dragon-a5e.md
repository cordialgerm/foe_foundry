The Adult Blue Dragon is a formidable and powerful creature that dominates the skies and deserts of the Dungeons and Dragons universe. As a Huge Dragon with a challenge rating of 19, it boasts an impressive array of abilities and resistances that make it a significant threat to adventurers. This dragon's armor class of 19 and substantial hit points totaling 275 make it exceptionally durable in battle. Its strengths lie not only in its physical attacks but also in its innate magical abilities. However, it has limited dexterity, which could leave it vulnerable to certain tactics. With the capabilities to fly, burrow, and swim, as well as proficient knowledge of lightning and terrain manipulation, the Adult Blue Dragon presents both a physical and strategic challenge for any group of heroes.

The Adult Blue Dragon has an extraordinarily high Strength of 24, providing a very good modifier of +7 for its physical attacks. Its Constitution score of 22 gives it a good +6 modifier, bolstering its resilience. Intelligence and Charisma scores of 16 and 18, respectively, yield average and very good modifiers of +3 and +4, enhancing its spellcasting and interaction prowess. The dragon's Wisdom score of 14 provides a good +2 modifier, aiding in perception and survival skills. Its Dexterity is average at 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, which is not particularly effective for evasive maneuvers.

The saving throws for the Adult Blue Dragon add to its survivability; it has +6 for Dexterity, +12 for Constitution, +8 for Wisdom, and +10 for Charisma, showcasing its exceptional ability to resist effects like spells or severe damage on certain attacks. It is immune to lightning damage, an attribute that accentuates its theme as a blue dragon.

In terms of special abilities, the dragon possesses several that allow it to navigate its environment deftly and enhance its stealth. With the Desert Farer ability, it ignores difficult terrain caused by sand or gravel, even while airborne, and is unaffected by extreme heat. The Dune Splitter ability lets it submerge in sand and gravel for extended periods, gaining advantage on stealth checks to conceal its presence. Its Legendary Resistance allows the dragon to choose to succeed on failed saving throws up to three times a day, though this results in it losing some scales, potentially lowering its armor class after its uses are exhausted.

The Adult Blue Dragon is an innate spellcaster with a spellcasting ability tied to Charisma and a save DC of 18. It can cast three spells each per day, including Blur, which grants it the ability to become harder to hit, Silent Image for creating illusions, Blight for causing significant necrotic damage to its foes, and Hypnotic Pattern to incapacitate and mesmerize enemies.

In terms of actions, the dragon can make a Multiattack, which combines one bite attack dealing an average of 23 piercing damage plus 4 lightning damage, along with two claw attacks that deal an average of 20 slashing damage each. It also has access to a powerful tail attack that bludgeons a target for an average of 16 damage and can push them away. The Arc Lightning action lets the dragon create a chain lightning effect, forcing a target to make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer damage and the potential to jump the damage to another target. Its Lightning Breath is a devastating area attack with a long reach, dealing an average of 77 lightning damage, and it can restrict the reactions of those who fail to save against it. The Quake ability allows the dragon to cause a thunderous pulse that can knock creatures prone and restrain them in loose sand.

As a reaction, the dragon can execute a Tail Attack against a creature that successfully lands a melee attack against it, showing its ability to respond in combat.

For Legendary Actions, the dragon has access to three unique options: Roar induces fear in nearby creatures with a Charisma saving throw, Wing Attack can push and knock down surrounding foes while allowing the dragon to reposition in the air, and Quake can be activated for additional disruption, costing two actions. This versatile combination of magical abilities, physical attacks, and powerful defensive strategies makes the Adult Blue Dragon a compelling foe in any campaign.
