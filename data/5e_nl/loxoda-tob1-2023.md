The Loxoda is a huge monstrosity characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This creature serves as a formidable opponent in combat, boasting a robust combination of high hit points and solid attack options. With an Armor Class of 13, the Loxoda can sustain a decent amount of damage before being overwhelmed. Its challenge rating of 6 makes it a dangerous encounter for adventurers, yielding 2,300 experience points upon defeat. The Loxoda excels in both strength and constitution, making it a powerful physical combatant, while its decent wisdom allows for practical survival instincts. However, it has lower flexibility and intelligence, affecting its ability to interact and strategize beyond brute force.

The Loxoda possesses the following attributes: Strength is 19, granting a +4 modifier, which is exceptional for melee attacks. Dexterity is 12, providing a +1 modifier, which is average for avoiding attacks and makes it somewhat nimble. Its Constitution is also high at 19, resulting in a +4 modifier, reflecting very good resilience. Intelligence is at 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating an average capability for reasoning. Wisdom stands at 14, with a +2 modifier demonstrating good perception and insight, while Charisma is a mere 10, reflecting an average presence in social interactions.

In terms of actions, the Loxoda can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to attack twice in a single turnâ€”one with its Slam and one with its Spear. The Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, featuring a reach of 10 feet, that deals 22 bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. The Spear can be used both as a melee and ranged attack, also with a +7 to hit, reaching 5 feet or ranging up to 60 feet, inflicting either 14 piercing damage (or 17 when used in two hands) on a successful hit. The Stomp is particularly devastating, targeting prone creatures within reach; it deals 20 bludgeoning damage with the same +7 to hit modifier.

One of the Loxoda's most powerful abilities is Tooth-Rattling Pound, which can be used once the creature recharges (on a roll of 5-6). It causes the Loxoda to rear up and slam down, creating shockwaves that affect each creature in contact with the ground within a 20-foot radius. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 36 bludgeoning damage, along with an additional 10 thunder damage at the end of their next turn due to lingering shockwaves. A successful save results in half the damage without the additional thunder damage, making this ability highly impactful in crowd control scenarios during combat.
