Its dual ability to maneuver both in the air, with a flying speed of 80 feet, and on land, with a walking speed of 40 feet, gives it exceptional mobility in battles. Notable for its innate spellcasting abilities, the Young Green Dragon can manipulate the battlefield with magic while simultaneously delivering potent physical attacks.

The dragon's special abilities enhance its versatility in combat. The Amphibious trait allows it to thrive both in water and on land, enabling it to pursue foes into different environments. Additionally, the Woodland Stalker ability grants it advantage on Stealth checks when within forested areas, making it especially dangerous in its natural habitats. The Young Green Dragon also possesses innate spellcasting, with a spellcasting ability based on Charisma and a save DC of 14. It can cast the spells animal messenger and tongues three times per day without the need for material components, enabling it to communicate and gather information with ease.

In combat, the dragon can initiate a Multiattack, allowing it to attack once with its bite and twice with its claws. Its Bite attack has a +8 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and inflicts 20 piercing damage, additionally dealing 4 poison damage. The Claw attack also has a +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 slashing damage. One of its most devastating options is the Poison Breath ability, which can be used every five to six rounds. When activated, the dragon exhales a 30-foot cone of poisonous gas. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, suffering 42 poison damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful one. This ability can dramatically shift the tide of battle by inflicting considerable damage on multiple opponents simultaneously.
