The Alchemical Golem is a formidable Large Construct creature that presents a significant challenge in combat. It has a robust Armor Class of 15 and impressive Hit Points totaling 147, making it resilient in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it can provide a test for even experienced adventurers. The golem possesses high physical strength, reflected in its Strength score of 18, which gives it a good modifier of +4, allowing for effective melee attacks. It's known for its diverse and potent special abilities that can inflict damage on opponents while also protecting itself. However, it is not particularly agile or charming, having a Dexterity of only 7, which results in a bad modifier of -2. The golem is unaligned, meaning it does not adhere to any moral compass, which makes it unpredictable. Overall, the Alchemical Golem combines substantial damage-dealing capabilities with a significant amount of durability.

The Alchemical Golem has the following attributes:
- Strength: 18 (+4), which provides a strong offensive capability in physical combat and makes its attacks very effective.
- Dexterity: 7 (-2), resulting in a very bad modifier that hinders its ability to dodge and evade attacks.
- Constitution: 21 (+5), granting it exceptional durability and resistance against effects that may incapacitate it.
- Intelligence: 7 (-2), making it bad in terms of cognitive skills and decision-making.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), indicating an average sense of perception and insight.
- Charisma: 1 (-5), which is very bad, resulting in negligible social interaction capabilities.

The Alchemical Golem also has various resistances and immunities:
- Damage Immunities include poison and psychic damage, as well as damage from nonmagical attacks unless made with adamantine.
- Damage Resistances include acid, cold, fire, and lightning damage.
- Condition Immunities mean it cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned.
- It has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive Perception of 10. While it understands the languages of its creator, it cannot communicate verbally.

The golem possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness:
- Alchemical Infusion allows the golem to infuse itself with a powerful admixture at the start of its turn. It can choose one infusion from three options—Brimstone, Quicksilver, or Salt. Each infusion has its own effects, involving the golem taking necrotic damage to enhance its abilities temporarily.
  - Brimstone allows the golem to breathe poison and poisons nearby creatures.
  - Quicksilver increases its speed and grants resistance to damage.
  - Salt increases its Armor Class and enhances its melee attacks while making the ground difficult terrain.
- Elemental Expulsion deals damage to nearby creatures whenever the golem takes damage from acid, cold, fire, or lightning.
- Immutable Form provides immunity to any effects intended to alter its form, ensuring it remains intact in battle.
- Magic Resistance grants the golem advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.
- Magic Weapons means its attacks are considered magical, allowing them to bypass certain defensive measures.

In terms of actions, the golem can:
- Execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two slam attacks in one turn.
- Make a Slam attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, dealing an average of 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- Use Poison Breath as part of the Brimstone Infusion (with a recharge on rolls of 5-6), exhaling poisonous fumes in a cone, requiring foes to make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer significant poison damage.

These attributes and abilities make the Alchemical Golem a unique and dangerous adversary, capable of manipulating the battlefield and posing a serious threat through both its attacks and special powers.
