The Desert Giant is a massive and imposing creature classified as a Huge Giant with a Neutral alignment. It serves as a formidable combatant in the natural landscapes of arid deserts, leveraging its impressive physical attributes and special abilities to dominate its environment. With a high Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor and robust Hit Points totaling 175, it can absorb a significant amount of damage in battle. The Desert Giant’s challenge rating of 9 indicates a substantial threat level, making it suitable for mid-level adventurers. Notable strengths include exceptional strength and constitution scores, allowing it to deal substantial damage and withstand attacks. However, its Dexterity is average, making it less agile than other creatures, and its Charisma is only good, meaning it's not particularly persuasive or inspiring.

The Desert Giant possesses remarkable physical attributes, exhibited as follows: Strength 27 (+8) which earns a very good modifier of +12 on Strength saving throws, suggesting it excels in physical contests. Its Constitution score of 22 (+6) is also formidable, granting a good modifier of +10 on Constitution saving throws and contributing to its durability. The remaining attributes offer average to good benefits, with Intelligence at 13 (+1), Wisdom at 18 (+4), and Charisma at 15 (+2). Its skills include impressive bonuses in Perception (+8), Survival (+8), and decent Stealth (+4). Notably, it enjoys immunities to fire damage, allowing it to withstand such attacks without harm.

The Desert Giant's special abilities enhance its effectiveness on sandy terrain. The ability "Desert Walk" allows it to move through difficult terrain of sand or gravel without expending extra movement, maintaining its speed advantage. Additionally, its "Sand Camouflage" ability gives it an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in sandy environments, making it highly effective in ambush situations.

In combat, the Desert Giant can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two melee attacks with its falchion. The falchion attack has a +12 to hit, and when it successfully strikes, it inflicts 23 (6d4 + 8) slashing damage, making it a threat to even well-armored opponents. If it chooses to attack from a distance, it can throw a rock with a range of 60 feet, extending to 240 feet at disadvantage. This ranged attack also has a +12 to hit and deals significant damage of 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage when it hits, allowing the Desert Giant to engage targets both close and far away effectively.
