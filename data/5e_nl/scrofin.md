The Scrofin is a Medium Fey creature that embodies a playful yet formidable nature, often engaging in challenges and contests of strength. It operates under a lawful neutral alignment, maintaining a strict code in its interactions. With a solid Armor Class of 13 and 68 hit points, the Scrofin can hold its ground but is not invulnerable. Its strengths lie in its grappling ability and resilience, allowing it to restrain larger opponents effectively and endure damage. However, it has low Intelligence and Wisdom scores, which make it less adept at dealing with magical or perceptual challenges. Overall, the Scrofin is a captivating opponent that relies on physical strength and grappling prowess in battle.

The Scrofin has the following attributes: Strength of 16 (+3), Dexterity of 13 (+1), Constitution of 18 (+4), Intelligence of 9 (-1), Wisdom of 9 (-1), and Charisma of 10 (+0). The Strength score provides the Scrofin with very good physical power, complementing its role as a grappler. Its Constitution score also yields very good hit points, enhancing its durability in combat. The Dexterity allows for average agility, while its Intelligence and Wisdom scores are very bad, reflecting low mental acuity.

The Scrofin possesses several notable abilities. As an Expert Wrestler, it can grapple creatures up to two sizes larger than itself, enhancing its grappling effectiveness. When grappling a Medium or smaller creature, that creature has disadvantage on escape attempts, giving the Scrofin a tactical edge. Additionally, it has advantage on checks and saving throws to escape grapples or undo the restrained condition, making it very resilient in close combat.

The Relentless ability allows the Scrofin to survive lethal damage. If it takes 10 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it instead drops to 1 hit point, allowing it to continue fighting. This makes it exceptionally durable, as it can withstand potentially fatal blows.

In terms of actions, the Scrofin can perform a Multiattack, making two strikes in one turnâ€”one with its fist and one with its gore attack, or two with its fists. The Fist attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a 5-foot reach. When it successfully hits, it deals 6 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target, imposing an escape DC of 13. It's noteworthy that if the Scrofin scores a critical hit with a fist attack, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of its next turn, which can significantly impact the flow of combat. The Gore attack is similarly a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage with the same reach.

For reactions, the Scrofin has the Quick to Anger ability, which recharges after a short or long rest. If it takes damage while grappling a foe or is reduced to half its hit points, it becomes angry, gaining advantage on melee attack rolls and saving throws against charm, fright, or unconsciousness effects. Additionally, it gains resistance to bludgeoning damage, making it a formidable opponent for 1 minute, or until it is knocked unconscious or decides to end its anger as a bonus action. This ability reflects the Scrofin's emotional temperament and can turn the tide of a battle in its favor if it is severely challenged.
