The Faerie Dragon is a Tiny dragon known for its whimsical nature and playful demeanor. With an Armor Class of 15 and 14 hit points, it is relatively fragile in combat, but its high Dexterity and Charisma scores make it quite elusive and effective in spellcasting. The dragon's speed allows for swift aerial maneuvers, flying at 60 feet per round, while its combat abilities primarily focus on evasion and confusion rather than brute force. Notably, Faerie Dragons possess innate spellcasting abilities which grow as they age, endowing them with a variety of spells that can influence the battlefield and provide utility. While they have low Strength, their strong Dexterity offers them good capabilities in stealth and agility, although their overall combat effectiveness is primarily disruptive rather than damaging.

The Faerie Dragon's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength score of 3 with a modifier of -4, making it exceptionally weak in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity score is 20, giving it a +5 modifier, signifying a very good capacity in tasks like dodging attacks and sneaking. Its Constitution score is 12, translating to a +1 modifier, which is average in terms of resilience. The Intelligence score of 14 grants it a +2 modifier, showing a good capacity for various knowledge checks. With a Wisdom score of 12 (+1 modifier), it has an average perceptive ability, yet its Charisma score is 16, resulting in a +3 modifier, providing an exceptional ability in influencing others and spellcasting.

In terms of skills, the Faerie Dragon excels in stealth with a +7 modifier, indicating a very good capability for avoiding detection. Its arcana skill sits at +4, showcasing good proficiency in magical knowledge, while its perception skill is +3, marking an average ability to notice details in its surroundings. The dragon has a darkvision range of 60 feet and a passive perception of 13, allowing it to see in the dark reasonably well. It communicates in Draconic and Sylvan, and it can telepathically connect with other dragons within 60 feet.

The Faerie Dragon possesses several special abilities. Its innate spellcasting relies on Charisma, with a spell save DC of 13. As it ages, it can cast increasingly powerful spells. At 5 years old, it can cast "dancing lights," "mage hand," and "minor illusion" at will. At 10 years, it can cast "suggestion" once per day. At 30 years old, it gains the ability to cast "major image," also once per day. Finally, at 50 years, it can use "hallucinatory terrain" once per day, allowing for significant manipulation of its surroundings.

In combat, the Faerie Dragon's action options include a Bite attack, which allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit against a target within 5 feet, causing 1 piercing damage on a hit. Its Euphoria Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, lets it release an intoxicating gas at a creature within close proximity. The target must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw; on a failure, the creature becomes confused for one minute, complicating the battle for enemies. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to potentially shake off the effect. 

Additionally, the Faerie Dragon can use its Prismatic Light ability three times a day. This causes its scales to pulse with bright light, requiring every creature that can see it within a 15-foot radius to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they become magically blinded until the end of their next turn, offering strong control over the battlefield. At the higher age of 50 years or more, the dragon can employ the Beast Form ability once per day to target a creature within 15 feet. The designated target makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw; on failure, they are transformed into a harmless Tiny beast for one minute, restricting their ability to take actions or speak, although their statistics remain the same.

For bonus actions, the Faerie Dragon can turn invisible, along with any of its equipment. This invisibility lasts until it either falls unconscious, dismisses it, or uses any of its other actions, providing it with an exceptional means of escape or surprise attacks.
