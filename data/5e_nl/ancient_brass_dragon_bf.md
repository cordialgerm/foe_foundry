The Ancient Brass Dragon is a formidable gargantuan creature that serves as a powerful figure within its environment, often embodying the elements of fire and wisdom associated with dragonkind. With high hit points and impressive physical attributes, this dragon can deal significant damage while also possessing abilities that can manipulate and hinder foes. It is exceptionally resilient, able to shrug off effects that would incapacitate lesser beings, thanks to its Legendary Resistance. Its mix of powerful area-of-effect attacks, ability to instill fear, and magical techniques make it a multifaceted threat in combat, though players must be aware of its high challenge rating, which indicates its capability to overpower typical adventurers. As an ancient being, it also has a notable intelligence and charm, making it not just a brute force but also a cunning and charismatic opponent.

The Ancient Brass Dragon possesses the following attributes: Strength of +8 (which is very good), Dexterity of +6 (which is good), Constitution of +13 (which is exceptional), Intelligence of +3 (which is average), Wisdom of +8 (which is very good), and Charisma of +10 (which is very good). 

It has a high Armor Class of 20, representing its natural armor, and 284 hit points, indicating exceptional durability in battle. The dragon moves with a speed of 40 feet on land, can burrow at the same speed, and is capable of flying at 80 feet. It has senses that include darkvision extending 120 feet and keensense allowing it to perceive creatures and objects with perfect clarity within 60 feet. With a Perception score of 24, it is adept at noticing threats, and a Stealth score of 16, it can move silently when needed. The dragon is bilingual, understanding both Common and Draconic languages.

This creature features special abilities such as Legendary Resistance, which allows it to succeed on a saving throw three times per day if it initially fails. Furthermore, it emits Suffocating Heat, a damaging aura capable of affecting creatures within 30 feet, requiring a rather high DC of 21 to resist its effects.

In terms of combat, the Ancient Brass Dragon can make a Multiattack consisting of its Frightful Presence, one Bite attack, and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +14 to hit, and when it successfully hits, it inflicts 19 piercing damage (2d10 + 8). Each Claw attack also has a +14 to hit, causing 15 slashing damage (2d6 + 8) upon a successful hit. Additionally, it can strike with its Tail, which similarly has a +14 to hit and deals 17 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 8).

Frightful Presence impacts foes within 120 feet of the dragon, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 18. On failure, they are frightened for one minute, but they can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns to end the effect on themselves. The dragon's Fire Breath, which can be used on a recharge of 5 or 6, allows it to exhale fire in a substantial line of 120 feet, dealing 70 fire damage (20d6) to those who fail a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, or half damage if they succeed. Moreover, its Sleep Breath can incapacitate creatures within a 90-foot cone, requiring a DC 21 Constitution saving throw; those who fail fall unconscious for 10 minutes unless woken by damage or another creature's action.

In addition, the dragon can use a Bonus Action to Change Shape, allowing it to transform into a beast or humanoid of a challenge rating no greater than its own. This versatile ability enables it to adopt new forms while retaining core features such as hit points and communication capabilities.

As for legendary actions, the Ancient Brass Dragon can take up to three actions during other creatures' turns. It has options like Detect, allowing it to pinpoint all creatures and traps within 30 feet; Tail Attack, which offers another chance for a melee prey; or Elemental Roar, enabling it to make targets vulnerable to fire. It may also employ Wing Attack, knocking down creatures nearby and allowing it a moment to reposition without facing opportunity attacks.

Finally, the dragon has Regional Effects that pertain to its lair, which can include environmental changes based on its presence. These effects can diminish if the dragon is absent for an extended period or if it were to die, demonstrating its significant influence over the surrounding region.
