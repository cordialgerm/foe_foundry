The creature's challenge rating of 2 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, offering a balanced mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. Notable characteristics include strong dexterity and unique special abilities that effectively alter the flow of combat in its favor.

In terms of skills, the Wind Demon has a +8 bonus in stealth, allowing it to move quietly and remain undetected very effectively. It is immune to cold and poison damage, while having resistance to fire and lightning damage, making it quite resilient to various forms of attacks. It is also immune to being poisoned. Its senses include darkvision out to 60 feet, which enables it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and it has a passive Perception of 8, which is generally considered bad. The Wind Demon can communicate in Abyssal, Common, and Void Speech.

The Wind Demon possesses the special ability "Arrow Bane," which creates a unique defensive mechanism against ranged attacks. When targeted by a ranged attack or spell, it rolls a d6; on a roll of 1 to 5, the attacker suffers disadvantage on their roll, effectively making it harder for them to hit. If it rolls a 6, the attack reflects back at the attacker as if it originated from the Wind Demon, switching the target and making the attacker vulnerable to their own attack. This ability significantly complicates ranged encounters, making the Wind Demon a challenging opponent.

Additionally, the Wind Demon has "Magic Resistance," granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. This ability makes it significantly tougher against casters, resulting in a very good defense against magical onslaughts.

In terms of actions, the Wind Demon is capable of executing a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two attacks with its frost claws. The "Frost Claw" melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, targeting a single foe. Upon a successful hit, it deals 6 slashing damage—with a damage roll of 1d4 + 4—along with an additional 3 cold damage from a roll of 1d6. This combination of damage types allows it to bypass certain resistances and affect enemies in various ways.

As a reaction, the Wind Demon can utilize "Swift as Frost," enabling it to move up to its speed after taking damage from an attack it can see. This ability allows it to evade further attacks and reposition itself strategically without provoking opportunity attacks from the attacker, enhancing its survivability and tactical options in combat situations.
