The Light Drake is a tiny dragon that embodies the essence of light and goodness. With its neutral good alignment, this creature plays a support role, using its innate spellcasting abilities to assist allies and illuminate its surroundings. The Light Drake possesses decent defenses with an Armor Class of 13 and a modest hit point pool of 24, making it somewhat resilient in combat. Its mobility is excellent, flying at 60 feet and also able to walk and hover at low speeds. While its physical strength is limited, it compensates with high dexterity, allowing it to be nimble in battle. 

The Light Drake's abilities include Reflective Scales, which enhances the lighting around it, making it a beacon in dark areas. Its innate spellcasting relies on Charisma, which is above average at +2, allowing it to effectively use spells to control the battlefield. It can cast several useful spells without needing material components, contributing to its utility in both exploration and combat scenarios. 

In terms of attributes, the Light Drake has a Strength of 7, which is very bad, making it ineffective in physical strength-based tasks. Its Dexterity of 16 is good, enhancing its agility and allowing it to perform well in acrobatic tasks, contributing +5 to its acrobatics skill. The Constitution is at 13, giving it an average score, providing some durability without being outstanding. Intelligence at 8 is very bad, limiting its problem-solving capabilities. Wisdom at 12 is average, allowing for decent perception but not exceptional insight. Finally, Charisma is set at 14, which is good, helping it to cast spells effectively and interact with other creatures.

The Light Drake possesses two special abilities. Reflective Scales allows it to cause light sources within 5 feet to project bright light and dim light further, enhancing visibility in combat and exploration. When wearing or carrying an object that emits light from the daylight spell, this ability turns the light into sunlight, which can be significant against creatures vulnerable to radiant damage. 

In terms of innate spellcasting, the Light Drake has a spell save DC of 12 and a +4 to hit with spell attacks. It can cast the following spells at will: dancing lights, light, guiding star, and starburst. Each of these spells provides utility, from creating visual distractions to illuminating areas. Additionally, it can cast color spray and faerie fire three times per day each, both of which can control enemies by blinding them or outlining them, making them easier to target.

As for its actions, the Light Drake can make a melee weapon attack with its Bite, which has a +5 to hit and deals 6 piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, it has a Breath Weapon that recharges on a 6, allowing it to exhale a powerful 30-foot line of brilliant white light. This attack forces creatures in the line to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in 5 radiant damage and blindness for one minute, while success halves the damage and avoids the blindness. The blinded condition can be removed by succeeding on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of a creature's turns, affecting tactical decision-making during combat.
