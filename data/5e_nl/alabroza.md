The Alabroza is a small, unaligned monstrosity known for its insatiable thirst for blood, which is crucial for its survival. This creature is characterized by its ability to fly and its relatively high mobility, allowing it to engage or disengage from combat effectively. With an Armor Class of 12, it has a moderate level of defense, but with only 45 hit points, it can be taken down fairly easily. Its strength lies in its offensive capabilities, particularly through its Draining Fangs ability, which can cause significant ongoing damage to its prey. However, its weakness is its dependency on consuming blood or milk daily, which, if unmet, leads to exhaustion. This dependency adds a strategic layer to encounters with the Alabroza, as it must find sustenance regularly.

The Alabroza has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2 - good), Dexterity 15 (+2 - good), Constitution 13 (+1 - average), Intelligence 4 (-3 - very bad), Wisdom 15 (+2 - good), and Charisma 7 (-2 - bad). Its skills include perception at +2, providing it with a modest ability to detect hidden creatures or objects. Additionally, it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive perception of 12, allowing it to see in dark conditions and perceive threats effectively. Although it can understand Abyssal, it lacks the ability to communicate, which could limit its interactions.

One of the unique special abilities of the Alabroza is called Bloodthirsty. This ability mandates that the creature must consume at least 1 pint of fresh blood or milk every 24 hours. Failing to meet this requirement results in the Alabroza suffering one level of exhaustion. Conversely, for each pint consumed, one level of exhaustion is removed, making sustenance a critical factor in its performance during encounters.

In terms of actions, the Alabroza can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make either two Talons attacks or one Talons attack combined with a Draining Fangs attack in one turn. The Talons attack benefits from a +4 to hit and deals an average of 5 slashing damage (1d6+2). The Draining Fangs attack similarly has a +4 to hit and inflicts 6 piercing damage (1d8+2). However, if successful, the Draining Fangs attack also attaches the Alabroza to the target, resulting in continuous damage to the victim. While attached, the Alabroza does not attack but instead causes the target to lose an additional 6 hit points at the start of each of its turns due to blood loss.

If the situation necessitates, the Alabroza can detach itself by spending 5 feet of movement after the target has been reduced to 0 hit points. Alternatively, the attached target or any creature can use their action to detach the Alabroza if the need arises, providing an opportunity for strategic play during combat.
