The Guard is a Medium humanoid creature designed to serve as a basic defensive unit in various situations. It has a reasonable armor class of 15, making it moderately difficult for attackers to land successful hits. With 11 hit points, it can sustain a small amount of damage before being defeated, but it is not particularly resilient. The Guard's speed is typical, allowing it to move at a rate of 30 feet per turn. Its challenge rating is 1/8, which indicates that it is not a formidable opponent, typically posing minimal threat to more experienced adventurers. The creature's primary strength lies in its basic combat capabilities, particularly its spear attack, but it lacks any significant special abilities or spells, making it relatively straightforward in terms of encounters.

The Guard's statistics are as follows:

- Strength: 10, which is average. Its modifier of +0 means it is not particularly strong or effective in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 12, yielding a +1 modifier, indicating a slightly above-average agility, which can help in dodging attacks or performing tasks that require finesse.
- Constitution: 12, also granting a +1 modifier. This provides the Guard with a decent level of endurance and helps with its overall hit points.
- Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma all sit at 10, which is average, translating to a +0 modifier for each. This means the Guard does not excel in mental attributes and has no particular advantages or disadvantages in interaction or perception checks beyond its skills.

In terms of skills, the Guard has a +2 bonus in perception, reflecting its ability to notice its surroundings and detect potential threats or intruders. Its passive perception score is 12, which is decent for spotting ambushes or hidden enemies. The Guard is capable of understanding any one language, allowing for basic communication, but it does not necessarily possess the ability to speak fluently.

The Guard can perform the following action:

- **Spear:** This is a melee or ranged weapon attack. The Guard has a +2 modifier to hit, making it an average attacker when using this weapon. The spear has a reach of 5 feet for melee combat or a range of 20 feet for short-range and 60 feet for long-range targets. If the attack is successful, it deals 3 piercing damage (1d6), which can contribute to the overall damage output in encounters, albeit limited due to its low hit points.

Overall, while the Guard can present a challenge in numbers or as a defensive unit, it is not likely to create significant obstacles for a well-prepared party.
