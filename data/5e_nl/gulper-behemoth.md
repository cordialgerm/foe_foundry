The Gulper Behemoth is a gargantuan monstrosity, primarily characterized by its immense size and aquatic nature, making it a formidable adversary in water-based environments. With an Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of 188 hit points, it can absorb a significant amount of damage before being incapacitated. This creature boasts impressive physical strength with a Strength score of 20, allowing it to inflict considerable damage and excel in grappling opponents. However, it is hampered by poor Dexterity and Intelligence scores, resulting in average agility and tactical awareness. The Gulper Behemoth can be vulnerable to piercing damage, and while it has resistances to acid and thunder damage and immunity to being blinded, it is unable to attack effectively when deafened. Overall, its strengths lie in its raw power and its ability to control the battlefield through grappling, area damage, and stunning effects, though its limitations in mobility and environmental adaptability may introduce weaknesses in combat.

The attributes of the Gulper Behemoth are as follows: 
- Strength: 20 (+5) - Exceptional effectiveness in physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0) - Average effectiveness; poses no significant advantages or disadvantages.
- Constitution: 19 (+4) - Very good durability and resilience.
- Intelligence: 4 (-3) - Very bad cognitive abilities, limiting strategic options.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0) - Average awareness and perception.
- Charisma: 5 (-3) - Very bad social interactions and presence.

In terms of special abilities, the Gulper Behemoth has several notable features:
- **Death Burst:** This ability triggers when the behemoth drops to 0 hit points, resulting in an explosive burst of acid damage. Creatures within a 40-foot radius must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) acid damage, making it dangerous to engage the behemoth closely.
- **Echolocation:** Though it has blindsight, this ability is nullified if the behemoth is deafened, reducing its effectiveness in limited sensory conditions.
- **Keen Hearing:** The behemoth has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that are hearing-based, reflecting its acute senses in detecting threats in the aquatic environment.
- **Water Breathing:** It can only breathe underwater, which constrains its movement outside of aquatic settings.

For its actions, the Gulper Behemoth can perform the following:
- **Bite:** It may make a melee attack with a +9 to hit, reaching up to 10 feet. A successful hit results in 40 (6d10 + 7) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it is grappled with an escape DC of 16. This ability effectively restrains the opponent while allowing further attacks on other targets to cease until the grapple is released.
- **Swallow:** This action allows the behemoth to consume a grappled Large or smaller creature. If the bite attack hits, the target is swallowed and suffers from blindness and restraint, taking 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behemoth's turns. Swallowed creatures have total cover from external attacks but can be regurgitated if the behemoth sustains sufficient damage.
- **Sonic Pulse (Recharge 5-6):** The behemoth can emit a sonic pulse in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) thunder damage and be stunned until the end of their next turn. Those that succeed take half damage and remain unaffected by the stunning effect.

The combination of its formidable melee capabilities, area control through sonic pulses, and the hazard of its death burst makes the Gulper Behemoth a significant threat in underwater encounters, providing challenges that players must tactically navigate.
