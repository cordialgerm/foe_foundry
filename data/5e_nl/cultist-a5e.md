The Cultist is a medium humanoid creature typically serving as a follower of sinister entities and forbidden deities. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, Cultists are relatively weak but can still pose a threat when encountered in groups or within the context of their dark rituals. Cultists possess a decent Dexterity score, allowing them to be agile in combat, but they lack in other attributes, making them fragile and vulnerable in direct confrontations. Their special ability, Fanatic, grants them an advantage against being charmed or frightened by non-cultist foes, reflecting their unwavering devotion. While they may not be individually powerful, their association with darker powers can lead to dangerous situations for adventurers.

The Cultist has an Armor Class of 12, which is average for their Challenge Rating, providing them with a moderate defense that can be bypassed by most attackers. They have 9 hit points, which is very low, making them easy to defeat if targeted effectively. Their movement speed is 30 feet, typical for most humanoids.

In terms of ability scores, the Cultist has the following values: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 10 (+0), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 10 (+0). The Dexterity score is good, enabling them to perform tasks requiring agility and to have a favorable initiative in combat. However, their other scores are average, indicating they are not particularly strong or resilient. The Cultist has skills in Deception and Religion, both providing a +2 modifier, which is average and allows them to be somewhat convincing and knowledgeable about their dark beliefs. Their passive Perception is 10, which is very bad; they are not particularly aware of their surroundings.

Cultists can communicate in one additional language of their choice, reflecting their adaptability in different environments.

The Cultist's special ability, Fanatic, means that they have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened by any creatures not associated with their cult. This ability significantly enhances their survival when facing those who would instill fear or attempt to manipulate them.

In terms of actions, the Cultist can attack with a Dagger, making a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit, which is good. The dagger has a reach of 5 feet for melee or a range of 20/60 feet for ranged attacks, targeting one creature. On a successful hit, it deals 4 piercing damage (1d4 + 2), which is fairly low, reflecting their role as a minor threat rather than a frontline combatant.

Overall, the Cultist serves an important role within their sinister narrative, often acting as an expendable servant to greater evils, and they can provide both narrative depth and tactical challenges in a campaign setting. Their commitment to their cult can also lead to interesting interactions with players, especially if their motivations and the larger threats they contribute to become apparent.
