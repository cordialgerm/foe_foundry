The Ash Drake is a small dragon classified as neutral evil, known for its cunning and stealth. With an armor class of 16, it is well protected due to its natural armor. It has a solid 117 hit points, giving it good staying power in combat. This creature moves quickly, walking at a speed of 60 feet and flying at 30 feet, which allows it to engage or escape effectively. Its challenge rating of 4 indicates it can pose a significant threat, offering 1,100 experience points when defeated. The Ash Drake possesses noteworthy abilities, including damage immunity to fire, which enhances its survivability against many attacks. However, it has low intelligence, which limits its use of tactics or spellcasting. 

The Ash Drake's attributes are well-rounded, with noteworthy physical stats: a Strength of 14 (good), Dexterity of 15 (good), and Constitution of 16 (very good). Its Wisdom score is 15 (good), reflecting its perceptiveness, while its Intelligence of 9 (bad) indicates poor problem-solving capabilities. The Charisma score of 10 is average, suggesting it can communicate but lacks any particular charm or presence. The Ash Drake excels in Dexterity saving throws with a +4 modifier which is considered good, and it is proficient in Stealth, also with a +4 modifier, making it very effective in sneaky tactics. 

The Ash Drake's special ability called Firesight allows it to see clearly through fire, smoke, and fog, granting it significant tactical advantages in combat situations involving obscured visibility. This ability enhances its ability to engage opponents effectively, even in challenging environments.

In combat, the Ash Drake can perform a Multiattack, adding flexibility to its offensive strategies. It makes one Bite attack, which has a +4 to hit and can deal 9 piercing damage plus an additional 3 fire damage, making it a solid melee threat. Furthermore, it can use two Claw attacks per round, each with the same +4 to hit and inflicting 9 slashing damage. 

The Ash Cloud ability is a significant crowd control feature that recharges after a short duration. When activated, it creates a heavily obscured area around the drake, affecting any creature except for other Ash Drakes. Any creature that enters this area or starts its turn there must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 13 or risk becoming blinded, creating opportunities for the Ash Drake to attack without retaliation.

The Ash Breath ability is another powerful attack, available every 5 to 6 turns. It creates a 30-foot cone of blistering hot ash, forcing creatures within to make a Dexterity saving throw against the same DC of 13. On a failed save, creatures suffer 14 fire damage and become poisoned for a minute, making the Ash Drake exceptionally dangerous when surrounded by foes. If a creature succeeds on their saving throw, they take half damage and avoid being poisoned. Poisoned creatures can attempt to free themselves by saving at the end of their turns, prolonging the potential impact of the Ash Breath ability in group encounters.
