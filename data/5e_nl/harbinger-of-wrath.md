The Harbinger of Wrath is a formidable gargantuan construct characterized by its chaotic evil alignment. This creature possesses an exceptional armor class of 21, making it difficult to hit, and a staggering 297 hit points, allowing it to endure substantial damage in combat. The Harbinger is designed for melee combat with a speed of 50 feet, enabling it to swiftly engage with foes. With a challenge rating of 20, it presents a high-stakes encounter for adventurers. Its strengths lie in its superior physical attributes, particularly its strong Strength score of 28, which provides a +9 modifier, allowing for devastating melee attacks, and its excellent Constitution score of 22, giving it a +6 modifier that bolsters its hit points and resilience. However, its Dexterity score of 8 results in a -1 modifier, making it quite slow and less agile. Notably, the Harbinger's damage immunities to cold, fire, poison, psychic, and nonmagical attacks not made with adamantine weapons, alongside its array of special abilities, make it a particularly dangerous opponent.

The Harbinger of Wrath has several notable special abilities. It wields adamantine weapons, making its attacks magical and capable of bypassing many forms of damage resistance. Its Immutable Form grants it immunity to any spells or effects that would alter its physical state. The creature benefits from legendary resistance three times per day, allowing it to succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail, signifying its formidable nature. Additionally, the Harbinger has magic resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it exceptionally hard to control or influence with magic.

In combat, the Harbinger can utilize a multiattack action, allowing it to make two slam attacks per turn. Each slam attack has a +15 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, and deals significant bludgeoning damage of 36 on a hit, while also potentially grappling targets, which can restrict their movements. If the Harbinger has a creature grappled, it can use the Impale action to make a single attack against that creature, causing it to become restrained and take ongoing damage from being impaled. The restrained state can make it challenging for the target or allies to aid the impaled creature without expending significant resources or actions.

The Harbinger possesses two powerful recharge actions: Drain Life and Spike Volley. Drain Life allows it to sap the vitality from an impaled creature, requiring the target to succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or suffer a massive 55 necrotic damage. If the target dies from this attack, its soul is absorbed by the Harbinger, reaffirming the gravity of facing such a foe. The Harbinger also regains hit points equal to the damage inflicted. Spike Volley allows it to launch a barrage of adamantine spikes in a 60-foot radius, forcing all creatures in that area to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail suffer 42 piercing damage, while successful saves result in halved damage, demonstrating the Harbinger's lethal ability to control the battlefield.

Overall, the Harbinger of Wrath is an exceptionally powerful adversary that combines immense physical might with debilitating abilities, presenting significant threats to any adventurers who face it.
