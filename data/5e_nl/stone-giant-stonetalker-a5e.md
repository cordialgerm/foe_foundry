- Multiattack allows it to strike twice with its greatclub or with rocks, increasing its damage output significantly.
- Greatclub attacks have a +9 to hit, reach of 15 ft., dealing an average of 19 bludgeoning damage. If it hits a Large or smaller creature, the target must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or fall prone.
- The Rock attack also uses a +9 to hit and deals an average of 20 bludgeoning damage. It has the added effect of pushing smaller creatures away and knocking them prone on a failed DC 19 Strength saving throw.
