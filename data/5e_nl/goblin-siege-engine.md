With a Challenge Rating of 11, it is a significant adversary in battle. Notably, it has high Strength and Constitution scores, making it exceptionally resilient and capable of dealing out damage.

The Constitution score of 20 grants it a +5 modifier, contributing to its very good durability, while its Intelligence is a low 3, resulting in a very bad modifier of -4, indicating it has little capacity for complex thought. The Wisdom score of 11 provides an average modifier of +0, while its very low Charisma of 1 leads to a -5 modifier, making it ineffective in social interactions. The Siege Engine has a base speed of 30 feet and possesses passive perception at a basic level of 10.

The Goblin Siege Engine showcases various special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. "Adaptable Locomotion" allows it to move freely through difficult terrain without any movement penalties, and it gains advantage on ability checks and saving throws to escape grapples or the restrained condition. It has "Construct Nature," meaning it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, enhancing its endurance in prolonged engagements. The "Defensive Mount" ability allows it to serve as a mount for other creatures, providing half-cover to those positioned within its turret. The "Immutable Form" grants it immunity to form-altering spells or effects, while "Magic Resistance" gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. Finally, its "Siege Monster" trait means it deals double damage to objects and structures, making it devastating against fortifications.

In terms of actions, the Goblin Siege Engine can perform a "Multiattack," which allows it to make three Slam attacks in one turn. Each Slam is executed as a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit modifier, targeting a single creature within 10 feet and dealing an average of 22 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 3d10+6. Additionally, it has an "Acid Jet" attack that can be used after a recharge of 5 or 6, which involves spraying a jet of acid in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures caught in the line take an average of 40 acid damage, represented as 9d8, with a DC of 17 for Dexterity saving throws to halve the damage. This ability further reinforces its role as a destructive machine on the battlefield.
