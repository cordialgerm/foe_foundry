The Ur-Otyugh is a large aberration that serves as a formidable foe in combat, typically encountered in environments such as underground lairs and polluted waters. It boasts a strong physical presence with a formidable armor class of 14, allowing it to withstand attacks from players. With 144 hit points, derived from a combination of 17d10 plus 51, it has a solid endurance, making it a challenging opponent. Although its Dexterity score is average at 10, the Ur-Otyugh excels in Strength and Constitution, with scores of 16, giving it a good modifier of +3. This translates to a very good effectiveness in grappling and resisting physical effects. However, the creature's Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom scores are relatively low, indicating that it may not be the most strategic or charismatic foeâ€”this could be exploited during interactions or by spellcasters. It has a challenge rating of 10, which suggests it is suitable for encounters with a party of around five moderately experienced adventurers.

The Ur-Otyugh possesses some notable abilities, including Legendary Resistance, which allows it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw twice per day. However, using this ability comes at a cost, reducing its overall speed and effectiveness in subsequent turns as it becomes slower and loses one of its legendary actions each time it uses this ability. Its primary actions involve grappling and restraining foes with its tentacles, dealing a combined total of 11 bludgeoning and piercing damage on a successful hit. If it successfully grapples a creature, that target becomes restrained until it escapes. The Ur-Otyugh can also slam targets it is grappling into surfaces or into each other, forcing them to make a Strength saving throw or suffer significant bludgeoning damage and become stunned.

As a bonus action, the Ur-Otyugh can bite, dealing 12 piercing damage while also having a chance to inflict a debilitating disease that lowers the target's hit point maximum over time. This can create ongoing complications for the affected characters in the campaign. If it manages to bite and stun a Medium or smaller creature, it can swallow them whole, granting total cover from external attacks while inflicting continuous acid damage each turn.

For its legendary actions, the Ur-Otyugh can swiftly move, make an extended tentacle attack, or unleash a powerful psionic attack called Mental Fuzz. This last ability affects creatures within 30 feet that are non-aberrations, dealing psychic damage and potentially stunning them, which can dramatically shift the tide of battle in its favor. Overall, the Ur-Otyugh's combination of physical strength, grappling abilities, and disease-inflicting bite makes it a serious threat that requires strategic planning to overcome.
