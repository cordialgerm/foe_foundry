The Albino Death Weasel is a large beast that exemplifies cunning and ferocity in its natural habitat. It possesses a solid combination of speed and strength, making it a dangerous adversary despite its unaligned nature. The creature has an Armor Class of 13, which is relatively average for a creature of its challenge rating, and it boasts 45 hit points, allowing it to endure a decent amount of damage in combat. With a challenge rating of 1, it is considered a low-level threat, thus rewarding its defeat with 200 experience points. Notable traits of the Albino Death Weasel include its remarkable senses and the ability to incapacitate its prey with effective grappling and poison attacks, making it a formidable opponent that can disrupt the strategies of adventurers.

The creature’s attributes indicate a well-rounded combatant, with a Strength of 16, granting it a good +3 modifier, making its physical attacks fairly effective. Its Dexterity of 14 gives it a good +2 modifier, enhancing its ability to dodge attacks and improve its stealth. The Constitution of 15 also provides a solid +2 modifier, contributing to its overall durability. However, its intelligence is very low (4), leading to a -3 modifier, meaning it cannot engage in complex strategies or tactics. While its Wisdom is decent (15), yielding a +2 modifier, it aids in perception checks, and its Charisma is very poor (5), resulting in a -3 modifier, indicating a lack of social grace or intimidation power.

The Albino Death Weasel has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Keen Hearing and Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell, making it exceptionally aware of its surroundings. The Pounce ability allows the weasel to charge at a target and potentially knock it prone, which creates an opening for a bite attack, significantly increasing its damage potential in a single turn if the target fails a DC 13 Strength saving throw.

In terms of actions, the Albino Death Weasel can execute a Bite attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 8 piercing damage on a successful hit. Similarly, its Claw attack also has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 5 slashing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, the claw attack can grapple the target with an escape DC of 13, restraining it and preventing the weasel from attacking another target until the grapple ends. This ability to grapple gives the Albino Death Weasel control over smaller foes, making it a strong tactician in close combat.

Additionally, the weasel possesses a unique Musk Spray ability that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. When activated, it releases a foul musk in a 20-foot cone, requiring creatures in that area to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for up to 1 minute. The poisoned condition can severely hinder creatures' abilities in combat, providing a strategic advantage to the weasel. Affected creatures can attempt to free themselves by repeating the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, offering them a chance to recover from the poison but also potentially inviting further damage from the albino death weasel in subsequent turns.
