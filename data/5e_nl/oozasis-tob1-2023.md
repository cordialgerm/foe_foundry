The Oozasis is a gargantuan, amorphous ooze creature that presents itself as an oasis in desert environments, making it a deceptive and formidable foe. Its high hit points and resilience to most types of damage, along with its ability to grapple multiple targets, give it considerable staying power in combat. The Oozasis has a unique ability to ensnare creatures with its waters, which can compel them into performing tasks that serve its long-term plans. However, its low Armor Class and weak Dexterity make it relatively easy to hit, and its vulnerability to cold attacks can be exploited by savvy adventurers. Overall, the Oozasis is both a threatening combatant and a clever manipulator, using its abilities to influence the actions of characters in unexpected ways.

In terms of statistics, the Oozasis has the following attributes: Strength is 18, which provides a good modifier of +4; Dexterity is 5, resulting in a bad modifier of -3; Constitution is exceptionally high at 20, granting a +5 modifier; Intelligence is below average at 8, giving it a -1 modifier; Wisdom is 20, also exceptionally high with a +5 modifier; and Charisma is average at 13, with a +1 modifier. It has saving throw benefits with Intelligence +3, Wisdom +9 (very good), and Charisma +5 (good). The creature has skills in Deception +5, History +3, Insight +9 (very good), and Perception +9 (very good). Damage vulnerabilities include cold, while it is immune to acid damage and has resistance to fire damage as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It is completely immune to conditions including blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, and prone. Its sensory abilities include blindsight up to 120 feet and a passive Perception of 19. Although it can understand all languages, it cannot speak and instead communicates through telepathy within 120 feet.

The Oozasis has several special abilities that enhance its gameplay mechanics. The Amorphous ability enables it to move through narrow spaces with ease, making standard movement restrictive for its attackers. The Oasis Appearance ability allows it to blend seamlessly into its environment when motionless, providing a strategic advantage. Its Ooze Nature trait eliminates the need for sleep, making it a perpetual threat. The Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion can seriously manipulate creatures drinking its water, leading them into cryptic obedience through a geas spell.

In terms of actions, the Oozasis can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Pseudopod attacks on its turn. The Pseudopod itself is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, dealing an average of 20 damage consisting of bludgeoning and acid. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it becomes grappled, resulting in it being restrained with an escape DC of 16. Furthermore, the Oozasis can leverage its Compelling Vapors ability, which recharges after usage on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability forces creatures within 20 feet to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw; failure results in significant psychic damage and a disturbing effect (either tranquility, where they cannot attack, or turmoil, where they must attack the nearest creature). Successful saves reduce the damage and negate the effects, but affected creatures can attempt to shake off the effects at the end of each turn.

Overall, the Oozasis presents unique challenges for adventurers, both in face-to-face combat and through its cunning capabilities to manipulate and control those who venture too close.
