The Wererat is a Medium humanoid with lycanthropic traits, functioning as a cunning and stealthy adversary in combat scenarios. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it is considered a moderate threat, especially when it employs tactics that take advantage of its surroundings and allies. The Wererat has a robust Dexterity modifier of +4, which provides it with good agility and the ability to excel in stealth. Its Hit Points total 57, giving it decent durability, but its lack of a strong Strength and Charisma suggests it relies more on cunning and dexterity than brute force. Notably, it possesses a unique ability to transform into a rat, which enhances its stealth capabilities and allows it to employ various tactics based on the form it assumes.

The Wererat's attributes include: 
- Strength: 10 (modifier +0, effectiveness: average)
- Dexterity: 18 (modifier +4, effectiveness: very good)
- Constitution: 12 (modifier +1, effectiveness: average)
- Intelligence: 10 (modifier +0, effectiveness: average)
- Wisdom: 10 (modifier +0, effectiveness: average)
- Charisma: 8 (modifier -1, effectiveness: bad)

The creature has a darkvision that extends to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light. It boasts a Perception score of 12 which, bolstered by its heightened sense of smell, elevates its perception by smell to an impressive 17. This adjustment makes the Wererat particularly adept at tracking and hunting. The Stealth score of 14 allows it to blend into shadows effectively, which complements its role as an ambusher.

Special abilities include:
- Heightened Smell: This ability makes the Wererat exceptionally skilled at detecting creatures based on scent, enhancing its Perception when used this way.
- Pack Tactics: This ability grants the Wererat advantage on attack rolls against a target, provided that at least one ally is within close proximity. This significantly increases its chances of hitting when engaging in group attacks.

In terms of actions, the Wererat can perform the following:
- Multiattack: In human or hybrid form, the Wererat can make three attacksâ€”either with Claw or Shortsword, or opt for three ranged attacks with a Hand Crossbow. It can also replace one of its attacks with a Bite attack when in rat or hybrid form.
- Bite: In rat or hybrid form, the Wererat can attack a target with a +4 to hit, inflicting 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage. Additionally, humanoid targets that take damage must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become cursed with lycanthropy.
- Claw: When in rat or hybrid form, it can slash at enemies with a +4 to hit, dealing the same damage of 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing.
- Shortsword: In humanoid or hybrid form, it can strike with a Shortsword, also at +4 to hit, for 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.
- Hand Crossbow: This ranged weapon attack in humanoid or hybrid form has a +4 to hit and can strike at a distance of up to 120 feet, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

The Wererat can also utilize a bonus action:
- Change Shape: This ability allows the Wererat to transform into a small rat, a rat-humanoid hybrid, or revert back to its true humanoid form. While in any form, it maintains the same statistics except for its size and speed, and it does not transform its equipment. If the Wererat dies, it reverts to its humanoid form.

Overall, the Wererat excels in stealth and tactical advantage through its transformations and pack tactics, posing a threat to unsuspecting adventurers.
