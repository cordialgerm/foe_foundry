The Obsidian Ophidian is a huge elemental creature that represents a unique blend of power and resilience derived from its fiery environment. With a challenge rating of 5, it can pose a significant threat to adventurers, thanks not only to its formidable physical attacks but also its distinct abilities that enhance its survivability in combat. It has an impressive armor class of 16, providing good defense, and its hit points total 136, reflecting its ability to withstand prolonged battles. Notably, this creature is vulnerable to bludgeoning and cold damage, which can be exploited by clever adventurers. Its skills and condition immunities make it a tough opponent, as it can effectively resist a range of debilitating effects.

The Obsidian Ophidian has the following ability scores: Strength at 17, granting a good modifier of +3; Dexterity at 15, resulting in a decent +2 modifier; Constitution at 18, giving it a very good +4 modifier; Intelligence at 5, yielding a very bad -3 modifier; Wisdom at 12, producing an average +1 modifier; and Charisma at 7, translating to a bad -2 modifier. The creature has a skill proficiency in Perception with a total modifier of +1, allowing it to be aware of its surroundings but not exceptionally so. 

It possesses several notable special abilities:
- **Lava Walker:** This ability allows the Obsidian Ophidian to traverse lava effortlessly, moving across its surface as if it were solid ground. It can swim through lava at its walking speed without harm.
- **One with Lava:** The ophidian cannot be surprised by creatures that are within 5 feet of lava, and it can sense any creature touching the same pool of lava it occupies.
- **Sharp Fragments:** When the creature receives bludgeoning damage, shards of obsidian scatter, dealing 2 piercing damage (1d4) to any creature within 5 feet of it as they are struck by flying fragments.
- **Volcanic Rejuvenation:** This ability allows the ophidian to regain 10 hit points at the start of its turn, provided part of its body is in contact with lava. However, if it takes cold damage, this ability becomes inactive for the next turn. Importantly, it will only die if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and cannot regenerate.

In combat, the Obsidian Ophidian can perform multiple attacks due to its **Multiattack** feature. It can make two Bites or one Bite and one Constrict. 
- **Bite:** This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts damage of 12 (2d8 +3) piercing. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take ongoing damage of 5 (2d4) piercing at the start of its turns as shards of obsidian remain lodged in its wound. The shards can be removed using an action and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check, or they will disintegrate if the target receives magical healing.
- **Constrict:** This melee attack also has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled, with an escape DC of 15. While grappled, the target is restrained and takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage at the start of its turns.
- **Lava Splash (Recharge 4â€“6):** This special attack allows the ophidian to splash lava in all directions. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 fire damage (6d6). To use Lava Splash, the Ophidian must be touching or within 5 feet of lava.

Overall, the Obsidian Ophidian represents a formidable foe that excels in both offense and defense when in its natural fiery environment, making it a challenging encounter for adventurers who dare cross its path.
