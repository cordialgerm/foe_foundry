The Rug of Smothering is a large construct designed to ambush unsuspecting adventurers. Its deceptive appearance allows it to blend in with the environment, often catching characters off guard as it springs to life. With an Armor Class of 12 and a total of 45 hit points, it can endure a moderate amount of damage. The creature has strong physical attributes, particularly in Strength, which is rated at 16, giving it a very good +3 modifier. This creature operates primarily in close quarters, using its ability to grapple opponents to restrain them while simultaneously dealing damage. However, with inherent weaknesses such as being susceptible to dispel magic, where a DC of 19 is required to destroy it, it is crucial for adventurers to be mindful of their magical capabilities during encounters.

In terms of statistics, the Rug of Smothering has the following attributes: Strength at 16 (+3), Dexterity at 14 (+2), Constitution at 14 (+2), Intelligence at 1 (-5), Wisdom at 10 (+0), and Charisma at 1 (-5). The creature's Dexterity and Constitution provide it with good agility and endurance, while its intelligence and Charisma scores reflect its ineffectiveness in mental contests, making it vulnerable to certain magical effects.

The Rug of Smothering has several resistances and immunities that make it a resilient opponent. It is immune to poison and psychic damage, and resistant to bludgeoning damage. It cannot be blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, which provides a good level of protection against various status effects. The creature also possesses blindsight out to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its environment effectively despite its blindness beyond this radius.

Regarding its special abilities, the Rug of Smothering is considered a spell-created entity, which means that to destroy it using dispel magic, an opposing player must meet or exceed a difficulty class of 19. Additionally, the rug can appear as an ordinary rug while motionless, allowing it to effectively deceive characters until it chooses to engage.

In terms of actions, the primary action the Rug of Smothering can take is its "Smother" attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. It can target one Large or smaller creature within its reach (5 feet). Upon a successful hit, the targeted creature is grappled with an escape difficulty of 13. While the creature is grappled, it is restrained and unable to breathe. Notably, if the Rug takes damage while grappling, it only suffers half of that damage, with the other half applying to the grappled target. This ability allows the Rug of Smothering to sustain itself while inflicting harm on its victim, limiting the effectiveness of its opponent's counter-attacks.

Additionally, the Rug can perform a "Squeeze" action, which inflicts 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage to a creature it has grappled. This action enhances its ability to deal damage while maintaining control over opponents, making it a threatening foe in close combat scenarios.
