The Mountain Giant can use legendary actions to further influence the battle. Grasping Soil allows the giant to restrain multiple targets with a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, creating a formidable area control tactic. The Roar, which costs two actions, causes nearby creatures to take thunder damage and may knock them prone, adding chaos to the battlefield. The Spawn Elemental ability, requiring three actions, lets the Mountain Giant create an earth elemental to assist in combat, granting it additional tactical support on the battlefield. The Mountain Giant can control up to five earth elementals at once, making it a formidable opponent that can summon allies while wreaking havoc on its enemies.
