The Vampire Mage is a powerful Medium Undead being that serves as a formidable adversary in any encounter. With an impressive hit point total and a high armor class, this creature is not only resilient but also capable of inflicting devastating damage through both spellcasting and melee attacks. The Vampire Mage is particularly notable for its combination of spellcasting abilities and its innate vampire powers, which allow it to charm, regenerate, and evade attacks effectively. However, it has weaknesses, especially against radiant damage and certain types of spells, making tactical play essential when facing it. The creature has a challenge rating of 13, indicating its ability to pose a significant threat to a party of adventurers.

The Vampire Mage has the following ability scores: Strength is 20 with a +5 modifier, which is very good, Dexterity is 18 with a +4 modifier, which is good, Constitution is 20 with a +5 modifier, which is very good, Intelligence is 16 with a +3 modifier, which is average, Wisdom is 16 with a +3 modifier, which is average, and Charisma is 18 with a +4 modifier, which is good. The saving throws for the Vampire Mage are Dexterity +8, Wisdom +7, and Charisma +8, all of which are good. It possesses skills in perception at +7, persuasion at +8, and stealth at +8, indicating exceptional capabilities in manipulation and evasion. The creature has damage resistances against necrotic damage and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, making it more difficult to harm. Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 17, which is also good. The Vampire Mage can speak the languages it knew in life.

The Vampire Mage exhibits several special abilities. It has Legendary Resistance (3/day), allowing it to succeed on a failed saving throw, but it visibly ages each time it does this, reverting to its original appearance after a long rest. Misty Recovery allows the Vampire Mage to turn into mist when it drops to 0 hit points, instead of becoming unconscious, and it must return to its resting place within 2 hours to recover. Regeneration enables it to regain 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it did not take radiant damage since its last turn, which is exceptional. The Spider Climb ability allows the vampire to traverse difficult surfaces and even ceilings. However, it has weaknesses, such as taking 20 radiant damage if it ends its turn in sunlight or running water, and it cannot use its Regeneration or Mist Form abilities while affected by these weaknesses. The Resting Place is a required lair feature, where the vampire needs to rest for at least an hour each day, and if disturbed by spells like bless or hallow, it can be destroyed. 

In terms of spellcasting, the Vampire Mage serves as a 7th level spellcaster with an Intelligence-based spellcasting ability, having a spell save DC of 15. Its spells include cantrips such as mage hand and minor illusion, which provide utility in manipulation and deception. At the 1st level, it can cast disguise self to alter its appearance and shield to improve its defense. Its 2nd-level spells include darkness, which creates an area of magical darkness, and misty step, allowing it to teleport short distances. At the 3rd level, it can cast animate dead to raise undead minions and fireball, a powerful area damage spell that deals fire damage to targets in its area of effect. Lastly, the Vampire Mage can use blight as a 4th-level spell to drain the life energy from a target, dealing significant necrotic damage.

During combat, the Vampire Mage utilizes various actions. The Grab attack allows it to inflict melee weapon damage while grappling a target, which becomes restrained and vulnerable to further attacks. The Charm ability can incapacitate a creature for 24 hours, making it a willingly targeted victim for its bite. Additionally, the Vampire Mage can unleash a fireball on opponents using a well-spaced attack that forces creatures to make a Dexterity saving throw to reduce the damage taken. The blight spell is particularly devastating against living creatures and plants, requiring a Constitution saving throw to mitigate damage.

Bonus actions include the Bite, a powerful attack that deals piercing and necrotic damage and can reduce the target's hit point maximum while healing the Vampire Mage. The Hissing Scuttle reaction allows the Vampire Mage to escape a situation following radiant damage taken, while Warding Charm can preemptively charm an attacker. The Shield reaction provides a momentary defensive boost to its AC and immunity to magic missiles.

Legendary actions are additional ways the Vampire Mage can act outside its turn, allowing it to use Charm or make a Grab attack or transform into mist or a beast shape, enhancing its versatility and survivability in combat.
