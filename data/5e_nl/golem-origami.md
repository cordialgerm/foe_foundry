The Origami Golem is a large construct creature that embodies versatility through its unique forms. This creature possesses a significant amount of hit points, making it durable in combat, and its armor class is reasonably high due to its natural armor. The Golem excels in mobility with a combination of flight and walking speed, allowing it to engage enemies effectively. One of its key strengths is its magical resistance, granting it the advantage on saving throws against spells, enhancing its survivability against magic users. However, it is vulnerable to fire damage, which can be a significant weakness. Its intelligence is notably low, making it an unaligned entity without the ability to communicate verbally, though it understands languages spoken by its creator. The Golem can shift between different forms, such as a dragon, swan, or frog, each presenting unique abilities and combat tactics. 

The Origami Golem has an armor class of 15, which provides a good defensive measure against physical attacks. It has 114 hit points, calculated from twelve ten-sided dice plus an additional 48, which provides an average durability making it formidable in prolonged engagements.

The Golem's skills include a perception score of +0, which makes it average at noticing hidden objects or creatures.

Additionally, it is immune to various conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, or frightened. Its darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and its passive perception score sits at 13.

Regarding the special abilities, the Golem's construct nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep. Its false appearance allows it to blend in as a regular paper artifact when motionless. It possesses immutable form, rendering it immune to spells or effects that alter its shape. With magic resistance, it has advantage on saving throws against spells, enhancing its durability in magical confrontations. The Golem’s weapon attacks are categorized as magical, providing an advantage when engaging foes with certain resistances. Lastly, its standing leap ability allows it to jump impressive distances, giving it tactical options during battle.

In terms of actions, the Origami Golem can perform a multiattack, delivering three attacks through either Lacerating Strike or Wing Buffet. The Lacerating Strike has a +6 to hit and inflicts an average of 16 slashing damage. Wing Buffet also has a +6 to hit, and when used, it inflicts 13 bludgeoning damage on its target, requiring them to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

The Golem can utilize its Hazardous Hop ability in frog form, dealing 33 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within 10 feet of where it lands, while forcing a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage and resist being knocked prone. The Shredded Breath ability, available in dragon form and recharging on a roll of 5-6, allows the Golem to exhale a cone of paper fragments, dealing 31 slashing damage to all creatures in the area and potentially blinding them until the end of their next turn with a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Alternatively, the Trumpeting Blast in swan form, also recharging on a roll of 5-6, emits a thunderous blast affecting all creatures in a 30-foot cone for 31 thunder damage and deafening them until the end of their next turn on a failed DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

As a bonus action, the Golem can fold into different forms, reshaping its body to resemble a large dragon, large swan, or medium frog. This shape-shifting ability retains its statistics, except for size adjustments, making it a versatile addition to any encounter. If the Golem falls in battle while in its folded form, it unfurls back into a large flat piece of fabric or paper, maintaining its unique identity to the end.
