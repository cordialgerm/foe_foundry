The Leech Swarm is a medium-sized unaligned beast that embodies a predatory and parasitic nature. With an Armor Class of 13 and 32 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage for its challenge rating of 2, representing moderate threat in combat scenarios. The creature thrives in aquatic environments, boasting a swimming speed of 40 feet, while its walking speed is limited to 10 feet. The Leech Swarm's dexterity is exceptional at +3, allowing it to be quite agile and stealthy, with a skill modifier of +5 in Stealth. However, it suffers from weak strength, with a value of just 5, and has significantly low intelligence and charisma. The swarm is adept at draining the life force from its victims, making it especially dangerous to those who are already wounded. On the downside, it is vulnerable in terms of limited damage resistance and cannot heal itself, making it rely on its offensive capabilities to secure victories in combat.

The attributes of the Leech Swarm are as follows: 

- Strength (STR) is 5, resulting in a modifier of -3, which is very bad for physical attacks and brawn-based checks.
- Dexterity (DEX) is 16, giving it a modifier of +3, which is exceptional, enhancing its agility and stealth capabilities.
- Constitution (CON) is 15, providing a modifier of +2, which is good and helps with overall hit point function.
- Intelligence (INT) is very low at 2, resulting in a modifier of -4, making it exceptionally poor in thinking or problem-solving.
- Wisdom (WIS) is 13, leading to a modifier of +1, which is average for perception and insight.
- Charisma (CHA) is also low at 4, generating a -3 modifier, which is very bad for social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Leech Swarm is proficient in Perception with a +3 modifier, allowing it to be aware of its surroundings to a good degree, and in Stealth with a +5, making it exceptionally skilled in sneaking up on its prey. It possesses resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, which slightly improves its durability in combat. It is immune to conditions such as being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned, which makes it difficult to control or incapacitate. The creature has darkvision up to 30 feet, providing it with good vision in dim light.

The Leech Swarm has notable special abilities:

- Blood Frenzy grants it advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have all its hit points, making it particularly lethal against injured foes.
- Blood Sense allows the swarm to detect non-undead and non-construct creatures within 30 feet solely by scent, showcasing its ability to hunt injured adversaries effectively.
- The Swarm ability lets the Leech Swarm occupy another creature's space and vice versa; it can also move through tight openings, although it cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

For its actions, the Leech Swarm can perform Bites as a melee weapon attack with a +5 modifier to hit. This attack has a reach of 0 feet, meaning it must be in the same space as the target. When hitting, it deals 14 piercing damage (4d6) or 7 piercing damage (2d6) if it has taken half or fewer of its total hit points. Additionally, if the target is not a construct or undead, it must pass a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in losing 2 hit points at the start of each turn due to leeches draining blood. A creature can attempt to remove these leeches with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check, or the leeches will detach if the target receives fire damage. This combination of abilities and attacks makes the Leech Swarm a dangerous opponent, especially when attacking weakened foes.
