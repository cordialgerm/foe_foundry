The Adult Bronze Dragon is a formidable and wise creature within the realm of Dungeons & Dragons 5e. This *Huge* Dragon stands as a powerful adversary or a potential ally, known for its ability to manipulate the elements, particularly the waters and storms. With an Armor Class of 18 and a substantial Hit Points total of 287, it can withstand significant damage in combat, making it a very tough opponent. The dragon has a Challenge Rating of 18, denoting it as a high-level threat capable of engaging well-prepared adventurers. Its primary strengths include a variety of powerful melee attacks, formidable breath weapons, and impressive innate spellcasting abilities, while its weaknesses may lie in its reliance on maintaining a higher Armor Class with its Legendary Resistance. 

In terms of attributes, the Adult Bronze Dragon possesses:
- Strength: 24 (+7), which is exceptional, allowing it to hit hard in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), which is average, indicating a lack of agility.
- Constitution: 22 (+6), very good, granting resilience against attacks and the ability to sustain damage.
- Intelligence: 16 (+3), good, making it quite clever and able to strategize effectively.
- Wisdom: 14 (+2), average, providing decent insight and perception.
- Charisma: 18 (+4), exceptional, enhancing its ability to influence and command.

For saving throws, the dragon has significant advantages: Dexterity +6 (average), Constitution +12 (very good), Wisdom +8 (good), and Charisma +10 (very good). In skills, it excels in insight +8 (good), perception +8 (good), and stealth +6 (average). It is immune to lightning damage and has blindsight up to 60 feet along with darkvision extending to 120 feet, giving it excellent sensory capabilities. It speaks Common, Draconic, and one additional language, allowing it to communicate effectively in various situations.

The Adult Bronze Dragon has several special abilities:
- Amphibious: This ability allows the dragon to breathe both air and water.
- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. However, if it uses this ability, its Armor Class drops to 16 until it completes a long rest.
- Oracle of the Coast: The dragon can predict weather patterns accurately for seven days and cannot be surprised while conscious. Additionally, it can cast scrying by spending one minute underwater, requiring no components.
- Innate Spellcasting: With a spellcasting ability based on Charisma, the dragon can cast spells like fog cloud, speak with animals, commune with nature, and speak with plants, each three times per day.

Regarding its actions, the Adult Bronze Dragon can attack multiple times in a turn:
- Multiattack: It can make one bite attack and two claw attacks, or use its Lightning Pulse in place of the bite.
- Bite: A melee weapon attack with a +13 to hit, this deals 23 piercing damage plus an additional 4 lightning damage.
- Claw: Another melee weapon attack with +13 to hit, dealing slashing damage of 20.
- Tail: With a reach of 15 feet, it can perform a tail attack, causing 20 bludgeoning damage and pushing the target 10 feet away.
- Trident: In humanoid form, it can attack with a trident at +13 to hit, for 10 piercing damage.
- Lightning Pulse: This ranged attack forces a target within 60 feet to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 22 lightning damage on a failure and half on a success. If the target is in contact with water, nearby creatures must also make the saving throw.
- Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6): The dragon possesses two powerful breath attacks. Lightning Breath requires creatures in a 90-foot line to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 69 lightning damage on a failed save (and preventing reactions until the end of its next turn) or half damage on success. Ocean Surge can push creatures a considerable distance, with those failing a DC 20 Strength saving throw pushed 30 feet and knocked prone; those who succeed are pushed only 15 feet.

The dragon also has unique capabilities with Change Shape, allowing it to transform into a humanoid or beast while retaining its statistics, barring size alterations. However, some of its attacks are restricted while in these forms.

In reactions, the dragon has a Tail Attack, enabling it to retaliate against melee attackers within 10 feet, making a tail attack as a response.

As for Legendary Actions, the Adult Bronze Dragon can perform three separate actions:
- Roar: It can frighten creatures within 120 feet by forcing them to make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in the frightened condition for one minute.
- Wing Attack: By beating its wings, the dragon can push creatures within 15 feet away while knocking them prone and then can fly half its speed.
- Foresight: By spending two legendary actions, the dragon can gain a predictive advantage that imposes disadvantage on attackers until its next turn.

Overall, the Adult Bronze Dragon is not only a potent combatant but also a creature of great intelligence and mystical prowess, making it a highly adaptable force on the battlefield and beyond.
