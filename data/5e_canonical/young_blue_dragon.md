<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>A Young Blue Dragon is an arrogant and strategic predator that rules over the deserts and arid regions it calls home. Its vibrant blue scales crackle with electrical energy, and its breath weapon releases devastating bolts of lightning. Even at this stage, Blue Dragons are master tacticians, using the terrain to their advantage and striking from unexpected angles. They often build their lairs beneath the sand, where they hide their growing hoards. Young Blue Dragons are proud and demanding, frequently subjugating weaker creatures to serve their needs and expand their influence.</summary>

<summary>The Young Blue Dragon is a formidable creature known for its agility and cunning. As a Large Dragon with a Challenge Rating of 10, it presents a significant challenge for adventurers, boasting 152 hit points, which allows it to endure sustained combat. With an Armor Class of 18, it is well-defended against many attacks, making it a resilient opponent. The dragon possesses exceptional strength, a solid constitution, and good charisma, allowing it not only to inflict heavy damage but also to execute powerful spells. Its speed is noteworthy, with the ability to fly at 80 feet, enabling it to strike from above, retreat quickly, or engage in aerial combat. While it is immune to lightning damage, its relatively low Dexterity can be considered both a strength, allowing for positional advantages, and a weakness, making it more susceptible to stealthy attacks if the terrain favors them.</summary>

<detail>

The Young Blue Dragon has a Strength score of 20, providing a +5 modifier, which is exceptional for physical attacks. Its Dexterity is average at 10, offering no bonus, which means it lacks finesse in agility. With a Constitution of 18 (+4), it has good durability against physical damage. An Intelligence of 14 (+2) gives it a keen tactical mind, while a Wisdom of 12 (+1) allows it to be perceptive but not exceptional. Its Charisma score of 16 (+3) supports its spellcasting ability. The dragon has saving throw bonuses of +4 for Dexterity, +8 for Constitution, +5 for Wisdom, and +7 for Charisma, making it particularly resilient against physical and magical attacks aimed at those attributes.

In terms of skills, the Young Blue Dragon has proficiency in perception, stealth, and survival, with bonuses of +5, +4, and +5 respectively, allowing it to be very good at identifying threats and adapting to its environment. It possesses damage immunity to lightning, which is critical in avoiding common elemental attacks. The dragon has blindsight and tremorsense out to 30 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive perception of 18, showcasing its keen awareness and ability to detect hidden enemies in various situations. It can communicate in both Common and Draconic languages.

The Young Blue Dragon has some unique special abilities enhancing its effectiveness in its natural desert habitat. With the Desert Farer trait, it can ignore difficult terrain or obstructions caused by sand and gravel while flying and is immune to the debilitating effects of extreme heat. The Dune Splitter ability allows it to submerge itself in sand or gravel for extended periods, providing advantage on Stealth checks, which can make it a dangerous predator lying in wait.

The dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma-based with a save DC of 15. It is capable of casting the spells blur and silent image three times each per day without requiring material components. The blur spell increases its chances of avoiding attacks, making it harder for enemies to hit, while silent image allows it to create deceptive illusions that can mislead opponents and provide tactical advantages.

In combat, the Young Blue Dragon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one bite attack and two claw attacks per turn. The bite attack has a +9 to hit with a 10-foot reach, dealing an average of 21 piercing damage plus an additional 4 lightning damage. The claw attacks also have a +9 to hit and deal an average of 14 slashing damage each. Its signature Lightning Breath ability can inflict massive area damage, allowing it to exhale a damaging line of lightning 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, suffering an average of 44 lightning damage on a failed save or half that on a successful one. Furthermore, a creature that fails the throw cannot take reactions until the end of its next turn, effectively limiting its ability to defend itself from subsequent attacks.

Overall, the Young Blue Dragon's combination of formidable physical attacks, tactical spellcasting, and special abilities makes it a versatile and dangerous adversary for any adventuring party.

The Young Blue Dragon is a formidable creature known for its mix of aerial agility and potent lightning abilities. As a Large dragon with a challenge rating of 9, it boasts an armor class of 18 due to its natural armor and an impressive pool of hit points at 175, making it a tough opponent in combat. This dragon's physical attributes are strong overall, with a good constitution of +8, which enhances its durability. Its dexterity of +4 and strength of +5 allow for both quick maneuvers and strong attacks. The dragon’s charisma of +7 enables it to be a master of intimidation and interaction, while its keen senses contribute to its ability to detect threats. The actions of the Young Blue Dragon include multiattacks combining bites and claws with added lightning damage, making it not only a challenging melee foe but also a significant threat from a distance with its lightning breath. However, while its strengths are notable, it can be overpowered by cunning strategies that exploit its weaknesses in spellcasting and reliance on its breath weapon.

The Young Blue Dragon possesses an impressive stat block: it has 5 for strength (good), 4 for dexterity (good), 8 for constitution (exceptional), 2 for intelligence (average), 5 for wisdom (good), and 7 for charisma (very good). 

In terms of senses, it has darkvision extending 120 feet and keen senses at 30 feet, which enhances its perception to a value of 19, allowing it to detect foes easily even in low light. Its stealth ability stands at 14, indicating a good but not exceptional competency in remaining undetected. The dragon can communicate in both Common and Draconic.

The Young Blue Dragon has a special ability called Charged Hide. This ability allows the dragon to build up an electric charge in its body when it hasn’t used its Lightning Breath. While this breath is available, it creates wild sparks of electricity around it. Any creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of its next turn, creating a substantial threat to nearby enemies.

In terms of actions, the Young Blue Dragon can perform a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 16 piercing damage along with an additional 5 lightning damage on a successful hit. The Claw attack also has a +9 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 12 slashing damage.

Additionally, the dragon has access to its infamous Lightning Breath, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This breath weapon allows it to exhale a line of lightning that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures caught in this line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw; a failed save results in 55 lightning damage (10d10), while a successful save halves the damage. This ability is a game-changer in combat, allowing the Young Blue Dragon to inflict significant damage over a wide area, making positioning crucial for enemies to avoid its devastating attacks.</detail>
