<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>A Young Blue Dragon is an arrogant and strategic predator that rules over the deserts and arid regions it calls home. Its vibrant blue scales crackle with electrical energy, and its breath weapon releases devastating bolts of lightning. Even at this stage, Blue Dragons are master tacticians, using the terrain to their advantage and striking from unexpected angles. They often build their lairs beneath the sand, where they hide their growing hoards. Young Blue Dragons are proud and demanding, frequently subjugating weaker creatures to serve their needs and expand their influence.</summary>
