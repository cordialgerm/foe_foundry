Its natural armor provides a robust defense with an Armor Class of 17, while it boasts a substantial pool of health at 172 hit points, typically reflecting its challenging nature for adventurers at a Challenge Rating of 9. Ammut excels in combat through strong physical attacks and unique abilities that inflict conditions upon its foes, particularly targeting undead creatures. Its strengths include high physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, with modifiers of +5 and +6 respectively, which are considered very good. However, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are average, showing that it may not excel in trickery or deception. Notably, Ammut has a variety of damage immunities and resistances, which further contribute to its resilience in battle.</summary>

<detail>

Ammut's Strength attribute is 20, granting it a +5 modifier, making it exceptionally powerful in physical interactions. Its Dexterity stands at 12 with a +1 modifier, which is considered average. The creature has a Constitution of 23, boasting a +6 modifier, giving it very good durability against attacks. Meanwhile, it has a low Intelligence of 6, resulting in a -2 modifier that is very bad, indicating limited problem-solving capabilities. Its Wisdom of 16 offers a +3 modifier, which is good, enhancing its perception skills. With a Charisma of 12, the ammut also maintains an average presence in social interactions.

Ammut has proficiency in certain saving throws: it receives +9 to Strength saving throws and +10 to Constitution saving throws, both of which are exceptional and reflect its physical prowess. On the skills front, it has a +11 modifier for Perception, also considered exceptional due to its high Wisdom score.

This celestial being has immunity to necrotic damage and resists cold and radiant damage, providing it with good protection against elemental attacks. It is also immune to the frightened condition, which prevents it from becoming cowardly during encounters. Ammut possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light. Its passive Perception score is an impressive 21.

Ammut's special abilities include Judging Aura, which allows it to stun any undead creature that starts its turn close to it unless they succeed in a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. This ability is particularly impactful in combat scenarios, neutralizing threats posed by undead. Additionally, its Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells, making it difficult for spellcasters to affect it with magical effects.

In terms of abilities related to combat, Ammut has a melee weapon attack known as Bite. It has a +9 to hit and can deal 32 piercing damage plus an additional 10 radiant damage on a successful hit. It can grapple targets that are Large or smaller, allowing it to restrain them. Additionally, Ammut has the Swallow action, which is devastating; if it manages to swallow a grappling target, that creature becomes blinded and restrained with total cover against outside effects. Should Ammut take sufficient damage from a swallowed creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or regurgitate the creature.

Ammut can also unleash a potent ability called Ghost Breath once per day, where it inhales the spirits of undead creatures in close proximity. This ability automatically destroys weaker undead and incapacitates stronger ones unless they pass a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Finally, the Absorb Spirit ability lets Ammut attempt to absorb the spirit of a creature trapped within it, requiring a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw to resist. Absorption leads to the target's destruction and heals Ammut based on the maximum hit points of the absorbed creature, emphasizing its natural role as a predator of the undead.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Judging Aura:** An undead creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the ammut must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the ammut's Judging Aura for the next 24 hours.
- **Magic Resistance:** The ammut has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Prison Belly:** The large belly of the ammut magically sustains the life of those trapped inside it. A creature caught in its belly doesn't need food, water, or air. The ammut can maintain one Medium or smaller creature this way as long as the ammut remains alive.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (5d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) radiant damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the ammut can't bite another target.
- **Swallow:** The ammut makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the ammut. An ammut can only have one Medium or smaller creature swallowed at a time.<br><br>If the ammut takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the ammut must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the ammut. If the ammut dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
- **Ghost Breath (1/Day):** The ammut inhales the tortured spirits of undead within 30 feet. Each undead creature of CR 1 and lower in the area is automatically destroyed. All other undead must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Absorb Spirit (1/Day):** The ammut attempts to absorb the spirit of a dead or undead creature in its belly. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be absorbed by the ammut. A creature absorbed this way is destroyed and can't be reanimated, though it can be restored to life by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell. The ammut regains hp equal to the absorbed creature's hp maximum.
