<summary>The Roachling Skirmisher is a small humanoid creature with a chaotic neutral alignment, often characterized by its agility and tricky nature. It has an Armor Class of 13, making it somewhat resilient, along with 21 hit points derived from rolling six six-sided dice, or 6d6. This creature has a walking speed of 25 feet and presents a challenge rating of 1/4, which means it is considered a low-level opponent, typically yielding 50 experience points when defeated. The Roachling Skirmisher excels in Dexterity-related tasks, reflected by its good Dexterity score of 14, which grants it a +2 modifier. This modifier allows the Roachling to effectively evade attacks and perform Acrobatics and Stealth maneuvers with a total bonus of +4 and +6 respectively, showcasing its exceptional natural ability to remain hidden and agile. However, its low Wisdom and Charisma scores of 9 and 8 respectively are indicative of its bad performance in social interactions and perception-based tasks.</summary>

<detail>

The Roachling Skirmisher possesses several special abilities that enhance its survivability and playstyle. It is classified as Hardy, providing immunity to diseases and granting it advantage on Constitution saving throws, making it tougher against effects that might incapacitate others. It has a notable disadvantage due to its Unpleasant Scent ability, which hampers its interactions with animals and humanoids alike unless it takes the time to bathe meticulouslyâ€”after which this trait is temporarily nullified for 24 hours.

In combat, the Roachling Skirmisher uses a Shortsword as its primary melee weapon, making a weapon attack with a bonus of +4 to hit and dealing an average of 5 piercing damage on a successful hit, calculated as 1d6 plus its Dexterity modifier. It also has the option to attack at range with a Dart, which also utilizes a +4 to hit bonus, reaching targets effectively within a distance of 20 feet to 60 feet. Hitting a target with a Dart inflicts an average of 4 piercing damage, calculated as 1d4 plus the same Dexterity modifier.

Overall, the Roachling Skirmisher melds agility and cunning, making it a suitable skirmisher on the battlefield, though its social and perceptual weaknesses might hinder it in various interactions outside of direct combat.</detail>
