<summary>The Rat King is a Medium-sized monstrosity characterized by its chaotic evil nature. As a sinister leader of the rats, this creature boasts a unique blend of stealth and resilience, making it a formidable opponent that can manipulate its environment to sow misfortune among its enemies. With a total of 76 hit points, an Armor Class of 14, and the ability to burrow, the Rat King possesses significant defensive capabilities. However, its Strength score is quite low at 6, which is very bad, while its Dexterity at 16 and Constitution at 18 are exceptional, allowing it to evade attacks and withstand damage effectively. The Rat King's challenge rating of 5 indicates that it is a suitable challenge for a party of mid-range level adventurers, offering 1,800 experience points upon defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The Rat King has an Armor Class of 14, indicating it has decent protection against attacks. With hit points totaling 76, derived from 9d8 plus 36, it can take considerable hits in combat. It has limited mobility for walking at 20 feet but can burrow at an impressive speed of 30 feet. Its low Strength (-2) makes it weak in physical confrontations, while its Dexterity (+3) enhances its agility and Stealth proficiency, granting a +6 modifier, which is good. The Rat King's Constitution (+4) contributes to its high endurance, making it tough to take down.

In terms of resistances, the Rat King is immune to poison damage and resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. This makes it quite resilient in physical encounters. Additionally, it is immune to a wide range of conditions such as charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and stunned, providing excellent protection against various effects that may hinder its actions. The Rat King has darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive perception of 12, allowing it to navigate effectively in low-light conditions. It can communicate in Common and Thieves' Cant, which enhances its ability to blend in with urban settings.

The Rat King's special abilities significantly augment its combat potential. Its "Keen Smell" ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to smell, helping it detect hidden foes or traps. The "Plague of Ill Omen" creates a magical aura around it, causing creatures starting their turn within 15 feet to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they suffer from disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the beginning of their next turn, creating a strategic advantage for the Rat King in combat.

In terms of actions, the Rat King can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two Bite attacks in a single turn. Each Bite attack has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 10 piercing damage along with an additional 7 poison damage. If the target is hit, they must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion and become infected with a disease. The ongoing effects of the disease are severe, requiring the afflicted creature to make saving throws at the end of long rests, risking further levels of exhaustion until the disease is cured.

The Rat King's ability to "Call Rats" once per day allows it to summon additional minions, adding 2d4 regular rats, 1d4 giant rats, or 1 swarm of rats to the battlefield, which creates a horde that can overwhelm opponents. These summoned rats act on the Rat King’s behalf for an hour or until dismissed.

Its reaction, "Absorption," enables the Rat King to absorb any friendly rat or swarm that begins its turn nearby. When achieved, the targeted creature dies, and the Rat King gains temporary hit points equal to the target's remaining hit points, enhancing its durability.

Overall, the Rat King is a cunning and resilient threat that leverages stealth, misfortune, and summoning to control the flow of battle, making it a dangerous encounter for adventurers.</detail>
