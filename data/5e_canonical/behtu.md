<summary>The Behtu is a small humanoid creature characterized by its chaotic evil nature, making it a formidable opponent in combat scenarios. With a solid armor class of 14, it possesses good defensive capabilities, while its hit points of 52, derived from eight six-sided dice plus a substantial constitution bonus, give it moderate endurance in battle. This creature boasts strong physical attributes, particularly in strength, dexterity, and constitution, all of which are rated at +3, marking them as good in effectiveness. However, its intelligence and wisdom attributes are average, and its charisma is notably poor at -2, which may affect its interactions and ability to influence others. The Behtu is capable of dealing significant damage with its melee attacks and has a powerful area-of-effect fire breath ability that can deal major damage to multiple targets.</summary>

<detail>

The Behtu’s armor class stands at 14, which is considered good and provides adequate protection for its size. It has 52 hit points, indicating a good level of durability for a challenge rating of 2. In terms of movement, it can walk at a speed of 20 feet. For saving throws, it has a +5 modifier to Dexterity saves, which is quite good, enhancing its chances of evading effects that require such rolls. In terms of skills, it has +5 in Athletics and Stealth, both of which are good and enable it to move stealthily and engage in physical activities effectively.

The Behtu possesses resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, allowing it to endure attacks that would ordinarily deal significant harm. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet, which enables it to see in low-light conditions effectively. It can communicate in its own language, Behtu, as well as Common and Infernal, giving it a fair range of communication options.

In terms of actions, the Behtu can execute a Multiattack, which allows it to make both a Bite attack and a Spear attack in the same turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage upon a successful hit. The Spear attack can be made either as a melee or ranged attack with the same +5 to hit modifier, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet. This attack also deals 6 piercing damage when thrown or 7 piercing damage if wielded in two hands as a melee weapon.

One of its most notable abilities is Fire Breath, which can be used after a recharge period of six rounds. The Behtu exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within that area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 21 fire damage, or suffer half damage on a successful save. This ability can significantly alter combat dynamics, especially when facing multiple enemies clustered together.

Additionally, the Behtu can use Ichorous Infusion, an ability that allows it to ingest a potent infusion made from the blood of Mechuiti. This infusion grants the Behtu advantage on all Strength and Constitution saving throws and ability checks for one minute, while doubling its walking and climbing speeds. It does, however, impose disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws and ability checks during the same period. Non-Behtu creatures that consume this infusion must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 poison damage and become poisoned for one minute, adding a layer of tactical risk when dealing with the Behtu. Each Behtu typically carries between two to five infusions, giving it the potential for increased effectiveness in battles.</detail>
