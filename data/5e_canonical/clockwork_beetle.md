<summary>The Clockwork Beetle is a Tiny Construct that serves as a versatile and nimble creature, often created for utility and support roles. With an Armor Class of 14 and 20 hit points, it can withstand moderate attacks while offering valuable assistance in a variety of situations. Its challenge rating of 1/2 indicates that it is suitable for lower-level encounters. The Clockwork Beetle excels in Dexterity with a score of 16, giving it a good modifier of +3, allowing it to move swiftly and avoid danger effectively. However, its other attributes, particularly Intelligence at -3 and Charisma at -2, are very poor, which limits its abilities in mental tasks and social interactions. Its immunities to poison and psychic damage, along with multiple condition immunities, enhance its durability.</summary>

<detail>

The Clockwork Beetle has the following ability scores: Strength is 8 (-1), Dexterity is 16 (+3), Constitution is 10 (+0), Intelligence is 4 (-3), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 7 (-2). Its saving throw bonus for Dexterity is +5, making it very good at evading attacks and effects that require a Dexterity save. It has a good Stealth skill with a +5 modifier, allowing it to hide effectively. The creature has darkvision of 60 feet and a passive Perception of 11, which is average for detecting creatures or objects in low-light conditions. It understands the languages of its creator but is incapable of verbal communication.

The Clockwork Beetle possesses several special abilities that enhance its utility. Its Construct Nature means it does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to function in environments inhospitable to living creatures. With Immutable Form, it is immune to spells or effects that alter its form, making it very resistant against certain magical attacks. The Limited Telepathy ability allows it to send simple messages and images to its creator within 100 feet, facilitating communication. Additionally, its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further bolstering its survivability.

In combat, the Clockwork Beetle has one primary action: the Bite attack. This is a melee weapon attack that uses a +5 to hit modifier and has a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 6 piercing damage (1d6 + 3) and inflicts additional poison damage. The target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw; on a failure, it takes an extra 5 poison damage (2d4), or half that amount on a successful save. This combination of damage types allows the Clockwork Beetle to deal consistent and effective damage to its adversaries while presenting a challenge through the poison effect.</detail>
