<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>A Stone Golem is a massive construct made from solid rock, crafted through powerful magic to serve as a guardian or enforcer. These towering figures are incredibly strong and resilient, nearly impervious to most physical attacks. Stone Golems are often found guarding ancient temples, tombs, or treasures, standing motionless until commanded to act. Once activated, they are relentless and follow orders without question. Though slow-moving, their crushing strength and durability make them formidable opponents. Stone Golems can also use magic to slow their enemies, turning the tide of battle in their favor.</summary>
