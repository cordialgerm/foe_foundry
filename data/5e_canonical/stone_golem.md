<summary>A Stone Golem is a massive construct made from solid rock, crafted through powerful magic to serve as a guardian or enforcer. These towering figures are incredibly strong and resilient, nearly impervious to most physical attacks. Stone Golems are often found guarding ancient temples, tombs, or treasures, standing motionless until commanded to act. Once activated, they are relentless and follow orders without question. Though slow-moving, their crushing strength and durability make them formidable opponents. Stone Golems can also use magic to slow their enemies, turning the tide of battle in their favor.</summary>

<summary>The Stone Golem is a large construct known for its immense strength and durability, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an armor class of 17, it has very good protection due to its natural armor plus 176 hit points, allowing it to withstand a significant amount of damage before being defeated. Its challenge rating is 10, indicating it is a strong creature typically encountered by mid to high-level adventurers. The golem has limited mobility with a speed of 30 feet but compensates for this with powerful melee attacks and special abilities. It has a mixture of strengths and weaknesses; notable strengths include its immunity to non-magical attacks and several conditions, while its lack of intelligence and charisma makes it less resilient to certain magical effects that rely on mental influence.</summary>

<detail>

The Stone Golem possesses several key attributes. Its Strength score is 20, granting it a +5 modifier, which is considered very good, bolstering its physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is 8, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is bad and indicates that it is not agile. With a Constitution score of 24, the golem has a +9 modifier, classified as exceptional, significantly enhancing its hit points and resilience to physical harm. Intelligence is very low at -4, rendering its +0 Wisdom average, and its Charisma is exceedingly poor at -5. These qualities describe the golem as a powerful protector or guardian that executes its programmed functions without creativity or emotional engagement.

The Stone Golem has several special abilities enhancing its effectiveness in combat and its resilience to magic. It enjoys an immunity to poison and psychic damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks. Such traits allow it to remain a robust foe on the battlefield. The golem is also unaffected by conditions like exhaustion or charmed states, which is advantageous during prolonged encounters. Its Immutable Form ability makes it resistant to any spells that would alter its physical state, while Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against magical effects, enhancing its survivability further. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by the golem are considered magical, bypassing the typical defenses of non-magical creatures.

In terms of actions, the Stone Golem can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Slam attacks in one turn. Each Slam is a melee weapon attack that can hit with a +9 to hit modifier, reaching one target within 5 feet. A successful hit inflicts an average of 21 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 3d10 plus a 5 from its Strength. The golem also has a powerful special action called Slow, which can be used every 6 turns. This area effect slows all creatures within a 10-foot radius, requiring a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Failing this save results in a significant hindrance to a creature’s actions, as their speed is halved, and they can make only one attack on their subsequent turn, limiting their combat effectiveness for a minute.

As a bonus action, the Stone Golem can use Rearrange Stone, altering the configuration of its body to gain tactical advantages. When choosing Jagged Stones, the golem deals piercing damage to attackers hitting it in melee, although it reduces its own armor class by 2. Conversely, with Protective Slabs, the golem sacrifices some speed to reduce incoming damage, creating a strategic choice based on the circumstances of combat. This ability can provide both offensive and defensive capabilities, showcasing the golem's versatility in a fight.</detail>
