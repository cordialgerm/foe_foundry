<summary>The Fomorian is a powerful Huge Fey creature, renowned for its formidable presence and mystical abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 8, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, boasting a high Armor Class of 15 and robust Hit Points totaling 138. The Fomorian is particularly adept at charming and controlling creatures through its unique gaze abilities, posing a psychological challenge in addition to its physical threat. However, its reliance on these charm effects can be seen as a weakness, as players can strategize to counteract its powers. The Fomorian possesses both high physical strength and durability, making it an exceptional opponent in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Fomorian has a Strength score of 20, translating to a +5 modifier, which is very good, allowing it to deal significant melee damage and overpower its foes. Its Constitution is also 20, which contributes to its high Hit Points and endurance in battles. Dexterity is average at 10, resulting in no modifier, indicating that it is not particularly nimble. The creature's Wisdom score of 14, providing a +2 modifier, allows for moderate perception and insight. Charisma is notable at 18, yielding a +4 modifier, which is very good, enhancing its charm abilities. The Intelligence score remains average at 10.

In terms of skills, the Fomorian has a +7 modifier in persuasion, which is good, making it formidable in social interactions and negotiations. It has immunities to psychic damage and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, making it difficult to harm with standard weaponry. Additionally, it possesses darkvision up to 120 feet and has a passive perception score of 12, allowing it to detect threats in low-light conditions. The Fomorian can communicate in Celestial, Common, Giant, and Sylvan, which may come in handy for interactions with various creatures.

The Fomorian has several noteworthy special abilities. Its Eye Vulnerability allows creatures to target its eye with an attack made at disadvantage. If this attack succeeds and deals 10 or more damage, it can free affected creatures from its gaze abilities. This mechanic encourages players to strategize attacks specifically targeting the Fomorian's eye to disrupt its control over allies. The Fomorian also exhibits Immortal Nature, meaning it does not need air, food, or sleep, allowing it to maintain its presence constantly without the same resource limitations as other creatures.

In terms of actions, the Fomorian can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to strike twice with its warhammer each turn. The Warhammer attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 18 bludgeoning damage, making it a strong melee option.

Its bonus actions include Charming Gaze, which forces a creature within 60 feet to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the creature being magically charmed for 24 hours unless it succeeds on subsequent saving throws or takes damage. This ability can leave enemies temporarily incapacitated, making them less likely to resist the Fomorian's influence. The Mesmerizing Gaze functions similarly, restraining a creature that fails the same saving throw. On subsequent turns, the restrained creature can attempt to break free, but failure can lead to paralysis, creating a potent incapacitating threat.

Finally, the Fomorian has the ability called Immortal Form that allows it to change into a specific Medium humanoid form while in its lair, sharing the same statistics as its true form. This transformation can be pivotal for subterfuge or evasion strategies. The Fomorian reverts to its original form upon dying, being incapacitated, or leaving its lair, emphasizing its connection to its domain. This combination of physical might, magical presence, and environmental advantage makes the Fomorian a unique and formidable foe in any encounter.</detail>
