In combat, the Young Imperial Dragon utilizes its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make three attacks in a single turn: one with its bite and two with its claws, making it a dangerous foe capable of dealing significant damage. Its Bite attack has a +10 to hit and adds 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage, while the Claw attack also holds a +10 to hit and inflicts 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.
