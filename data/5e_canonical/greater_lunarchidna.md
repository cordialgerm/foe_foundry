<summary>The Greater Lunarchidna is a medium-sized aberration characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This creature excels in stealth and cunning, enhanced by its climbing ability and its proficiency in spellcasting. It presents a notable challenge to adventurers with its capability of manipulating webbing and utilizing necrotic damage to weaken foes. However, it suffers from a significant disadvantage when exposed to sunlight, making it vulnerable in brightly lit environments. The combination of its stealth, spellcasting, and physical attacks gives the Lunarchidna a formidable presence in combat, but it must navigate carefully to avoid areas of direct sunlight.</summary>

<detail>

The Greater Lunarchidna has an Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, which provides good protection against attacks. With 58 hit points derived from a pool of 9d8 plus 18, it is fairly sturdy in combat. Its climbing speed of 30 feet and walking speed of 30 feet allow for good mobility, essential for evasion and tactical positioning. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 4, translating to 1,100 experience points for its defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Greater Lunarchidna has the following scores: Strength is average at 10 with a modifier of +0, Dexterity is good at 16 with a modifier of +3, Constitution is good at 14 with a +2 modifier, Intelligence is average at 12 with a +1 modifier, Wisdom is average at 12 with a +1 modifier, and Charisma is good at 15 with a +2 modifier. This gives it saving throws of +4 for Constitution and +3 for Wisdom, both of which are above average. It also excels in stealth with a +7 modifier, making it a very competent ambusher, while its perception skill is at +3, which is considered average.

The Lunarchidna possesses immunity to poison damage and condition immunities to being poisoned and restrained, making it resilient against certain types of attacks. Its senses include blindsight for 10 feet and darkvision for 60 feet, contributing to its ability to function in darkness effectively, and it has a passive perception of 13. This creature can communicate in Deep Speech and Elvish, giving it the capacity to engage with various types of opponents or allies.

The Greater Lunarchidna has several special abilities. Its Spider Climb ability allows it to traverse difficult surfaces and ceilings without any checks, making it highly mobile. The Sunlight Sensitivity ability imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks relying on sight while in sunlight, making it less effective in brightly lit areas. The Web Walker ability permits it to move freely through webs without any movement restrictions, enhancing its combat tactics. Additionally, the creature is a 4th-level spellcaster with an Intelligence-based spellcasting ability; its spell save DC is 11, and it has a +3 to hit with spell attacks. Its spells include at-will cantrips like minor illusion, mage hand, poison spray, and ray of frost, along with 1st-level spells including detect magic, magic missile, and shield, and 2nd-level spells such as alter self and suggestion.

In combat, the Greater Lunarchidna can utilize the Multiattack action, allowing it to make two attacks—one bite and one claw. If both attacks strike a medium or smaller target, the creature can restrain that target with webbing as part of its Wrap Up action. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit and inflicts 10 necrotic damage on a successful hit, but it also imposes a Constitution saving throw of DC 13 to maintain the target's hit point maximum. If this maximum is reduced to 0, the target dies. The Claw attack, also with a +5 to hit, deals 8 slashing damage.

The Lunarchidna can use its Web ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6; this ranged attack (30/60 ft.) targets a creature and restrains them upon a successful hit. The affected creature may escape by making a DC 13 Strength check or attacking the webbing, which has an AC of 10 and 5 hit points, with vulnerabilities to fire damage. Finally, the Wrap Up ability allows the Greater Lunarchidna to wrap a restrained creature, causing them to be blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe each turn unless they can succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. This adds both psychological and physical pressure on its victims during encounters. The Lunarchidna can only have one creature wrapped at a time, which adds a tactical layer to its choices in combat.</detail>
