<summary>The Ichor Ooze is a Medium creature of the ooze type with a neutral evil alignment. Its unique combination of offensive capabilities, magical resistances, and movement traits positions it as a formidable foe for lower-level adventurers. The ooze boasts a decent set of hit points, making it moderately resilient in combat, though its Armor Class is quite low, rendering it easier to hit for characters with reasonable accuracy. With the ability to both damage opponents and heal itself through its Life Drain ability, the Ichor Ooze can prolong engagements effectively. However, its weak Dexterity means it is not particularly quick or evasive in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Ichor Ooze has an Armor Class of 8, which is considered very bad, making it easy for attackers to hit it. It possesses 39 hit points derived from rolling 6d8 plus an additional 12 points from its Constitution score, resulting in a solid but not overwhelming pool of health. The creature has a speed of 20 feet walking, swimming, and climbing, indicating it can maneuver through various environments without hindrance.

The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength is 15, providing a good +2 modifier, which makes it effective at melee attacks. Dexterity is 6, giving it a bad -2 modifier, affecting its ability to dodge incoming attacks. Constitution sits at 14, reflecting a good +2 modifier that contributes to its overall hit points. Intelligence is very low at 3, resulting in a very bad -4 modifier, which means it cannot effectively engage in complex problem-solving or strategy. Wisdom at 7 gives it a -2 modifier, while Charisma is exceptionally low at 1, leading to a very bad -5 modifier and making it socially ineffective.

In terms of defenses, the Ichor Ooze has several immunities and resistances. It is immune to fire damage, and it has resistance to necrotic and poison damage. Additionally, it is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by nonmagical attacks, which makes it fairly resilient against physical damage from most typical weapons. The ooze is immune to conditions such as being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, and prone, making it a challenging target in combat. It has blindsight up to 60 feet, enabling it to sense its surroundings without the need for sight, but beyond this range, it is effectively blind. The creature has a passive Perception score of 8.

The Ichor Ooze's special abilities include Amorphous, which allows it to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, enhancing its evasive maneuvers in tight environments. It possesses Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on all saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it harder for spellcasters to affect it with their magic. Its Sense Destroyer ability enables it to know the direction and distance to the creature that killed its creator, as long as both are on the same plane of existence, giving it a unique vendetta-driven motivation. Lastly, with Spider Climb, the ooze can navigate difficult surfaces like ceilings without needing to roll for checks.

In terms of actions, the Ichor Ooze has several offensive options. It can use its Pseudopod attack as a melee weapon strike, with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing a base damage of 5 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 fire damage. If it successfully hits a target that is Large or smaller, the target is grappled with an escape DC of 12. The ooze can also employ Hurl Mote, a ranged attack that can deal 5 fire damage from a distance of up to 30 feet, which can be useful for attacking from a distance.

Its most formidable ability is Life Drain, where a creature grappled by the ooze must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer 10 necrotic damage, with half damage on a successful save. Notably, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by the damage taken, and the ooze regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. This reduction persists until the target finishes a long rest, and if this attack reduces the target’s hp maximum to 0, the target will die. This ability not only allows the ooze to stay in the fight but also can significantly weaken opponents over time, making it a dangerous adversary in prolonged engagements.</detail>
