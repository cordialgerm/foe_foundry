<summary>The Suppurating Ooze is a Medium-sized ooze creature that operates without any alignment, making it a neutral force in the world. It serves as a challenge rating of 1, providing a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly due to its unique abilities and diseases. With an Armor Class of 8, it is relatively easy to hit, but it compensates for this with a decent pool of 30 hit points, translating to a good durability for its challenge rating. The creature is notable for its immunities and resistances, making it difficult to harm with certain damage types and conditions. However, it lacks intelligence and charisma, indicating its simplistic behavior in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Suppurating Ooze are as follows: it has a Strength score of 16, granting it a good modifier of +3, which makes it fairly strong for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is quite low at 6, giving a poor modifier of -2, meaning it is clumsy and slow-moving. The Constitution score is high at 16, providing a very good modifier of +3, reinforcing its durability. The ooze has very low mental capabilities, with Intelligence at 1 (-5) and Charisma at 2 (-4), making it ineffective in many non-combat situations. The Wisdom score is 6 (-2), suggesting a limited perception of its environment.

In terms of saving throws, the creature has a significant Constitution saving throw bonus of +5, which is exceptional for resisting effects that target its physical well-being. The ooze benefits from advantageous damage immunities to poison and resistances to cold, necrotic, and slashing damage, rendering it tough against various attacks. It is immune to several conditions, including being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, poisoned, and prone. Its blindsight of 60 feet allows it to detect creatures within that range while being vulnerable beyond, providing limited situational awareness.

The Suppurating Ooze possesses several unique abilities. Its Amorphous trait allows it to infiltrate spaces as narrow as 1 inch, making it a formidable opponent in confined areas. The Seeping Death ability is particularly dangerous; any living creature that comes into contact with the ooze or attacks it in melee range takes 4 necrotic damage and must pass a Constitution saving throw (DC 13) or contract a debilitating disease. This disease reduces the afflicted creature's Dexterity score over time until cured, potentially leading to death and transformation into another Suppurating Ooze. It can be cured by using spells like lesser restoration. Lastly, the Spider Climb ability enables it to climb difficult surfaces, giving it great mobility and an advantage in combat encounters.

For its actions, the Suppurating Ooze can make a melee weapon attack with its Pseudopod, which has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 6 bludgeoning damage and 9 necrotic damage. Additionally, any target hit must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 13) to avoid infection by the Seeping Death disease. This combination of strong attacks and debilitating effects makes the Suppurating Ooze a challenging adversary for adventurers who may not take its low Armor Class into account.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Seeping Death:** A living creature that touches the ooze or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its Dexterity score is reduced by 1d4. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Dexterity to 0, the creature dies and its body becomes a suppurating ooze 1d4 hours later. The disease lasts until removed by the lesser restoration spell or other similar magic.
