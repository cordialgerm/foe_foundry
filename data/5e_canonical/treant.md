<MonsterName/>Treant</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Plant</CreatureType>

<summary>A Treant is a towering, sentient tree-like creature that serves as a guardian of the forest. Standing over 20 feet tall, Treants have bark-like skin, branches for arms, and roots for legs. They are wise and ancient beings, deeply connected to nature, and they often act as protectors of their woodland homes. In combat, Treants use their massive strength to crush enemies and can animate trees to fight alongside them. They are generally peaceful, preferring to live in harmony with the natural world, but they will not hesitate to defend their forests from those who seek to harm them.</summary>

These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.

- **Rock:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
- **Animate Plant:** The treant magically animates a Large or larger plant within 60 feet. The plant is immobile  but it acts on the treants initiative and can make slam attacks  or rock attacks if there are rocks to throw within 10 feet of it. Non-plant creatures treat the ground within 15 feet of the plant as difficult terrain  as surrounding roots conspire to trip and grasp moving creatures. The plant remains animated for 1 hour. If the treant uses this action while it has three plants animated in this way  the plant that has been animated the longest returns to normal.
