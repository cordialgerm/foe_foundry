<summary>The Giant Wasp is a fearsome insect the size of a large dog, with a sharp stinger capable of injecting potent venom. Found in forests, jungles, or underground nests, these creatures are territorial and aggressive, defending their hives with lethal precision. Giant Wasps can fly at high speeds and often attack in swarms, making them dangerous to any creature that ventures too close to their nest. Their venom can paralyze or severely injure their prey, and they use their stingers and mandibles to finish off any who fall victim to their attacks.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Wasp is a medium-sized beast known for its agility and poisonous sting. With a moderate armor class of 12 and hit points totaling 18, it can withstand a few hits, but its real strength lies in its speed, with a fly speed of 50 feet allowing for rapid movement during combat. Although its Challenge Rating is only 1/2, indicating it is a lower-level threat, it compensates with powerful attacks and debilitating poison effects. It has average physical attributes but noteworthy dexterity, providing a good attack bonus and making it elusive in battle. However, it possesses very poor intelligence and charisma, which limits its utility in social situations. Its significant weakness is tied to its lack of durability; it can be dispatched relatively quickly if targeted effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Giant Wasp are as follows: 
- Strength is 10, which equates to an average modifier (no bonus), meaning it lacks any extraordinary strength-based capabilities. 
- Dexterity is 14, translating to a good +2 modifier that enhances its attack rolls and improves its chance to avoid incoming attacks. 
- Constitution is 10, rendering it average in terms of endurance with no modifiers. 
- Intelligence is exceptionally low at 1, resulting in a -5 modifier, indicating severe limitations in reasoning and tactical thinking. 
- Wisdom is average at 10, offering no modifiers, which suggests a lack of notable perception beyond the basic. 
- Charisma is very low at 4, with a -3 modifier, signifying that it is very inept in social interactions.

In terms of skill, the Giant Wasp has a passive perception of 10, indicating it can notice things at a basic level but is not particularly aware of its surroundings. It does not communicate in any known language.

The Giant Wasp has a notable action: 
- Sting: This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully hits a target, it deals 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2). Additionally, the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target suffers an additional 7 poison damage (2d6), while on a successful save, the target only receives half that damage. A critical aspect of the sting is that if the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stabilized but poisoned for one hour, during which they remain paralyzed, even if they regain hit points. This ability makes the Giant Wasp a substantial threat in combat, as it can incapacitate foes, paving the way for the wasp and its allies to attack with less resistance.</detail>
