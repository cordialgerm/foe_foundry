<summary>The Commoner Mob is a huge humanoid creature that acts as a collective representation of a group of commoners, often used to portray the chaotic nature of a populace in a Dungeons & Dragons setting. Its weak armor class of 10 and modest hit points of 45 make it a relatively easy target in combat, but the mob's unique mechanics offer it intriguing tactical advantages. With a challenge rating of 0, it is not a significant threat, but its ability to disperse into multiple smaller commoners upon being defeated introduces an interesting dynamic. The Commoner Mob excels in overwhelming opponents through sheer numbers but also suffers from vulnerabilities, particularly when subjected to area effects.</summary>

<detail>

The Commoner Mob has the following attributes: Strength is 10 with no modifier, Dexterity is also 10 with no modifier, Constitution sits at 10 with no modifier, Intelligence is 10 with no modifier, Wisdom is at 10 with no modifier, and Charisma is 10 with no modifier. Each of these reflects average capability, meaning the mob is neither exceptionally strong nor weak in any specific area. Its passive perception is 10, indicating average awareness, and it can understand one language.

Among its special abilities, the Commoner Mob has "Area Vulnerability," which means any effect that targets an area will deal double damage to it. This makes area-of-effect attacks particularly dangerous for the mob. The "Mob Dispersal" ability allows the mob to break apart into five individual commoners when it reaches zero hit points. Each of these new commoners has only 2 hit points, making them significantly more fragile compared to the original mob. Additionally, "Mob" signifies that the creature consists of ten or more commoners. It is able to take damage from single-target spells or attacks but ignores other effects. The mob can navigate through spaces suitable for one Medium creature, emphasizing its adaptability.

In terms of offensive actions, the Commoner Mob can perform melee attacks with clubs. When making a melee weapon attack, it has a +2 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, enabling it to target up to two enemies. If it lands a hit, it deals 10 (4d4) bludgeoning damage; however, if the mob is bloodied, it deals only half damage. For ranged attacks, the Commoner Mob can throw stones, again with a +2 to hit. The stones have a range of 10 feet for a regular throw and 30 feet at disadvantage, also allowing targeting of up to two enemies. The damage output is the same as its melee attack, with 10 (4d4) bludgeoning damage or half if bloodied. This emphasizes the mob's reliance on basic but effective physical attacks in combat.</detail>
