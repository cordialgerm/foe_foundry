<summary>The Rust Drake is a medium-sized dragon characterized by its chaotic evil nature. As a formidable adversary in combat, it possesses a high Armor Class of 17 due to its natural armor, making it relatively tough to hit. With 161 hit points, calculated through 19d8 plus 76, it can endure a significant amount of damage. Its movement capabilities are impressive; it can walk at a speed of 80 feet and has a fly speed of 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in battle. The Rust Drake has a challenge rating of 8, making it an appropriate encounter for a party that has gained some experience, providing a reward of 3,900 experience points upon defeat. Its attributes are robust, showcasing exceptional strength and constitution, which enhance its offensive and defensive capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Rust Drake has a Strength score of 20, yielding a modifier of +5, which is exceptional and reflects its ability to deal significant physical damage. Its Dexterity score of 15 provides a good modifier of +2, aiding its agility and stealth. The Constitution score of 19 translates to a very good +4 modifier, contributing to its durability in battle. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are relatively low, with values of 12, 8, and 8 respectively, resulting in average to below-average modifiers. This may suggest that the Rust Drake is not particularly adept at social interactions or utilizing complex strategies.

In terms of skills, the Rust Drake has a Perception score of +5 and a Stealth score of +5, indicating a good ability to notice hidden threats and to move unnoticed when it chooses to. The creature has an acid vulnerability, meaning it takes double damage from acid attacks. On the other hand, it is immune to poison damage and conditions, specifically being poisoned, showcasing its resilience against certain types of attacks. The Rust Drake also possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a passive Perception score of 15, making it perceptive to its surroundings. It can communicate in Common and Draconic.

The Rust Drake's special abilities include the Rust Drake Lockjaw, a disease effect that manifests in infected creatures after 1d4 days. This disease causes painful muscle spasms and presents a severe drawback in combat, paralyzing the infected creature for an hour if they fail a DC 15 Constitution saving throw after each long rest. The infected creature also suffers a reduction in its Dexterity score, potentially leading to grievous consequences if the score drops to zero.

In combat, the Rust Drake's actions allow it to unleash a series of devastating attacks. Through Multiattack, it can strike once with a Bite and make two Tail Swipe attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit and can deal 18 piercing damage (3d8 + 5). It also has an additional effect; if the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, it may contract the Rust Drake Lockjaw disease. The Tail Swipe similarly has a +8 to hit and can inflict 14 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 5).

One of the Rust Drake's notable abilities is Vomit Scrap, which has a recharge mechanic (needs to be rolled on a 5 or 6 to use again). This attack targets a 15-foot cone area, requiring all creatures within to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take a total of 44 damage (22 slashing and 22 poison), or half as much if they succeed. Additionally, failing the saving throw means they must also succeed on another DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid contracting the Rust Drake Lockjaw disease. This ability not only deals significant damage but also adds an element of crowd control, making it a formidable part of the Rust Drake's combat strategy.</detail>
