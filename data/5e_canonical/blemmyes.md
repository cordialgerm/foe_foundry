<summary>The Blemmyes is a large monstrosity characterized by its chaotic evil alignment and formidable presence on the battlefield. With a strong build and a variety of attacking options, it poses a serious threat to adventurers. Its notable strengths include high hit points, impressive melee damage capabilities, and the ability to incapacitate foes. The Blemmyes has exceptional physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, which enhance its combat effectiveness. However, it suffers from very low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, which can limit its tactical options and ability to interact socially. It is important to note that the Blemmyes can be dangerously compelled to attack incapacitated creatures due to its Carnivorous Compulsion ability, which can lead to devastating ambushes.</summary>

<detail>

The Blemmyes has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good, thanks to its natural armor. It possesses a total of 168 hit points, calculated as 16d10 + 80, making it very resilient in combat. Its walking speed is 40 feet, which allows for decent mobility on the battlefield. As a challenging monster with a Challenge Rating of 8, it provides 3,900 experience points when defeated. 

In terms of abilities, the Blemmyes has the following attributes: Strength at 20 (+5, exceptional), Dexterity at 13 (+1, average), Constitution at 20 (+5, exceptional), Intelligence at 7 (-2, very bad), Wisdom at 12 (+1, average), and Charisma at 5 (-3, very bad). Its skill in Intimidation is +3, indicating a somewhat intimidating presence.

The Blemmyes has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 11, enabling it to see in dark environments and notice creatures nearby, although not exceptionally well. It can communicate using the Giant language, which may be relevant in specific encounters.

For special abilities, the Blemmyes has the Carnivorous Compulsion, which forces it to attack an incapacitated creature it can see unless it succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. This can often lead to aggressive tactics if a party member is incapacitated, adding a layer of strategic challenge.

In its actions, the Blemmyes can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Slam attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 19 (4d6 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is incapacitated and is a Medium or smaller creature, it is swallowed, becoming blinded and restrained while taking 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each turn. The Blemmyes can only swallow one creature at a time.

The Slam attack also has a +8 to hit and deals 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. Any creature hit must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn, which can significantly hinder its ability to respond in combat.

Additionally, the Blemmyes can use a Rock attack as a ranged weapon with a range of 30/120 feet. It also has a +8 to hit and can deal 27 (4d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn, potentially causing disruption among enemy ranks.

Overall, the Blemmyes is a dangerous opponent with a mix of strong physical attacks, unique abilities, and a penchant for aggression that can turn the tide of battle if not dealt with swiftly.</detail>
