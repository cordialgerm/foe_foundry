<detail>

The Sand Spider has a Strength of 20, providing a +5 modifier, which is exceptional in combat for melee attacks. Its Dexterity score of 17 grants a +3 modifier, resulting in good capabilities in stealth and initiative rolls. The Constitution of 14 gives it a +2 modifier, contributing to its average resilience and hit points. Its Intelligence of 4 results in a -3 modifier, making it very bad at tasks requiring intellect. With a Wisdom of 12 (+1 modifier), it has average perception skills, and a Charisma score of 4 (-3 modifier) indicates it is very bad at social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Sand Spider excels at Perception with a +4, allowing it to effectively notice hidden creatures or traps, and has excellent Stealth with a +6, benefiting greatly from its Sand Camouflage ability. With darkvision and tremorsense, it can sense its environment and prey within a 60-foot range, giving it formidable awareness in dark or obscured spaces.

The Sand Spider’s primary abilities include Sand Camouflage, allowing it to gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in sandy terrain, making it exceptionally adept at hiding and ambushing. The Sand Spider can execute a Multiattack, using one Bite and two Impaling Legs in a single action. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit that deals 10 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage on a successful hit. The Impaling Leg attacks also have a +8 to hit, reaching 10 feet and dealing 12 piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become grappled, inflicting additional piercing damage every turn while restrained.

In terms of reactions, the Sand Spider can perform a Trapdoor Ambush, where it strikes at a creature entering its burrowed space, making an Impaling Leg attack. This attack is particularly deadly as the target is at a disadvantage for the saving throw to escape the grapple, allowing the Sand Spider to potentially incapacitate its prey quickly. Overall, this monster represents a cunning and powerful threat in combat scenarios, particularly in sandy areas where it can fully utilize its ambushing skills.</detail>

### Special Abilities

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sand spider makes one Bite attack and two Impaling Leg attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.
- **Impaling Leg:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 16).

The target has disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid being grappled.
