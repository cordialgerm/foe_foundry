<detail>

The Green Knight's attributes are as follows: Strength is at 18, which offers a very good modifier of +4, making it effective in physical confrontations. Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), resulting in a lack of agility. Constitution is decent at 14 (+2), providing good endurance. Intelligence is average at 10 (+0), but Wisdom is slightly above average at 12 (+1), which aids in perception and insight checks. Charisma is exceptional at 16 (+3), important for its intimidation skills and magical effects.

It has saving throw bonuses of +3 in Dexterity and +5 in Constitution, indicating good resilience against physical and magical effects. The creature is skilled in athletics (+7), intimidation (+6), and survival (+4), marking it as a capable tracker and a frightening opponent in social situations. It is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that are not made with cold iron, and it is immune to being charmed or frightened. Senses include darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive perception of 11. The Green Knight speaks Common, Elvish, and Sylvan, allowing it to communicate with various creatures.

The Green Knight possesses several notable special abilities. "Headsman's Woe" allows it to reattach its head if severed, preventing death from head loss. The "Knight's Challenge" ability can be used three times a day as a bonus action to compel one creature within 30 feet to engage in melee combat. The affected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or will be forced to move toward the Green Knight and attack it for one minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn to attempt to end this compulsion. The Green Knight also enjoys magic resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, increasing its resilience. Furthermore, it can communicate with beasts and plants, reinforcing its connection to nature.

In terms of actions, the Green Knight can make two attacks each turn with its "Multiattack" option. It can strike with its "Battle Axe," which has a +7 to hit and deals 8 slashing damage (1d8 + 4), or 9 slashing damage (1d10 + 4) when wielded with two hands. It also has a "Shield Bash" attack that similarly has a +7 to hit, causes 7 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 4), and grapples the target, restricting their movement until they escape with a DC 15 check. Additionally, the Green Knight can throw a javelin that has the same +7 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage (1d6 + 4) at both melee and ranged distances (30/120 ft.).

For its reactions, the Green Knight can use "Knight's Rebuke." When struck by a melee attack from a creature it has challenged, it can immediately counterattack with its battle axe with advantage, emphasizing its defensive and retaliatory prowess. This allows it to effectively punish foes for their aggression while still enforcing its challenges.</detail>

If the target can see the green knight, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become magically compelled to engage the green knight in melee combat for 1 minute, or until the knight challenges a new opponent.
