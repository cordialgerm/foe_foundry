<summary>The Barbed is a small, humanoid creature with a lawful evil alignment, often acting as a cunning and ruthless combatant in the shadows. With an Armor Class of 13 and a total of 44 hit points, it can absorb some damage but is not particularly sturdy in prolonged battles. It is capable of moving a moderate distance with a speed of 30 feet per round. Its Challenge Rating of 1 indicates that it provides a moderate challenge to low-level adventurers, offering 200 XP upon defeat. The Barbed excels in dexterity and stealth, making it a good ambush attacker and an excellent scout for its allies. However, it is not particularly intelligent or charming, which limits its effectiveness in social encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Barbed possesses the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2), which is above average and allows it to engage effectively in melee; Dexterity is 16 (+3), giving it very good agility for dodging attacks and executing stealth maneuvers; Constitution is 12 (+1), providing it with a slight resilience; Intelligence is low at 8 (-1), making it very bad at tasks that require mental acuity; Wisdom is average at 10 (+0), and Charisma is also average at 11 (+0). The Barbed is proficient in athletics with a +4 modifier, making it good at physical tasks, and has a stealth skill with a +5 modifier, making it very good at moving undetected.

This creature is immune to poison damage and canâ€™t be poisoned itself, allowing it to resist certain effects in battle. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, which lets it see in dim light as though it were bright light, helping it remain effective in dark environments. It knows Common and Draconic, enabling communication with other creatures in these languages.

The Barbed has two notable special abilities. Pack Tactics provide it with an advantage on attack rolls against a target if it has an ally within 5 feet of the target, significantly enhancing its offensive capability when working with others. In contrast, Sunlight Sensitivity imposes a disadvantage on its attack rolls and perception checks while in bright sunlight, making it less effective during the day.

In terms of actions, the Barbed can perform a melee attack called Barbed Slash. This attack uses a +4 to hit against its target and has a reach of 5 feet. Upon hitting, it deals 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage in addition to 3 (1d6) poison damage. The target then must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they become poisoned until the end of their next turn, potentially incapacitating them for a round. Additionally, the Barbed can throw a javelin as a ranged attack. This also uses a +4 to hit, with a range of 30 to 120 feet, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage on a successful hit. 

Overall, the Barbed is a clever and dangerous foe that thrives in a team and the shadows, but struggles in direct sunlight. It embodies the archetype of the crafty, malicious creature, making it a perfect choice for encounters that require stealth and cunning.</detail>
