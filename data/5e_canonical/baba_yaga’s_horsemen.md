<MonsterName/>Baba Yaga’s Horsemen</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>Baba Yaga’s Horsemen are formidable Medium Fey creatures that embody the power and dark magic associated with the legendary figure of Baba Yaga. With a lawful neutral alignment, they serve as mystical guardians with a focus on delivering both physical and magical damage. They boast a strong defense due to their high Armor Class of 20 and substantial Hit Points totaling 171, making them capable of enduring sustained combat. The horsemen shine with their unique abilities, particularly their Enchanted Weapons that allow them to deal additional magical damage depending on their individual themes. They possess resilience against spells and benefit from the Peerless Rider ability, which allows them to share damage resistance and immunities with their mounts. However, their weaknesses include a reliance on their mount and vulnerability to nonmagical attacks under certain circumstances.</summary>

The horsemen have the following attributes: Strength is 22, which is very good, Dexterity is 11, which is average, Constitution is 21, which is very good, Intelligence is 16, which is good, Wisdom is 18, which is very good, and Charisma is also 18, which is very good. They have saving throws in Dexterity at +4 (average) and Wisdom at +8 (very good). Their skills include Arcana +7 (good), Athletics +10 (very good), History +7 (good), and Perception +8 (very good).

In terms of resistances, the horsemen are immune to lightning and poison damage and resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. They are also immune to the conditions of exhaustion, paralysis, and poison, further enhancing their survivability in combat. Their passive Perception score is 18, allowing them to notice stealthy characters and hidden dangers easily. They can communicate in Celestial, Common, and Infernal languages and possess telepathy up to 120 feet.

The horsemen have several special abilities. Their Enchanted Weapons lend a magical quality to their attacks, adding an extra 2d8 damage of different types based on their alignment—cold for the black night horseman, fire for the red sun, and radiant for the bright day. Their Magic Resistance grants them an advantage on saving throws against spells, significantly reducing the chances of being affected by harmful magical effects. The Peerless Rider ability allows them to take damage that would affect their mount, share their resistances, and completely negate damage for the mount if the horseman succeeds on a saving throw against an effect. Finally, their Timeless Nature means they do not age and do not require basic necessities like food, drink, or sleep.

For their actions, they possess a powerful Lance attack with a +10 to hit, dealing an average of 12 piercing damage alongside the extra 9 damage from Enchanted Weapons. However, they suffer from disadvantage on this attack if the target is within 5 feet. Their Longsword attack can deal between 10 and 11 damage plus the additional magical damage. The Horseman’s Bolt is a ranged attack that has a +8 to hit and can deal 22 damage, also incorporating the extra magical damage. 

In terms of spellcasting, they can cast useful spells without requiring material components using Charisma as their spellcasting ability (with a spell save DC of 16). They can summon a phantom steed three times per day, creating a temporary mount. The black night horseman can cast darkness twice per day, while the bright day and red sun horsemen can cast daylight also twice per day. They can use dimension door and fire shield each twice a day and have the capability to use plane shift once per day to transport themselves and their mount.

As a bonus action, they can use their Temporal Strike (recharging on a roll of 5–6) to impose an aging effect on a target hit by their Horseman’s Bolt or Longsword within the last minute. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or age 16 years, suffering disadvantage on physical rolls until the effect is reversed. If the target ages beyond its lifespan, it dies instantly. The aging effect can be undone by finishing a long rest or being restored by specific magic, while a successful saving throw grants immunity to this ability for 24 hours.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Enchanted Weapons:** The horseman’s weapon attacks are magical. When the horseman hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 damage of a type depending on the horseman: cold (black night), fire (red sun), radiant (bright day).
- **Magic Resistance:** The horseman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Peerless Rider:** Any attacks directed at the horseman’s mount target the horseman instead, and the horseman confers his damage resistances and immunities and his condition immunities to his mount. In addition, if the horseman and mount are subjected to an effect that allows each to make a saving throw to take only half damage, the mount takes no damage if the horseman succeeds on the saving throw.
- **Timeless Nature:** The horseman doesn’t age and doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Lance:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (1d12 + 6) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) damage of the type defined in Enchanted Weapons. The horseman has disadvantage on this attack roll if the target is within 5 feet of him.
- **Longsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage, or 11 (1d10 + 6) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 9 (2d8) damage of the type defined in Enchanted Weapons.
- **Horseman’s Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d6 + 4) damage of the type defined in Enchanted Weapons.
- **Spellcasting:** The horseman casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):<br>3/day: phantom steed (as an action)<br>2/day each: darkness (black night horseman only), daylight (bright day and red sun horsemen only), dimension door, fire shield<br>1/day: plane shift (self and mount only)

### Bonus Actions

- **Temporal Strike (Recharge 5–6):** One creature the horseman can see and that the horseman hit with a Horseman’s Bolt or Longsword attack within the last minute must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or age 16 (3d10) years. A creature that ages this way has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until the aging is reversed. A creature that ages beyond its lifespan dies immediately. The aging lasts until the creature finishes a long rest, or until it is reversed by a greater restoration spell or similar magic. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the horseman’s Temporal Strike for 24 hours.
