<summary>The Flying Polyp is a formidable Huge Aberration embodying chaotic evil. Its extraordinary flight capabilities make it a challenging foe in combat, allowing it to engage from above while avoiding ground-based attacks. With a hefty number of hit points, high defenses through natural armor, and various resistances, it can sustain significant damage while dishing out its own. The polyp excels in controlling the battlefield with its unique abilities, particularly its Aura of Wind and Cyclone attack, which can force opponents to reposition or take substantial damage. However, it has vulnerabilities to lightning damage, requiring strategic planning from opponents who can exploit this weakness.</summary>

<detail>

The Flying Polyp has the following attributes: Strength at 20 (+5), Dexterity at 12 (+1), Constitution at 17 (+3), Intelligence at 22 (+6), Wisdom at 14 (+2), and Charisma at 16 (+3). Its inherent Strength and Intelligence scores are exceptional, which enhances both its physical attacks and its spellcasting capabilities. The polyp's saving throws are strong against Dexterity with a +5 modifier and even stronger in Wisdom at +6, reflecting good defensive resilience. While it has proficiency in skills such as Arcana and History (both at +10), its Dexterity score is average. The creature is also immune to the prone condition, making it challenging for enemies to incapacitate.

In terms of damage vulnerabilities and resistances, the polyp is vulnerable to lightning damage while resisting acid, cold, fire, and thunder. It also has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, making it tough for regular attacks to take it down. Its blindsight extended to 60 feet means it can perceive its surroundings without the need for sight, and with a passive Perception score of 16, it is vigilant in detecting hidden threats. The creature communicates using Deep Speech and can telepathically interact with others within 120 feet.

The Flying Polyp possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Aura of Wind forces nearby creatures to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw at the start of their turn, or they will be pushed up to 15 feet away, providing the polyp control over spacing during battle. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to move through objects as if they were difficult terrain, albeit with the risk of taking 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside another object. With Magic Resistance, it gains advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it quite resilient to magical assaults. The polyp's innate spellcasting, based on its Intelligence ability with a spell save DC of 18, allows it to cast the spell "invisibility" at will, along with "wind walk" three times per day and "control weather" once per day, providing it with significant tactical options in combat.

When it comes to actions, the polyp can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two melee attacks in a single turn. Its Tentacle attack has a +9 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, dealing an average of 15 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Additionally, if a target is Large or smaller, it is grappled, with an escape DC of 17, rendering the target restrained and immune to the polyp's Aura of Wind until the grapple ends. The Bite attack, which is available only against grappled targets, also has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 18 piercing damage. The polyp can unleash a Cyclone, a powerful ability that requires a recharge (rolling a 5 or 6) and affects all creatures within a 30-foot radius, compelling them to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw to avoid taking an average of 27 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone. On a successful save, creatures only take half damage and remain standing. The polyp can also use Etherealness to transition between the Material and Ethereal Planes, adding an element of evasion during combat.

As a reaction, the Flying Polyp can use Fist of Wind in response to being targeted by an attack. This ability creates a 60-foot long and 10-foot wide line of strong wind that, if creatures fail a DC 17 Strength saving throw when they enter it or start their turn within it, will be pushed 15 feet away from the polyp, making it difficult to engage with the creature directly. Overall, the Flying Polyp presents a challenging scenario for adventurers, offering a combination of powerful attacks, control abilities, and the capacity to evade threats.</detail>

At will: invisibility (self only)
3/day: wind walk

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The polyp makes two melee attacks.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17).

- **Etherealness:** The flying polyp magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.

### Reactions

- **Fist of Wind:** When a creature the flying polyp can see targets it with an attack, the flying polyp can unleash a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide in the direction of the attacker. The wind lasts until the start of the flying polyp's next turn. Each creature in the wind when it appears or that starts its turn in the wind must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from the flying polyp in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line treats all movement as difficult terrain.
