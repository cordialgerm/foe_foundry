<MonsterName/>Stryx</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Stryx is a tiny monstrosity characterized by its stealth and ability to blend seamlessly into its surroundings. It serves as a cunning scout or spy, utilizing its impressive skills in perception and stealth to gather information without being detected. The creature's noteworthy strengths include its exceptional Dexterity, which allows it to be quick and elusive, as well as its special abilities like Flyby that enable it to avoid opportunity attacks. While it has a low Armor Class and limited Hit Points, making it relatively fragile in combat, its ability to mimic a normal owl provides excellent camouflage, making it very challenging for enemies to spot.</summary>

<detail>

The Stryx has the following attributes: Strength of 3, which is very bad and limits its physical prowess; Dexterity of 14, which is good, granting it agility in both movement and avoidance; Constitution of 11, which is average, providing a moderate level of durability; Intelligence of 8, which is bad, indicating limited cognitive abilities; Wisdom of 15, which is very good and contributes significantly to its perceptive skills; and Charisma of 6, which is very bad, suggesting a lack of social presence.

In terms of skills, the Stryx has a Perception bonus of +4, which is considered good, and a Stealth bonus of +6, which is very good, making it highly adept at remaining unnoticed. It is equipped with darkvision that reaches up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and has a passive Perception score of 14. The languages it understands include Common and Elvish, giving it some ability to communicate.

The Stryx has several special abilities that enhance its capabilities. The False Appearance ability enables it to resemble a typical owl when it keeps its beak closed and refrains from vocalization. This allows it to remain undetected among flocks of real owls. The Flyby ability means that when the Stryx flies, it does not provoke opportunity attacks from enemies, making it difficult for foes to retaliate during its movement. Its Keen Hearing and Sight ability provides it with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on these senses, allowing it to notice hidden foes or impending dangers more effectively.

In combat, the Stryx can use its Talons for a melee attack, boasting a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. If successful, this attack deals 4 slashing damage, derived from rolling 1d4 and adding 2, resulting in fairly modest damage output. Additionally, the Stryx is capable of spellcasting, with the ability to cast the spell Comprehend Languages up to three times a day. This spell allows the creature to understand any spoken language for a duration of one hour, facilitating communication and strategic planning. The Stryx uses its Wisdom for spellcasting, aligning with its strong Wisdom attribute to enhance its magical abilities.</detail>
