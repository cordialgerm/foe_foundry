<summary>The Nian is a large chaotic neutral monstrosity that embodies a blend of fear and power. With a robust constitution and formidable strength, this creature is capable of both engaging enemies directly and utilizing its unique abilities strategically in combat. One of its notable strengths lies in its speed and mobility, allowing it to quickly traverse various terrains, including climbing and swimming. However, its susceptibility to loud noises, fire, and the color red presents a significant weakness, which marks it as a creature that can be easily frightened if those elements are used effectively against it. The Nian presents a challenge at a Challenge Rating of 4, making it a suitable adversary for mid-level adventurers who may employ various tactics to exploit its fears.</summary>

<detail>

The Nian possesses an Armor Class of 13, representing average defenses due to its natural armor. It has a substantial hit point pool of 102, calculated from rolling 12d10 and adding 36, indicating good resilience in battle. It has a speed of 50 feet for walking, 30 feet for climbing, and also 30 feet for swimming. The creature’s Strength score is 18, providing a +4 modifier, which is considered exceptional for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is average at 11, giving it no bonus, while its Constitution of 17 grants it a +3 modifier, translating to a good ability to withstand physical damage. The Nian's Wisdom is notably high at 16, yielding a +3 modifier, yet its Charisma is rather poor at 9, resulting in a -1 modifier.

The Nian's skills include a passive perception of 13, allowing it to notice hidden creatures or objects at an average rate. As for its immunities, the Nian is immune to poison damage and the conditions of charmed, paralyzed, and poisoned, which can render it formidable against certain types of attacks. It has truesight out to 60 feet, providing it a significant advantage when facing invisible foes. The Nian can communicate in Sylvan and through telepathy up to 60 feet.

In terms of special abilities, the Nian has the Hold Breath ability, allowing it to remain underwater for up to 30 minutes without having to surface for air. This can be used to the Nian's advantage in water-based encounters. Its Trampling Charge allows it to gain a tactical edge by knocking opponents prone when charging, given they fail a DC 14 Strength saving throw after being struck by its gore attack. If a target does fall prone, the Nian can follow up with a stomp attack as a bonus action, making this ability quite effective in controlling the battlefield. 

A unique characteristic of the Nian is its Tremulous ability, which reflects its fear of loud noises, fire, and the color red. If faced with these stimuli, the Nian must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn. This fear lends the party opportunities to exploit its weaknesses during encounters, as the Nian cannot be frightened by the same source for 24 hours after.

As for its actions during combat, the Nian has several melee weapon attacks, including a Bite, Gore, and Stomp. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 17 piercing damage per hit. Its Gore attack, also with a +6 to hit, does slightly less damage, averaging 13 piercing damage. The Nian's Stomp attack, which can only be used against prone targets, has the same +6 to hit and averages 15 bludgeoning damage. 

The Nian also has a special ability called Year's Termination, which it can use once per day. This ability creates an area of magical darkness and silence in a 15-foot radius around it, lasting up to 10 minutes as long as the Nian maintains concentration. Within this sphere, no sound can exist, and no creature can see in the darkness unless they are inside the sphere in shades of gray. This ability effectively neutralizes spellcasters, as spells requiring verbal components cannot be cast in this area. If overlapping with light created by lower-level spells, the darkness can destroy those light sources, further enhancing the Nian’s capacity to control the battlefield.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath:** The nian can hold its breath for 30 minutes.
- **Trampling Charge:** If the nian moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the nian can make one stomp attack against it as a bonus action.
- **Tremulous:** The nian is inherently fearful of loud noises, fire, and the color red. It will not choose to move toward any red object or any fiery or burning materials. If presented forcefully with a red object, flame, or if it is dealt fire or thunder damage, the nian must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn. After it has been frightened by a specific red object or a particular source of noise (such as clanging a weapon on a shield) or fire (such as the burning hands spell), the nian can't be frightened by that same source again for 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d12 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Stomp:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one prone creature. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Year's Termination (1/Day):** The nian creates magical darkness and silence around it in a 15-foot-radius sphere that moves with it and spreads around corners. The dark silence lasts as long as the nian maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). The nian sees objects in the sphere in shades of gray. Darkvision can't penetrate the darkness, no natural light can illuminate it, no sound can be created within or pass through it, and any creature or object entirely inside the sphere of dark silence is immune to thunder damage. Creatures entirely inside the darkness are deafened and can't cast spells that include a verbal component. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is destroyed.
