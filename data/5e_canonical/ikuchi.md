<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>The Ikuchi is a gargantuan elemental creature that embodies the chaotic forces of nature, specifically within aquatic environments. As a chaotic neutral entity, it doesn't pursue good or evil but rather operates on instinct and survival, making it unpredictable in its behaviors and actions. With an Armor Class of 16, it can withstand a moderate amount of attacks, while its substantial pool of hit points, totaling 116, allows it to endure prolonged encounters. The Ikuchi’s dual movement capabilities—walking at 20 feet and swimming at 50 feet—give it an advantageous position in water, where it can exert control over its surroundings. Despite its strengths, it is particularly vulnerable to magical attacks, having resistances to damage from nonmagical sources, but it possesses no inherent resistances against magical damage types. </summary>

<detail>

The physical attributes of the Ikuchi are robust, showing strength with a score of 20, which translates to a +5 modifier—an exceptional value, granting it powerful attacks. Its constitution of 18 (+4) enhances its durability, while its dexterity of 13 (+1) gives an average level of maneuverability. Intellect and charisma scores are low, at 6 (-2) and 8 (-1) respectively, making it a poor candidate for complex interactions or planning. The Ikuchi boasts a skill in perception, reflected in a +4 modifier, highlighting its ability to sense its environment effectively. It is immune to poison damage and resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, making it challenging to face with conventional weaponry.

The Ikuchi’s special abilities play a significant role in its aquatic dominance. First, it constantly emits a nonflammable oil that affects the area within 30 feet when submerged. This thick oil creates difficult terrain, compelling creatures that traverse it to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw if they move more than 10 feet. Failure results in being restrained for the duration of their next turn, effectively impeding movement and positioning in combat. A creature protected by a freedom of movement spell remains unaffected by this oil. The Ikuchi also possesses the ability to breathe underwater exclusively, which allows it to remain submerged without needing to surface for air.

When it comes to offensive capabilities, the Ikuchi can execute a multiattack strategy, allowing it to both bite and constrict a foe. The bite attack is made with a +8 to hit and has a reach of 15 feet, dealing 16 piercing damage on a successful hit. The constrict ability functions similarly, also with a +8 to hit, but extends its reach to 20 feet. If it hits, the constrict deals 14 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target with an escape DC of 16, restraining them until the grapple ends. 

Additionally, the Ikuchi has a powerful attack known as Crush, which can be used once it recharges on a roll of 4 to 6. Any creature it is grappling must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes significant damage—23 bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a success. This ability emphasizes the Ikuchi's role as a formidable threat in melee combat, capable of incapacitating multiple opponents and dominating the battlefield in aquatic settings.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Ikuchi Oil:** The ikuchi constantly emits a thick, nonflammable, yellowish oil. When the ikuchi is underwater, this oil makes the water within 30 feet of the ikuchi difficult terrain. Each time a creature moves more than 10 feet through this area it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the thick oil until the end of its next turn. A creature under the effects of a freedom of movement spell or similar magic is immune to the effects of Ikuchi Oil.
- **Water Breathing:** The ikuchi can breathe only underwater.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ikuchi makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Constrict:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one Huge or smaller creature. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the ikuchi isn’t already constricting two other creatures. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.
- **Crush (Recharge 4-6):** Each creature grappled by the ikuchi must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw, taking 23 (4d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
