<summary>The Lantern Hagfish is a small aberration that serves as a unique adversary in aquatic or void-themed encounters. With an Armor Class of 11 and a mere 9 Hit Points, it is relatively fragile compared to other creatures in its challenge rating of 1/8. However, its resistance to several conditions, along with special abilities that allow it to manipulate its environment, makes it a tricky foe. The Lantern Hagfish's bioluminescent slime not only provides illumination but also enhances its combat effectiveness when partnered with other hagfish, reflecting its tactical potential in groups. Its ability to move effortlessly through the Void and ability to burrow into prey adds layers to its combat strategy, making it an effective ambush predator in the right conditions. </summary>

The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength is -4 (very bad), Dexterity is +1 (average), Constitution is +0 (average), Intelligence is -4 (very bad), Wisdom is +0 (average), and Charisma is -5 (very bad). This combination suggests that the Lantern Hagfish is not physically strong but possesses a degree of agility. Its resilience makes it hard to control in a fight, though its damage output and intelligence are low, limiting its strategic options.

The special abilities of the Lantern Hagfish include Aberrant Resilience, which gives it resistance to charm, frighten, paralyze, and stun conditions, as well as advantage on saving throws against spells that would alter its form. This resilience makes it a difficult creature to incapacitate. Its Bioluminescent Slime ability allows it to shed light between 5 to 20 feet, either aiding visibility or creating tactical advantages when fighting alongside other hagfish since it gains advantage on attack rolls against enemies that are near allied hagfish. Additionally, the Void Traveler ability enables the hagfish to survive in the Void or similar environments without needing air or sleep, making it highly versatile in cosmic explorations. Its Void Swimmer ability allows it to swim through the Void as if it were water, showcasing its adaptation to alien environments.

In terms of actions, the Lantern Hagfish has the Bite attack, which functions as a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it does 3 piercing damage, and if the target is prone and not a Construct or Undead, the hagfish can burrow into its flesh, causing 3 damage each turn as it consumes its prey from the inside. This mechanic allows it to inflict continuous damage while attached and provides a layer of strategy as opponents must act to remove the burrowed hagfish before it fully consumes them.

Its bonus action is the Slime Slide, which allows it to slide up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. The path it takes becomes coated in slime, causing any creature that crosses it to make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. This can effectively control movement on the battlefield and create hazards that adversaries must navigate around.

Overall, the Lantern Hagfish offers both tactical challenges and thematic depth, making it a noteworthy creature in the right campaign settings, especially those involving aquatic adventures or encounters in the Void.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Aberrant Resilience.** The lantern hagfish is resistant to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, and it has advantage on saves against spells or effects that would alter its form.
- **Bioluminescent Slime.** The lantern hagfish sheds bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The hagfish can alter the radius as a bonus action. In addition, the hagfish has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one other hagfish is within 5 feet of the creature and that other hagfish isn’t incapacitated.
- **Void Traveler.** The lantern hagfish doesn’t require air, sleep, or ambient pressure, enabling it to travel safely through the Void and similar environments.
- **Void Swimmer.** When traveling in the Void, the lantern hagfish can swim through the Void as if through water.

### Actions

- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage. If the target is a prone creature that isn’t a Construct or Undead, the hagfish can burrow into the creature’s flesh. While burrowed into a creature, the hagfish can’t attack, and at the start of each of the hagfish’s turns, the target loses 3 (1d4 + 1) HP as the hagfish consumes it from the inside. The burrowed hagfish moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the hagfish’s movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. It does so after it consumes 6 HP worth of flesh from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can take its action to extract the burrowed hagfish by succeeding on a DC 11 WIS (Medicine) check.

### Bonus Actions

- **Slime Slide.** While on a solid surface, the lantern hagfish slides up to 15 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature without provoking opportunity attacks. Each space on that surface along that line is coated in slime until the start of the hagfish’s next turn. Each creature in that line, and any creature that enters a slime-coated space for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or fall prone.
