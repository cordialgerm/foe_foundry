This fiend has darkvision extending up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. It understands both Common and Infernal languages, further emphasizing its fiendish nature.

The Myrmidon possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness: 

- **Arcane Weapons**: The Myrmidon’s weapon attacks are magical, dealing an extra 2d4 force damage in addition to regular weapon damage when it hits.
- **Dedicated Warrior**: This ability grants the Myrmidon advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, making it more resilient against such attacks.
- **Limited Magic Immunity**: The Myrmidon cannot be affected or detected by spells of 1st level or lower unless it chooses to be. It also has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects, providing a significant defensive advantage.
- **Tiger Tag Team**: The Myrmidon gains advantage on attack rolls against a target if there is at least one friendly Rakshasa within 5 feet of the target that is not incapacitated, encouraging teamwork in battle.

For actions, the Rakshasa Myrmidon can perform a **Multiattack**, allowing it to make two attacks with either its Forked Scimitar or an Arcane Bolt. 

- **Forked Scimitar**: This melee weapon attack has a +6 to hit, spans a 5-foot range, and deals 7 (1d6+4) slashing damage along with 5 (2d4) force damage. Notably, the Myrmidon can choose to disarm an opponent instead of dealing damage, requiring the target to make a DC 12 Strength saving throw or have their weapon thrown randomly within 10 feet.
- **Arcane Bolt**: This ranged spell attack has a +4 to hit, a range of 60 feet, and deals 12 (4d4+2) force damage, making it a reliable option for distance combat.

Additionally, the Myrmidon can utilize its **Spellcasting** ability, using Charisma with a DC of 12 and no material components. It can cast *Detect Thoughts* at will and *Disguise Self* up to two times per day, enabling effective deception and insight into foes.

As a reaction, the Myrmidon has the ability called **Allied Parry**, which allows it to impose disadvantage on an attack roll targeting a creature within 5 feet of it when wielding a shield. This helps protect its allies during combat encounters.</detail>
