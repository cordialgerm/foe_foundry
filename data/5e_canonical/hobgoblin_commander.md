<detail>

The Hobgoblin Commander has the following ability scores: Strength is +2 (average), Dexterity +2 (average), Constitution +2 (average), Intelligence +1 (average), Wisdom +0 (bad), and Charisma +2 (average). The +2 modifier in physical attributes offers the commander's attacks a decent chance to hit, while the average Constitution allows it to take some hits but not excel in durability compared to higher Constitution opponents. With darkvision out to 60 feet, it can see in darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception score of 10 is average, and it also has good stealth capability, with a modifier of 9 (14 without armor). The commander's ability to understand and speak Common and Goblin enhances its interaction both with allies and enemies.

One special ability that enhances the Hobgoblin Commander's value in combat is "Unshakable Command." This ability prevents friendly creatures within 30 feet from being charmed or frightened while the commander is not incapacitated, significantly boosting the morale and combat effectiveness of allies in its vicinity.

The Hobgoblin Commander can take multiple actions during a turn. It has the "Multiattack" action, which allows it to make three attacks with either a Greatsword or a Longbow. The Greatsword attack has a +4 to hit and can deal 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, while the Longbow allows for ranged attacks with the same +4 to hit, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage. These attacks indicate good offensive capability, especially from a distance using the Longbow.

As a bonus action, the Hobgoblin Commander can utilize "Martial Tactics," employing one of two strategies. The first is "Emboldening Shout," which provides a friendly creature within 30 feet with 7 (2d6) temporary hit points until the start of the commander's next turn, effectively increasing that ally's survivability in battle. The second option is "Pressing Advance," enabling the commander to move up to half its speed and command another allied creature within sight to also move. This movement is exceptional as it allows for tactical repositioning without the challenges of difficult terrain or opportunity attacks, significantly enhancing the potential for strategic maneuvers during combat.

Overall, the Hobgoblin Commander is a solid combatant with good leadership abilities, able to bolster allies through tactical coordination and temporary enhancements while inflicting respectable damage through physical attacks.</detail>
