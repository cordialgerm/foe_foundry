<summary>The Ijiraq is a Medium fey creature characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment. It possesses a strategic mix of abilities that allow it to be a tricky opponent in combat and exploration, particularly due to its capacity for memory manipulation and its unique shapeshifting abilities. With an Armor Class of 14 and a substantial pool of Hit Points at 127, the Ijiraq can withstand a fair amount of damage while delivering its own through powerful attacks. Although it has a good Constitution score of 19, which provides a very good damage resistance, its Charisma score of 9 indicates a weakness in social interactions. The Ijiraq serves as a unique foe that requires both physical and tactical consideration due to its inherent magical properties and ability to leave opponents with fragmented memories of encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Ijiraq's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength of 17 (+3), which is very good for dealing melee damage; a Dexterity of 13 (+1), which is average for enhancing its defense and initiative; a Constitution of 19 (+4), providing excellent durability; an Intelligence of 11 (+0), meaning it has average cognitive capabilities; a Wisdom of 15 (+2), which indicates good perception and insight; and a Charisma of 9 (-1), representing a lack of effectiveness in social situations. The Ijiraq has a skill in Perception with a bonus of +5, enhancing its ability to notice details. Additionally, it has damage resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, making it more resilient in physical confrontations. The Ijiraqâ€™s senses include darkvision out to 60 feet and truesight for 30 feet, allowing it to see in total darkness and perceive illusions and hidden creatures. It speaks Sylvan, providing communication with other fey beings.

In combat, the Ijiraq can employ several special abilities and actions. Its weapon attacks are magical, meaning they bypass nonmagical damage resistances. A notable special ability called Memory Loss forces any creature that encounters the Ijiraq to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to try to remember the encounter. If the saving throw fails, the creature rapidly forgets the details of its encounter, which can create tactical opportunities or escape routes for the Ijiraq.

The Ijiraq can perform a multiattack: in its true form, it can make two claw attacks, and in its hybrid form, it can make one gore and one claw attack. The gore attack, available only in hybrid form, allows the Ijiraq to make a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) poison damage. The claw attack, which can be used in both hybrid and true forms, also has a +6 to hit, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage and an additional 13 (3d8) poison damage.

Additionally, in its true form, the Ijiraq can magically turn invisible until it attacks or loses concentration, which can be strategic for ambushing or escaping. The Ijiraq has the Change Shape ability, which allows it to polymorph into any beast with a challenge rating no higher than its own, into its caribou-human hybrid form, or back into its true form. This ability enables the Ijiraq to absorb any equipment it carries into its new form, maintaining its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, and core mental attributes while adopting the statistics of the chosen beast form.

The combination of these attributes, abilities, and actions makes the Ijiraq a clever and elusive foe, adept in both combat situations and psychological manipulation, presenting unique challenges for adventurers who face it.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Magic Weapons:** The ijiraq's weapon attacks are magical.

The ijiraq magically turns invisible until it attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). It may choose whether equipment it wears or carries is invisible with it or not.
- **Change Shape:** The ijiraq magically polymorphs into any beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, into its caribou-human hybrid form, or back into its true from. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the ijiraq's choice). <br><br>While in its true form or its hybrid form, its statistics are the same. When in a beast form, the ijiraq retains its alignment, hp, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
