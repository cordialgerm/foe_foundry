<summary>The Giant Boar is a massive, aggressive beast with thick, bristly fur and sharp tusks. These creatures roam forests and plains, foraging for roots, fungi, and small animals, but they are quick to charge at anything that threatens them. A Giant Boar's charge is a fearsome attack, capable of knocking down even the largest foes. Despite their size, Giant Boars are fast and resilient, and their tough hide makes them difficult to harm. They are highly territorial and will defend their herds or young with ferocity, making them a formidable presence in the wild.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Boar is a robust creature that embodies the traits of a large beast with impressive physical capabilities. With an armor class of 12, it can withstand moderate attacks, while its hit points totaling 63 give it substantial endurance in combat, rated at a Challenge Rating of 2. The boar is well-suited for frontline engagement due to its speed of 40 feet, allowing it to close distances quickly. Its Strength score of +3 contributes to its potent melee attacks, while its Constitution score of +3 provides strong resilience. However, it is notably lacking in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, making it poor at mental contests and communication. The boar's distinct abilities, such as Charge and Relentless, enhance its lethality and survivability, making it a formidable opponent despite its mediocre Dexterity and lack of any noteworthy senses or languages.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Boar has a Strength of 16, contributing to its attack modifier of +5, which means its chances of landing hits in combat are good. Its Dexterity is 10, making it average in terms of agility or finesse required for stealthy movements or ranged attacks. With a Constitution of 16, the creature possesses a very good ability to take damage. The Wisdom and Charisma scores are both quite low at -2 and -3 respectively, which makes the boar very bad at Wisdom saves and interactions that require charm or persuasion.

As for its special abilities, the Giant Boar can use Charge to enhance its tusk attacks significantly. If it rushes at least 20 feet toward a target and lands a hit, the additional damage dealt is 7 (2d6) slashing damage. The target must also succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. This ability can be pivotal in combat, allowing the boar to potentially incapacitate a foe with a single powerful maneuver. Additionally, its Relentless ability allows it to remain active and in the fight after taking what would normally reduce it to 0 hit points, instead dropping to 1 hit point, making it exceptionally durable.

In terms of standard combat actions, the Giant Boar can utilize Multiattack to perform two tusk strikes in one turn; if both attacks land on the same target, that target must also succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone again. The tusk strike itself inflicts an average of 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, solidly contributing to the boar’s offensive capabilities.

Additionally, the Giant Boar features a bonus action called Challenging Snort, where it can intimidate a creature within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn, which also imposes disadvantage on its next save against being knocked prone by the boar, potentially setting the stage for further attacks.

Overall, the Giant Boar is a strong physical combatant with useful traits for both dealing and absorbing damage in battle.

The Giant Boar is a formidable Large beast known for its aggressive nature and powerful physical attacks. With a sturdy armor class of 12 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 47, it can withstand a fair amount of punishment in battle. Its challenge rating of 2 indicates that it is a moderate threat to adventurers, providing 450 experience points upon defeat. The creature excels in strength, boasting a score of 16 which gives it a good modifier of +3, making its melee attacks quite effective. Conversely, the Giant Boar has very low intelligence, wisdom, and charisma, which makes it poor in social interactions and mental challenges. Its unique resilience is highlighted by its special ability, Relentless, allowing it to survive fatal blows under certain circumstances.

The Giant Boar has the following ability scores:  
- Strength: 16 (+3) - This strong attribute makes it very good at melee combat, allowing it to hit hard with its tusk attacks.  
- Dexterity: 10 (+0) - This average score indicates that it is not particularly agile or quick, reflecting its bulk.  
- Constitution: 18 (+4) - With this exceptional constitution, the Giant Boar has a very good ability to absorb damage and maintain its hit points in combat.  
- Intelligence: 2 (-4) - This very low score shows that it has very bad reasoning and problem-solving skills.  
- Wisdom: 8 (-1) - This below-average wisdom means that its insight and awareness are lacking, resulting in bad perception abilities.  
- Charisma: 4 (-3) - The Giant Boar has very bad social grace, making it ineffective in any diplomatic encounters.

The Giant Boar has a passive Perception score of 9, which is relatively low, indicating that it may struggle to notice hidden threats or subtle details in its environment. The creature does not understand any languages, reflecting its bestial nature.

One of the Giant Boar's notable abilities is called Relentless. This special ability can be used once per day, and it allows the boar to endure a potentially fatal blow. When the Giant Boar takes 10 or fewer points of damage that would otherwise reduce its hit points to 0, it drops to 1 hit point instead, potentially allowing it to continue fighting even after sustaining a critical hit.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Giant Boar primarily uses its Tusk attack. This melee weapon attack is made with a +5 to hit, which is a good modifier, enabling it to successfully strike targets within reach. The attack has a range of 5 feet and inflicts a base of 10 slashing damage (2d6+3) upon a successful hit. If the Giant Boar charges at least 20 feet straight towards its target before attacking, it deals an additional 7 slashing damage (2d6) and forces the target to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. A target that fails the saving throw falls prone, making it easier for the Giant Boar to attack again on subsequent turns.

Overall, the Giant Boar serves as a challenging adversary in combat, leveraging its strong physical abilities and unique resilience to pose a significant threat to parties of adventurers who encounter it.</detail>
