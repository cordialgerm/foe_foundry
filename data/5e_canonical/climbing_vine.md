<summary>The Climbing Vine is a medium-sized, unaligned plant creature that provides a unique challenge in encounters due to its ability to grapple foes and inflict damage through its specialized abilities. It features a low Armor Class of 11, which makes it somewhat easier to hit, but it compensates with decent hit points totaling 13, derived from rolling 2d8+4. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, it is considered a minor threat that can still impact gameplay through its grappling and damaging capabilities. Strengths include its implementation of the Digestive Dew ability that deals acid damage to grappled enemies, while its weakness lies in its vulnerable Dexterity score, which is very bad, making it easy for opponents to evade its attacks. </summary>

<detail>

The Climbing Vine has the following attributes: Strength at 13 (+1), Dexterity at 7 (-2), Constitution at 15 (+2), Intelligence at 1 (-5), Wisdom at 7 (-2), and Charisma at 1 (-5). Most notably, the Dexterity score is very bad, hindering its ability to react defensively, while its Constitution at +2 provides it with an average resilience against damage. The climbing vine is equipped with a perception skill at a modifier of -2, which is also bad, indicating limited awareness of its surroundings. It has immunity to psychic damage and is unaffected by conditions such as being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, or prone. With blindsight extending for 20 feet and a passive perception score of 8, it can sense nearby creatures without seeing them, although not very effectively.

The Climbing Vine’s special abilities include Digestive Dew, which inflicts 2 points (1d4) of acid damage to any creature that starts its turn grappled by the vine. This ability creates a tactical environment where players must prioritize escaping the vine before taking further damage. The Flexible Form ability allows the Climbing Vine to move through spaces as narrow as 6 inches, enabling it to evade obstacles in its environment with ease.

In terms of actions, the Climbing Vine can use Dewvine to make a melee weapon attack with a +3 modifier against a creature within 5 feet. If successful, the target is grappled, with an escape difficulty of DC 11. Each Climbing Vine has two attacking vines, meaning it can potentially grapple two creatures simultaneously. The Squeeze action targets any creature within its grasp, requiring the grappled target to make a DC 11 Strength saving throw. Failure results in taking 5 points (2d4) of bludgeoning damage, adding pressure on the grappled players to escape quickly.

As a reaction, the Climbing Vine can trigger Grasping Retaliation when a creature hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet. This allows the vine to launch a Dewvine attack in response, introducing an additional layer of interaction in melee combat scenarios and punishing opponents for engaging it directly. Overall, the Climbing Vine serves as an interesting encounter element, combining grappling mechanics with area control in its environment.</detail>
