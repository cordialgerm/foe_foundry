<detail>

The attributes of the Kobold Drake Rider are as follows: Strength (STR) is 17, providing a +3 modifier which is good, Dexterity (DEX) is 16, also giving a +3 modifier, making it good in both attack and defense. Constitution (CON) stands at 15, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is average. Intelligence (INT) is 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average, Wisdom (WIS) is 10 with no modifier, making it very bad, and Charisma (CHA) is 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is also average. Its skills include a perception score of +0, and it has darkvision up to 60 feet along with a passive perception of 12, allowing it to see in low-light environments. The Kobold Drake Rider can communicate in Common and Draconic.

Special abilities of the Kobold Drake Rider include:

- **Drake Mount:** The rider has established a bond with a Med or larger drake mount, which can act as a controlled mount regardless of its intelligence, following the rider's commands. Mounting and dismounting only costs 5 feet of the rider's movement.
  
- **Mounted Warrior:** While riding, neither the rider nor the mount can be charmed or frightened, ensuring both remain steadfast in combat.
  
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** When exposed to sunlight, the rider suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that depend on sight.
  
- **Sure Seat:** While mounted and not incapacitated, the rider is secured in the saddle and cannot be knocked prone, dismounted, or moved against their will.
  
- **Trained Tactics (Recharge 4–6):** The rider can command the mount to move up to 30 feet in a straight line through the space of any Large or smaller creature without provoking opportunity attacks. During this maneuver, the rider can choose one of the following tactics:
  - **Barrel Roll:** If the mount can fly, it can perform a looping maneuver, allowing the rider to make one spear attack against a target with advantage, rolling damage three times on a hit.
  - **Corkscrew Roll:** If the mount has a swimming speed, it can cause all creatures in a line to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become incapacitated with dizziness until the end of their next turn.
  - **Weaving Rush:** This maneuver causes each creature in the line to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and become prone.

For actions, the Kobold Drake Rider can perform a **Multiattack**, making three Spear attacks during its turn. If it is mounted, the drake can make one Bite, Claw, Slam, or Tail attack afterwards. The **Spear** can be used both in melee and ranged attacks, with a +5 to hit and dealing either 6 (1d6+3) piercing damage at close range or 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage when used two-handed in melee.

As a reaction, the Kobold Drake Rider possesses **Failsafe Equipment**, which includes wing-like arm and feet flaps attached to its back. If the mount dies or the rider is dismounted, it can descend up to 60 feet per round without taking any falling damage if the mount was flying, or gain a swimming speed of 30 feet for one minute if the mount was swimming.</detail>
