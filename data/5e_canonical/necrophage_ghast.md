<summary>The Necrophage Ghast is a Medium undead creature embodying chaotic evil. This monster possesses a mix of physical and magical capabilities that make it a formidable foe in combat. With an Armor Class of 13, the Necrophage Ghast can absorb some damage while boasting a total of 65 hit points, allowing it to endure a fair amount of harm. It has a relatively high Dexterity score of 17, granting it a good modifier of +3, making its attacks quick and nimble. Despite its strengths, the creature has a low Charisma of 8, which presents a significant weakness in social interactions and spells that rely on this stat. The presence of the Necrophage Ghast can significantly hinder its opponents with its special abilities, such as Necrophage Stench and Turning Defiance, while its spellcasting options grant it control and damage-dealing capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Necrophage Ghast has the following attribute scores: Strength is 10 with a modifier of +0 (average), Dexterity is 17 with a good modifier of +3, Constitution is 14 with a good modifier of +2, Intelligence is 16 with a good modifier of +3, Wisdom is 10 with an average modifier of +0, and Charisma is 8 with a modifier of -1 (very bad). It has proficiencies in arcana and investigation skills, both rated at +5, which is very good. The creature is immune to poison damage and resistant to necrotic damage, but it also suffers from condition immunities, including being charmed, exhausted, or poisoned. Its senses include darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 10. It can communicate in Common.

The special ability Necrophage Stench poses a serious threat to living creatures, as any such creature within 30 feet at the start of its turn must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in disadvantage on all saving throws against spells cast by any Necrophage Ghast for one minute, compelling opponents to avoid close proximity. However, a successful save or the end of the effect provides immunity to the stench for 24 hours. The ability Turning Defiance grants the Necrophage Ghast and nearby undead advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, reinforcing its resilience against certain clerical powers.

The Necrophage Ghast is also a 5th-level spellcaster with a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 bonus to hit with spell attacks. It has several spells prepared that enhance its capabilities in combat and manipulation. Its cantrips include friends, mage hand, poison spray, and prestidigitation, giving it some versatility. At the first level, it can use charm person to influence others, false life for added durability, magic missile for guaranteed hits, and ray of sickness for causing damage and poisoning. At the second level, it can cast hold person, which can incapacitate foes, and invisibility, allowing for stealth maneuvers. Finally, at the third level, it can animate dead to raise fallen foes as minions and hypnotic pattern to mesmerize enemies and incapacitate them by inducing a state of confusion.

In terms of its actions during combat, the Necrophage Ghast can make a melee weapon attack using its bite with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 12 piercing damage on a successful hit. It can also utilize its claws for another melee attack, with a +5 to hit, dealing an average of 10 slashing damage. If the target is not undead, a successful hit forces the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for one minute, creating a significant threat to living adversaries as they risk being incapacitated. The effectiveness of these capabilities makes the Necrophage Ghast a dangerous opponent in various encounters.</detail>
