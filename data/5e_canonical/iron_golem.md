<summary>An Iron Golem is a massive, humanoid construct made entirely of iron and brought to life through powerful magic. Standing over 12 feet tall, these golems are nearly indestructible, their iron bodies impervious to most forms of attack. Iron Golems are often used as guardians of treasure vaults, fortresses, or important relics, and they follow their creator’s commands without question. In battle, they strike with tremendous force, wielding massive weapons or crushing foes with their iron fists. Iron Golems can also release a cloud of poisonous gas, incapacitating nearby enemies. Despite their immense power, they are slow and methodical in their movements.</summary>

<summary>The Iron Golem is a formidable large construct that serves as a powerful guardian or protector, often employed by wizards, sorcerers, or malicious entities to safeguard their secrets or locations. With a high armor class of 20, this creature is very durable in combat, able to withstand significant amounts of damage with its impressive 201 hit points. Its challenge rating of 16 indicates that it poses a serious threat to adventurers, particularly those unprepared for its magical resistances and physical attacks. Notably, the Iron Golem is immune to most forms of damage, except for magical sources, making it exceptionally tough in battles where typical weapons and tactics might fail. However, its lack of dexterity and its low intelligence make it predictable in certain scenarios, as it may struggle against clever strategies or magic that targets its weaknesses.</summary>

<detail>

The Iron Golem possesses a Strength score of +12, which results in exceptional proficiency in physical attacks, while its Dexterity score of -1 reflects very bad dodging ability, making it less effective in avoiding incoming attacks. The Constitution score of +5 contributes to its good overall resilience, but it has very bad scores in Intelligence and Charisma, indicating it is a simple-minded construct without any social prowess. With a Wisdom score of +0, its perceptive capabilities are average, allowing it to notice threats but not necessarily see through illusions or misleading tactics.

Among its various special abilities, the Iron Golem has Construct Nature, allowing it to function without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep. With Golem Resilience, it showcases remarkable durability by being immune to poison, psychic damage, and most forms of physical damage from non-magical sources, while also being immune to exhaustion and several debilitating conditions like charmed or frightened. Fire Absorption is crucial in combat, allowing the golem to heal rather than suffer from fire damage, enhancing its longevity in prolonged battles. Immutable Form further adds to its resilience by preventing any alterations to its physical form through spells or effects. The golem also benefits from Magic Resistance, giving it an advantage on saving throws against magical effects, while its Magic Weapons trait ensures that its attacks cannot be easily avoided by standard defenses.

In terms of action capabilities, the Iron Golem can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make four Spear Arm attacks, showcasing its exceptional offensive potential. The Spear Arm attack has a +12 to hit, operating at a reach of 10 feet, dealing 25 piercing damage when it successfully lands a strike. The Shield Bash is a critical component of its combat tactics, delivering a powerful blow with a +12 to hit, which can knock enemies prone if they fail a DC 18 Strength saving throw. Furthermore, the Expel Poisonous Gas ability, available on a recharge of 5-6, allows it to unleash a 15-foot radius poisonous gas attack, dealing significant poison damage to nearby enemies unless they succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw.

Overall, the Iron Golem serves as an effective and challenging opponent in battle, combining high physical damage potential with impressive defensive capabilities, making it a notable adversary for any adventuring party.</detail>
