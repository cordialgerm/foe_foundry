<summary>The Ghost Dwarf is a Medium undead creature with a neutral evil alignment that embodies the restless spirit of a once-living dwarf. It serves as an effective combatant in encounters, leveraging its combination of melee abilities and necrotic damage to weaken opponents. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it is a dangerous opponent, especially in environments that allow for stealth and ambush. Its flying speed and incorporeal movement grant it mobility advantages, while its special abilities, like Aura of Defiance and Prayers Unanswered, provide it with significant defensive capabilities and crowd control potential. However, it suffers from sunlight sensitivity, making it vulnerable in daylight situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Ghost Dwarf has an Armor Class of 14, which provides a moderate level of protection, and it possesses 81 hit points, making it relatively durable for its Challenge Rating. Its ability scores show it as particularly dexterous with a Dexterity of 14 (+2), allowing for improved agility and maneuverability. Its Charisma score of 15 (+2) indicates a presence that can influence and frighten others. The Strength score is very bad at 4 (-3), making it ineffective in physical confrontations relying on brute force. With a Constitution score of 10 (+0), it demonstrates average resilience, and a Wisdom score of 14 (+2) contributes to its effectiveness in perceiving threats.

For saving throws, the Ghost Dwarf has a Wisdom modifier of +5, which is good, enhancing its chances to resist mental effects. It possesses immunities to necrotic and poison damage, along with resistance to acid, cold, fire, and lightning damage, and it is resistant to nonmagical physical attacks, broadening its survivability in diverse combat scenarios. Additionally, it is immune to a variety of conditions including charmed, exhaustion, and paralyzed, making it exceptionally difficult to control during encounters.

The Ghost Dwarf's special abilities significantly enhance its combat prowess. The Aura of Defiance grants itself and adjacent undead advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, making it a strong ally in undead-focused confrontations. With Ethereal Sight, it can perceive entities in the Ethereal Plane, allowing for advanced tactical awareness. Incorporeal Movement lets it pass through solid objects, though it risks taking damage if it ends its turn inside one. However, while in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks, which is a notable weakness.

In combat, the Ghost Dwarf can utilize several actions. Its Multiattack allows it to make three attacks, ensuring consistent pressure on foes. The Ghostly Axe is a versatile weapon that can be used in melee or at range, dealing 5 slashing damage plus 9 necrotic damage. The Hand of the Grave is a powerful melee attack that inflicts 18 necrotic damage and can permanently reduce the target's hit point maximum unless they succeed on a Constitution saving throw. Furthermore, it has the ability called Prayers Unanswered, which can frighten multiple opponents within range on a failed Wisdom saving throw, leading to potential control over the battlefield. Lastly, Etherealness allows the Ghost Dwarf to move between planes, providing strategic options for retreating or positioning offensively without being able to affect or interact with the material world during its movement phase.</detail>
