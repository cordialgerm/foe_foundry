<MonsterName/>Darkmantle</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Darkmantle is a shadowy, octopus-like creature that clings to cavern ceilings, waiting to ambush prey below. Its leathery, dark-colored body blends into the shadows, making it nearly invisible in dim light. When a creature passes beneath it, the Darkmantle drops down, wrapping its tentacles around the victimâ€™s head and smothering them. Darkmantles also have the ability to emit magical darkness, further disorienting their prey. They are solitary predators and are most commonly found in caves or the Underdark, lurking in areas where they can use their natural camouflage to deadly effect.</summary>

<summary>The Darkmantle is a Small Monstrosity that primarily serves as a lurking predator in its environment. This creature possesses a range of abilities that make it effective at ambushing prey. With a decent Armor Class of 11 and moderate Hit Points totaling 22, the Darkmantle can withstand some damage but is not overly resilient. Its movement capabilities are unique, allowing it to walk at a slow pace of 10 feet while being able to fly swiftly at 30 feet, making it agile and hard to pin down. Its Challenge Rating of 1/2 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, with an experience reward of 100 XP upon defeat. A notable aspect of the Darkmantle is its ability to create areas of magical darkness, which can severely hinder its opponents' visibility, and its grappling power can constrain foes effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The Darkmantle has a Strength score of 16, translating to a +3 modifier that is considered very good. Its Dexterity and Constitution scores are 12, each providing a +1 modifier, rated as average, while its Intelligence (2, -4), Wisdom (10, +0), and Charisma (5, -3) are poor indicators of its cognitive and social skills. The Darkmantle possesses blindsight up to 60 feet, enabling it to detect creatures in total darkness, but this ability is negated if the creature is deafened. 

One of the Darkmantle's unique features is its false appearance; when motionless, it can blend seamlessly with rock, making it difficult for adventurers to notice it until it strikes. 

In combat, the Darkmantle utilizes a Multiattack, allowing it to both activate its Darkness Aura and make a crush attack in a single turn. The Darkness Aura creates a 15-foot radius of magical darkness that is impenetrable to darkvision and natural light. This effect lasts for up to 10 minutes or until the Darkmantle suffers damage, making the battlefield extremely challenging for those reliant on sight. 

The Darkmantle can also perform a Crush attack, making a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit (considered good). This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is successfully hit and grapples (escape DC 13), the Darkmantle can gain a tactical advantage. If the attack is made with advantage, it can attach itself to the target's head, causing blindness and preventing the target from breathing. While grappling, the Darkmantle's speed drops to 0, effectively securing its grip while still being able to focus its attacks on the restrained opponent.

The Darkmantle is a small monstrosity that resembles a cave formation such as a stalactite or stalagmite when motionless. This creature has a unique strategic role, effectively serving as an ambush predator in dark environments. Its strengths include its resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, allowing it to maintain combat efficiency over time. However, its armor class is relatively low at 11, and its hit points total 25, making it somewhat vulnerable if discovered and attacked. It has a challenge rating of 1/2, indicating it is suitable as a low-level encounter for adventurers. Notably, the Darkmantle is capable of attacking and attaching itself to its prey, causing continued damage while impairing the target's ability to see and breathe.

For its attributes, the Darkmantle has a Strength of +3, which is considered good, enabling it to effectively deal melee damage. Its Dexterity is +1, which is average and provides some evasion in combat. It has a Constitution of +1, which again is average and contributes to its durability. Intelligence is -4, indicating very bad cognitive abilities, while its Wisdom is +0, suggesting average perception skills. Finally, its Charisma is -3, indicating very bad skills in social interactions or influence.

The Darkmantle has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Echolocation allows it to sense its surroundings within 60 feet, though it cannot use this ability while deafened. With False Appearance, when the Darkmantle remains still, it can deceive creatures into thinking it is simply part of the environment. Its Jagged Hide ability inflicts 2 piercing damage on any creature that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet, providing a deterrent against attempting to engage it in close quarters. Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it a bit more resilient in prolonged encounters.

In terms of actions, the Darkmantle has two primary offensive capabilities. The first is the Crush action, which is a melee weapon attack that adds a +5 to hit. If it successfully hits, it deals 6 bludgeoning damage and attaches itself to the target, blinding and restricting the breathing of creatures that are Medium or smaller. This attachment deals additional damage at the start of the Darkmantle's turns, continuously applying pressure. The second action, Topple, allows the Darkmantle to knock its attached target prone with a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is already prone, it is restrained, providing an opportunity for further attacks or control.

Additionally, the Darkmantle has a bonus action called Darkness Aura, which it can use once per day. This ability creates a magical darkness that extends 15 feet around it and moves with the Darkmantle, lasting up to 10 minutes while it maintains concentration. This darkness prevents Darkvision from seeing through it and dispels any natural light within its radius, creating a tactical advantage in combat and hindering opponents' visibility.</detail>
