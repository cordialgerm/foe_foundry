<MonsterName/>Desert Slime</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Ooze</CreatureType>

<summary>The Desert Slime is a formidable large ooze creature that inhabits arid environments, resembling ordinary sand when still. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it is suitable for mid-level encounters and possesses a total of 75 hit points, which offers decent durability in combat. Its low Armor Class of 8 signifies that it can be hit quite easily, making it somewhat vulnerable in battle. However, it compensates for this with solid offensive capabilities, particularly its ability to restrain and damage opponents through its unique traits and actions. While the Desert Slime is unaligned and does not possess any language or communication skills, it excels in ambushing and incapacitating creatures foolish enough to wander too close.</summary>

<detail>

The Desert Slime's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength score of 17, providing a +3 modifier, which is classified as good for melee attacks. The Dexterity score is low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, which is very bad, affecting its agility and ability to avoid attacks. The Constitution score is 14, granting a +2 modifier for good resilience against health-related effects. Intelligence is notably very low at 2, giving it a -4 modifier, which marks it as very bad for any reasoning or knowledge-based skills. Wisdom is average at 10, providing a +0 modifier, while Charisma is dismal at 1, resulting in a -5 modifier, so it lacks any social influence.

The Desert Slime is immune to acid and fire damage and is not affected by conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or frightened. It has a blindsight range of 60 feet, enabling it to detect creatures without relying on sight, though it is effectively blind beyond that range. The ooze does not require sleep and can move through spaces that are at least 1 foot wide without being hindered.

The Desert Slime has some notable special abilities. The "Amorphous" ability allows it to squeeze through narrow spaces, enhancing its mobility. Its "False Appearance" trait allows it to blend seamlessly with the sand, making it challenging for opponents to detect until it moves. The "Ooze Nature" feature means it does not need to rest, which suits its role as a constant threat in its environment. Additionally, because of its "Sandy Ooze" characteristic, it can occupy the same space as other creatures, making the terrain around it difficult for others to navigate.

In combat, the Desert Slime utilizes the "Pseudopod" attack, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit. Upon succeeding, it deals 7 bludgeoning damage in addition to 10 acid damage, making this a potent attack.

Its primary action, "Mire," targets a creature within its space, forcing it to make a Dexterity saving throw with a difficulty of 13. If the creature fails this save by 5 or more, it becomes restrained and knocked prone. Even if it passes, the creature still becomes restrained, which means it is effectively immobilized and begins to suffer acid damage at the start of each of the slime’s turns. If the restrained creature is also prone, it cannot breathe or cast spells that require verbal components. The slime can only have one creature restrained at a time, and the restrained creature can attempt to escape by succeeding on a Strength check against a DC of 13, although doing so would inflict acid damage on the creature helping.

As a bonus action, the Desert Slime can use "Surging Sands," which allows it to take the Dash action, increasing its speed momentarily and enabling it to reposition itself or close the distance to its targets effectively.

Overall, the Desert Slime presents unique challenges in combat, combining stealth, area control, and persistent damage to keep its foes at bay.</detail>
