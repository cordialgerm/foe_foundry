<MonsterName/>Doppelrat</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Doppelrat is a Tiny monstrosity known for its cunning and adaptability in combat. With an Armor Class of 13 and a hit point total of 45, this creature is relatively resilient for its size, allowing it to endure some damage. It possesses an impressive Dexterity of 17, giving it a very good modifier of +3, which enhances its ability to dodge attacks and escape danger. However, its physical strength is incredibly low, with a Strength score of just 2, resulting in a very bad modifier of -4. This imbalance makes the Doppelrat heavily reliant on its special abilities and stealth tactics rather than physical confrontation. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating it represents a moderate challenge for adventurers, with a reward of 450 experience points for defeating it. </summary>

<detail>

The Doppelrat has several notable attributes: it has a decent Constitution at +2, which provides it with some extra resilience, but it lacks intelligence and charisma, scoring only 2 in both stats, leading to very bad modifiers of -4. While its Wisdom is average at +1, it leverages its keen senses with darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 11. The creature excels in stealth, boasting a +5 skill modifier, making it particularly effective at avoiding detection in shadowy settings.

One of its defining special abilities is Arcane Doubling, which allows the Doppelrat to create duplicates of itself that act as a swarm of rats. This swarm functions as an ally and can move with the Doppelrat using its reaction, creating a tactical advantage in combat. The swarm can persist for up to one minute or until the Doppelrat is dismissed or killed, but the doppelrat is limited to controlling two swarms at a time. Another ability, Hidden Original, grants the Doppelrat total cover while it’s inside a swarm it has created, making it difficult for opponents to target it unless they succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. 

The Doppelrat is also capable of inflicting the Horrific Doppeling disease through its bite attack. This disease poisons the affected creature until cured and has a lingering effect where the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw after each long rest, or it suffers the grotesque outcome of shedding a tumor resembling a smaller version of itself. The disease requires two successful saving throws for complete recovery. 

In combat, the Doppelrat uses its Bite attack, which has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If the attack is successful, it deals 5 piercing damage (1d4 + 3), and the target must then succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract the horrific doppeling disease. 

In summary, the Doppelrat excels in evasion, deception, and inflicting debilitating conditions while relying on creating distractions through its summoning abilities.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Arcane Doubling:** While in combat, at the start of each of its turns, the doppelrat rapidly creates duplicates of itself as an automatic defense mechanism. These duplicates immediately form into a swarm of rats in the doppelrat’s space, acting as allies of the doppelrat and obeying its body language commands. The swarm acts on the doppelrat’s turn, and the doppelrat can use its reaction to move up to its speed with the swarm, provided it is in the swarm’s space when the swarm moves. The swarm remains for 1 minute, until the doppelrat dies, or until the doppelrat dismisses it as a bonus action. The doppelrat can have no more than two swarms of rats under its control at a time.
- **Hidden Original:** While the doppelrat is in the space of a swarm it created with Arcane Doubling, it is indiscernible from the other rats and has total cover. A creature must take an action to visually inspect the swarm and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find the doppelrat among its duplicates. Once a creature succeeds on this check, the doppelrat loses total cover against attacks and spells from that creature and that creature’s allies until the doppelrat starts its turn in the same space as one of its swarms.
- **Horrific Doppeling:** Characterized by the growing and sloughing off of tumors shaped like the infected creature, horrific doppeling is a disease that infects creatures attacked by doppelrats. Until the disease is cured, the creature is poisoned. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or shed a tumor that looks like a Tiny version of itself. Though disturbing, the tumor is merely a mass of shed skin and fat that decays as normal. The disease is cured after the creature succeeds on two saving throws.
- **Keen Smell:** The doppelrat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract the horrific doppeling disease (see the Horrific Doppeling trait).
