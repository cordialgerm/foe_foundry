<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>A Pseudodragon is a small, dragon-like creature about the size of a cat. It has leathery wings, a barbed tail, and shimmering scales that often come in shades of red, gold, or green. Despite their small size, Pseudodragons are intelligent and magical creatures, capable of telepathic communication with those they trust. They are often sought after as familiars by wizards or other spellcasters due to their loyalty and keen senses. Pseudodragons can deliver a painful sting with their barbed tail, which also carries a mild venom that causes sleepiness. They are naturally curious and playful, though they can be fiercely protective of their companions.</summary>
