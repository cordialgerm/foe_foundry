<summary>A Pseudodragon is a small, dragon-like creature about the size of a cat. It has leathery wings, a barbed tail, and shimmering scales that often come in shades of red, gold, or green. Despite their small size, Pseudodragons are intelligent and magical creatures, capable of telepathic communication with those they trust. They are often sought after as familiars by wizards or other spellcasters due to their loyalty and keen senses. Pseudodragons can deliver a painful sting with their barbed tail, which also carries a mild venom that causes sleepiness. They are naturally curious and playful, though they can be fiercely protective of their companions.</summary>

<summary>The Pseudodragon is a tiny dragon-like creature often favored for its intelligence and magical abilities. With an Armor Class of 13 and only 7 hit points, it is relatively fragile in combat but can be a valuable companion due to its magical resistance and ability to communicate telepathically. Its primary strength lies in its agility, with a Dexterity score of 14 that provides a good modifier (+2) for actions involving stealth, making it particularly adept at sneaking around or escaping danger. Despite its frail nature, it can inflict potent effects through its sting attack and spells like Telepathic Static, particularly in disrupting enemy actions.</summary>

<detail>

The Pseudodragon has the following attributes: Strength 6 (very bad), Dexterity 14 (good), Constitution 12 (average), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 12 (average), and Charisma 10 (average). It possesses a good Dexterity modifier, enhancing its ability to evade attacks and perform subtle maneuvers. It is equipped with skills in Perception (+3) and Stealth (+4), making it a competent scout. Its senses include blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to navigate low-light environments efficiently. Despite its ability to understand Common and Draconic languages, it cannot speak, limiting its interactions.

The Pseudodragon has unique special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in various situations. Its Limited Telepathy enables it to communicate simple ideas, emotions, and images to any creature within 10 feet. This can aid in planning or warning allies without alerting foes. Additionally, its Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it resilient against magical attacks.

In combat, the Pseudodragon can use its sting attack, which requires a melee weapon attack roll of +4 to hit, reaching out to 5 feet to target one creature. On a hit, it deals 4 piercing damage (1d4 + 2) and forces the target to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails, it becomes poisoned; it must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. Success means the effect ends, while failure results in the target becoming unconscious for one hour, unless awakened through damage or an action from another creature. This ability can effectively incapacitate foes, allowing allies to gain an upper hand.

The Pseudodragon can also unleash Telepathic Static three times per day. This action targets one creature it can see within 10 feet, compelling the target to make a DC 11 Charisma saving throw. A failed save leaves the target stunned until the end of its next turn, as it is overwhelmed by a barrage of telepathic imagery. This can provide critical openings during combat, potentially disabling key threats to the Pseudodragon and its allies.

The Pseudodragon is a tiny dragon that possesses many unique qualities, making it both a fascinating companion and a tricky adversary. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is considered a low-level creature, yet it showcases impressive abilities such as magic resistance and heightened senses. Its strengths lie in its agility, perceptive skills, and telepathic communication, allowing it to navigate environments with ease and avoid detection. However, with only 12 hit points and an Armor Class of 13, it is relatively fragile and can be taken down quickly if faced with direct attacks. Overall, the Pseudodragon serves as an excellent scout or a magical companion, while being vulnerable in straightforward combat situations.

In terms of attributes, the Pseudodragon has a Strength of -2, which is very bad, a Dexterity of +2 — regarded as good for dodging attacks, a Constitution of +1, indicating average resilience, an Intelligence of +0, which is average in terms of cognitive ability, a Wisdom of +3, which is very good for perception and insight, and a Charisma of +0, which is average for social interactions. 

It possesses several special abilities that enhance its capabilities. The **Heightened Senses** ability grants the Pseudodragon a Perception score of 18 when using sight, hearing, or smell, making it an exceptional observer in its surroundings. With **Magic Resistance**, it has an advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, significantly improving its survivability against magic users. Meanwhile, **Limited Telepathy** allows it to share simple thoughts, emotions, and images with any creature within 100 feet that understands a language, facilitating communication without spoken words.

In terms of actions, the Pseudodragon can perform a **Bite** attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 4 piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, it has a **Sting** attack, functioning similarly with a +4 to hit and also reaching 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 4 piercing damage, plus an additional 2 poison damage (1d4) and forces the target to make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 11. If the target fails this saving throw by 5 or more, they fall unconscious while poisoned, remaining in that state until they take damage or are woken by another creature's actions. This ability makes the Pseudodragon a significant threat in battle due to its potential to incapacitate foes. Lastly, the Pseudodragon can use **Puff of Smoke** once per day, exhaling a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius sphere that heavily obscures vision, lasting for one minute unless dispersed by strong winds. This ability can be strategically used to create cover or to escape from danger.

Overall, the Pseudodragon is a small but capable creature, offering intriguing options for both combat and support in various adventuring scenarios.</detail>
