<summary>The Fang of the Great Wolf is a large monstrosity that embodies the ferocity and cunning of a predator. With a neutral evil alignment, this creature is both formidable and tactical in its approach to combat. It possesses considerable physical strength and speed, making it a dangerous opponent in battle. Notable for its significant hit points and natural armor, the Fang of the Great Wolf can endure a decent amount of damage while dealing substantial piercing damage with its bite attack. However, it has a low intelligence and charisma, which limits its social interactions and strategy-based abilities. Its main strengths lie in its physical attacks and the ability to grapple opponents, while its weaknesses include lower damage resistances and a reliance on melee combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Fang of the Great Wolf has an Armor Class of 14, offering a good defense through its natural armor. It has 65 hit points, calculated as 10d10 plus 10, making it durable but not invincible. The creature can move quickly with a speed of 50 feet. Its challenge rating is 3, meaning it is appropriate for encounters designed for characters of mid-level experience, yielding 700 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Fang has a Strength of 16, which provides it a modifier of +3, indicating exceptional physical power for melee attacks. Its Dexterity score of 13 gives it a +1 modifier, which is considered average, contributing to agility but not heavily impacting its combat effectiveness. The Constitution is also a 13 (+1), which supports its hit points but does not provide additional resilience beyond that. The creature has a low Intelligence score of 9 (-1), limiting its problem-solving capabilities and knowledge-based interactions. Wisdom is at 13 (+1) and helps it with perception checks, aided by a +3 bonus in insight and a +5 bonus in perception, making it quite effective at identifying threats. However, its Charisma is notably low at 8 (-1), indicating very bad social skills.

One important ability is **Keen Hearing and Smell**, which grants the Fang of the Great Wolf advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. This enhances its capability to detect prey or foes in its vicinity.

The Fang's primary action is its **Bite** attack. This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to effectively engage targets close by. If successful, it inflicts 13 piercing damage (3d6 + 3). Notably, if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the Fang can grapple the target, applying an escape DC of 13. While grappled, the target is restrained, making it easier for the Fang to control the combat scenario since it cannot bite another target until the grapple ends.

The Fang of the Great Wolf has a special ability called **Might of the Great Wolf**, which recharges after a short or long rest. This ability allows the creature to grow in size, resembling the effects of the enlarge/reduce spell but only permitting enlargement for a duration of 1 minute. While enlarged, the Fang gains an additional attack option called **Swallow**. This action enables it to make one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target that it is grappling. If the bite hits, the target is swallowed and becomes blinded and restrained, having total cover against attacks from outside the worg. Furthermore, the swallowed creature suffers 10 acid damage at the start of the Fangâ€™s turns. The Fang can only swallow one creature at a time, but if it takes 10 damage or more from that creature on a single turn, it must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate the swallowed target. 

If the Fang is no longer enlarged or dies, any swallowed creature is also released, falling prone in a space within 5 feet of it. This combination of abilities makes the Fang of the Great Wolf a menacing threat in encounters, dominating foes with its physical prowess and controlling tactics.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Keen Hearing and Smell:** The worg has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13) if the worg isn't already grapping a creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the worg can't bite another target.
- **Might of the Great Wolf (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** The fang of the Great Wolf grows in size. This works like the enlarge/reduce spell, except the worg can only enlarge and it lasts for 1 minute. While enlarged, the fang of the Great Wolf gains the following action:<br>Swallow. The worg makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worg, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the worg's turns. The worg can have only one creature swallowed at a time. <br><br>If the worg takes 10 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the worg must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the worg. The creature is automatically regurgitated when the worg is no longer enlarged. If the worg dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
