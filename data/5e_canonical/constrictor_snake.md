<summary>The Constrictor Snake is a large, muscular serpent known for its ability to coil around its prey and squeeze with crushing force. Found in jungles, forests, and swamps, these snakes are skilled hunters, lying in wait for their prey before wrapping around them and suffocating them. Though they lack venom, their immense strength makes them dangerous to even large creatures. Constrictor Snakes rely on their stealth and patience, using their camouflage to blend into their surroundings before striking swiftly. Once they've captured their prey, they consume it whole.</summary>

<summary>The Constrictor Snake is a large beast known for its powerful constriction and ability to ambush prey. With an Armor Class of 11, it is relatively easy to hit, but it compensates for its lower defenses with a decent health pool of 13 hit points, calculated from rolling 2d10 and adding 2. This makes it moderately resilient but not overly tough. It has a Challenge Rating of 1/4, implying it is suitable for lower-level encounters, rewarding players with 50 experience points upon defeat. Notable for its mobility, the Constrictor Snake can walk, climb, and swim at a speed of 30 feet each, giving it versatility in various terrains.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Constrictor Snake possesses a Strength score of 14 (+2), which is regarded as good and enables it to deal significant damage in melee combat. Its Dexterity score of 12 (+1) is average, providing some agility but not enough to excel in evasive maneuvers. The Constitution score of 12 (+1) is also average, contributing to its modest hit points. However, its Intelligence score is quite low at 2 (-4), meaning it is not capable of complex thought or problem-solving, which is expected for a beast. It has a Wisdom score of 10 (+0), indicating it has a basic awareness of its surroundings, while its Charisma score of 3 (-4) is very bad, reflecting its inability to interact socially.

The Constrictor Snake has blindsight out to 10 feet and a passive Perception score of 10, allowing it to sense vibrations and movement nearby, a useful ability for hunting or avoiding danger. It does not communicate through language.

The Constrictor Snake can take two primary actions in combat: **Bite** and **Constrict**. When it uses its Bite attack, it performs a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit against a target within five feet. If successful, it inflicts 6 points of piercing damage, which can be significant for lower-level characters. The second action, **Constrict**, is another melee weapon attack that also has a +4 to hit and allows the Constrictor Snake to deal 5 points of bludgeoning damage. If the attack hits, the target is grappled with an escape DC of 14, indicating that a character will need to succeed on a Strength or Dexterity check to break free. Once grappled, the target is restrained, limiting its movements and actions, and the snake cannot grapple a different target until the current grapple ends. This combination of damage and control makes the Constrictor Snake a formidable opponent against unsuspecting adventurers, particularly in close quarters.</detail>
