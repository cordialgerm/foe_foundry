<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Constrictor Snake is a large beast best known for its ability to grapple and restrain prey, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers who come too close. With an Armor Class of 12 and 15 hit points, the snake has decent resilience for its Challenge Rating of 1/4, indicating it poses a minor threat to most parties. Its speed allows it to move effectively both on land and in water, giving it great versatility in various environments. The snake’s main strength lies in its ability to restrain opponents and inflict damage through its bite and constrict actions. However, it is somewhat limited by its average Strength and Dexterity scores, which translate to overall lower attack potential and moderate defensive capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The snake has the following attributes: 
- Strength: +2 (average)
- Dexterity: +2 (average)
- Constitution: +1 (average)
- Intelligence: -5 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +0 (average)
- Charisma: -4 (very bad)

This creature has keen senses up to 10 feet, a perception score of 10, and a stealth score of 12, which indicate it is reasonably adept at noticing threats and remaining undetected. Concerning languages, the Constrictor Snake does not communicate verbally.

In terms of its special abilities, the Constrictor Snake has two primary attack options: 

1. **Bite:** This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, allowing it to target a creature up to 5 feet away. On a successful hit, the snake inflicts 5 piercing damage, calculated as 1d6 + 2. 

2. **Constrict:** Similar to the bite attack, this melee weapon attack also has a +4 to hit and targets one creature within 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it deals 6 bludgeoning damage (1d8 + 2) and grapples the target if the creature is Large or smaller, with an escape DC of 12. While grappling, the target is restrained, and the snake can only grapple one creature at a time.

The snake can also use a bonus action:

- **Crush:** When the snake has a creature grappled, that creature must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or take 4 bludgeoning damage (1d8) and begin suffocating. The creature remains in danger of suffocation until the grapple ends, which can greatly affect its survival in combat.

Overall, the Constrictor Snake excels at ambushing targets and controlling battle space through its grappling ability, although adventurers typically find it manageable due to its moderate overall attributes and low-level challenge rating.</detail>
