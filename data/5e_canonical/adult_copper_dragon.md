<summary>The Adult Copper Dragon is a lithe and agile creature, with scales the color of aged copper that shimmer with a dull, metallic gleam. It is known for its playful and mischievous personality, often playing pranks or engaging in wordplay with those it encounters. Copper Dragons prefer rocky hills or mountains, where they make their lairs in hidden caves. Despite their lighthearted nature, they are formidable in battle, able to breathe a gout of corrosive acid or unleash a gas that can slow and confuse enemies. Copper Dragons enjoy riddles and puzzles, and often challenge those they meet to games of wit.</summary>

<summary>The Adult Copper Dragon is a huge and formidable creature that serves as an iconic representation of powerful dragons in Dungeons & Dragons. With a challenge rating of 17, it possesses significant offensive and defensive capabilities. Its impressive armor class of 18 and robust hit points totaling 253 render it a challenging adversary in combat. This dragon has strengths in both melee attacks and spellcasting, making it versatile in various tactical scenarios. Despite its formidable nature, it has a few weaknesses, notably its reliance on its legendary resistances, which, when depleted, lowers its Armor Class. With its unique ability to blend into terrain and the potential to frighten foes, the Adult Copper Dragon is a master of battle who can control the battlefield's dynamics effectively.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Adult Copper Dragon has a Strength of 22, which offers a +6 modifier, categorizing it as exceptional in physical power. Its Dexterity is average at 12, providing a +1 modifier that is not particularly strong but still decent for a creature of its size. Constitution is high at 20 (+5), granting it good resilience against damage. It has an Intelligence of 18 (+4), indicating good tactical thinking, and Wisdom of 14 (+2), which is above average for perceptiveness. Charisma is also strong at 16 (+3), enhancing the dragon's innate spellcasting effectiveness.

The dragon’s saving throw bonuses are noteworthy: it has a +7 to Dexterity saves, +11 to Constitution saves, +8 to Wisdom saves, and +9 to Charisma saves, indicating that it is very good at avoiding effects that target these attributes. It excels in several skills, including deception (+10), perception (+9), and stealth (+7), showcasing its cunning and ability to remain undetected.

The dragon is immune to acid damage and has several notable senses, including blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive perception of 20. It can communicate in Common, Draconic, and two additional languages, indicating its ability to engage with various beings.

The dragon’s special abilities enhance its stealth and survivability. "Flow Within the Mountain" enables it to hide more effectively in mountainous areas and allows it to merge with stone surfaces, enabling strategic movement across the battlefield. The "Legendary Resistance" allows the dragon to negate failed saving throws three times per day, although failing to use them reduces its Armor Class temporarily. 

The dragon's innate spellcasting is bolstered by a high Charisma score (save DC 17), allowing it to cast several powerful spells without needing material components, specifically "hideous laughter," "suggestion," "mislead," and "polymorph," each of which can significantly influence encounters, disrupt opponents, or provide strategic advantages.

In combat, the dragon utilizes multiattack, delivering powerful strikes with its bite (with a +12 to hit, dealing 22 piercing damage plus 4 acid damage on a success) and two claw attacks (also with +12 to hit, dealing 19 slashing damage). It can also use its tail attack to push targets away or employ the Acid Spit ability, forcing a Dexterity saving throw (DC 19) that can inflict significant acid damage and ongoing damage if the target fails. Its breath weapons - Acid Breath and Slowing Breath - provide area-of-effect attacks that can damage or incapacitate multiple foes.

The dragon can magically change shapes, allowing it to become a humanoid or beast, though it sacrifices some of its capabilities in that form. In terms of reactions, the Tail Attack allows it to retaliate against melee attackers within close proximity.

The dragon has access to legendary actions, enabling it to exert control over the battlefield even out of turn. These include a fear-inducing Roar, a disruptive Wing Attack to push creatures back while gaining flight, and a tactical Tricksters Gambit which enables it to teleport and create illusory duplicates to confuse enemies.

Overall, the Adult Copper Dragon is a powerful and versatile foe that poses a significant challenge to adventurers, utilizing a blend of physical attacks, strategic movement, and spellcasting to dominate encounters.


The Adult Copper Dragon is a formidable creature known for its cunning, agility, and magical abilities. This huge dragon boasts a solid Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of hit points at 252, making it a durable opponent in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 14, it poses a significant threat to adventurers due to its combination of powerful physical attacks, particularly its multiattack capabilities, and devastating breath weapons. Its strong ability scores include a noteworthy Constitution of +10, granting it excellent resilience, while its Charisma of +8 enhances its social interactions and spellcasting. However, like all dragons, it has specific weaknesses that can be exploited if opponents plan strategically. 

The dragon's attributes include the following: Strength at +6, Dexterity at +6, Constitution at +10 (exceptional), Intelligence at +4 (average), Wisdom at +7 (very good), and Charisma at +8 (very good). The dragon possesses darkvision with a range of 120 feet and keensense up to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its environment more acutely than many other creatures. With a high Perception score of 22, it can detect hidden enemies or traps easily, and it has a decent Stealth modifier of +16, indicating it can maneuver quietly when necessary. The creature can communicate in Common and Draconic.

Among its special abilities, the Adult Copper Dragon has Corrosive Scales, inherited from its younger stage, which likely contribute to its overall resilience in combat. Its Legendary Resistance, usable three times per day, allows the dragon to choose a successful save instead of failing, which is an incredibly strategic advantage during battles.

In combat, the dragon can use its Multiattack feature, which allows it to unleash its Frightful Presence, making enemies within 120 feet potentially terrified and vulnerable. Following that, it can execute a Bite attack, dealing 17 piercing damage, or two Claw attacks, each inflicting 13 slashing damage. The dragon also possesses a Tail attack, dealing 15 bludgeoning damage. The Frightful Presence forces opponents to succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute, significantly impacting their ability to fight effectively. They can repeat the save at the end of each turn to try and break free from the effect. 

Its Acid Breath, which has a recharge time of 5 to 6, allows the dragon to unleash a line of corrosive acid up to 90 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures in this line must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 54 acid damage, which can decimate low-hit-point foes quickly, while a successful save still results in half damage. Furthermore, the Slowing Breath ability, rechargeable on a 6, delivers a 60-foot cone of slowing mist that affects the speed of those caught.

For bonus actions, the dragon can Change Shape, morphing into a beast or humanoid form that matches its challenge rating. In this new form, it retains its Legendary Resistance and hit points, making it a versatile and unpredictable opponent.

The dragon also possesses a set of Legendary Actions, allowing it to take actions outside its regular turn. It can use Detect to pinpoint creatures and traps within 30 feet automatically, making it hard to ambush. The Tail Attack allows for quick retaliation during enemy turns, while Elemental Roar (costing two actions) makes targets vulnerable to acid damage if they fail a DC 16 Charisma save. Lastly, with Wing Attack (also costing two actions), it can deal damage and knock back enemies nearby, while allowing it to reposition safely. 

Should the Adult Copper Dragon perish, its regional effects will fade over the course of a year, but the exact nature of those effects requires further specification. This dragon's unique traits and abilities make it a memorable foe in any campaign, capable of challenging even the most prepared adventuring party.</detail>
