<summary>The Dvarapala is a formidable Huge Giant that serves as a guardian figure, embodying the will of its patron deity. With a challenge rating of 5, it possesses a robust defensive capability with an Armor Class of 14 due to natural armor and a substantial pool of 136 hit points, providing it with good survivability in combat. This giant characteristically has exceptional strength, with a Strength score of 19 (+4), allowing it to be a powerful melee combatant. While it is notably less agile, exhibiting bad Dexterity with a score of 8 (-1), its considerable Constitution (18) and Wisdom (16) scores contribute to its endurance and perceptiveness. The Dvarapala's inherent divine abilities, resistance to magical effects, and unique attack capabilities make it a versatile opponent in various combat situations, although its average Intelligence and very bad Charisma suggest it may struggle with social interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Dvarapala's saving throw modifiers are good in Strength (+7), Constitution (+7), and Wisdom (+6). It is skilled in Perception (+6) and has knowledge of Religion (+3). The creature is immune to the charmed, exhaustion, and frightened conditions and possesses darkvision that enables it to see in darkness up to 120 feet. Its passive perception score is impressive at 16, indicating its keen awareness of its surroundings. The Dvarapala can communicate in Common and can use telepathy within 120 feet. Additionally, it can speak a language related to its patron deity, enhancing its connection to powerful cosmic forces.

The Dvarapala has several special abilities that contribute to its effectiveness in combat. The Divine Words ability allows it to communicate in a language tied to the nature of its deity, lending it a mystical presence. Its Keen Senses give it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that depend on sight, hearing, or smell, reinforcing its perceptual dominance. The Magic Resistance ability grants the Dvarapala advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it resilient against spellcasting adversaries. The You Shall Not Pass feature allows it to make opportunity attacks not only when an enemy leaves its reach but also when they enter, effectively giving it an extra chance to strike, as it can utilize an additional reaction specifically for this purpose.

In terms of innate spellcasting, the Dvarapala can innately cast spells using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14). It can cast the sacred flame cantrip at will, which deals 2d8 radiant damage to a target. It can also use thunderwave three times a day, creating a loud blast of sound that pushes back creatures. Once per day, it can evoke the gust of wind spell, creating a strong wind, and the wind wall spell, forming a barrier of wind.

When it comes to physical attacks, the Dvarapala has a distinct melee weapon attack using its gada. It has a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 25 (6d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage to a target and possibly pushing foes that are Large or smaller. The javelin attack allows both melee and ranged strikes with the same +7 to hit modifier. When thrown, it deals 14 (3d6 + 4) piercing damage. Finally, its Sweeping Strike ability can be activated every few turns (requires a recharge on a roll of 4-6), where it can target enemies within 10 feet. Creatures must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or suffer 24 (7d6) bludgeoning damage, taking half on a successful save, along with being pushed 5 feet away if they fail.

Overall, the Dvarapala serves as a powerful guardian with a mix of physical might, resistances, and spellcasting abilities, making it a formidable foe in any confrontation.</detail>
