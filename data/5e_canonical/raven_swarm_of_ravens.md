<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Raven, Swarm of Ravens, is a medium-sized swarm of tiny beasts that serves as an interesting addition to Dungeons & Dragons 5e encounters, offering both functional support to other monsters and unique challenges to players. With a lower Armor Class of 12 and 13 Hit Points, it is relatively fragile but gains significant advantage through its swarm mechanics and special abilities. Its Challenge Rating of 1/4 indicates that it can be a manageable encounter for a group of low-level adventurers. The swarm excels in stealth and evading direct combat, leveraging its special abilities to disrupt spellcasting and locate carrion, making it a nuisance in battles. However, its low Strength and Constitution scores indicate vulnerabilities in direct melee combat. </summary>

The attributes of this swarm reveal its strengths and weaknesses: it has a Strength of -2 (very bad), a Dexterity of +2 (good), and a Constitution of -1 (bad). Its Intelligence is -4 (very bad), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is -1 (bad). The swarm benefits from a good Perception score of 13 and a Stealth of 12, allowing it to remain undetected in many scenarios.

The Swarm of Ravens possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The "Carrion Sense" ability allows the swarm to detect the presence of carrion, dead creatures, and undead within a range of 60 feet, providing it with valuable reconnaissance abilities. The "Pilfering Swarm" ability creates a disruptive tactical situation, as creatures within the swarm's space must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to successfully cast spells that require material components. If they fail, the spell is wasted, but not the spell slot, as the swarm of ravens steals the component. The "Swarm" ability lets the swarm occupy other creatures' spaces and move through tight openings, enhancing its maneuverability on the battlefield. Importantly, the swarm cannot regain Hit Points or gain temporary Hit Points. Lastly, "Swarm Resilience" gives the swarm resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, while immunity to several conditions, making it tough to control in combat.

In terms of actions, the swarm can perform a melee attack called "Beaks." When performing this attack, it uses a +4 modifier to hit a target in its space, dealing 9 (2d8) piercing damage on a successful hit, or 4 (1d8) piercing damage if the swarm has half or fewer Hit Points remaining. This scaling damage mechanic encourages strategic thinking, forcing opponents to decide whether to prioritize attacking the swarm or mitigate its effects.

Overall, the Raven, Swarm of Ravens offers unique gameplay opportunities through its disruptive mechanics and swarm behavior, making it a memorable encounter for players.</detail>
