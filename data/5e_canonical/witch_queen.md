The Witch Queen's ability scores are as follows: 
- Strength: 9, which equates to a very bad modifier of -1, indicating that she is not physically strong.

In terms of skills, the Witch Queen excels in arcana and stealth, with bonuses of +3 and +6, respectively, signifying that she has a proficient knowledge of magical lore and can navigate situations quietly. She has darkvision up to 120 feet, enabling her to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and her passive perception is relatively low at 9. She can communicate in Common, Dwarvish, and Undercommon.

The Witch Queen possesses several special abilities:
- Heightened Spell allows her to impose disadvantage on a target's saving throw against her next spell, which she can use three times per day. This makes her spells more likely to succeed, enhancing her combat effectiveness.
- Magic Resistance gives her advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making her resilient to magical attacks.
- Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on her attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks when in sunlight, which is a significant drawback for her in daylight situations.
- As an 8th-level spellcaster, her spellcasting ability is Charisma with a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 modifier to hit with spell attacks. 

The Witch Queen has a range of spells at her disposal, including:
- Cantrips such as acid splash, mage hand, message, and ray of frost which she can cast at will to deal damage or manipulate objects and communications.
- 1st level spells including burning hands, magic missile, and sleep, providing her with offensive capabilities and crowd control options.
- 2nd level spells like invisibility, spider climb, and suggestion, allowing her to evade attacks, traverse vertical surfaces, or influence the actions of others.
- 3rd level spells such as blink, fear, and lightning bolt, granting her powerful movement options, the ability to instill fear in opponents, and direct damage.
- 4th level spells blight and confusion offer significant area damage and the potential to disrupt enemy actions.

Additionally, the Witch Queen can execute a melee attack called Maddening Scimitar, which has an attack bonus of +6 to hit and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage. If she successfully hits a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they are forced to use their reaction to move their speed and attack the nearest enemy of the Witch Queen, demonstrating her manipulative combat style.</detail>
