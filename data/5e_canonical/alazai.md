<summary>The Alazai is a large elemental creature with a chaotic neutral alignment, making it unpredictable in combat and interactions. It boasts impressive physical stats, including a strong Constitution score that grants it a significant pool of hit points, and a high Strength that enhances its melee capabilities. The Alazai is particularly formidable due to its damage immunities to fire and poison, as well as its ability to remain invisible in many situations, complicating attacks against it. However, it has a weakness to cold iron weapons, which can disrupt its abilities and reveal its location. With a Challenge Rating of 10, it provides a considerable challenge to adventurers, especially with the combination of its strong melee attacks and powerful ranged fire spells.</summary>

- Strength of 21 (modifier +5, which is very good) 
- Dexterity of 15 (modifier +2, which is average) 
- Constitution of 22 (modifier +6, which is exceptional) 
- Intelligence of 10 (modifier +0, which is average) 
- Wisdom of 16 (modifier +3, which is good) 
- Charisma of 20 (modifier +5, which is very good).

For saving throws, the Alazai has a Dexterity modifier of +6 and a Wisdom modifier of +7, both of which are very good. It possesses a base skill in perception with a +3 modifier, indicating average awareness of its surroundings.

The Alazai's special abilities make it unique in combat:
- **Conditional Invisibility:** This allows the Alazai to remain mostly invisible unless specific conditions reveal it, such as cold temperatures or darkness, which can affect the tactics of those trying to fight it. Regardless of these conditions, attackers do not have disadvantage on attacks against it during those situations.
- **Elemental Nature:** The Alazai does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate without the need for basic sustenance.
- **Fire Form:** This ability enables the Alazai to squeeze through very tight spaces with ease. Additionally, creatures in close proximity who touch or strike it with melee attacks take fire damage.
- **Iron Disruption:** If struck by a cold iron weapon, the Alazai becomes visible and temporarily loses its ability to use two of its fire-related attacks, adding a strategic layer to combat against this foe.

In terms of attack options, the Alazai can:
- **Multiattack:** This allows it to perform two Burning Slams or three Hurl Flames in a single turn, showcasing its versatility in both melee and ranged combats.
- **Burning Slam:** A melee attack that deals significant damage with a total of 14 bludgeoning and 11 fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it also ignites, causing ongoing fire damage each turn unless extinguished.
- **Hurl Flame:** A ranged spell attack that can hit targets up to 120 feet away and inflicts substantial fire damage.
- **Scorching Aura (Recharge 6):** This powerful ability creates an area of effect around the Alazai, inflicting fire damage on nearby creatures in contact with metal objects. It also forces targets to make a Constitution saving throw or drop their metal items, assuming they cannot remove their armor, which would burden them with disadvantage on future attacks and checks until the Alazai's next turn.

Overall, the Alazai presents a dangerous and unpredictable opponent due to its combination of elemental powers, physical prowess, and the ability to inflict chaos among adventurers through its attacks and special abilities.</detail>
