<summary>The Treacle is a tiny, unaligned ooze that presents as an unusual and deceptive creature within the realm of Dungeons & Dragons. This diminutive entity serves as both a potential threat and a cunning trickster due to its ability to drain blood from unsuspecting victims while remaining undetected. With its unique blend of mobility and mimicry, the Treacle can navigate through tight spaces and disguise itself as familiar, less threatening objects. While it possesses low combat attributes, its average durability and clever tactics make it a noteworthy opponent for adventurers, particularly at low levels. However, its limited offensive capabilities mean that it is best used as a stealthy ambusher rather than a front-line combatant.</summary>

<detail>

The Treacle has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average for a creature of its challenge rating. It possesses 22 hit points, calculated through 4d4 plus an additional 12, granting it good resilience for a creature designed to be encountered by low-level parties. Its movement speed is 10 feet, which is quite slow compared to other creatures. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/4, providing a worth of 50 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of ability scores, the Treacle has a Strength of 4, resulting in a very bad modifier of -3, making it incapable of delivering significant physical attacks. Its Dexterity is 15, leading to a good modifier of +2, which allows it to be nimble and agile. The Constitution of 17 provides an exceptional +3 modifier, contributing to its durability and hit points. It has Intelligence and Wisdom scores of 1, both resulting in a very bad -5 modifier, indicating a lack of mental capabilities. Finally, it has a Charisma of 10, which provides an average modifier of +0.

The Treacle possesses a skill in Deception, allowing it to lie convincingly with a modifier of +4, which is relatively effective for tricking other creatures. It has blindsight out to 120 feet, meaning it can perceive its environment without relying on sight, but is blind beyond that distance. Its passive Perception is very low at 5, indicating poor awareness of its surroundings. The Treacle cannot communicate in languages.

In terms of special abilities, the Treacle has Amorphous, which allows it to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without restriction, enabling it to escape or ambush from unexpected angles. Its Mimicry ability lets it imitate animal sounds. A creature that hears the Mimicry can detect its true nature with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

For actions, the Treacle has Blood Drain, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, the Treacle attaches to the target and begins to drain blood, causing the victim to lose 5 hit points (2d4) at the start of each of the Treacle’s turns. The victim must make a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to realize they are being attacked, although those below half their hit points automatically succeed on this check.

The Treacle can use the reaction called Mimic Innocence when it sees a creature move within 120 feet of it. In response, it can change its shape into that of a Tiny Beast or an inanimate object that the approaching creature considers non-threatening. While the Treacle's shape transforms, part of it retains a white, pale, or pearlescent quality, and its texture remains soft and plush. It can maintain this guise for up to 8 hours or until another creature it can see moves within the same distance. This ability adds a layer of strategy, allowing the Treacle to potentially deceive adventurers into letting their guard down.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The treacle can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Mimicry:** The treacle can mimic animal sounds. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

### Actions

- **Blood Drain:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: The treacle attaches to the target. While attached, the treacle can’t attack, and at the start of each of the treacle’s turns, the target loses 5 (2d4) hp due to blood loss. Each time the target loses hp in this way, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the treacle is attached and harming it, otherwise it is unaware the hp loss is from the treacle. A creature that loses hp in this way while below half its hp maximum automatically succeeds on this check.

### Reactions

- **Mimic Innocence:** When a creature the treacle can see moves within 120 feet of it, the treacle squishes, stretches, and molds its body into the shape of a Tiny Beast or object the creature finds least threatening, such as an injured rabbit or a long-lost toy. The treacle’s body takes on most of the coloration of the desired shape, but some part of it is always white, pale, or pearlescent. Regardless of the shape, the treacle’s flesh doesn’t change and is soft and plush to the touch. The treacle can maintain this shape for up to 8 hours or until another creature it can see moves within 120 feet of it.
