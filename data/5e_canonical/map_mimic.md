<summary>The Map Mimic is a tiny monstrosity that serves a unique role in combat and exploration scenarios. With its ability to disguise itself as an ordinary object, it excels in ambush tactics, allowing it to blend seamlessly into its environment until it strikes. It has a relatively low challenge rating of 1/4, indicating that it is a minor threat to experienced adventurers but can still pose challenges to unsuspecting characters. Its strengths include its decent Armor Class of 14, which provides it good protection, and its ability to deal consistent damage through its attacks. However, it has low hit points at 22 and poor strength, which are notable weaknesses that can be exploited by agile characters.</summary>

<detail>

The Map Mimic has the following attributes: Strength 7 (very bad), Dexterity 15 (good), Constitution 14 (good), Intelligence 5 (very bad), Wisdom 13 (average), and Charisma 16 (very good). It has a +2 modifier to Dexterity, which enhances its ability to avoid attacks and contributes to its overall agility. The Constitution score allows it to endure a moderate amount of damage. Consequently, the Map Mimic is effective at dodging attacks but lacks raw physical power and intelligence.

One of the standout special abilities of the Map Mimic is its "False Appearance." When it remains motionless, it can mimic the appearance of an ordinary object, which can effectively deceive adventurers and allow it to launch surprise attacks. Its "Life Path" ability enables it to create a map on its surface that indicates the route it has traveled since leaving its parent mimic. This is particularly useful for navigation and can provide information about the terrain without revealing specific names of locations.

In terms of actions, the Map Mimic can perform a melee attack known as "Pseudopod." When it makes this attack, it has a +4 bonus to hit, reaching up to 5 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 5 bludgeoning damage (which is noted as 1d6 + 2) to the target and attaches itself to that target. While attached, the mimic cannot perform other attacks, but the attached target becomes blinded, creating a significant disadvantage in battle. Additionally, at the start of each of the Map Mimic's turns, the target takes 5 more bludgeoning damage, escalating the danger of being attached.

The Map Mimic also possesses a unique bonus action called "Change Shape." This allows the creature to transform into a Tiny object or revert back to its true amorphous form. Its statistics remain constant in either form, preserving its effectiveness. However, any equipment it carries or wears remains unchanged during this transformation. This ability grants it added versatility, as it can escape detection or reposition itself tactically during combat situations.

Overall, the Map Mimic provides an intriguing option for players and Dungeon Masters alike, offering both utility and threat potential in a compact form.</detail>
