<summary>The Ancient Bronze Dragon is a noble and disciplined creature, with scales that shimmer like polished bronze. These dragons are often found near coastlines or large bodies of water, where they protect and oversee vast regions. Known for their sense of justice and honor, Bronze Dragons often aid noble causes, defending coastal cities and ships from threats. Their breath weapon is a powerful blast of lightning, and they can also manipulate water to create tidal waves or storms. Despite their formidable power, Ancient Bronze Dragons are often diplomatic, preferring to resolve conflicts through reason rather than force.</summary>

<summary>The Ancient Bronze Dragon is a gargantuan creature known for its power and versatility. As one of the most formidable dragons, it serves as a guardian of coastal regions and is revered for its intelligence and connection to nature. With a high Armor Class of 21, it is difficult to hit, while its impressive 425 hit points and formidable Constitution make it exceptionally resilient in battle. The dragon possesses a range of abilities that enhance its combat prowess, such as strong multiattack capabilities featuring devastating bite, claw, and tail strikes. Its lightning immunity and natural spellcasting abilities further augment its effectiveness. Notably, it has the capacity for flight and swimming, making it a threat both in the air and underwater. While it has exceptional offensive capabilities, its reliance on advantageous terrain and the potential vulnerability during its recharge abilities may be considered a weakness.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient Bronze Dragon has the following ability scores: Strength 28 (+9, very good), Dexterity 10 (+0, average), Constitution 26 (+8, exceptional), Intelligence 18 (+4, good), Wisdom 16 (+3, good), and Charisma 20 (+5, very good). In terms of saving throws, it possesses Dexterity +7 (average), Constitution +15 (exceptional), Wisdom +10 (good), and Charisma +12 (very good). Its skills include Insight +10 (good), Perception +10 (good), and Stealth +7 (average). With damage immunity to lightning, it is particularly difficult for foes who rely on lightning attacks. Its senses of blindsight (60 feet) and darkvision (120 feet) grant it an advantage in low-light situations, while a passive Perception of 23 allows it to notice hidden dangers effectively. The languages it speaks include Common, Draconic, and two additional languages of its choice, making it capable of communicating with various races.

The dragon has several special abilities that contribute to its prowess. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, enhancing its mobility in diverse environments. The Legendary Resistance (3/day) enables it to succeed on a failed saving throw, at the cost of some of its scales, while also introducing a potential weakness that reduces its Armor Class to 19 when depleted. The Oracle of the Coast ability allows it to predict the weather for up to seven days and grants it the ability to cast the spell scrying in specific conditions, enhancing its strategic advantage. Its innate spellcasting, utilizing Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a save DC of 20, allows for versatile combat options, enabling it to cast fog cloud and speak with animals three times a day, while controlling the weather and etherealness once per day.

In combat, the Ancient Bronze Dragon can perform a Multiattack, making a bite attack and two claw attacks, or opting for a Lightning Pulse instead of its bite. The Bite attack has a +16 to hit and deals 31 piercing damage plus an additional 9 lightning damage, making it a formidable single hit option. The Claws offer a +16 to hit, delivering 22 slashing damage, while the Tail also has a +16 to hit and can push the target away, combining damage with battlefield control. The Trident can be used in its humanoid form, dealing 12 piercing damage at a distance. 

The Lightning Pulse ability targets a single creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw for significant lightning damage. If the target is in contact with water, nearby creatures can also be affected. The dragon's Breath Weapons have a recharge mechanic, allowing it to exhale powerful lightning or seawater attacks. The Lightning Breath, a long line attack, deals up to 93 lightning damage, while the Ocean Surge attack can push opponents away, controlling their positioning.

In addition to its standard attacks, the dragon has several bonus actions and reactions. The Change Shape ability allows it to transform into a humanoid or beast form without changing its core statistics, but limiting its combat capabilities in certain forms. The Tail Attack reaction offers a counterattack in response to a melee hit, reinforcing its defensive capabilities.

Furthermore, the Ancient Bronze Dragon can utilize legendary actions to further influence the battlefield. The Roar action can frighten creatures within range, while the Wing Attack can push opponents away and allow it to reposition itself. The Foresight action, costing two legendary actions, enhances its defenses by granting advantage on saving throws and disadvantage on attacks against it for a turn, showcasing the creature's foresight and tactical maneuvering in combat.

The Ancient Bronze Dragon is a gargantuan and formidable creature known for its intelligence and elemental control. This dragon serves as a powerful adversary or a majestic ally depending on the circumstances, boasting exceptional physical attributes along with powerful spells and abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 19, it possesses significant combat prowess, enhanced by its high Armor Class of 21 and impressive hit points totaling 314. Its main strengths lie in its combination of flight, versatility in shape-shifting, and potent breath weapons, which make it a terror on the battlefield. However, despite its strengths, players might find a way to exploit its vulnerabilities—most notably, its reliance on certain abilities that have recharge times, and the potential for its frightful presence to not affect creatures prepared against it.

The Ancient Bronze Dragon has the following attributes: 
- Strength: +9, which is considered very good, allowing it to deal considerable damage in melee combat.
- Dexterity: +6, classified as good, granting it decent agility.
- Constitution: +14, exceptional, ensuring a robust resistance to damage and the ability to endure through long combats.
- Intelligence: +4, average, reflecting its capability of using spells effectively but not exhibiting extraordinary intellect.
- Wisdom: +9, classified as very good, aiding in perception and awareness during encounters.
- Charisma: +11, also exceptional, enhancing its ability to communicate and influence others, including characters in combat or negotiation situations.

In terms of senses, the dragon can perceive with darkvision up to 120 feet and has keen senses that extend an additional 60 feet. Its Perception score of 27 is exceptional, making it highly aware of its surroundings. It also has access to the languages Common and Draconic, allowing it to communicate effectively with adventurers and other creatures.

The dragon possesses several special abilities:
- **Amphibious**: This ability allows it to breathe both air and water, offering immense versatility in various environments.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**: If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead, significantly bolstering its defenses.
- **Lightning Extraction**: This ability projects a bolt of lightning that can affect creatures within 30 feet, requiring a DC 22 saving throw to avoid damage.

During combat, the Ancient Bronze Dragon can use its actions as follows:
- **Multiattack**: This action allows the dragon to perform multiple attacks in one turn, specifically utilizing Frightful Presence to incapacitate foes followed by one Bite attack (with a +15 to hit, dealing an average of 20 piercing damage) and two Claw attacks (also at +15, each dealing 16 slashing damage). It can substitute one Bite attack for the use of its powerful Repulsion Breath if it's available.
- **Bite**: This melee attack has a reach of 15 feet and inflicts substantial piercing damage.
- **Claw**: With a reach of 10 feet, this attack inflicts slashing damage.
- **Tail**: A melee attack with a reach of 20 feet, dealing bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence**: Affecting all aware creatures within 120 feet, targets must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute, with the potential to repeat the saving throw each turn.
- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6)**: It unleashes a powerful line of lightning spanning 120 feet, necessitating a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw to either take full damage (88 lightning damage on a failed save) or half on success.
- **Repulsion Breath (Recharge 6)**: This ability pushes creatures away from the dragon up to 45 feet, requiring a DC 22 Strength saving throw to avoid being moved.

As for bonus actions, the dragon has the ability to **Change Shape**, allowing it to transform into a Beast or Humanoid of a challenge rating up to its own. This ability grants the dragon significant strategic flexibility as it can adapt to various scenarios while retaining core capabilities.

The Ancient Bronze Dragon also has an array of legendary actions that can be taken at the end of other creatures' turns, which include:
- **Detect**: Automatically revealing the location of all creatures and traps nearby.
- **Tail Attack**: Making an additional Tail attack when desired.
- **Elemental Roar (Costs 2 Actions)**: Vulnerabilizing up to two targets to lightning damage, which can be crippling in the right scenario.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**: Damaging and potentially knocking prone foes while repositioning itself effectively.

The dragon also possesses regional effects that could play a role in its territory, which are contingent on its survival and behavior. Overall, the Ancient Bronze Dragon embodies a potent mix of physical might, elemental control, and cunning, making it a formidable challenge in any campaign.</detail>
