<summary>The Armory Golem is a formidable Large Construct that serves as a powerful guardian in any encounter. It possesses significant defensive capabilities with an armor class of 15 and substantial hit points totaling 136. This creature has a challenge rating of 7, making it a moderately challenging opponent for adventurers. Its melee attacks deal considerable damage due to its high strength score of 20, which gives it a +5 modifier, allowing it to hit its targets effectively. However, the Armory Golem has a very poor Charisma of -4, meaning it lacks social power and can easily fail in interactions that require presence or persuasion. It is immune to many common negative effects such as poison and psychic damage, making it a resilient foe. However, smart players might find ways to exploit the golem's weaknesses related to its focus, presenting a tactical challenge in combat situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Armory Golem has the following attributes and mechanics:
- Strength: 20 (+5, which is exceptional)
- Dexterity: 14 (+2, which is good)
- Constitution: 16 (+3, which is good)
- Intelligence: 10 (+0, which is average)
- Wisdom: 10 (+0, which is average)
- Charisma: 2 (-4, which is very bad)

It is important to note that the golem is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that are not made with adamantine, granting it resilience against most standard weapon attacks. It also has several condition immunities, including exhaustion and being frightened, which enhances its durability in battle. The creature has a darkvision that allows it to see up to 60 feet in darkness and understands the languages of its creator, although it cannot communicate verbally.

The Armory Golem possesses a unique special ability known as "Armory Exploit." This ability allows its body parts to be targeted. When an attacker rolls a critical hit, they may opt to disable one of the golem's attacks, except for its slam attack, or try to destroy its focus instead. This introduces an interesting tactical element for players on how they choose to engage the golem.

Another notable ability is "Focus Weakness." If a creature is grappling the golem, they can attempt to remove its focus with a successful DC 15 Strength check. The stakes are high; if they succeed and the golem's focus is destroyed or removed, the golem must make a series of Constitution saving throws to determine if it continues to function or ultimately falls apart.

The "Immutable Form" ability further grants the golem immunity to any effects that would change its form, avoiding debilitating effects from spells. Furthermore, it possesses "Magic Resistance," giving it advantage on saving throws against magical effects, making it tough to debilitate with spells. Its attacks are magical, allowing it to bypass resistances that creatures might have against nonmagical attacks.

In terms of actions, the Armory Golem can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike twice in one turn. For individual attacks, its "Slam" ability can strike at +8 to hit, dealing 11 damage with a successful hit. The "Polearm Strike" is similar, dealing piercing damage with the same hit bonus. Additionally, the golem can utilize "Crossbow Barrage," a ranged attack option that can hit targets from a distance.

Finally, the "Shield Wall" ability is a defensive maneuver that requires recharge and allows the golem to encase its body in durable shields and armor, regaining hit points and temporarily increasing its armor class by 2. This can change the tide of battle, making it essential to strategize against this construct.</detail>
