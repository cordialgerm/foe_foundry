<summary>The Earth Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon known for its connection to the earth, both in its abilities and its role as a guardian of specific locations. With an Armor Class of 17 and 58 hit points, it is a moderately tough opponent for adventurers rated at Challenge Level 3, providing a balance of physical strength and unique abilities that make it formidable. The wyrmling exhibits good physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, while being average in Dexterity. It is capable of burrowing through earth and stone seamlessly, making it a cunning ambusher in its natural habitat. However, it is vulnerable to magical weapons, which can bypass its resistances. Its essence linking ability ties it to the land, affecting its power and longevity based on its proximity to a specific area, presenting both tactical advantages and potential weaknesses.</summary>

<detail>

The Earth Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: Strength of 14, Dexterity of 12, Constitution of 14, Intelligence of 12, Wisdom of 14, and Charisma of 10. The Strength and Constitution scores are good, allowing for effective physical attacks and resilience. Dexterity is average, giving it decent reflexes but not exceptional speed. Intelligence is average as well, indicating a moderate capacity for problem-solving, while Wisdom is good, enhancing its insight and perception skills. Charisma is average, meaning it does not excel at social interactions or threats.

In terms of skills, the wyrmling possesses an athletics skill that is very good at +4, allowing it to excel in physical pursuits. Its insight and perception skills are both good at +4, which helps it notice hidden creatures and understand their motivations. The nature skill is average at +3. 

For defenses, the dragon has damage resistance to attacks from nonmagical weapons, making it more resilient against standard physical attacks. It is also immune to petrification, protecting it from a common hindrance in combat. With darkvision extending up to 120 feet and tremorsense up to 30 feet, the creature can detect enemies even in darkness or through solid material. Its passive perception of 14 means it is somewhat aware of its surroundings without needing to actively search. The dragon can communicate in Draconic and Terran languages.

The Earth Dragon Wyrmling has several special abilities. Its Earth Glide allows it to burrow through unworked earth and stone without creating any disturbance, letting it ambush enemies or escape unnoticed. The False Appearance ability allows it to blend seamlessly into rocky terrain when motionless, making it difficult for intruders to detect. Its Essence Link ties it to a specific area, which dictates its well-being during long rests and influences the recovery state of that area upon its death, causing creatures that enter to suffer fatigue and strife.

In terms of combat actions, the wyrmling can make a melee attack with its Bite, which has a +8 to hit and can deal 13 piercing damage (2d10 + 2) on a successful hit. Additionally, its Scouring Breath ability (which recharges on a 5-6 roll) allows it to unleash a 15-foot cone of sand and stones, forcing creatures caught in it to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 10 slashing damage (3d6), while success halves the damage. The combination of its physical attacks and unique breath weapon makes it a versatile opponent with strong offensive potential.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Earth Glide:** The dragon can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing it.
- **False Appearance:** While the dragon remains motionless within its linked area, it is indistinguishable from a natural rocky outcropping.
- **Essence Link:** The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d10 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Scouring Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon breathes scouring sand and stones in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw  taking 10 (3d6) slashing damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
