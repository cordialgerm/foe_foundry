- **Enclose:** The berstuc encloses a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it in a mossy growth on the berstuc’s body, and the grapple ends. While enclosed in the berstuc’s growth, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover from attacks and other effects outside the berstuc, and it takes 21 (6d6) poison damage at the start of each of the berstuc’s turns. The berstuc can have only one creature enclosed at a time.
