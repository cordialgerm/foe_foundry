<summary>The Mithral Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon that embodies neutrality and possesses striking abilities that make it a formidable opponent despite its young age. With an impressive flying speed and the ability to resist magical effects, this wyrmling excels in maneuverability and magic resilience. Its combat capabilities are reinforced by a sharp bite and a powerful area-effect breath weapon that hinders movement and inflicts damage. However, being a young dragon, despite its potential, it may still struggle against more experienced adventurers. The creature thrives on agility and offensive spells, making it a noteworthy foe in a campaign setting.</summary>

The Mithral Dragon Wyrmling has an Armor Class of 14, attributed to its natural armor, which indicates a good level of protection. It possesses 44 hit points, calculated from a pool of eight eight-sided dice with an additional eight hit points added, marking this as an average durability for its challenge rating. With a walking speed of 60 feet and a flying speed of 50 feet, its mobility is very good. The creature has a challenge rating of 1, equating to a total of 200 experience points for those who defeat it.

The attributes of the Mithral Dragon Wyrmling are as follows: Strength is 12 with a modifier of +1, indicating an average physical capability; Dexterity is 14 with a modifier of +2, showcasing good agility; Constitution sits at 13 with a +1 modifier, denoting average hardiness; Intelligence is 14 (+2), reflecting good cognitive skills; Wisdom at 15 (+2) points to a good perception and insight; and Charisma is also 14 (+2), demonstrating a solid presence. 

For saving throws, the dragon has +4 in Dexterity, +3 in Constitution, +4 in Wisdom, and +4 in Charisma, all of which signify a very good resilience against various threats, particularly magical ones due to its special abilities. In terms of skills, it excels with a +4 bonus in Insight and Wisdom-based skills and a +6 in Perception, enhancing its ability to notice hidden threats, and it has a +4 bonus in Stealth to remain undetected.

This wyrmling has specific damage immunities, including immunity to slashing damage, as well as immunity to the charmed condition, making it challenging to control or seduce. Its senses grant it blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision at a range of 60 feet, resulting in a passive Perception score of 16 that allows it to detect nearby creatures effectively. The creature can communicate in all languages and has telepathy that extends to 30 feet.

A notable special ability of the Mithral Dragon Wyrmling is Magic Resistance, providing it with an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which significantly enhances its survivability in magical combat.

In terms of actions, the dragon has a Bite attack, which allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 7 piercing damage, calculated from one ten-sided die plus two. Additionally, instead of causing damage, the dragon may choose to end a magical effect of 2nd level or lower on the target using an ability check, where it uses its +4 modifier.

Furthermore, the prized Shard Breath ability allows the wyrmling to unleash a barrage of metallic shards in a 15-foot cone. Each creature caught within this area must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 14 slashing damage, determined by rolling four six-sided dice. A successful save reduces this damage by half. Importantly, the area affected becomes difficult terrain until the start of the dragon’s next turn, which can severely hamper the movement of targets caught within the cone. After that, the shards dissipate into silvery smoke, enhancing the thematic allure of the creature.</detail>
