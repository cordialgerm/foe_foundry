<summary>The Rime Worm is a formidable Large Elemental creature that thrives in icy environments. Unaligned in its motivations, it embodies the harshness of winter, making it a challenging foe for adventurers. With a solid Armor Class of 15, it can withstand significant damage, complemented by its robust 114 hit points derived from rolling twelve ten-sided dice plus an additional 48. The Rime Worm can efficiently traverse both land and burrow through ice and snow, boasting a speed of 30 feet on foot and another 30 feet while burrowing. It is rated as a Challenge Rating 6 creature, rewarding players with 2,300 experience points upon defeat, indicating that it presents a balanced level of threat for a party of adventurers. The Rime Worm's strengths lie in its impressive Strength (20, which offers an exceptional +5 modifier), high Constitution (19, granting a good +4 modifier), and unique cold damage abilities, while its Intelligence and Charisma scores are very low, reflecting a simplistic mindset and limited social interaction.</summary>

The creature utilizes several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, making it versatile in various environments. The Icy Body ability deals 4 cold damage (1d8) to any creature that touches it or strikes it with a melee attack within 5 feet, providing a deterrent to close combat. With Snow Camouflage, the Rime Worm benefits from advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in snowy terrains, allowing it to effectively conceal itself and ambush unsuspecting foes. The Snow Stride ability enables it to burrow effortlessly through snow and ice while ignoring movement penalties typically associated with difficult terrain made of these elements.

In battle, the Rime Worm can execute a multiattack, allowing it to make two Rime Tendril attacks against its foes. The Rime Tendril attack has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, and deals 12 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 5) in addition to 9 cold damage (2d8). If it grapples a target that is Medium or smaller, the escape DC is 15, forcing opponents into a precarious position. Additionally, it can invoke Freeze Prey, which compels a grappled creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the creature being petrified in ice for 1 minute, although they can repeat the save at the end of their turns, and taking fire damage grants an advantage on this saving throw. Last but not least, Black Ice Spray is a powerful area attack that can be used every 5 to 6 rounds; it releases icy shards in a 30-foot cone, demanding a DC 15 Constitution saving throw from creatures in the area. On a failure, the target takes 36 cold damage (8d8) or half damage on a success, and the area becomes icy difficult terrain for 1 minute, further complicating the battlefield for enemies.

Overall, the Rime Worm poses a unique blend of direct damage, strategic area control, and crowd-control capabilities, allowing it to effectively dominate in icy landscapes and engage adventurers in a challenging encounter.</detail>

- **Black Ice Spray (Recharge 5–6):** The rime worm sprays slivers of ice in a 30-foot cone.
