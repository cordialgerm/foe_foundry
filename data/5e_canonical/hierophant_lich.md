<summary>The Hierophant Lich is a formidable Medium Undead creature with any evil alignment. It serves as an exceptional combatant due to its high hit points of 91, derived from 14d8 plus a constitution modifier of 28, giving it good durability in battle. With an Armor Class of 14, it is reasonably difficult to hit, but it also benefits from various spellcasting abilities and strong saving throws. Its Challenge Rating of 9, offering 5,000 XP for defeating it, indicates that it is a significant threat to adventurers. The Hierophant Lich possesses several notable strengths, including resistance to a range of damage types and the ability to evade some debilitating conditions. However, its overall physical capabilities are average, with a Strength of 12, Dexterity of 13, and Intelligence of 12, making it less effective in melee combat compared to more physically robust creatures.</summary>

<detail>

The Hierophant Lich's ability scores include a Constitution of 15, providing a modest +2 modifier, which contributes to its hit points but does not grant extraordinary resilience. It has a Wisdom score of 20, translating to an exceptional +5 modifier, making it highly skilled in Wisdom saving throws. This is further enhanced by its proficiency bonus, resulting in a +9 to Wisdom saving throws, making it quite difficult to incapacitate or outmaneuver. It is also wise in perception checks and insights, having a +9 modifier in both, enabling it to detect unseen threats and understand contexts well. Its Charisma of 17 (+3 modifier) makes it a capable manipulator, allowing it to maximize its influence over undead creatures and forcefully charm opponents.

The Hierophant Lich has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. One significant ability is Legendary Resistance, which allows it to succeed on a saving throw it would have otherwise failed three times per day. This makes it exceptionally difficult to disable through magic or other effects. Another noteworthy ability is Levitate, enabling the lich to move vertically up to 20 feet without needing to concentrate, making it evasive in combat scenarios. Rejuvenation permits the lich to return to life within 1d10 days provided it has a sacred vessel, restoring its health and capabilities and making it a challenging foe to permanently defeat. Turn Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against effects intended to turn undead, increasing its resilience against certain clerical abilities.

In terms of spellcasting, the Hierophant Lich is a 9th-level spellcaster, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 17 and a +9 to hit with spell attacks. It has a versatile selection of spells prepared, including cantrips such as guidance, mending, sacred flame, and thaumaturgy. The first-level spell options include command, detect magic, protection from evil and good, and sanctuary, allowing it to manipulate or defend itself effectively at the beginning of combat. At the second level, spells like blindness/deafness and hold person provide further crowd control capabilities. Higher-level spells such as animate dead, dispel magic, spirit guardians, and flame strike offer offensive, defensive, and battlefield control tactics, significantly affecting the outcome of encounters.

In combat, the Hierophant Lich's main attack is called Unholy Smite. It makes a melee weapon attack with +5 to hit, and upon a successful hit, it deals 8 bludgeoning damage and an additional 9 necrotic damage. Additionally, the target must roll a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for up to a minute, forced to defend the lich. This effect becomes even more potent against undead, who are charmed for 24 hours upon failing their saving throw.

The Hierophant Lich can also make use of its legendary actions to enhance its combat strategy. It may cast a cantrip as a quick reaction, or expend its actions on more powerful moves such as using Unholy Smite again or executing Damnation, which instills fear in a target. For the Damnation ability, a creature within 10 feet must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute, creating strategic challenges for a party to overcome. This combination of spells, special abilities, and powerful melee attacks makes the Hierophant Lich a dangerous adversary that requires tactical responses from adventurers.</detail>
