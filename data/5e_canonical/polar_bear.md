<summary>The Polar Bear is a massive, white-furred predator found in the icy tundras and frozen seas of the north. Known for their strength, Polar Bears are fierce hunters, preying on seals, fish, and other animals in their frigid environment. They are excellent swimmers and can travel long distances across ice and water in search of food. In combat, Polar Bears rely on their powerful claws and crushing bites to overwhelm their enemies. Though they are solitary by nature, they will fiercely defend their territory and young from intruders.</summary>
