This creature is robust, boasting a solid Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor and a significant pool of Hit Points totaling 105, which provides it with exceptional durability in combat situations. The challenge rating of 6 indicates that it poses a medium-level threat to adventurers, granting a reward of 2,300 experience points upon defeat. The Crab Samurai is particularly notable for its diverse capabilities including effective melee attacks and the ability to grapple opponents, making it a strategic combatant in its environment. While it possesses limited intelligence and cannot speak, its combat abilities and special traits make it quite effective in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Crab Samurai has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 6 (-2), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 10 (+0). Its Strength is very good, allowing it to inflict significant damage and grapple effectively. Its Constitution is also good, contributing to its substantial health pool. However, its Dexterity is average, limiting its effectiveness in avoiding attacks but maintaining a steady performance. Intelligence is very bad, indicating it lacks mental acuity and reasoning. Wisdom is good, allowing for a reasonable perception and awareness in its surroundings, while Charisma is average, providing no particular advantages in social interactions.

In terms of combat mechanics, the Crab Samurai has a +7 modifier to its Strength saving throws, which is good, making it quite resilient to attempts to grapple or incapacitate it. It has proficiency in Perception with a +2 modifier, allowing for a passive perception of 15, which is above average. It benefits from damage resistances against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, further enhancing its survivability. Additionally, it is immune to being charmed or frightened, which allows it to maintain focus in combat.

The special ability "Amphibious" gives the Crab Samurai the capacity to breathe both air and water, enhancing its versatility in aquatic or marshy environments.

For its actions, the Crab Samurai can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make three melee attacks. However, if it is grappling two creatures, it is unable to use its Crustaceous Sword attacks. The Crustaceous Sword attack has a +7 to hit and deals 13 (2d8+4) slashing damage, making it a threatening option for combat. Additionally, it can use its Claw attack, which also features a +7 to hit and inflicts 11 (2d6+4) bludgeoning damage. Should it grapple a target that is Medium or smaller, they must succeed on an escape DC of 15 to break free, which can be quite constraining in battle.

The Crab Samurai can utilize the bonus action "Fighting Stance," which allows it to adopt one of several stances that modify its combat abilities. The "Banded Claw" stance inflicts 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage to each creature it has grappled at the start of their turn, enhancing damage output. The "Hard Shell" stance increases its Armor Class by 2, offering better defense. Conversely, the "Soft Shell" stance grants advantage on the first Crustaceous Sword attack each turn, significantly boosting its offensive capabilities in the initial stages of combat. These mechanics make the Crab Samurai a dynamic opponent, emphasizing its strategic role in various encounters.</detail>
