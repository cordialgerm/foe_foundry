<summary>The Simurg is a gargantuan celestial creature associated with neutral good alignment. It serves as a powerful ally in combat, with formidable flying capabilities and a range of abilities that allow it to heal, protect, and exert control over the battlefield. With strong physical attacks and potent spellcasting, the Simurg excels in both offense and support roles, making it a valuable addition to any party. However, its relatively low armor class for its size means that it can be vulnerable to focused attacks, especially from ranged enemies that can avoid its melee reach.</summary>

<detail>

The Simurg has an Armor Class of 15, derived from its natural armor, which is considered average for a creature of its size. It has a robust total of 108 hit points, calculated from rolling eight twenty-sided dice and adding 24, making it relatively tough to bring down in combat. Its fly speed is exceptionally good at 80 feet, and it can walk 20 feet, providing excellent mobility. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 5, indicating it presents a moderate challenge, worth 1,800 experience points for a party that successfully defeats it.

The Simurg's ability scores are as follows: Strength 18 (modifier +4, very good), Dexterity 11 (modifier +0, average), Constitution 17 (modifier +3, good), Intelligence 14 (modifier +2, good), Wisdom 17 (modifier +3, good), and Charisma 16 (modifier +3, good). Its saving throws are strong in Constitution (+6), Wisdom (+6), and Charisma (+6), making it well-rounded in defense against many effects. However, its Dexterity saving throw is average at +3. The creature possesses a +6 modifier in Perception skills due to its high Wisdom. It has resistances to radiant damage and senses including darkvision with a range of 120 feet, as well as a passive Perception score of 16. The Simurg can understand all languages and communicate telepathically within 120 feet.

The Simurg has notable special abilities. Its Flyby ability allows it to avoid opportunity attacks while flying away from a target, making it an elusive foe. The Keen Sight feature gives it an advantage on perception checks that rely on sight, enhancing its ability to detect threats. The creature's innate spellcasting is anchored in its Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 14. It can cast the following spells without requiring material components: 

- At will: "Detect Poison and Disease," allowing it to sense any toxins or infections; "Detect Thoughts," enabling it to read the surface thoughts of nearby creatures; and "Spare the Dying," which stabilizes a dying creature.
- Twice a day, it can use: "Cure Wounds," restoring health to an ally; "Lesser Restoration," removing conditions such as blindness or paralysis; and "Purify Food and Drink," ensuring consumables are safe.
- Once a day, it can cast: "Greater Restoration," which can restore up to 50 hit points and remove negative conditions; and "Remove Curse," freeing a creature from curses.

In combat, the Simurg can utilize the Multiattack feature, allowing it to make three attacks: one bite and two claw strikes. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 piercing damage (2d8 + 4). Similarly, its Claw attacks also have a +7 to hit and deal an average of 11 slashing damage (2d6 + 4) each.

The Simurg has a unique ability named Forceful Gale, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. When activated, it creates a powerful wind gust in a 30-foot cone. Every creature in that area must perform a Strength saving throw against a DC of 15. Creatures that fail take 27 bludgeoning damage (6d8), are pushed 10 feet away from the Simurg, and become knocked prone. Successful saves reduce the damage by half, and the creature remains standing in their original position. This ability can significantly influence the battlefield by disrupting enemy formations and causing chaos among foes.</detail>
