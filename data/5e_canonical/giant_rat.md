<summary>A Giant Rat is a larger, more aggressive version of the common rat, often found in dark, abandoned areas like sewers, dungeons, or ruined buildings. Its sharp teeth and claws allow it to gnaw through wood and stone, and its pack mentality makes it particularly dangerous when encountered in groups. While individually weak, Giant Rats are often found in swarms, overwhelming enemies with sheer numbers. They are carriers of disease, and their bites can spread sickness to those unlucky enough to be attacked. They are scavengers, feeding on anything they can find, including corpses.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Rat is a small beast often found in urban landscapes and rural settings. Despite its tiny stature, it possesses a surprising amount of agility and cunning in combat situations, making it a nuisance for adventurers and townsfolk alike. With an Armor Class of 12 and only 7 hit points, it is relatively weak and can be easily dispatched by most characters. However, its advantages lie in its Keen Smell special ability and Pack Tactics, enabling it to effectively coordinate attacks with allies. This makes the Giant Rat a more formidable opponent when in groups, posing a challenge primarily to lower-level characters.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Rat has the following attributes: Strength of 6, which is very bad, Dexterity of 14, which is good, Constitution of 10, which is average, Intelligence of 2, which is very bad, Wisdom of 10, which is average, and Charisma of 4, which is very bad. Its low Strength means it is not adept at physical feats, while its above-average Dexterity allows it to evade attacks and strike quickly. The Giant Rat relies largely on its agility, making it capable of surprising opponents.

The Giant Rat has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell, allowing the rat to detect hidden or stealthy characters more easily. This is especially useful in situations involving stealth or ambush. The Pack Tactics ability gives the rat advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of that target, making it significantly more dangerous in groups. This encourages tactical play where Giant Rats can flank and swarm their opponents, making it a more challenging adversary than it would be when encountered singly.

In terms of its offensive capabilities, the Giant Rat has a Bite action, which is a melee weapon attack. It has a +4 to hit with this attack, meaning it is likely to land hits against targets with low Armor Classes. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 4 piercing damage on a successful hit, which is enough to threaten weaker characters while relying on its pack for support in combat scenarios. Overall, the Giant Rat exemplifies the dangers that can come in swarms, combining speed and tactical advantages to compensate for its individual weaknesses.

The Giant Rat is a small beast known for its agility and pack tactics, making it a noteworthy foe for low-level adventurers. It has an Armor Class of 13 and 14 hit points, which is modest but manageable for new characters. While its strength score is poor at -2, its dexterity at +3 allows it to swiftly evade attacks. With a challenge rating of 1/4, the Giant Rat is suitable for lower-tier encounters. Its special abilities, including heightened perception and pack tactics, enhance its effectiveness when fighting alongside allies. Though not particularly formidable individually, when working with others, it poses a greater threat through coordinated attacks.

The Giant Rat has the following attributes:
- Strength: -2 (very bad)
- Dexterity: +3 (good)
- Constitution: +0 (average)
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +0 (average)
- Charisma: -3 (very bad)

In terms of senses, the Giant Rat possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, but only in shades of gray. It has a Perception score of 10, which is average, and a Stealth score of 15, indicating good ability to hide from opponents. It does not speak any languages.

The Giant Rat has several special abilities that enhance its capabilities in combat:
- Accustomed to Filth: This ability grants the rat advantage on saving throws against diseases, making it more resilient in environments where diseases abound.
- Heightened Smell: The rat has an enhanced sense of smell, allowing its Perception to rise to 15 when relying on this sense, making it effective in tracking and detecting creatures.
- Pack Tactics: This ability allows the rat to have advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one ally is within 5 feet of that target and is not incapacitated, greatly increasing its chance of landing a hit when working in a group.

For its actions, the Giant Rat can execute a Bite attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. Upon a successful hit, it deals 5 piercing damage, which is decent damage for such a low-level creature. Additionally, the targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failure results in either contracting the rat plague disease or being poisoned until the end of its next turn, adding a toxic effect that can hinder opponents in combat. 

Overall, the Giant Rat serves as an effective minion in numbers, using its speed, stealth, and pack tactics to overwhelm unsuspecting adventurers with its disease potential and coordinated attacks.</detail>
