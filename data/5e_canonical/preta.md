<summary>The Preta is a Medium-sized undead creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It plays the role of a deceptive and stealthy attacker on the battlefield, employing its ability to manipulate blood and hide in the shadows to gain the upper hand in combat. Known for its - good attack potential and resilience, it can deal significant necrotic damage while sustaining itself through its unique Blood Siphon ability, giving it a sustainable foothold in prolonged encounters. Its weaknesses mainly stem from its moderate defenses and reliance on stealth tactics, making it less effective in direct confrontations against perceptive or high-damage foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Preta has an Armor Class (AC) of 13, derived from its natural armor, providing it with average defensive capabilities. It possesses 75 hit points, calculated as 10d8+30, indicating a good amount of health for its Challenge Rating of 3, which makes it a moderately challenging opponent. The Preta has a walking speed of 30 feet, enabling it to move adequately during combat.

Its ability scores are as follows: Strength 15 (+2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 13 (+1), and Charisma 15 (+2). The Preta has good physical strength and constitution, allowing it to endure damage and perform effectively in melee combat. Its Dexterity also contributes to its stealth capabilities, which are above average with a modifier of +2, giving it a stealth proficiency of +4.

In terms of damage immunities, the Preta is immune to poison damage and is resistant to necrotic damage, providing it with very good survivability against certain types of attacks. It is immune to conditions such as exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, further enhancing its durability in battle. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 13, allowing it to be aware of its surroundings in darkness, and it can still communicate using the languages it knew in life.

The Preta has several notable special abilities. Its Ethereal Sight allows it to see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane while on the Material Plane and vice versa, giving it strategic insight into otherworldly threats and opportunities.

In terms of actions, the Preta can perform a Multiattack, permitting it to use its Blood Siphon ability followed by two claw attacks. The claw attacks are melee weapon attacks with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage on a successful hit. 

The Blood Siphon ability signifies the Preta's primary attack mechanism; it can magically draw blood from a target within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) points of necrotic damage. Importantly, the Preta recovers hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt, allowing it to heal during combat, which can be a significant tactical advantage.

Etherealness allows the Preta to shift between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane. While in the Border Ethereal, it remains visible but cannot interact with anything on the other plane, making it a ghostly threat that can avoid damage while positioning itself strategically.

The Hidden Illusionist ability enables the Preta to become invisible until it makes an attack or uses its Blood Siphon, maintaining stealth in combat. It can also create illusory sounds and images similar to the minor illusion spell. This ability allows the Preta to confuse and misdirect opponents, ultimately enhancing its overall effectiveness as a stealthy attacker. During this time, the Preta and any equipment it carries are also invisible, making it a formidable foe in terms of trickery and surprise attacks.</detail>
