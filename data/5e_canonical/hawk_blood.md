<summary>The Blood Hawk is a small beast known for its agility and keen eyesight, making it an effective scout and aerial attacker in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 1/8, it is considered relatively weak but can be surprisingly effective in groups due to its Pack Tactics ability, which provides it with an advantage on attack rolls when working alongside allies. Its offensive capabilities include a beak attack that can inflict piercing damage. The Blood Hawk is exceptionally fast, being able to fly at a speed of 60 feet, which enhances its ability to maneuver in combat. However, its low armor class and hit points make it vulnerable, requiring careful positioning to avoid being easily dispatched.</summary>

The Blood Hawk has the following attributes: Strength is -2, making it very bad in physical power; Dexterity is +2, which is good for evading attacks and enhancing its accuracy; Constitution is +0, indicating average resilience; Intelligence is -4, showing that it isn't capable of complex thought; Wisdom is +2, giving it good perception and insight; and Charisma is -3, indicating it is very bad in social situations. The hawk benefits from a Perception score of 14, making it effective at noticing hidden threats, and a Stealth score of 12, allowing it to move quietly and avoid detection.

The Blood Hawk possesses a unique special ability called Heightened Sight, which increases its Perception score to 19 when it is using sight, granting it exceptional awareness in spotting prey or dangers. Additionally, with the Pack Tactics ability, the hawk can roll an advantage on its attack if an ally is within close proximity of its target, making it dangerous when fighting in groups.

In combat, the Blood Hawk utilizes a melee weapon attack with its beak, having a +4 to hit, which translates into good chances of landing a successful strike against most creatures. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and inflicts 4 piercing damage (1d4 + 2) with each successful hit.

As a bonus action, the Blood Hawk can use Evasive Flight to either disengage from combat or take a dodge action, enhancing its ability to evade attacks while in flight. This ability is particularly useful for repositioning in combat or escaping from unfavorable situations while flying.</detail>
