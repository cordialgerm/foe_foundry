<detail>

In terms of attributes, the River Dragon Wyrmling possesses the following values: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 10 (+0). The Dexterity score is particularly advantageous, enhancing its agility and providing good bonuses in skills like acrobatics and stealth. Its skills include acrobatics (+4), deception (+2), insight (+4), nature (+2), perception (+4), and stealth (+4), reflecting a well-rounded ability to evade threats and perceive danger. The dragon exhibits damage resistance against nonmagical weapons, meaning it will take full damage from magical attacks but less from mundane sources. Additionally, it is immune to fatigue and can see in darkness up to 120 feet, aided by tremorsense in water up to 90 feet, making it an exceptional hunter in its environment. The River Dragon Wyrmling speaks Aquan and Draconic.

Among its special abilities, "Amphibious" allows the dragon to breathe both air and water effectively, making it a versatile creature in aquatic settings. "Flowing Grace" prevents the dragon from provoking opportunity attacks when it moves out of an enemy's reach while flying or swimming, giving it exceptional mobility. "Essence Link" represents a deeper connection to a specific area or landmark, granting it no benefits from a long rest if it strays more than 1 mile away. Should it die, the linked area suffers a loss of vital essence, inflicting fatigue and strife on creatures that enter the area until the essence dragon is replaced, an event that may take centuries.

For its actions, the River Dragon Wyrmling can perform a melee weapon attack with its bite, which has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful attack, it deals 13 piercing damage (2d10 + 2). Its "Torrential Breath" is a significant offensive ability that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. When activated, the dragon exhales a 15-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of water, requiring creatures in the area to make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 14 bludgeoning damage (4d6), while succeeding halves the damage, making it a potent area control ability in combat.</detail>
