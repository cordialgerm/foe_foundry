<summary>The Swarm of Wolf Spirits is a formidable undead entity, both fearsome and mobile in combat. This creature, categorized as a Large Swarm and known for its neutrality towards good and evil, possesses a robust armor class of 16, indicating a good level of durability for a swarm. With a total of 104 hit points resulting from rolling 16 ten-sided dice and adding 16, it boasts an impressive health pool, making it a significant challenge for adventurers. The swarm's movement capabilities are exceptional, allowing it to walk 50 feet and fly at the same distance. Agile and stealthy, it has a Dexterity score of 18, which translates to a good modifier of +4, while its Strength and Constitution provide average to good modifiers of +2 and +1, respectively. This creature's challenge rating of 6 suggests it can effectively serve as a medium-level boss encounter. </summary>

<detail>

The swarm has some distinct weaknesses and strengths. It is immune to cold and poison damage, is resistant to various damage types including acid, fire, and bludgeoning, yet is still vulnerable if faced with force damage or certain other attacks that deal non-physical damage. Its condition immunities are extensive, allowing it to avoid many forms of crowd control, including being frightened or paralyzed. The swarm’s ability to meld into corporeal spaces makes it particularly elusive. However, its intelligence and wisdom scores are low, particularly its intelligence at just 4, which gives it a very bad modifier of -3. 

In terms of actions, the swarm can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to execute two Spectral Bite attacks per turn. Each Spectral Bite attack has a +7 to hit and can inflict significant damage, dealing either 14 cold damage plus 9 necrotic damage or reduced damage if the swarm is at half health or lower. Additionally, the Chilling Howl ability can incapacitate foes, requiring them to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or risk suffering 35 cold damage and becoming frightened for up to a minute. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it also gains one level of exhaustion, which can severely hinder its capabilities in combat. Victims of the fright condition can attempt to break free of it at the end of their turns, making this ability particularly impactful in shaping the battlefield. 

Moreover, the swarm has several relevant special abilities. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects as though they were difficult terrain, taking minor force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. The Swarm trait enables it to occupy the same space as other creatures, enhancing its tactical options in a crowded fight. Lastly, with its Undead Nature, the swarm has remarkable resilience; it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it unyielding to many strategies that might be effective against living foes. All of these attributes make the Swarm of Wolf Spirits a unique and challenging opponent for any adventuring party.</detail>
