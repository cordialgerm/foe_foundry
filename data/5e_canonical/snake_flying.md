With an Armor Class of 11 and only 10 hit points, it is relatively fragile and requires careful play to avoid damage.

<detail>

The Flying Snake has a Strength score of -3, making its physical attacks generally ineffective, resulting in a very bad modifier. The Dexterity score of +1 is good, allowing it to be agile and avoid attacks. With a Constitution of 0, it has an average resilience to damage. Intellectually, it has a very bad score of -4, indicating a lack of reasoning abilities. Its Wisdom score of +1 is good and applies to perception checks, while its Charisma score of -3 is very bad, indicating it lacks presence or influence in social interactions.

The Flying Snake has a unique special ability known as Flyby, which allows it to move out of an enemy’s reach without provoking opportunity attacks. This enables it to strike and withdraw without facing reprisal, enhancing its survivability during skirmishes. 

In terms of defensive capabilities, it has a reaction called Reflexive Escape. When targeted by an attack, it can move up to 5 feet as a reaction. If this distance puts it beyond the reach of the attack, the attack automatically misses, providing it with an exceptional means of avoidance.

For its primary offensive action, the Flying Snake has a Bite attack. This melee weapon attack has a +3 to hit, allowing it to land strikes on creatures within its reach. If it successfully bites a target, it inflicts 3 piercing damage, with the potential for the target to suffer an additional 5 poison damage if they fail a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 11, adding a layer of threat to its attacks. 

Overall, the Flying Snake utilizes its speed and flight to avoid confrontation, while its bite can deliver detrimental effects to those it targets.</detail>
