With an impressive Armor Class of 16, robust Hit Points totaling 138, and a decent movement speed of 40 feet, it presents significant threats in combat. This creature's main strengths are its high Strength and Constitution scores, facilitating effective melee attacks and considerable endurance in battles. With an exceptional Strength modifier of +5, the Cacus Giant can deal significant damage, complemented by its immunity to fire damage, providing it with an added layer of protection. However, its weaknesses include low Dexterity and Intelligence scores. The Cacus Giant poses a challenge for mid-level adventurers, presenting a Challenge Rating of 6, which translates to an experience reward of 2,300 XP when defeated.</summary>

<detail>

The Cacus Giant has the following attributes: Strength of 21 (+5), Dexterity of 11 (+0), Constitution of 20 (+5), Intelligence of 7 (-2), Wisdom of 14 (+2), and Charisma of 10 (+0). Its Strength and Constitution scores are exceptional, allowing the creature to excel in physical combat with high damage output and resilience. The Dexterity is average, which might affect its armor class and initiative rolls, while the Intelligence is very bad, likely indicating limited tactical awareness. The Wisdom score is good, making it relatively perceptive and effective in survival situations. The Cacus Giant's saving throws provide it a noticeable advantage with bonuses of +8 to Strength and Constitution, and +5 to Wisdom.

In terms of skills, the Cacus Giant is proficient in Perception and Survival, each providing a bonus of +5, which reflects its ability to be aware of its surroundings and thrive in the wild. Its damage immunity to fire grants it protection against fire-based attacks, while its passive Perception score of 15 allows it to notice creatures or objects effectively within its vicinity. The Cacus Giant can communicate using the Giant language.

The Cacus Giant possesses special abilities as well. One notable ability, Final Breath, activates upon its death, allowing it to exhale a gout of intense fire in a radius of 5 feet. Creatures within this area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take a substantial 27 fire damage (6d8) on a failure, or half that on a success. This makes the Cacus Giant even more dangerous as it can inflict damage upon its foes as it falls.

In combat, the Cacus Giant can use its Multiattack action to make two attacks with its greatclub. Each greatclub attack is a Melee Weapon Attack with a +8 modifier to hit, extending its reach to 10 feet, and dealing 18 bludgeoning damage (3d8 + 5) upon hitting a target. Additionally, it can perform a ranged attack by hurling a rock with a +8 to hit, within a range of 30 feet for normal attack and up to 120 feet for distant attacks, inflicting significant damage of 27 bludgeoning damage (4d10 + 5).

The Cacus Giant also has access to a formidable breath weapon called Fire Breath, which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6. This ability allows the giant to exhale fire in a 30-foot cone. Any creature caught in this area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 24 fire damage (7d6) on a failed save or half that damage on a successful save. This attack can severely impact multiple characters positioned within the cone, making it a powerful crowd-control ability in combat scenarios.</detail>
