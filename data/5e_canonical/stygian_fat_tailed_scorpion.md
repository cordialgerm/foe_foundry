<summary>The Stygian Fat-Tailed Scorpion is a Tiny beast that operates independently and is unaligned. It possesses a significant challenge rating of 3, making it a moderately dangerous foe for adventurers. With a good Armor Class of 14 provided by its natural armor and a robust health pool of 63 hit points, it can withstand substantial damage. Its speed is moderate, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat. Despite its low strength, which is very bad at -4, it compensates with a good dexterity of +2, which enhances its ability to evade attacks. Additionally, its constitution is solid at +2, granting it resilience. However, this creature lacks intelligence, wisdom, and charisma, severely limiting its ability to engage in non-physical interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Stygian Fat-Tailed Scorpion has moderate skills in combat due to its Multiattack ability, allowing it to perform two Claw attacks and one Sting attack in a single turn. Each Claw attack is made with a +4 to hit, and if successful, deals 4 bludgeoning damage. Its Sting attack is more formidable; it also has an attack bonus of +4 to hit, dealing 4 piercing damage alongside a substantial 14 poison damage. The target of the Sting attack must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned until it takes a short or long rest. If the poisoned creature continues to take poison damage, it risks suffering one level of exhaustion with each failed saving throw against the same DC. This introduces a tactical element, as the creature can inflict debilitating effects on its opponents over successive rounds. 

The Stygian Fat-Tailed Scorpion possesses darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. This enhances its effectiveness in various environments, particularly in dark areas where visibility is limited. Despite its lack of skill proficiency or languages, its natural instincts and combat abilities make it a significant adversary for its level.</detail>
