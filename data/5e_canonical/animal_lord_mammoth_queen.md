<summary>The Animal Lord, also known as the Mammoth Queen, is a formidable Huge fey creature that embodies chaotic goodness. With an impressive Armor Class of 20 and a substantial 250 hit points from 20d12+120, she relies on her massive size and power to dominate the battlefield. The Mammoth Queen boasts exceptional physical strength, with a Strength score of 25 (+7) and Constitution score of 22 (+6), which allows her to deliver massive damage with her attacks. However, her Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), which means she may struggle with speed and flexibility. With a Challenge Rating of 18, she represents a significant threat to adventurers and can impact encounters substantially. Notably, her ability to rejuvenate and her magic resistance make her a challenging opponent that requires strategic thinking to defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The creature's attributes show outstanding physical capabilities, particularly in Strength and Constitution. Her saving throws in Dexterity (+6) and Wisdom (+1) are average, providing her some resilience against attacks but not making her exceptionally hard to hit. The Mammoth Queen is immune to cold and poison damage and has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, making her a tough foe to bring down. Additionally, she is completely immune to conditions such as being charmed or incapacitated, which allows her to remain a constant threat during encounters. With her passive perception of 20 and truesight up to 120 feet, she can detect hidden threats effectively. She can communicate telepathically within 120 feet and understands all languages, facilitating complex interactions.

Her special abilities further enhance her capabilities in combat and interactions. "Elephantine Passivism" ensures that mammoths and other elephantine creatures cannot willingly attack her, enforcing a protector role over such beings unless magically compelled. "Legendary Resistance" allows her to succeed on failed saving throws three times per day, giving her an edge against powerful spells. "Magic Resistance" provides her with an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further safeguarding her. Notably, "Rejuvenation" presents a unique challenge, as her essence re-forms on the Astral Plane upon death and inhabits another elephantine creature in a matter of days unless all of them are killed.

Her physical attacks comprise various devastating options. She can use "Multiattack," allowing her to make three Battleaxe attacks, two Gores, or a combination of both. The "Battleaxe" attack inflicts either 20 (3d8+7) or 23 (3d10+7) slashing damage, making it a potent strike. The "Gore" attack, a powerful charge, deals 34 (6d8+7) piercing damage. Her "Stomp" can deal 34 (5d10+7) bludgeoning damage, while her "Trunk" allows her to grapple smaller creatures, restraining them until the grapple ends.

Additionally, she boasts powerful special attacks like "Tusk Sweep," which can deal 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 15-foot cube and push them away. Her "Trampling Charge" knocks prone targets she charges at, enabling her to follow up with a "Stomp" as a bonus action on prone enemies. The "Trunk Slam" is another versatile option, allowing her to deal significant damage while maintaining her grappling advantage.

As a bonus action, the Mammoth Queen can change her shape into various forms, which still retain her game stats aside from size. This grants her flexibility in how she may approach encounters. With the "Catch Weapon" reaction, she can significantly reduce incoming melee damage and potentially disarm an attacker, using her remarkable strength to her advantage.

Her legendary actions include "Regenerative Hide," allowing her to regain hit points, and powerful crowd-control options like "Shoving Stampede," which deals damage and potentially causes knockdown effects. "Queen's Trumpet" has strategic implications, empowering allies or intimidating foes, allowing her to manipulate the battlefield dynamics effectively.

Overall, the Mammoth Queen is a masterful blend of offensive power, defensive resilience, and battlefield control, proving to be a serious challenge for any adventuring party.</detail>
