<summary>The Revenant is a formidable undead creature designed primarily for vengeance. It serves as a relentless pursuer, utilizing its exceptional physicality and magical resistance to track down and dismantle its foes. With a decent armor class of 13 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 110, the Revenant is both durable and quite dangerous in close combat. Its strengths lie in its high strength and charisma attributes, which enhance its combat capabilities and its ability to instill fear in its targets. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage and has a relatively low intelligence score, making it less capable in situations requiring complex problem-solving. Overall, the Revenant poses a significant threat, especially against those who have wronged it in life.</summary>

<detail>

The Revenant has an armor class of 13, which provides it with a good level of defense against attacks. With 110 hit points, derived from rolling 13d8 and adding 52, its durability in battle is very good, allowing it to withstand considerable damage. The creature moves at a speed of 30 feet per turn, which is average for most creatures.

The Revenant possesses several attributes: it has a strength score of 18 (+4 modifier), a dexterity score of 16 (+3), a constitution of 18 (+4), intelligence of 10 (+0), wisdom of 12 (+1), and charisma of 18 (+4). These scores translate into saving throws where it is particularly effective (very good) in strength and constitution, both with a +7 modifier, as well as charisma, also at +7. Its wisdom saving throw is good with a +4 modifier. The Revenant has immunities to poison damage and effects, and shows resistance to both necrotic and psychic damage. It is immune to conditions such as being charmed, fatigue, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned, making it exceptionally resilient in adverse situations. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and its perception is passive at 11. The Revenant can communicate in the languages it knew during its life.

The Revenant has several unique special abilities. Fearsome Pursuit allows it to dedicate time to track a specific target it seeks vengeance upon, ignoring difficult terrain while pursuing them. This effect ends if the Revenant takes damage or does not move in its turn, which can strategically influence its actions. Magic Resistance grants the Revenant advantage on saving throws against spell effects, making it very resilient against magical attacks. Rapid Recovery enables it to regain all of its missing hit points if it goes one minute without taking any damage, providing a formidable mechanic for sustainability in combat. Finally, the Relentless ability ensures that if the Revenant is reduced to zero hit points, it can resurrect itself in a nearby humanoid corpse, awakening with 1 hit point after a brief delay.

In combat, the Revenant can utilize Multiattack to perform two Strangle attacks, allowing it flexibility and increased chances for damage. Its Strangle attack has a +7 to hit and can deal 11 bludgeoning damage, as well as grapple the target (with an escape DC of 15) if it is large or smaller. While grappled, the target cannot breathe, adding a significant penalty to the combat encounter. The Revenant can also use its Burning Hatred ability, which recharges on a roll of 4-6. Against its designated target, it forces the target to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in 14 psychic damage and paralysis until the end of their next turn, while success halves the damage and instills fright in the target until their next turn, presenting an effective crowd control mechanic.

Overall, the Revenant is a relentless and powerful adversary that can significantly impact gameplay through its diverse abilities and combat tactics.</detail>
