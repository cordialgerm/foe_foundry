<summary>The hippopotamus is a large, unaligned beast that plays a role similar to that of a tank in combat scenarios. With a robust armor class and a substantial pool of hit points, it is able to withstand significant damage, making it a formidable opponent. Its high strength allows it to deal considerable damage with its melee attacks, while its special abilities enhance its versatility in battle, particularly with powerful area effects. However, its low Dexterity makes it less agile and more vulnerable to attacks that require precise movement. Overall, the hippopotamus can serve as both a frontline combatant and a destabilizing force in encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The hippopotamus possesses an Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor, which provides average protection against attacks. It has 76 hit points, contributed by rolling 9d10 and adding 27, allowing it to endure prolonged confrontations, rated as good for its challenge rating of 3, representing a moderate threat level for adventurers. Its walking speed is 40 feet, which is good for a creature of its size, and it can swim at a speed of 20 feet. The hippopotamus has the following ability scores: Strength 21 (+5), Dexterity 7 (-2), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 2 (-4), Wisdom 11 (+0), and Charisma 4 (-3). Its Strength is exceptional, allowing it to perform powerful physical attacks, while its Dexterity is very bad, making it slow and clumsy compared to other creatures.

In terms of skills, the hippopotamus has a perception score of +0, which is average, meaning it does not excel at sensing its surroundings. Its passive perception is 10, which indicates that it is not particularly alert or aware. The creature does not possess any languages, as it is an unthinking beast.

One of its notable special abilities is "Hold Breath," which enables the hippopotamus to maintain its breath for 10 minutes. This ability is particularly useful in aquatic environments, allowing it to engage in underwater combat or evade threats above the surface.

The hippopotamus can perform a melee attack called "Gore," which has a +7 to hit and strikes within a 5-foot range. When it successfully hits a target, it inflicts 18 (3d8+5) piercing damage, which is a significant amount of damage for its challenge rating, helping it to take down foes quickly.

Another action it can utilize is "Thunderous Bray," which can be activated once every 5 to 6 rounds, making it a recharging ability. When it uses this action, it emits a powerful bray that affects all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Targets must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; those who fail take 14 (4d6) thunder damage and are incapacitated until the end of their next turn. Creatures that succeed on the save take half the damage and are not incapacitated. This ability can drastically alter the dynamics of a battle, potentially incapacitating multiple enemies and granting the hippopotamus and allies an opportunity to seize control of the encounter.</detail>
