<summary>A Hezrou is a hulking, amphibious demon with a toad-like body and powerful limbs. These creatures are among the brutish enforcers of the Abyss, serving more powerful demons in battles against their enemies. Hezrous exude a foul stench that sickens and weakens those nearby, and their thick, warty skin provides them with protection against most attacks. In combat, they rely on their brute strength to crush and maul foes, often grappling and tearing enemies apart with their claws and teeth. Despite their simple minds, Hezrous are dangerous due to their raw power and relentless aggression.</summary>

<summary>The Hezrou is a large fiend known for its chaotic and evil nature. As a formidable creature in combat, it boasts a significant armor class of 16 and a total of 136 hit points, making it a tough adversary in battle. This creature walks at a speed of 40 feet and has a Challenge Rating of 10, which indicates it can provide a significant challenge for a party of adventurers, granting them 5,900 experience points upon defeat. The Hezrou's strengths lie in its strong physical attributes—particularly its Strength and Constitution, with scores of 18 (+4) and 20 (+5), respectively—allowing it to deal substantial damage while withstanding attacks. However, it suffers from low Intelligence, which restricts its strategic options in terms of spellcasting and problem-solving.</summary>

<detail>

The Hezrou has several notable abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. It has resistance to cold, fire, lightning, and damage from nonmagical weapons, making it more durable in battle. Additionally, it has immunity to poison damage and is also immune to being poisoned—a very good defensive trait. The creature has darkvision with a range of 120 feet and can communicate in Abyssal as well as through telepathy within the same range.

Its special abilities include "Magic Resistance," which grants the Hezrou advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, thereby making it difficult for spellcasters to incapacitate it. The "Chaotic Evil" aura underscores its malevolent nature, influencing the battlefield's tone.

In terms of attacks, the Hezrou can utilize a Multiattack feature allowing it to execute both a bite and a claw attack in one turn. The bite attack targets a creature within 5 feet, has a +7 to hit, and deals 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage. If this attack successfully hits a Medium or smaller creature, it immediately grapples them, requiring a DC 15 escape check. While grappled, the target is restrained, preventing it from moving freely. The claws deal more damage, hitting for 22 (4d8 + 4) slashing damage with the same attack bonuses, showcasing its offensive capabilities.

The "Swallow" ability allows the Hezrou to attempt to consume a Medium or smaller creature if it has already grappled them. If the bite attack hits, the target is swallowed, gaining total cover from outside attacks and becoming both blinded and restrained, suffering ongoing acid damage of 17 (5d6) each turn until they escape or the Hezrou is defeated. If a swallowed creature manages to deal 25 or more damage to the Hezrou in a single turn, or if the Hezrou dies, the creature is vomited up.

The Hezrou can also create magical darkness that spreads out from a point within 30 feet, filling a 15-foot radius. This darkness lasts for one minute, obscuring vision for creatures with darkvision and cannot be penetrated by nonmagical light, making it an exceptional tactical choice to control the battlefield.

As a reaction, the Hezrou can trigger "Stench" once per day when it is hit by a melee attack. It releases a foul-smelling gas in a 20-foot radius, requiring creatures in the area to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the creature becoming poisoned for one minute, which can be repeated at the end of each of its turns. This ability serves as a deterrent for melee attacks, further complicating confrontations with the Hezrou.

The Hezrou is a large fiend from the demon classification in Dungeons & Dragons, known for its formidable combat abilities and resilience. It boasts a strong presence on the battlefield with high hit points, making it a tough adversary (CR 8) for adventurers. Characterized by its amphibious nature, the Hezrou can traverse both land and water, presenting a versatile threat. Its attributes reflect substantial physical strength and constitution, suggesting that it can withstand significant damage while also delivering powerful attacks. The creature possesses an array of special abilities, including resistance to various elemental types, and unique attacks that can alter the course of combat by weakening foes and controlling distance.

The Hezrou has the following attributes: Strength +7 (very good), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +8 (exceptional), Intelligence -3 (very bad), Wisdom +4 (good), and Charisma +1 (average). These modifiers indicate the Hezrou’s capabilities in combat and during interactions, with exceptional physical resilience and strong fortitude against damage.

It has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat and interactions, including:

- Amphibious: The Hezrou is capable of breathing both air and water, allowing it to operate effectively in aquatic environments.
- Demonic Resilience: It has resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage and is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, making it very tough to harm with elemental attacks and poisons.
- Magic Resistance: This ability gives the Hezrou advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, helping it resist many magical tactics used by opponents.
- Speak with Frogs and Toads: The Hezrou can communicate with these creatures, which may provide unique opportunities during role-play scenarios.
- Standing Leap: It can jump long distances, up to 20 feet horizontally or 10 feet vertically, enhancing mobility.
- Stench: Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the Hezrou must pass a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of its next turn. Successful saves grant immunity to this effect for the next 24 hours.

In terms of actions, the Hezrou employs a Multiattack, allowing it to make a combination of different attacks in one action. The attacks include:

- Bite: This melee attack has a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 15 piercing damage (2d10 + 4) on a successful hit.
- Claw: With a similar +7 to hit and reach, this slashing attack deals 17 damage (3d8 + 4) per successful hit.
- Sticky Tongue: With a reach of 20 feet, this attack also has a +7 to hit and deals 11 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 4). Additionally, it pulls the target closer, requiring a DC 16 Strength saving throw to avoid being pulled up to 15 feet toward the Hezrou.

The Hezrou has a noteworthy bonus action:

- Quick Leap: This ability allows the Hezrou to jump horizontally up to 20 feet into an unoccupied space it can see, and it can do so without provoking opportunity attacks.

Overall, the Hezrou stands as a challenging and capable opponent in combat, combining strong physical damage with various abilities that can disorient and control its foes. Its resistance to many forms of damage and capabilities to engage in both melee and ranged interactions make it a formidable foe for any adventuring party.</detail>
