<MonsterName/>Hezrou (Demon)</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>A Hezrou is a hulking, amphibious demon with a toad-like body and powerful limbs. These creatures are among the brutish enforcers of the Abyss, serving more powerful demons in battles against their enemies. Hezrous exude a foul stench that sickens and weakens those nearby, and their thick, warty skin provides them with protection against most attacks. In combat, they rely on their brute strength to crush and maul foes, often grappling and tearing enemies apart with their claws and teeth. Despite their simple minds, Hezrous are dangerous due to their raw power and relentless aggression.</summary>
