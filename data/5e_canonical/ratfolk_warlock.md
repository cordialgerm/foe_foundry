The Ratfolk Warlock has an Armor Class of 13, which increases to 16 when it casts Mage Armor. It has 27 hit points, calculated from rolling 6d6 and adding 6, which represents its moderate durability in battles. It can swim at a speed of 10 feet and walk at 25 feet, giving it decent mobility on land and in water. This creature is classified with a Challenge Rating of 1, which indicates it provides a moderate challenge for an adventuring party, granting 200 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of its ability scores, the Ratfolk Warlock has a Strength of 8, which results in a very bad modifier of -1, making it ineffective in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity score of 16 gives it a good modifier of +3, enhancing its agility and reflexes, while its Constitution score of 12 translates to an average modifier of +1, offering some resilience. The Intelligence score of 14 results in a good +2 modifier, supporting its knowledge in arcana, and a Wisdom score of 12 provides an average +1 modifier for perception checks. Critically, its Charisma score of 17 grants it an exceptional +3 modifier, which directly enhances its spellcasting abilities and social interactions.

The Ratfolk Warlock possesses several saving throws that include a Wisdom saving throw modifier of +3 and a Charisma saving throw modifier of +5, both of which are quite effective, reflecting its resilience against mental effects and its capability in magical encounters. Its skills include proficiency in Arcana, Deception, and Perception, with bonuses of +4, +5, and +3 respectively, making it knowledgeable about magic, skilled in misleading others, and reasonably alert in its surroundings. The creature has darkvision of 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and a passive Perception score of 13 which indicates its awareness of subtle cues around it. It speaks Common.

The Ratfolk Warlock has some notable special abilities. Its Nimbleness allows it to freely move through the space of Medium or larger creatures, providing excellent maneuverability during combat. With Pack Tactics, the Warlock gains advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet, making it very effective at coordinating attacks with its allies.

As for its innate spellcasting, the Ratfolk Warlock uses Charisma as its casting ability, having a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 bonus to hit with spell attacks. It can cast the following spells without the need for material components:
- At will: Dancing Lights, Eldritch Blast, Fire Bolt, Mage Armor, Mage Hand, Minor Illusion, Poison Spray, and Speak with Animals. 
- Three times per day, it can cast Command, Darkness, and Hellish Rebuke. 
- Once per day, it can cast Blindness/Deafness and Hold Person.

These spells can greatly affect gameplay by allowing the Ratfolk Warlock to manipulate light and darkness, deal damage, create distractions, command opponents, and restrain or incapacitate foes.

In combat, the Ratfolk Warlock can use a Dagger to perform a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +5 to hit. On a successful hit, the dagger deals 5 piercing damage. Alternatively, it can use a Quarterstaff, which has a modest +1 to hit, dealing 2 bludgeoning damage with one hand or 3 damage if wielded with two hands.

One of its unique actions includes Darken, which lets the Warlock unleash tendrils of shadow that extend outwards to all creatures within a 10-foot radius. Those creatures must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw; if they fail, they become restrained by the tendrils until the end of the Warlock's next turn, providing an opportunity for the Warlock or its allies to capitalize on the restrained condition for advantage on attacks against them.</detail>
