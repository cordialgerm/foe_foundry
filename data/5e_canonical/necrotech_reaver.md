<MonsterName/>Necrotech Reaver</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Necrotech Reaver is a formidable and sinister creature, categorized as a Huge Undead with a neutral evil alignment. It serves as a menacing foe for adventurers, featuring a large pool of hit points and significant damage output capabilities. With an Armor Class of 15 provided by its natural armor, the Reaver demonstrates resilience in combat. It possesses a Challenge Rating of 6, making it a challenging opponent worth 2,300 XP upon defeat. Notably, its physical prowess, particularly its high Strength score of 21, grants it an exceptional modifier of +5, allowing it to deal significant damage in melee combat. However, its Dexterity is quite poor at 7, resulting in a bad -2 modifier, which contributes to its sluggishness and low evasion capabilities. The Reaver is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, but its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores indicate that it suffers from average to bad effectiveness in checks related to these attributes.</summary>

<detail>

The Necrotech Reaver has several key abilities enhancing its combat functionality. It deals double damage to objects and structures due to its Siege Monster ability, making it a grave threat to fortifications. Additionally, its Undead Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. However, it suffers from the Unstable Footing trait, imposing disadvantage on saving throws against being knocked prone, which can be a significant drawback during battles.

In combat, the Reaver utilizes its Multiattack feature to make two Chain Lash attacks. This melee weapon attack has a +8 to hit, which provides a good likelihood of connecting with its target at a range of 15 feet. Each successful hit inflicts 18 (4d6 + 4) slashing damage and grapples the target with an escape DC of 15, restricting their movement. With four chains to wield, the Reaver can grapple multiple foes in close proximity.

The Bladed Sweep is a powerful action it can initiate, recharging on rolls of 5 or 6. This attack involves swinging its chains in a sweeping motion, forcing every creature within a 15-foot range to make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 15. A failed save results in 21 (6d6) slashing damage and knocks the target prone, while a successful save halves the damage and prevents being knocked prone. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also pushed back up to 15 feet and knocked prone, amplifying the Reaver's threat by potentially repositioning enemies on the battlefield. Overall, the Necrotech Reaver is a dangerous enemy with impressive offensive capabilities and a distinct combat style that can control the battlefield effectively.</detail>
