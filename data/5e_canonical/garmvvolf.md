<summary>The Garmvvolf is a formidable Huge Monstrosity that operates outside of any alignment, often presenting itself as a fearsome adversary in encounters. It boasts a high amount of hit points, making it durable and capable of sustaining damage during battles. With an exceptional Strength score of 20, the Garmvvolf excels in physical combat, particularly through its powerful bite attacks. Its Challenge Rating of 9 indicates that it poses a significant threat to low to mid-level adventurers, and its ability to regenerate heads makes it a persistent foe. However, it has weaknesses, such as low Intelligence and Charisma, making it easy to outsmart or charm. Overall, the Garmvvolf can be a menacing presence on the battlefield, especially when working with allies to exploit its strengths.</summary>

<detail>

The Garmvvolf has an Armor Class of 14, which is considered average, and it has 189 hit points derived from rolling 18d12 plus a constitution modifier of +4, granting it a very good resilience in combat. With a walking speed of 40 feet, it can maneuver effectively during its turns. Its attributes include a Strength of 20, providing a +5 modifier which is exceptional for dealing damage; a Dexterity of 15 with a +2 modifier, which is good for agility; and a Constitution of 19 resulting in a +4 modifier, demonstrating very good durability. Its Intelligence of 5 creates a very bad modifier of -3, making it ineffective in tasks requiring intelligence. Wisdom is at 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average, while its Charisma of 7 gives it a very bad -2 modifier, indicating difficulty in social interactions.

Special abilities further enhance its combat prowess. The Garmvvolf has "Keen Hearing and Smell," granting it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to these senses, making it very good at tracking or detecting hidden foes. Its "Multiple Heads" ability allows it to have three heads, granting it advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. However, if it suffers 25 or more damage in a single turn, it loses one head, but it can regrow heads at the end of its turn, unless it has taken fire damage since then, alongside healing 10 hit points for each head regrown. The "Trampling Charge" ability allows it to knock opponents prone if it moves 20 feet straight towards a creature and successfully hits with its Bite attack, compelling the target to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. If the target fails, they become prone, allowing the Garmvvolf to make a bonus Bite attack against them. Lastly, "Wakeful" ensures that at least one head remains alert while the Garmvvolf sleeps, making it hard to ambush.

In terms of actions, the Garmvvolf can perform a "Multiattack," making as many Bite attacks as it has heads, which can rapidly deal damage. Each Bite is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage from its bite plus an additional 10 poison damage, which is significant. It also possesses a special action known as "Tripartite Howl," which can be used after recharging on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability has its heads unleash a three-part howl in a 30-foot cone, dealing 17 poison damage and 17 thunder damage to any creature within the area of effect, along with inflicting the frightened condition for one minute, unless they succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, which halves the damage and negates the frightened effect. A frightened creature can attempt to save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect.

Overall, the Garmvvolf provides a strong adversarial presence with a mix of high damage potential, regeneration abilities, and area control tactics. Encountering one can be a daunting challenge for any adventuring party.</detail>
