<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>The Blood Imp is a small, fiendish creature of a lawful evil alignment, known for its cunning and malice. With a low Challenge Rating of 1/2, it is a minor threat that can be quite dangerous in the right circumstances, particularly when exploiting the weaknesses of its enemies. Notable for its ability to fly and its resistance to spells, the Blood Imp can maneuver around the battlefield with ease. It has average durability with 14 hit points, making it somewhat squishy for combat but also capable of inflicting deceptive harm, especially against already wounded foes due to its special abilities. </summary>

<detail>

The Blood Imp's attributes show modest overall capabilities: 
- Strength is at 6, which gives it a very bad modifier of -2, reflecting a lack of physical power.
- Dexterity registers at 14, resulting in a good modifier of +2, making it nimble and harder to hit.
- Constitution is at 13, leading to an average modifier of +1, providing a small degree of resilience.
- Intelligence is 12, giving it an average modifier of +1, sufficient for basic cunning.
- Wisdom stands at 11, which yields an average modifier of +0, indicating normal perceptiveness.
- Charisma is at 14, translating to a good modifier of +2, enhancing its social skills.

For skills, the Blood Imp excels in persuasion with a +4 modifier, making it very good in social encounters. It also has a +5 in religion, which is exceptional, and a +4 in stealth, further strengthening its ability to remain undetected. It is immune to fire and poison damage and has resistance to cold, alongside being immune to the poisoned condition. With darkvision that extends to 120 feet, it can see in darkness as if it were dim light, enhancing its combat readiness in shadowy environments. 

Its special abilities are where the Blood Imp truly shines:
- "Bleed the Dying" enables it to deal an additional 1d4 poison damage when it hits a creature that is not at full hit points, making it particularly effective against weakened enemies.
- "Devil's Sight" allows it to see through magical darkness, an advantage in encounters involving spells that obscure vision.
- "Magic Resistance" gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, granting it very good survivability in magical confrontations.

In terms of actions, the Blood Imp has:
- "Sting," a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit that has a 5-foot reach, dealing 4 piercing damage on a successful hit.
- "Spew Blood," a ranged spell attack also with a +4 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet, which inflicts 5 poison damage on a hit. If targeted, the enemy must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn, potentially impairing their combat effectiveness.

Overall, the Blood Imp is a clever and deceptive creature, capable of manipulating situations to its advantage and presenting a unique challenge on the battlefield, especially when it can capitalize on its enemies' vulnerabilities.</detail>
