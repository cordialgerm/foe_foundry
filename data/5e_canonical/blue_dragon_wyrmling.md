<summary>The Blue Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon renowned for its affinity with deserts and lightning. With a relatively high Armor Class of 17 and 58 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, making it a formidable opponent in combat. The wyrmling possesses a solid Strength score of 16, allowing it to deliver significant bite attacks, while its Dexterity and Constitution scores contribute to its agility and durability, respectively. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are average, limiting its magical capabilities and social effectiveness. The creature's abilities, such as its unique movement capabilities and the powerful Lightning Breath, enable it to maneuver effectively through its environment and deal substantial damage in combat. While it has immunities to lightning damage, its lower resistances to other elemental attacks make it somewhat vulnerable to varied forms of assault.</summary>

<detail>

The Blue Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16 with a +3 modifier, which is very good for melee combat.
- Dexterity: 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average for its agility.
- Constitution: 14 with a +2 modifier, representing good toughness.
- Intelligence: 12 with a +1 modifier, indicating average mental acuity.
- Wisdom: 10 with a +0 modifier, showing an average perceptive skill.
- Charisma: 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good for any social interactions or charisma-based checks.

In terms of skills, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is proficient in perception (+2), stealth (+3), and survival (+2), allowing it to be quite competent in navigating and hunting in its environment. It has damage immunity to lightning, meaning it takes no damage from lightning-based attacks, and its senses include blindsight (10 feet), tremorsense (30 feet), darkvision (120 feet), and a passive perception score of 12, making it very adept at detecting threats in various conditions. It can communicate in Common and Draconic languages, enhancing its ability to interact with both non-dragons and other dragonkin.

The Blue Dragon Wyrmling has two special abilities that further enhance its capabilities during encounters: 
- **Desert Farer:** This ability allows the dragon to ignore difficult terrain caused by sand or gravel, granting it enhanced movement options in desert environments. It can also ignore the effects of extreme heat, making it resilient against environmental challenges.
- **Dune Splitter:** The wyrmling can remain hidden under sand and gravel for up to 4 hours, gaining advantage on Stealth checks while doing so. This ability makes it exceptionally effective for ambush tactics.

For actions, the wyrmling can perform the following:
- **Bite:** This melee attack has a +5 to hit and can reach one target within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 19 points (3d10 + 3) of piercing damage, which is significant and can pose a serious threat to low-to-mid level adventurers. 
- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6):** As a powerful area attack, the dragon exhales a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and is 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. The ability can substantially impact the battlefield, especially in tightly packed engagements, and is especially dangerous for groups of characters.

Overall, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling embodies the cunning and might typical of dragonkind, with potent abilities that can turn the tide of battle in its favor.

The Blue Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable Medium dragon characterized by its solid defensive capabilities and offensive prowess, making it a fearsome opponent for adventurers. With a focus on agility and power, it boasts a high armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and possesses 68 hit points, allowing it to endure several rounds of combat. Its challenge rating of 3 signifies that it can present a moderate challenge to a party of adventurers. Notably, this dragon can fly at impressive speeds of 60 feet, making it highly mobile in battle, while also having the ability to burrow. Its various abilities give it both a tactical advantage in combat and the potential to disrupt the plans of its foes.

The attributes of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling are as follows: Strength is +3 (good), Dexterity is +2 (average), Constitution is +4 (very good), Intelligence is +1 (average), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +4 (very good). This blend of attributes allows it to not only withstand damage but also effectively use its Charisma for interactions and abilities.

The Wyrmling has keen senses, with darkvision that extends to 60 feet and keen sense allowing it to detect enemies more effectively. Its perception is strong at 14 (good), and it can utilize stealth with a modifier of 12 (average) to remain undetected. The Wyrmling can communicate using the Draconic language.

In combat, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling has a special ability called Pounce. This ability allows the dragon to move at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a target and, if it successfully strikes with its Claw attack, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failure results in being knocked prone, granting the dragon an additional Claw attack as a bonus action against that opponent. 

For its actions on each turn, the Blue Dragon Wyrmling can utilize a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite attack and one Claw attack. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit modifier, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage plus an additional 3 lightning damage. The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit modifier, dealing 6 slashing damage.

One of the most devastating abilities of the Blue Dragon Wyrmling is its Lightning Breath, which can be used after a recharge period of 5-6. This powerful attack lets the dragon exhale a line of lightning that stretches 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 27 lightning damage (5d10) on a failed save, taking half damage if they succeed. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield, allowing the dragon to damage multiple enemies at once while possibly forcing them to reposition.</detail>
