Its skills include Athletics (+11), which is very good for grappling and maneuvering, and Intimidation (+8), which is also very good, allowing it to instill fear in others.

The Automata Devil has immunities to fire and poison damage, and it resists cold damage, along with being resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that are not silvered. It is immune to the poisoned condition, enhancing its durability in combat. It has darkvision out to 120 feet and a passive Perception of 12, enabling it to see in darkness and detect hidden creatures. It can communicate in Common and Infernal languages and can use telepathy up to 120 feet.

In terms of special abilities, the Automata Devil has Devil’s Sight, allowing it to see through magical darkness. Its Fear Aura creates an area of fear, compelling creatures within 10 feet to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in being frightened until the beginning of their next turn, while success grants immunity to the aura for 24 hours. Additionally, its Magic Resistance means it rolls with advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it particularly resilient against magical attacks.

During combat, the Automata Devil can utilize its Multiattack ability, which allows it to make one Bite attack, one Whip attack, and two Claw attacks, providing a versatile and dangerous offensive strategy. The Bite has a +11 to hit and deals 18 slashing damage on a hit, while each Claw attack also has a +11 to hit, dealing 16 slashing damage. The Whip can reach a target from 15 feet away, inflicting 12 slashing damage and grappling the target with an escape DC of 17, limiting their movement.

The Shredding Maw action allows the Automata Devil to pull a grappled creature toward itself, shredding it with gears and blades. The target must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw, suffering 36 (8d8) slashing damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. Lastly, with the Teleport ability, the Automata Devil can instantly relocate itself and any equipment within 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, providing high mobility and tactical positioning on the battlefield.</detail>
