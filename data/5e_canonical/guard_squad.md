<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The Guard Squad is a large humanoid creature that functions primarily as a protective unit in combat. With a challenge rating of 3, it serves as a mid-level threat on the battlefield. Its strengths lie in its ability to absorb damage and transform when severely injured, allowing it to continue affecting the encounter even when faced with heavy attacks. However, the Guard Squad has notable vulnerabilities, particularly concerning area attacks, which can deal double damage. This combination of resilience and vulnerability makes it a unique and strategic opponent that requires careful handling by players.</summary>

<detail>

The Guard Squad has a decent Armor Class of 15 and 55 hit points, which are determined by rolling 10d8 and adding 10. The hit points indicate a good level of durability, allowing the squad to withstand several hits before being incapacitated. The attributes of the Guard Squad are as follows: Strength is rated at 10 (modifier of +0), Dexterity at 12 (modifier of +1), Constitution at 12 (modifier of +1), Intelligence at 10 (modifier of +0), Wisdom at 10 (modifier of +0), and Charisma at 10 (modifier of +0). The modifiers indicate that its physical abilities are average, while its mental faculties are quite low, which plays into its role as a simple fighter rather than a tactician. Its skill in perception is +2, granting it a slightly above-average ability to notice things in its environment, with a passive perception score of 12.

One of the Guard Squad's special abilities is called "Area Vulnerability." This ability means that the squad takes double damage from any effect that targets an area, making it particularly susceptible to spells or actions that affect multiple targets. This vulnerability encourages players to use area-of-effect attacks strategically. 

Another ability, "Squad Dispersal," stipulates that when the Guard Squad is reduced to 0 hit points, it transforms into 2 randomly generated guards with 5 hit points each. This ability allows the squad to spread its influence even in defeat, potentially continuing to engage players after they believe they have defeated the original squad.

The "Squad" feature signifies that this entity is made up of 5 or more individual guards. If it is affected by a spell or other effect that targets a single creature, the squad will take damage but will ignore any non-damaging effects of the attack. This means it can withstand many adverse conditions that would typically incapacitate a lone creature. Moreover, the Guard Squad can move through spaces that accommodate a Medium creature without any issues, allowing for flexible positioning.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Guard Squad utilizes spears. It has a +2 modifier to hit when making either melee or ranged weapon attacks. The spear has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20 to 60 feet and can deal 17 points of piercing damage (5d6) on a hit. However, if the squad is bloodied (has half or fewer hit points), it deals only half damage with these attacks. This means that while the squad can deliver strong hits initially, it becomes less effective as it suffers damage.

Overall, the Guard Squad presents a formidable challenge with its tactical abilities and transforming nature, while also possessing significant weaknesses that can be exploited by savvy players.</detail>
