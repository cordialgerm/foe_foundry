<summary>The Spurred Water Skate is a large and unaligned beast that thrives in aquatic environments, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers who venture near water bodies. With a respectable armor class of 13, it possesses a decent amount of durability with 60 hit points, which translates to a moderate challenge for players at a Challenge Rating of 1. This creature excels in agility, boasting a Dexterity score of 17, categorized as very good, allowing it to evade attacks effectively. However, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are very low, indicating that it lacks social skills and cognitive abilities. This creature's special ability, Water Walker, allows it to traverse water surfaces effortlessly, similar to the spell water walk, enhancing its mobility in combat scenarios. The Spurred Water Skate's notable action is its Stabbing Forelimbs, which is a melee attack with a good chance to connect, dealing a substantial amount of damage and enabling it to grapple opponents, restricting their movements and potentially leading to their suffocation if held underwater.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Spurred Water Skate are as follows: It has a Strength of 12, which translates to a good modifier of +1. Its Dexterity is 17, providing an exceptional +3 modifier that contributes to its effectiveness in dodging attacks and improving its initiative rolls. Constitution is relatively strong at 15, giving it a +2 modifier, which bolsters its hit point total. The creature has an Intelligence score of 3, resulting in a very bad -4 modifier, indicating it cannot effectively engage in complex thought processes or problem-solving. Its Wisdom score is average at 10, yielding a +0 modifier, enabling it to notice things in its environment without any significant advantages. Finally, its Charisma of 6 leads to a bad -2 modifier, making it unconvincing when interacting with others.

In gameplay, the Spurred Water Skate's special ability, Water Walker, allows it to traverse water as though it were solid ground, negating the typical movement penalties associated with water. This ability enables the creature to ambush characters from unexpected positions. 

As for its actions, the Stabbing Forelimbs allow the Spurred Water Skate to make a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, which is a good bonus. If it successfully hits an opponent, it deals 10 piercing damage, calculated as 2d6 plus 3. This action also lets the creature grapple a target that is Medium or smaller if it is not already grappling two other creatures, with an escape DC of 12. Once grappled, the target is restrained, limiting its ability to move and take actions effectively. If the grappled target is submerged in liquid, the Spurred Water Skate can hold it underwater, where it risks suffocation, adding a dire threat to encounters with this creature. Overall, the Spurred Water Skate presents a unique and challenging opposition in aquatic combat scenarios.</detail>
