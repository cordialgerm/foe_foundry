<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Mirror Hag is a Medium-sized fey creature that embodies chaotic neutrality. With a challenge rating of 6 and a total of 147 hit points, it possesses formidable combat prowess, primarily through its unique abilities and spells. The hag excels at incapacitating foes and altering their forms, making her a dangerous adversary in battle. With an armor class of 16 derived from natural armor, she can withstand a fair amount of damage. Defensively, she has resistance to thunder damage and is immune to conditions such as being charmed or frightened, rendering her resistant to typical crowd control tactics. However, her physical attributes show that she is only average in strength and intelligence, with exceptional constitution contributing to her durability.</summary>

<detail>

The Mirror Hag's attributes include a Strength score of 15 with a modifier of +2, which is considered average for physical attacks; a Dexterity score of 16 with a +3 modifier, indicating a good ability to dodge and react; a Constitution score of 22 with a +6 modifier, making her very resilient; an Intelligence score of 12 (+1, average for tactical maneuvers); a Wisdom score of 14 (+2, above average for perception and saving throws); and a Charisma score of 19 (+4, exceptional for spellcasting effectiveness). 

Her primary special ability, "Confounding Ugliness," targets humanoids who start their turn within 60 feet and can see her true form. These targets must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against DC 15 or become incapacitated until the start of their next turn. A successful saving throw grants the humanoid immunity to this effect for the next 24 hours, providing them a path to resist her debilitating charm.

In combat, the Mirror Hag can perform a "Bite" attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 12 piercing damage (rolled as 2d8 + 3) plus 5 necrotic damage (rolled as 2d4). She also has a "Claw" attack with the same attack bonus and reach, producing 6 slashing damage (1d6 + 3) along with the same necrotic damage.

Another one of her notable actions is the "Reconfiguring Curse," where she can curse a creature she can see within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If they succeed, they become immune to this curse for 24 hours; if they fail, they suffer one of the debilitating effects the hag chooses, representing her capacity to manipulate their physical form.

The Mirror Hag is capable of casting spells as well, using Charisma for spellcasting with a spell save DC of 15. She can cast "disguise self" and "ray of enfeeblement" at will, allowing her to change her appearance or weaken her enemies significantly. Once per day, she can cast "dispel magic" to negate spells affecting creatures or objects and "locate creature," enabling her to find specific beings she has knowledge of, enhancing her strategic capabilities in any encounter.</detail>
