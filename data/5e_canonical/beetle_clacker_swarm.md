<summary>The Clacker Swarm is a Medium-sized beast that represents a gathering of aggressive beetles. Unaligned in its nature, this swarm carries a Challenge Rating of 3 and can serve as a significant threat to adventurers, especially when they become surrounded. With an Armor Class of 14, it is reasonably difficult to hit, although its hit points total 36, making it vulnerable to concentrated attacks. The swarm has a unique set of strengths and weaknesses; it inflicts thunder damage with its constant clacking ability, while also being immune to conditions that might debilitate individual creatures. However, its low Strength score and very low Intelligence limit its physical capabilities and tactical awareness.</summary>

<detail>

The swarm's ability scores are as follows: Strength is 3, which results in a very bad modifier of -4, making the swarm incapable of lifting or moving heavy objects or applying physical force. Dexterity is 13, providing it with a good +1 modifier that aids in its agility and ability to avoid attacks. Constitution is 10, yielding an average modifier of 0, reflecting its moderate resilience. Intelligence is only 1, granting it a very bad -5 modifier, indicating a lack of reasoning or cleverness. Wisdom is 7, translating to a bad -2 modifier, which hinders its perceptive abilities. Charisma is also minimal at 1, offering a very bad -5 modifier, meaning it has little to no influence or presence.

The Clacker Swarm has a skill in perception, with a +2 modifier, which gives it an average ability to detect its surroundings. It benefits from several condition immunities, such as being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned. This resilience makes it challenging to manipulate or hinder during combat. The swarm has a blindsight ability that extends up to 30 feet, allowing it to sense its environment without relying on sight. Its passive perception score is 8, which is quite low but still allows it to notice obvious threats.

One of the swarm's special abilities, Constant Clacking, deals 5 thunder damage to any creature that starts its turn in its space. This ability can deter enemy movement and deal notable damage over time. Additionally, due to its Swarm ability, the Clacker Swarm can occupy the same space as another creature and can move through openings that a Tiny creature could, allowing it to swarm enemies effectively. However, the swarm cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, which limits its endurance in prolonged encounters.

In terms of actions, the Clacker Swarm can execute a Bite attack. It makes a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit targeting one creature within its space. If successful, this attack inflicts 14 piercing damage (4d6) or 7 piercing damage (2d6) if the swarm has 18 or fewer hit points. This variability in bite damage makes the swarm more dangerous when at full strength, while it still poses a threat even when weak. The combination of its thunder damage and biting capabilities can create a formidable challenge for unsuspecting adventurers.</detail>
