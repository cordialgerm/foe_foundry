<summary>The Arborcyte is a large, chaotic neutral plant creature known for its unique ability to create animated tendrils during combat. It possesses a strong armor class of 16, indicative of its natural resilience, and has a robust pool of hit points totaling 127, which allows it to endure a significant amount of damage. With a challenge rating of 8, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers and can grant them 3,900 experience points upon defeat. The creature is designed for close combat, moving moderately with a speed of 30 feet. Its main strengths lie in its powerful thorn vine attacks and the ability to summon additional tendrils when damaged, allowing it to control the battlefield effectively. Weaknesses include vulnerability to fire damage and a lack of mental acuity, reflected in low intelligence and charisma scores, making it less capable in skills and spellcasting.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Arborcyte has a strength score of 21, which represents an exceptional ability to inflict damage and grapple opponents, providing it with very good effectiveness for physical attacks. Its dexterity score of 12 provides average agility, while constitution at 16 gives it good stamina to sustain damage. However, its intelligence of 5 is very bad, reflecting a lack of reasoning and problem-solving abilities, coupled with a wisdom score of 10 that indicates average perception. Charisma is particularly low at 3, marking it very bad in social interactions.

The Arborcyte's saving throws are most effective in constitution, where it has a +6 modifier. It is vulnerable to fire damage, making it susceptible to fire-based attacks, and it possesses resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, allowing it to mitigate incoming physical attacks effectively. It is immune to conditions like deafened and has darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light.

One special ability, Shearing, activates when the Arborcyte takes 10 or more damage from a single attack, allowing it to create an animated tendril. Each tendril has an Armor Class of 14 and 10 hit points, functioning as an extension of the Arborcyte, which can act independently. This ability increases the creature's overall presence on the battlefield by providing additional targets and distractions.

When it comes to actions, the Arborcyte can make a multiattack, performing two thorn vine attacks in addition to one animated tendril attack for each tendril it controls. The Thorn Vine attack allows the Arborcyte to hit with a +8 to attack rolls, providing a reach of 10 feet against one target. Upon a successful hit, it deals 18 piercing damage and grapples the target, requiring a DC 16 escape to break free. This grapple leads to significant ongoing damage, as the victim takes 7 acid damage at the beginning of the Arborcyteâ€™s turn. The creature can wrestle with up to two opponents simultaneously. The Animated Tendril attack also has a +8 to hit and deals 9 piercing damage, making it a versatile threat.

Overall, the Arborcyte combines strong physical attacks with an ability to adapt and control the battlefield through its Shearing trait, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers.</detail>
