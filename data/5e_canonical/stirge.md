<summary>A Stirge is a small, bat-like creature with a long, needle-like proboscis that it uses to feed on the blood of living creatures. Found in swamps, forests, or dark caves, Stirges swarm in groups, attaching themselves to victims and draining their blood. Despite their small size, Stirges are dangerous in large numbers, overwhelming larger creatures with their relentless feeding. They are often drawn to the scent of blood and can be difficult to dislodge once they have latched on. Stirges are considered pests by many adventurers, but their persistence makes them a real threat.</summary>

<summary>The Stirge is a tiny beast that serves as a minor threat in the monstrous ecosystem. It is known for its ability to swiftly attack and latch onto its prey to drain blood, effectively dealing damage while remaining hard to hit due to its small size and agility. With a challenge rating of 1/8, it is a weak opponent individually but can be dangerous in swarms. The Stirge has high dexterity, making it good at dodging attacks, but its overall health is very low, making it exceptionally vulnerable to direct damage. Its notable attack mechanism allows it to both injure and sustain itself by feeding, posing a unique challenge for low-level adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Stirge's armor class is 13, providing a good defense against attacks for its size. It has hit points totaling only 2, which is very bad, reflecting its fragility in combat. The Stirge has a walking speed of 10 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet, giving it significant mobility in pursuit or evasion tactics.

In terms of ability scores, the Stirge has a Strength of 4, which is very bad, and a Dexterity of 16, which is very good. Its Constitution score is average at 10, while its Intelligence is exceptionally low at 2, making it incapable of higher reasoning. The Wisdom score is 8, which is bad, and its Charisma score is also low at 4, showing that the Stirge lacks any notable social skills.

The Stirge has no specific skills listed, but it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark or dimly lit environments. Its passive perception score is 9, indicating an average ability to perceive hidden dangers.

In terms of actions, the Stirge has two primary abilities. The first is the Proboscis, a melee weapon attack that boasts a +5 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully hits a target, it deals 1 piercing damage and attaches itself to the creature. The target can use an action to detach the Stirge, or it can detach itself as a bonus action, adding strategic elements to how characters might deal with it during combat.

The Stirge's second action is Blood Drain. Once attached to a creature, the Stirge drains blood, dealing 4 (1d8) damage to the unfortunate target. After it has drained a total of 8 hit points, which may span multiple uses, the Stirge detaches itself and cannot use Blood Drain again until it has finished a rest. This ability poses a significant risk to low-hit-point characters, especially if they are attacked by multiple Stirges at once.

The Stirge is a tiny beast known for its vampiric feeding behavior. These creatures are typically found in swarms and are notable for their ability to attach to larger creatures, draining blood and inflicting damage over time. They have low hit points, making them frail compared to other beasts, but their unique ability to drain blood can swiftly weaken foes who are unable to shake them off. Stirges excel in evasion thanks to their flight capability, but they suffer from very poor physical attributes, especially in strength and constitution, making them poor in direct confrontations. With a challenge rating of 1/8, they can pose a minor threat if underestimated, particularly because their blood draining ability can quickly add up if multiple stirges attack the same target.

The Stirge has an armor class of 14, which is considered good for a creature of its size. It possesses 7 hit points, making it very fragile and likely to be defeated in a single hit from most adventurers. The Stirge can move at a speed of 10 feet on the ground, but it can fly at a speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver quite effectively. 

The Stirge’s attributes are as follows: it has a strength score of -3, which is very bad for physical attacks and grappling; a dexterity score of +2, which is good for dodging attacks and improving stealth; a constitution score of +0, which is average; an intelligence score of -4, which is very bad and indicates that it cannot engage in complex thought; a wisdom score of -1, which is bad and suggests limited perception; and a charisma score of -2, which is also bad indicating a lack of social skills.

The Stirge possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, though only in shades of gray. It has a perception score of 9, which is poor, and a stealth score of 12, which is average. The Stirge does not understand any languages.

The notable special ability of the Stirge is Blood Drain. This attack functions as a melee weapon action with a +4 to hit, meaning it has a good chance of successfully attaching to its target if within 5 feet. When it successfully hits, it deals 4 piercing damage and attaches itself to the creature, continuing to drain health. While attached, the Stirge cannot attack, but on each of its turns, it causes the target to lose an additional 4 hit points due to blood loss, which can stack up if untreated. After draining a total of 8 hit points from the target or if the target dies, the Stirge can detach itself.

Additionally, the Stirge has a reaction called Reactive Wiggle. If it is targeted by an attack from within 5 feet while attached, it can perform this reaction, attempting to redirect the attack. The attacker must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw; if they fail, they hit the creature to which the Stirge is attached instead. This ability adds an interesting tactical element, as it allows the Stirge to mitigate damage and potentially cause confusion among its enemy’s ranks.</detail>
