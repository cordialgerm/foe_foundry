<summary>A Stirge is a small, bat-like creature with a long, needle-like proboscis that it uses to feed on the blood of living creatures. Found in swamps, forests, or dark caves, Stirges swarm in groups, attaching themselves to victims and draining their blood. Despite their small size, Stirges are dangerous in large numbers, overwhelming larger creatures with their relentless feeding. They are often drawn to the scent of blood and can be difficult to dislodge once they have latched on. Stirges are considered pests by many adventurers, but their persistence makes them a real threat.</summary>

### Reactions

- **Reactive Wiggle.** When the stirge is the target of an attack from a creature within 5 feet of it while it is attached to a creature, the stirge can wiggle, exposing the flesh where it is attached. The attacker must succeed on a DC 12 DEX save or the attack targets the creature to which the stirge is attached instead of the stirge.
