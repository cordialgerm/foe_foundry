<summary>The Clockwork Tiger is a formidable Large Construct that serves as a mechanical guardian in combat scenarios. With an Armor Class of 16, it boasts strong defenses alongside its impressive 112 hit points, making it quite durable. Its formidable Strength of 18 grants it a strong melee presence, while its decent Dexterity of 16 allows for responsive movements. This creature is particularly effective in battle thanks to its special abilities such as Magic Resistance, which gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it resistant to magical effects. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are notably low, indicating that it lacks mental sophistication and emotional depth. The Clockwork Tiger's notable features include its ability to knock foes prone and follow up with an attack, making it a tactical menace on the battlefield, while its immunity to various conditions and alterations ensures it remains a consistent threat in encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Clockwork Tiger has the following attributes: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 15 (+2), Intelligence 7 (-2), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 6 (-2). Its Strength score is exceptional, allowing it to engage effectively in melee combat, while its Dexterity is good, providing decent agility. The Constitution score is average, contributing to its overall hit points, but the low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores indicate that it cannot engage in complex interactions or be easily influenced.

The creature possesses several special abilities. Its Immutable Form means it is very resistant to any spells or effects that would alter its physical state, which is an exceptional advantage in combat. With Magic Resistance, it benefits from advantageous saving throws, enhancing its resilience against magical attacks, which is also a very good ability. The Pounce ability allows it to charge towards an enemy; if it hits with a claw attack after moving at least 20 feet, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, setting it up for a powerful bite attack in the same turn. This ability significantly increases its damage potential against immobilized foes. Finally, the Reactive Guardian feature allows it to protect its ward by intercepting attacks directed at them, further emphasizing its role as a guardian.

In terms of standard actions, the Clockwork Tiger can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one bite attack and two claw attacks in a single turn. The bite attack has a +7 to hit and deals an impressive 13 piercing damage on a successful hit, while each claw attack also has a +7 to hit and deals 11 piercing damage. This combination makes it a considerable threat in melee combat, capable of inflicting substantial damage over the course of a single round.

For its reactions, the Deflecting Leap ability is a strategic move that allows the tiger to react to an attack directed at its ward. It can move up to 10 feet towards its ward without provoking opportunity attacks and, if positioned properly, can take the attack's target onto itself instead. This feature provides it with exceptional tactical flexibility, allowing it to protect allies actively during combat.</detail>
