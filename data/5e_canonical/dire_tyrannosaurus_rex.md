<detail>

The Dire Tyrannosaurus Rex possesses an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average and may be penetrable by a skilled attacker. It has a total of 253 hit points, calculated from its 22d12+110 hit dice, giving it exceptional durability for a creature of its challenge level. The attributes that define its capabilities include: Strength 22 (+6), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 20 (+5), Intelligence 6 (-2), Wisdom 16 (+3), and Charisma 5 (-3).

In terms of skills, the Dire Tyrannosaurus Rex has a passive Perception of 11, which is average and allows it to notice subtle details in its environment. It has no spoken languages due to its animal nature.

In combat, the Dire Tyrannosaurus Rex features the action called Multiattack, enabling it to strike twice in one turn: once with its bite and once with its tail, targeting two different enemies. 

The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, allowing it to hit a single target for a substantial 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is another creature, it becomes grappled, requiring them to break free with a successful escape check against a DC of 17. While a creature is grappled, the Dire Tyrannosaurus Rex gains advantage on its bite attacks against that creature, making it a strategic choice for subduing opponents.

The Tail attack is also a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, reaching up to 10 feet and inflicting 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. This allows the Dire Tyrannosaurus Rex to threaten multiple opponents and control the battlefield effectively.

In summary, the Dire Tyrannosaurus Rex is an imposing force in any encounter, capable of dealing significant damage and controlling its foes with its grappling ability. However, adventurers must remain cautious of its average defenses, as it relies on its overwhelming strength and offensive capabilities to dominate in battle.</detail>
