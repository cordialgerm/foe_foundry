<summary>The Doppelixir is a Tiny ooze creature that presents an intriguing and deceptive presence in any encounter. This unaligned entity has a unique ability to imitate various liquids, making it an effective ambusher and manipulator. Although its physical stats are average, with an Armor Class of 13 and 45 hit points, it compensates with high dexterity, allowing it to evade attacks effectively. Its primary strengths include resistance to many damage types such as acid, fire, necrotic, and slashing, along with the capacity to ignore various conditions. However, it suffers from a very low intelligence, making it susceptible to intelligence-based attacks and strategies. The Doppelixir is particularly notable for its ability to charm and manipulate its targets, drawing them close for a dangerous attachment that leads to blood loss.</summary>

<detail>

The combat abilities and characteristics of the Doppelixir are as follows:

- **Armor Class:** 13, which provides a good chance of avoiding hits from many lower-level attacks.
- **Hit Points:** 45 (10d4+20) indicates a good level of durability for its challenge rating.
- **Speed:** It can walk, climb, and swim at a speed of 20 feet each, allowing for versatile movement in various terrains.

For its ability scores:

- **Strength:** 11 (+0), considered average, indicating it lacks strength to perform heavy physical actions.
- **Dexterity:** 17 (+3), which is good, enabling it to dodge attacks and improve its chances of avoiding damage.
- **Constitution:** 14 (+2), deemed average to good, reflecting its decent toughness.
- **Intelligence:** 3 (-4), marked as very bad, showing it is not capable of complex thought or strategy.
- **Wisdom:** 12 (+1), considered average, providing moderate perception and insight.
- **Charisma:** 7 (-2), categorized as bad, limiting its effectiveness in social interactions.

The Doppelixir possesses several special abilities:

- **Amorphous:** This ability allows it to move through spaces that are at least 1 foot wide without squeezing, giving it exceptional mobility in confined environments.
- **False Appearance:** When it is motionless, it becomes indistinguishable from the liquid it imitates, enabling it to use stealth tactics effectively.
- **Ooze Nature:** The creature does not require sleep, which means it can stay alert and active without rest.
- **Spider Climb:** It can move effortlessly across difficult surfaces and even ceilings without needing to make ability checks, making it a formidable opponent capable of surprising its enemies.

In terms of actions, the Doppelixir has the following:

- **Slam:** This melee weapon attack allows it to hit with a +5 to hit bonus, dealing 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage. When it successfully hits, the Doppelixir attaches to the target and begins draining their hit points at the start of each of its turns, causing a loss of 10 (2d6+3) hit points due to blood loss. The Doppelixir can detach itself at will after siphoning sufficient blood or if its target dies. It can also be detached by the target with a successful DC 13 Strength check.
- **Telepathic Urge:** This special action allows the Doppelixir to charm one creature within 60 feet, compelling it to move toward the Doppelixir and attempt to drink from it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for one minute. While charmed, the target must use its turn to move toward the Doppelixir. The target can attempt to save at the end of each of its turns, and if the Doppelixir attacks it, the charm effect ends. If the charmed target tries to drink the Doppelixir, it can make a Slam attack with advantage as a reaction.
  
The Doppelixir can also perform the following bonus action:

- **Imitative Liquid:** This allows the Doppelixir to imitate a common or uncommon potion or alchemical substance until it chooses to end the effect or change its imitation. If it takes no acid, fire, or poison damage in the round it is slain, creatures can collect its remains to use as the liquid it was imitating, providing a clever mechanism for gathering valuable resources.

Overall, the Doppelixir offers a mix of mobility, deception, and damage potential, serving as both a dangerous opponent and an unpredictable interactive element in the game.</detail>
