<summary>The Fey Knight is a magical creature from the Fey realm, embodying grace and trickery. It is classified as a Medium Fey, possessing an Armor Class of 16 and a total of 58 hit points, calculated as 9d8 plus 18. With a challenge rating of 4, it earns 1,100 experience points when defeated. The Fey Knight is notable for its agility and magical abilities, reflected in its Dexterity score of 18, granting it a good modifier of +4 to Dexterity checks and saving throws. It can move swiftly at a walking speed of 35 feet and can fly at a speed of 60 feet, providing exceptional mobility in combat. While it has a good Constitution score of 14, it also possesses solid mental attributes with a Wisdom score of 16 and a Charisma score of 16, both yielding +3 modifiers. However, it is vulnerable to strong physical attacks due to its relatively average Strength score of 14.</summary>

The Fey Knight has several strengths and weaknesses in combat. It is immune to being charmed and unconscious, making it resilient against certain magical assaults. It is adept in using stealth and deception, receiving a good +6 bonus to stealth checks and a +5 bonus to both deception and perception checks. However, as a Magical creature, it operates best in clever and tactical engagements, utilizing its abilities to manipulate and control opponents while avoiding direct confrontations where possible.

The Fey Knight possesses several special abilities. One is **Faerie Form**, allowing it to change its size between Medium and Tiny as an action, reducing the damage it takes while Tiny, though it suffers from disadvantage on Strength checks and gains advantage on Dexterity checks. The **Faerie Light** ability acts as a bonus action to cast dim light in a 30-foot radius or extinguish it, allowing for tactical manipulation of visibility.

In terms of actions, the Fey Knight can make two melee attacks when using its **Multiattack** feature, maximizing its offensive output. It wields a **Glittering Scimitar** for close-range combat, making melee weapon attacks at +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit inflicts 7 slashing damage, followed by 7 additional cold, fire, or lightning damage (as the knight chooses) from its magical abilities. The knight also carries a **Longbow** and can perform ranged attacks at +6 to hit with a range of 150 feet or 600 feet, dealing 8 piercing damage along with 14 poison damage. If the poison damage reduces a target to 0 hit points, that target is stable but poisoned for one hour and falls asleep during this time, even if it regains hit points.

Additionally, the Fey Knight can use **Fey Glamour** to charm a humanoid within 30 feet. The target must roll a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, and if they fail, they become charmed for one day. If harmed by the knight or its allies, the target must reattempt the saving throw, and they become immune to this charm for a year and a day if they succeed.

In a defensive capacity, the Fey Knight can use a reaction called **Nature's Shield**, which grants a +3 bonus to its Armor Class against an incoming attack if it is within 5 feet of a tree or large plant. This ability reflects the Fey Knightâ€™s adeptness at using its environment to enhance its defenses and survivability in battle.</detail>
