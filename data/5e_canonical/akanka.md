<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Akanka is a medium-sized fey creature with a chaotic evil alignment. It serves as a cunning and deceptive opponent in combat, utilizing its unique abilities to manipulate its environment and confound enemies. With moderate defenses, represented by an Armor Class of 12, and a decent pool of hit points totaling 45, the Akanka can sustain itself in battle while inflicting significant disruptions. It possesses a blend of magical and physical combat capabilities, thus being particularly dangerous in its ability to control engagements through illusions and incapacitation. However, its reliance on visual-based abilities means it can be challenged by foes that negate or diminish its sight, making it somewhat vulnerable to clever tactics that deny it its preferred methods of attack.</summary>

<detail>

The Akanka’s attributes reflect a balanced but slightly above-average capability in Dexterity and Charisma, with Dexterity at 15 (+2 modifier, which is good) aiding its agility, and Charisma at 16 (+3 modifier, which is very good) supporting its spellcasting. Its Constitution is decent at 14 (+2 modifier, which is good), contributing to its stamina in battles. Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, and its passive Perception of 12 are average to low, meaning it lacks robust physical prowess and does not excel at noticing hidden threats. 

In terms of special abilities, the Akanka possesses Spider Climb, which allows it to move on difficult surfaces, such as walls or ceilings, without penalty, giving it exceptional mobility. Web Sense enables the Akanka to know the exact position of creatures touching the same web, which can be crucial in ambush situations or when the terrain is filled with webs. Lastly, Web Walker allows it to traverse webbing unhindered, ensuring that such obstacles do not restrict its movement.

In combat, the Akanka can make a Multiattack, using its Mirrored Carapace ability first, followed by a Bite attack. The Bite is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit, indicating a good chance to connect with its target, dealing 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage. Additionally, the Bite inflicts a powerful status effect: the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. The target can awaken from this state if it takes any damage or if another character uses their action to awaken them.

The Mirrored Carapace ability allows the Akanka to project an illusory duplicate of itself, confusing attackers. If an enemy attacks the Akanka and rolls below a 15, they mistakenly strike the illusory duplicate instead, which is destroyed if hit. The duplicate is immune to all damage except those specifically targeting it and cannot be perceived as false by opponents relying on methods other than sight. This ability is inactive in darkness, and its effectiveness is diminished if enemies possess the ability to see through illusions.

The Akanka is also capable of spellcasting. With a Charisma-based spellcasting ability, it has a spell save DC of 13. It can cast spells without the need for material components, using cantrips like Minor Illusion and Silent Image at will, which allow it to create deceptive visual effects to mislead its enemies. It can cast Major Image three times per day, creating a more complex illusion, and once per day, it can use Hallucinatory Terrain to alter the environment significantly. These spells can dramatically impact gameplay by distorting perceptions and controlling the battlefield to the Akanka's advantage.</detail>
