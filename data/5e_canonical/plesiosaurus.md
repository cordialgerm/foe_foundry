<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Plesiosaurus is a large, aquatic dinosaur with a long neck, broad body, and flippers adapted for swimming. Found in deep lakes, rivers, and coastal waters, these creatures are fearsome predators, using their long necks to strike at fish and other marine life with deadly precision. Plesiosauruses are strong swimmers and can dive deep beneath the water to hunt or escape danger. Though generally not aggressive towards surface creatures, they can become territorial if disturbed or provoked, and their powerful jaws are capable of delivering a crushing bite.</summary>
