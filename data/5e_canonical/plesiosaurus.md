<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Plesiosaurus is a large, aquatic dinosaur with a long neck, broad body, and flippers adapted for swimming. Found in deep lakes, rivers, and coastal waters, these creatures are fearsome predators, using their long necks to strike at fish and other marine life with deadly precision. Plesiosauruses are strong swimmers and can dive deep beneath the water to hunt or escape danger. Though generally not aggressive towards surface creatures, they can become territorial if disturbed or provoked, and their powerful jaws are capable of delivering a crushing bite.</summary>

<summary>The Plesiosaurus is a large beast that primarily inhabits aquatic environments. Known for its notable swimming capabilities and powerful bite, it has a challenge rating of 7, allowing it to pose a considerable threat to lower-level adventurers while offering substantial experience points to those who defeat it. The creature has a strong physical presence with high strength, making it capable of dealing significant damage in combat. However, its low intelligence and charisma suggest it is not adept at interacting meaningfully with characters outside of combat. Overall, the Plesiosaurus excels in water-based combat due to its swimming ability but lacks versatility on land, which can be exploited by clever adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Plesiosaurus has an Armor Class of 13, indicating that it can offer a moderate defense against attacks, leading to an average survivability in combat. With 45 hit points, based on rolling six ten-sided dice plus an additional twelve points, it can withstand several attacks before being defeated. Its movement capabilities include a walking speed of 20 feet and a swimming speed of 40 feet, which gives it a very good ability to navigate through water swiftly but a bad performance on land.

In terms of ability scores, the Plesiosaurus exhibits exceptional strength with a score of 18, which translates to a +4 modifier, leading to powerful melee attacks. Its dexterity of 14, with a +2 modifier, is good, allowing it to dodge some attacks effectively. However, its constitution is average at 14, providing decent resilience but not outstanding. Intelligence and charisma scores are quite low, at -4 and -3 respectively, making these attributes very bad and indicating that the creature does not possess any notable intellect or charm.

The Plesiosaurus has a passive Perception score of 11, which gives it an average perception capability in passive observations. It has no languages, limiting its ability to communicate with adventurers or other creatures outside of instinctual cues.

The Plesiosaurus possesses a special ability called "Hold Breath," which allows it to remain underwater for up to 1 hour without needing to surface for air. This can be strategically beneficial when avoiding detection by land-based threats or when stalking prey.

For its actions, the Plesiosaurus can make a melee attack using its Bite ability. This attack has a +6 to hit, which is a good modifier, and a reach of 10 feet, allowing it to strike targets from a distance. If it successfully hits a target, it deals 15 points of piercing damage, calculated by rolling two ten-sided dice and adding its strength modifier of +4. Furthermore, the victim must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw; if they fail, they are pulled up to 5 feet closer to the Plesiosaurus. This tactic can disrupt opponents' positions and create opportunities for follow-up attacks from the beast or its allies.

The Plesiosaurus is a large aquatic beast known for its formidable presence both in the water and on land. With a challenge rating of 2, this creature poses a moderate threat to adventurers, offering a mix of physical attacks and special abilities. Its strengths lie in its ability to withstand critical damage and maintain effectiveness in aquatic environments. However, it lacks high intelligence and charisma, making it less capable in social interactions and strategic thinking. Overall, the Plesiosaurus is a reliable combatant, especially when engaging in water-based encounters.

In terms of attributes, the Plesiosaurus has a Strength score of +4, which is considered very good, allowing it to deal significant physical damage. Its Dexterity score of +2 is average, providing some agility but not enough to make it particularly evasive. With a Constitution score of +3, it has good durability, giving it a total of 60 hit points to absorb damage during encounters. Its Intelligence is very low at -4, meaning it has very poor ability for intelligence-based tasks. With a Wisdom score of +1, it has an average perception ability with a Perception score of 13, enabling it to notice its surroundings reasonably well. The creature’s Charisma score of -3 denotes a very poor social capability.

The Plesiosaurus possesses several notable special abilities. The "Hardy" ability allows it to negate the effects of a critical hit, treating it as a normal hit instead, which significantly enhances its resilience in combat. Additionally, the "Hold Breath" ability permits the Plesiosaurus to remain submerged for up to one hour without needing to surface for air, making it a natural predator in underwater scenarios.

In terms of actions during combat, the Plesiosaurus can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two attacks with its Bite. Each Bite attack has a +6 to hit, which is good, and it has a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 11 piercing damage (2d6 + 4) per successful hit. 

As a bonus action, the Plesiosaurus can execute a "Flipper Slam" while underwater, creating a shockwave that affects creatures in a 15-foot cone in front of it. Opponents must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become off-balance until the end of their next turn. Being off-balance halves a creature's speed and imposes disadvantage on the first attack roll they make on each of their turns, significantly hindering their combat effectiveness.

Overall, the Plesiosaurus is a powerful creature that thrives in aquatic environments, using both its raw physical power and special abilities to disrupt and damage opponents during battles.</detail>
