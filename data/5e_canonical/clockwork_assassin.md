<summary>The Clockwork Assassin is a versatile Medium Construct known for its efficiency in dealing damage and its ability to maneuver through various obstacles. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it poses a threat to adventurers, especially when it can take advantage of surprise attacks. The Clockwork Assassin has solid defenses, boasting an Armor Class of 16 and considerable Hit Points totaling 99, making it resilient against damage. However, it has a few weaknesses, particularly when faced with psychic damage, which hampers its combat capabilities. Its role primarily revolves around stealthy, surprise assaults and high mobility, being capable of climbing and walking at a speed of 30 feet.</summary>

<detail>

The Clockwork Assassin has an array of attributes that enhance its effectiveness in combat. Its Strength is 14, granting a good modifier of +2, which allows it to perform physical tasks with decent effectiveness. Dexterity is one of its strongest points at 17, resulting in a +3 modifier that provides very good bonuses to both attack rolls and Armor Class. Its Constitution score of 12 gives an average +1 modifier, contributing to its overall durability. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all at a score of 12, resulting in average modifiers of +1, except for Charisma, which has a bad modifier of -2. The assassin's saving throws are notably strong in Dexterity (+6) and decent in Constitution (+4). It also possesses skills that favor stealth and agility, with impressive bonuses in Acrobatics (+6), Stealth (+9), and average bonuses in Investigation, Perception, and Survival (+4 each).

The creature has immunity to lightning and poison damage, making it particularly resilient to certain types of attacks. It is also immune to various conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, significantly reducing the effectiveness of many crowd control effects. With darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 14, it is adept at navigating and detecting enemies in low-light conditions. It understands Common but cannot communicate verbally.

The Clockwork Assassin's special abilities enhance its combat prowess and survivability. The Assassinate ability grants it advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted in combat, turning critical hits into automatic successes against surprised foes. Its Explosive Core ability causes a damaging explosion upon its destruction, dealing fire damage in a radius to nearby creatures and requiring them to make a Dexterity saving throw to mitigate the damage. The Immutable Form ability grants it exceptional resistance to changes in its physical structure. Additionally, it possesses Magic Resistance, giving it advantage on saving throws against spells, making it significantly harder to affect with magical attacks. However, the Psychic Susceptibility ability means that if it receives psychic damage, its combat effectiveness is severely reduced until its next turn.

In combat, the Clockwork Assassin can utilize its Sneak Attack ability once per turn, providing an extra 10 (3d6) damage under certain conditions, such as when it has advantage on the attack roll or when it has an ally nearby. It also has a Standing Leap capability, enabling it to jump impressively far with or without a running start.

The assassin employs a Multiattack action, delivering two rapier strikes in a single turn. The rapier attack itself has a +6 to hit and can inflict 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. Additionally, if the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, they will take an extra 11 (2d10) poison damage and be poisoned for one minute. The Disassembly ability allows the assassin to break down into a snake-like form, utilizing narrow spaces while avoiding attacks due to the advantage granted against it while disassembled. However, it cannot attack in this form and must reassemble to regain its attack capabilities. 

Overall, the Clockwork Assassin is a formidable opponent that combines mobility, stealth, and explosive potential, making it a significant threat in the right circumstances.</detail>
