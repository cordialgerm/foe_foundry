<summary>The Lizardfolk Ruler is a medium humanoid creature known for its commanding presence and aggressive combat style. With a challenge rating of 4, it possesses a strong mix of physical abilities, making it a formidable foe in battle. Its armor class of 15 and a total of 100 hit points give it good resilience, while its decent movement options—30 feet on land, 15 feet climbing, and 30 feet swimming—allow for versatile positioning. Strength (STR) is the Ruler's primary attribute, rated at +3, which is considered good and enhances its melee attacks. Its dexterity (DEX) at +1 is average, and a constitution (CON) modifier of +2 contributes to its endurance. In social interactions, the Ruler's charisma (CHA) score of +2 is also above average. However, it lacks intelligence (INT) and has a modifier of +0, indicating average cognitive abilities, which is notable but not detrimental. The Lizardfolk Ruler excels in melee combat, particularly with its special abilities that boost damage output and provide tactical advantages for itself and allies.</summary>

<detail>

The Lizardfolk Ruler possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The "Brutal" ability allows it to deal an additional die of damage with melee weapons, adding significant power to its attacks. The "Heightened Smell and Taste" ability boosts its Perception score to 17 when relying on scent or taste, making it very good at detecting hidden or sneaky opponents. With the "Hold Breath" ability, this creature can maintain its breath underwater for up to 15 minutes, demonstrating its adaptability to aquatic environments. Perhaps most notably, the "Unshakable Command" ability grants protection to allied creatures within a 30-foot radius, preventing them from being charmed or frightened as long as the Ruler is not incapacitated.

In combat, the Lizardfolk Ruler can utilize its "Multiattack" feature to make two Bite attacks and one Greataxe attack, or three Javelin attacks in a single turn, allowing it to apply pressure on multiple targets or a single high-value target. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit and delivers 10 piercing damage on a successful strike (average damage). The Greataxe attack, also with a +5 to hit, has the potential to deal a substantial 16 slashing damage (very good damage potential) with its larger damage dice. The Javelin can be used for both melee and ranged attacks, dealing 10 damage in melee or 6 damage at range.

As a bonus action, the Lizardfolk Ruler can use "Leader's Challenge" to target a creature within 30 feet and force it to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. If the target fails, it suffers a disadvantage on attack rolls against anyone except the Ruler until the end of its next turn. Alternatively, if it fails against a threat, the Ruler gains advantage on its next attack against the target. This ability can significantly disrupt enemies and open them up for further attacks from the Ruler or its allies.

In reaction, the "Inspiring Hiss" ability empowers friendly Lizardfolk within 30 feet when they are hit by an attack. The targeted ally receives 5 temporary hit points for one minute, giving them a boost to their survivability during combat. This ability showcases the Ruler's leadership and its role in bolstering its allies in the heat of battle. Overall, the Lizardfolk Ruler stands out as a powerful and influential combatant that effectively combines offense, defense, and tactical support for its allies.</detail>
