<summary>A Vampire is an undead creature of immense power, known for its immortality, charm, and thirst for blood. Vampires retain the intelligence and personality they had in life but are twisted by their undead nature. They possess superhuman strength, speed, and the ability to regenerate from most wounds. Vampires can charm their victims, turn into mist or bats, and summon creatures of the night to their aid. While they are vulnerable to sunlight, running water, and holy symbols, they are dangerous foes in the darkness, using both their physical abilities and dark magic to manipulate and destroy.</summary>

<summary>The Vampire is a formidable Medium Undead creature, known for its cunning and overwhelming strength on the battlefield. With a challenge rating of 11, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, bolstered by impressive abilities and high defenses. The Vampire possesses strong melee capabilities, allowing it to grapple and drain the life force of its victims while also charming them, making it a dangerous adversary both in combat and when manipulating party dynamics. Its high Armor Class of 16 and substantial hit points of 142 provide resilience. However, it is vulnerable to sunlight and running water, which can impose significant damage and deactivate some of its abilities. This combination of strengths and weaknesses makes the Vampire a challenging foe that requires careful strategy to defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The Vampire has the following ability scores:
- Strength: 20, which provides a +5 modifier, indicating exceptional physical power.
- Dexterity: 18, granting a +4 modifier, which is very good for agility and reflexes.
- Constitution: 20, also offering a +5 modifier, showcasing exceptional resilience.
- Intelligence: 16, resulting in a +3 modifier, average for mental acuity.
- Wisdom: 16, giving a +3 modifier, also average for perception and insight.
- Charisma: 18, yielding a +4 modifier, indicating a very good ability to influence others.

The Vampire benefits from specific saving throws:
- Dexterity saving throws with a +8, which is good for dodging effects.
- Wisdom saving throws with a +7, which is good for resisting mental effects.
- Charisma saving throws with an +8, also good for maintaining charm effects.

In terms of skills, the Vampire is proficient in:
- Perception with a +7, which is good for noticing hidden threats.
- Persuasion with an +8, indicating a very good ability to convince or manipulate others.
- Stealth with an +8, also very good, allowing it to remain undetected.

It has resistances to necrotic damage and damage from non-magical, non-silvered weapons, which makes it fairly durable against standard physical attacks. The Vampire has darkvision up to 120 feet, giving it the ability to see in complete darkness, and a passive perception score of 17, which aids in detecting hidden creatures. It can understand the languages it knew in life but cannot speak.

The Vampire has notable special abilities:
- Legendary Resistance (3/Day): This ability allows the Vampire to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, showcasing its exceptional resilience. Each time it uses this ability, it visibly ages until it completes a long rest.
- Misty Recovery: Upon reaching 0 hit points, instead of falling unconscious, the Vampire turns to mist and must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. It becomes paralyzed for one hour upon returning to its resting place, resetting its hit points while vulnerable to certain types of damage during that time.
- Regeneration: The Vampire heals for 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and has not taken radiant damage since its last turn, making it very hard to defeat without specific strategies.
- Spider Climb: It can traverse difficult surfaces and odd orientations like ceilings, enhancing its mobility.
- Vampire Weaknesses: Vulnerable to sunlight and running water, taking 20 radiant damage upon ending its turn in contact with either, which also prevents it from using certain abilities.
- Resting Place: It must spend at least one hour per day in a specially prepared resting place to regain its powers.

The Vampire’s attacks include:
- Grab (Vampire Form Only): Makes a melee attack with an attack bonus of +9, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage plus 4 necrotic damage, and can grapple the target, which can attempt to escape with a DC of 17. This is a good tactical attack for control.
- Charm: Targets a creature within 30 feet, forcing a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the target becomes charmed and views the Vampire as a trusted ally for 24 hours. This is an excellent ability to manipulate combat dynamics as the charmed target will be willing to cooperate with the Vampire's actions.

In terms of bonus actions, the Vampire can use:
- Bite: A melee attack with +9 to hit, it deals 10 piercing damage plus 21 necrotic damage. This ability reduces the target’s hit point maximum by the necrotic damage dealt and allows the Vampire to regain that many hit points, making it very dangerous.

For reactions, the Vampire can utilize:
- Hissing Scuttle (1/Day): Avoids opportunity attacks and moves up to its speed when taking radiant damage, which is a good escape tactic when injured.
- Warding Charm (1/Day): Can use Charm as a reaction when targeted by a melee attack, offering significant defensive and strategic options.

The Vampire also has legendary actions it can utilize at the end of another creature's turn:
- Blood Charm: Uses Charm with disadvantage on the initial saving throw against a target it has bitten recently.
- Grab: Makes a grab attack as an additional action.
- Mist Form: Transforms into mist, gaining advantages for stealth and evasion.
- Shapechange: Transforms into a Medium or smaller beast, allowing versatility in approaches.

Overall, the Vampire is a powerful creature that combines melee prowess, life-draining capabilities, charm, and resilience, making it a complex and formidable opponent in combat scenarios.

The Vampire is a formidable Medium undead creature classified as a shapechanger, known for its versatility and terrifying abilities. With a high Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of 177 hit points, it stands as a resilient threat on the battlefield. The Vampire's challenge rating of 13 signifies its potential power and difficulty in combat scenarios. Its key strengths include a high Dexterity and Charisma, granting it exceptional stealth abilities and charm magic. However, the creature faces weaknesses, particularly when exposed to radiant damage or holy water. Its unique mechanics allow it to regain health rapidly through its regeneration ability and can easily escape certain death by transforming into mist before reaching 0 hit points, provided it avoids sunlight or running water.

The Vampire possesses the following attributes, which indicate its capabilities and effectiveness in combat: Strength +4 (average), Dexterity +9 (exceptional), Constitution +4 (average), Intelligence +3 (average), Wisdom +7 (good), and Charisma +9 (exceptional). Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet, which allows it to see in darkness as if it were bright light. The Perception score of 17 showcases its keen awareness, while the Stealth score of 19 provides a very good chance of remaining undetected. It is able to communicate in the languages it knew in life.

The Vampire has several special abilities that enhance its survivability and power. Its Hungry Dead Nature ability means it does not require air or sleep, but must consume a significant amount of blood every day to maintain its abilities. Failing to do so results in exhaustion, making this a critical aspect of its gameplay. With Legendary Resistance available three times per day, the Vampire can automatically succeed on saving throws it would normally fail, demonstrating an exceptional degree of resilience. Misty Escape allows the Vampire to turn into a mist when it is about to be incapacitated, granting it the chance to escape and recover at its resting place. Regeneration is a powerful ability that allows the Vampire to regain 20 hit points at the start of its turn, as long as it is not damaged by certain sources. Finally, the Resting Place ability highlights the Vampire's need for a designated area to recover and regain its strength.

In combat, the Vampire can take multiple actions due to its Multiattack feature. It can use its Charm ability on a nearby humanoid, forcing them to make a saving throw to avoid being charmed, putting them under its control for a day. The Bite attack, usable in its bat, rat, or wolf forms, inflicts piercing and necrotic damage, while the Claw attack, only usable in its vampire form, does similar damage but is slashing instead. The Draining Bite allows the Vampire to reduce a creature’s hit point maximum while healing itself, creating devastating effects if used strategically. Children of the Night enables the Vampire to call swarms of bats, rats, or wolves to assist in battle, providing reinforcements and complicating encounters for its enemies.

The Vampire also has notable bonus actions, such as Change Shape, allowing it to transform into smaller animals and Mist Form, which provides a range of defensive benefits while in mist state. In terms of legendary actions, it can move without being hindered, summon minions with Children of the Night, or cause excessive bleeding to surrounding enemies, making it a multifaceted threat.

Lastly, the Vampire has regional effects that come into play in areas it haunts, ensuring its influence is felt even beyond its immediate presence, adding an additional layer of challenge for adventurers confronting it.</detail>

***Shapechanger***. If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.

While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day)***. If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Misty Escape***. When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.

While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.

***Regeneration***. The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.

***Spider Climb***. The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Vampire Weaknesses***. The vampire has the following flaws:

*Forbiddance*. The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

*Harmed by Running Water*. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.

*Stake to the Heart*. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

*Sunlight Hypersensitivity*. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

###### Actions

***Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)***. The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

***Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (1d8+4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

***Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. *Hit:* 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.

***Charm***. The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

***Children of the Night (1/Day)***. The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

###### Legendary Actions

The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Move**. The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
