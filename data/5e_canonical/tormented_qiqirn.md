<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>The Tormented Qiqirn is a large chaotic evil fiend known for its resilience, quickness, and the ability to inflict both necrotic and psychic damage. With an Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor and a substantial amount of hit points totaling 133, it proves to be a formidable adversary in combat. The qiqirn's strengths lie in its high Dexterity, which allows for nimble movements and effective stealth tactics, combined with its special abilities that can debilitate foes. However, its Intelligence is notably low, indicating that it may not be the most strategic opponent. It possesses several immunities and resistances, making it tough to bring down, although its vulnerabilities are limited to specific types of damage. Its challenge rating of 10 places it at a moderate level of threat, and its actions in battle can shift the tide of combat significantly.</summary>

<detail>

The qiqirn has a Strength score of 15 (+2), which is considered average, allowing it to hold its own in melee combat. Its Dexterity score is 18 (+4), leading to a very good modifier that enhances its capability in stealth and agility-based actions. Constitution is also solid at 14 (+2), providing a good advantage for saving throws and hit point total. Notably, its Intelligence is very low at 5 (-3), resulting in a very bad modifier that limits its ability to understand complex tactics or spell casting. Wisdom at 12 (+1) is average, aiding in perception checks, while Charisma at 13 (+1) is just above average but does not substantially enhance its interactions with others.

The qiqirn enjoys several saving throw bonuses: a Dexterity save of +6, a Constitution save of +8 (both are good), and a Wisdom save of +6 (average). Its skills include a perception score of +6 (good), and an exceptional stealth score of +10, reflecting its natural ability to go unnoticed. It is immune to necrotic damage, resistant to cold, fire, lightning, poison, and less effective against attacks made with nonmagical forms of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The creature also has darkvision for 60 feet and communicates through telepathy up to 60 feet, although it cannot speak.

One of its primary special abilities, Aura of Pain, inflicts 4 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns on creatures within a 5-foot radius. Additionally, affected creatures need to succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid gaining disadvantage on their next melee attack roll. The Keen Smell feature provides the qiqirn with advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, enhancing its ability to detect nearby threats.

In terms of actions, the qiqirn can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to either make two bite attacks or use its Spiteful Howl ability twice. The Bite attack has an impressive +9 to hit and, when successful, deals 15 piercing damage along with an additional 9 necrotic damage. Targets struck must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The Spiteful Howl targets one creature and requires a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, causing 18 necrotic damage on a failure or half on a success.

The Unnerving Whispers ability, which requires a 5-6 recharge, allows the qiqirn to target up to three creatures within 60 feet, forcing them to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in 21 psychic damage and a random effect lasting one minute, which can include various debilitating conditions such as unconsciousness, deafness, incapacitation, stunning, fear, or paralysis. Affected creatures can repeat their saving throws at the end of their turns to shake off the effect.

Finally, the qiqirn features a reaction called Protective Spirits, which activates when it takes damage. It reduces the damage taken by rolling 2d8, representing its ability to call upon the spirits that infuse it for protection.

Overall, the Tormented Qiqirn is a dangerous opponent that combines physical prowess with debilitating magical abilities, capable of challenging adventurers in various ways.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Keen Smell:** The qiqirn has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. Self-loathing. A creature the qiqirn can hear can use its action to say “qiqirn” and make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. If it does so, the qiqirn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to the creature’s Charisma (Intimidation) check or be frightened of that creature until the end of its next turn. If the qiqirn succeeds on the saving throw, it can’t be frightened by that creature for the next 24 hours.

- **Spiteful Howl:** The qiqirn releases a spiteful howl at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the qiqirn, it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Unnerving Whispers (Recharge 5-6):** The qiqirn whispers the last words of the spirits infusing it into the minds of up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 21 (6d6) psychic damage and suffer a random effect for 1 minute. Roll a d6 to determine the effect: unconscious (1), deafened (2), incapacitated (3), stunned (4), frightened (5), paralyzed (6). A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
