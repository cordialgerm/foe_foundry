<summary>The Pyrohydra is a formidable Huge monstrosity known for its multiple fire-breathing heads and regeneration abilities. With an impressive Armor Class of 16 and a significant pool of Hit Points totaling 218, the Pyrohydra can endure extensive damage before being taken down, making it a resilient foe in combat. Its challenge rating of 13 signifies that it poses a serious threat to adventurers, providing a substantial 10,000 experience points upon defeat. Although it possesses a low Intelligence of 2, restricting its tactical capabilities, the Pyrohydra compensates with exceptional physical stats, particularly in Strength and Constitution, both rated at +5, marking their effectiveness as very good. The hydra is adept at using its environment to its advantage, with a speed of 30 feet on land and the same aquatic capability, allowing it to engage enemies both in and out of water.</summary>

<detail>

The Pyrohydra's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength of 20, a Dexterity of 12, a Constitution of 20, an Intelligence of 2, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 6. The Strength and Constitution scores indicate that it excels in physical confrontations and can withstand a significant amount of punishment, whereas its Dexterity is average, meaning its agility is sufficient but not outstanding. The hydra has skills in Perception and Stealth, both at +5, showcasing its ability to detect intruders effectively. It possesses darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 15, making it highly perceptive. 

One of the Pyrohydra's notable special abilities is "Hold Breath," enabling it to remain underwater for up to one hour, making it an excellent ambusher in aquatic environments. Its "Legendary Resistance" allows it to negate failed saving throws three times per day, although it temporarily loses coordination with its heads when this ability is used. The "Multiple Heads" feature provides it with advantages on various saving throws and makes it immune to being flanked, enhancing its defensive capabilities. The "Reactive Heads" ability grants the creature multiple reactions, allowing it to respond to threats more flexibly. With the "Regenerating Heads" trait, the hydra can grow back heads at the end of its turn unless it has received certain types of damage, making it particularly difficult to defeat. Lastly, "Toxic Secretions" poisons the water around its lair, posing a significant hazard to intruders who might attempt to drink or swim in the area.

In terms of combat, the Pyrohydra can execute a "Multiattack," where it makes a bite attack with each of its headsâ€”totaling seven bites if all heads are intact. Each bite attack is made with a +9 to hit and deals an average of 10 piercing damage (1d10 + 5) when successful. Additionally, the "Fire Breath" ability allows the hydra to unleash a devastating area-of-effect attack that deals 59 fire damage to creatures within a 30-foot radius, requiring them to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage. 

For legendary actions, the Pyrohydra has two options available at the end of another creature's turn. The "Rush" action allows it to move quickly without provoking opportunity attacks, with the potential of knocking prone any creatures it passes through. The "Wrap" action enables it to grapple and restrain a Medium or smaller creature, capturing one prey per head. If one of its grappling heads is killed, the attacker can choose to release the grappled creature of their choice, adding strategic depth to its combat interactions.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath:** The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When the hydra fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, its heads lose coordination. It is rattled until the end of its next turn.
- **Multiple Heads:** While the hydra has more than one head, it has advantage on Perception checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious, and it can't be flanked.
- **Reactive Heads:** For each head it has, the hydra can take one reaction per round, but not more than one per turn.
- **Regenerating Heads:** The hydra has seven heads. Whenever the hydra takes 30 or more damage in one turn, one of its heads dies. If all of its heads die, the hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows 2 heads for each head that was killed since its last turn, unless it has taken at least 20 cold damage since its last turn.
- **Toxic Secretions:** Water within 1 mile of the hydras lair is poisoned. A creature other than the hydra that is immersed in the water or drinks the water makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 24 hours. On a success, the creature is immune to this poison for 24 hours.
- **Wakeful:** When some of the hydras heads are asleep, others are awake.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hydra bites once with each of its heads.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** If the pyrohydra has at least 4 heads  it breathes fire in all directions. Each creature within 30 feet makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw  taking 59 (17d6) fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success.



### Legendary Actions

- **The hydra can take 2 legendary actions:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Rush:** The hydra moves or swims up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If this movement would pass through the space of creatures that are not incapacitated or prone, each creature makes a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is knocked prone and the hydra can enter its space without treating it as difficult terrain. On a success, the hydra can't enter the creatures space, and the hydras movement ends. If this movement ends while the hydra is sharing a space with a creature, the creature is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.
- **Wrap:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained until this grappled ends. The hydra can grapple one creature for each of its heads. When one of the hydras heads is killed while it is grappling a creature, the creature that killed the head can choose one creature to free from the grapple.
