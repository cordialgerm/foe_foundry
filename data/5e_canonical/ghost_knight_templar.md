<detail>

The Ghost Knight Templar's ability scores include a Strength of 20 (+5), Dexterity of 19 (+4), Constitution of 16 (+3), Intelligence of 13 (+1), Wisdom of 16 (+3), and Charisma of 15 (+2). It has saving throw bonuses of +7 in Wisdom and +6 in Charisma, both of which are considered good. The creature also has proficiency in Perception, granting a passive score of 17, which is very good for spotting hidden threats. As an undead entity, it enjoys notable immunities, including death from poison, and is resistant to cold and necrotic damage, as well as non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing, which enhances its survivability in battle. Additionally, it is immune to being charmed, exhausted, or poisoned, which offers further durability in various scenarios.

In terms of special abilities, the Ghost Knight Templar can execute a Charge, allowing it to deal an extra 10 (3d6) slashing damage if it moves at least 20 feet straight toward an enemy and hits with its Shadow Blade during the same turn. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, although it will take damage if it ends its movement within a solid object. The Turning Defiance ability grants it and any ghouls within a 30-foot radius advantage on saves against being turned by clerics or other abilities, making them harder to deal with when confronted by holy powers. Lastly, with Undead Nature, the Ghost Knight Templar does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to function without the limitations of living creatures.

In combat, the Ghost Knight Templar can use a Multiattack action to execute up to three melee attacks using its Shadow Blade. This attack has a +9 to hit and can deal 9 (1d8+5) slashing damage combined with an additional 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, making it a highly effective offensive option. The Stride of Damnation ability, which recharges on a 5 or 6, permits it to move through enemies without provoking opportunity attacks. During this movement, each creature it passes takes 35 (10d6) cold damage with a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage, presenting a significant area effect if positioned effectively. However, it cannot use this ability while mounted.

As a bonus action, the Ghost Knight Templar can summon or dismiss a ghostly mount, which functions as a warhorse skeleton with the Incorporeal Movement trait and a flying speed of 60 feet. This mount can also resist cold and necrotic damage, as well as non-magical attacks, and can be called upon once every hour if it is defeated. The combination of tactical abilities, strong melee attacks, and unique undead traits makes the Ghost Knight Templar a challenging and strategic opponent for adventurers.</detail>
