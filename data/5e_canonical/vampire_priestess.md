<summary>The Vampire Priestess is a formidable medium undead creature with a lawful evil alignment, designed to be a potent adversary in combat and a manipulator in social encounters. Possessing a significant challenge rating of 8, she boasts a well-rounded set of attributes and abilities that make her a versatile foe. With a high Wisdom score, she excels in spellcasting and can control the battlefield with her cleric spells. Her regenerative capabilities and ability to escape injury through mist form enhance her survivability, allowing her to evade defeat and launch counterattacks even when she seems vulnerable. However, she harbors critical weaknesses, such as hypersensitivity to sunlight and a reliance on specific conditions for her full range of abilities to function, presenting opportunities for strategic play by her enemies.</summary>

<detail>

The Vampire Priestess has an Armor Class of 16, making her relatively difficult to hit in combat, and she possesses 105 hit points, ensuring she can withstand several rounds of combat. Her ability scores are Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 13 (+1), Wisdom 20 (+5), and Charisma 15 (+2). The saving throw bonuses for her Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma are +4, +8, and +5, respectively, which can be considered good due to her high Wisdom score. Her skills include Perception at +8, which is very good, and Religion at +4, which is average.

In terms of resistances, the Vampire Priestess is resistant to necrotic damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. She is immune to being charmed and possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, providing her an advantage in dim lighting conditions. Her passive Perception score is 18, indicating her keen awareness of her surroundings.

Special abilities enhance her capacity to evade defeat and return to combat after taking damage. Her "Misty Escape" ability allows her to transform into mist upon reaching 0 hit points outside her resting place unless she is in running water. In this mist form, she cannot take actions or interact with objects, but she gains significant mobility and advantages on saving throws. If she successfully returns to her resting place, she can revert to her original form, though she remains paralyzed until she heals.

Regeneration is another critical ability, allowing the Vampire Priestess to regain 15 hit points at the start of her turn, provided she is not in sunlight or running water. However, this regeneration is disabled if she takes radiant damage or holy water damage during her turn. 

Her spellcasting capabilities further augment her combat prowess. Acting as a 9th-level spellcaster, she uses Wisdom as her casting ability, with a spell save DC of 16. She has access to a range of cleric spells, including cantrips such as "light" and "guidance," and various impactful 1st to 5th-level spells such as "bane," "inflict wounds," "spirit guardians," and "flame strike." These spells provide her with both offensive and defensive options, allowing her to hinder enemies or protect herself and allies.

Despite her strengths, the Vampire Priestess has notable weaknesses. She cannot enter a residence without an invitation due to her Forbiddance flaw, takes damage from running water, and suffers significant penalties in sunlight, including radiant damage and disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Additionally, she is vulnerable to wooden stakes, which can incapacitate her if delivered while in her resting place.

In combat, the Vampire Priestess can utilize multiattack, making two attacks after using her "Bewitching Gaze." The Scourge melee attack deals slashing damage and can inflict ongoing damage through bleeding, while her bite attack deals a combination of piercing and necrotic damage, potentially reducing the target's hit point maximum. The "Bewitching Gaze" ability allows her to charm and incapacitate a humanoid, controlling the battlefield temporarily while she prepares her next moves. Overall, the Vampire Priestess is a complex and dangerous undead opponent, adept at manipulation and combat, but vulnerable to specific tactics employed by clever adventurers.</detail>

Once in her resting place, she reverts to her priestess form. She is then paralyzed until she regains at least 1 hp. After spending 1 hour in her resting place with 0 hp, she regains 1 hp. s
- **Regeneration:** The vampire priestess regains 15 hp at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hp and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the priestess takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn.

Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The priestess takes 20 radiant damage when she starts her turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The vampire priestess can use her Bewitching Gaze. She then makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.
- **Scourge:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, and the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or bleed profusely from the wound. A bleeding creature takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire priestess, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the priestess regains hp equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the priestess' control.
- **Bewitching Gaze:** The vampire priestess targets one humanoid she can see within 30 feet. If the target can see her, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the priestess for 1 minute. While charmed, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0. Each time the vampire priestess or her allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. The target can also repeat the saving throw if another creature uses an action to shake the target out of its stupor.
