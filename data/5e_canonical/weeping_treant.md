In terms of attributes, the Weeping Treant has strong Strength at 21 (+5), allowing it to hit hard in combat, while its Constitution of 18 (+4) enhances its survivability.

However, its Dexterity is very low at 8 (-1), indicating that it struggles with tasks requiring agility and reflexes.

The Weeping Treant possesses certain vulnerabilities and resistances. It is vulnerable to fire damage, which means it will take double damage from fire-based attacks.

With "Speak with Plants," the Treant can converse with plant life, creating potential for unique negotiations or interactions through role-play. The "Weep Acid" ability causes it to continuously ooze acidic sap, creating dangerous situations for characters that engage with it in melee combat. Any creature that comes into contact with it or that attacks it in close proximity must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sustain 3 (1d6) acid damage.

In combat, the Weeping Treant can perform a "Multiattack," making two Slam or Rock attacks against its foes. The Slam attack, which has a +8 to hit and reaches 5 feet, deals 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage in addition to 3 (2d6) acid damage on a successful hit. Furthermore, the target must take an additional 3 (1d6) acid damage at the end of its next turn unless it or an ally takes action to wipe the acid away. The Rock attack is a ranged option with a +8 to hit, with a range of 60/180 feet, that deals 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, making it effective against foes from a distance.</detail>
