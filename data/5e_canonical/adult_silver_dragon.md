<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>The Adult Silver Dragon is a regal and noble creature with scales that gleam like polished silver. Its wings are large and majestic, and it often radiates a calming, dignified presence. Silver Dragons are known for their compassion and justice, frequently taking human form to live among mortals and assist those in need. They make their lairs in high, snowy mountains, where they can survey vast landscapes. Their breath weapon is a cone of icy cold, freezing enemies in their tracks. In addition to their cold breath, they can also emit a paralyzing gas, immobilizing their foes without causing harm.</summary>

<summary>The Adult Silver Dragon is a massive and powerful creature known for its grace and intelligence. As a formidable opponent, it boasts a high Armor Class of 19 and a substantial health pool, having 283 hit points. Its challenge rating of 19 signifies that it poses a significant threat in combat, often requiring a well-coordinated team of adventurers to defeat. This dragon excels in both physical and magical combat, backed by exceptional strength with a strength score of 24, which grants it a +7 modifier on related checks. Its innate spellcasting and unique abilities make it a cunning adversary. Although it has high resilience with damage immunity to cold and abilities allowing it to avoid damage under certain circumstances, its reliance on powerful breath weapons and splendid spells makes it vulnerable if disabled or outmaneuvered.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Silver Dragon possesses the following attributes: Strength 24 (+7), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 24 (+7), Intelligence 16 (+3), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 20 (+5). Its saving throws are formidable, with bonuses such as: Dexterity +8 (good), Constitution +13 (exceptional), Wisdom +7 (good), and Charisma +11 (exceptional). Its skills add to its competency in arcana +9, history +9, perception +7, and stealth +8, allowing it to navigate both battles and social encounters effectively. Additionally, its incredible senses include blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, giving it a passive perception of 20, making stealthy approaches against it very difficult.

This dragon's special abilities significantly enhance its combat effectiveness. The "Cloud Strider" ability grants the dragon immunity to nonmagical damage and increased fly speed of 300 feet after just one minute of concentration while in cloud form. However, this form restricts it to only using the Hide action. Its "Legendary Resistance" allows it to negate failed saving throws three times a day, a powerful way to avoid being helpless in critical moments. The dragon retains its impressive innate spellcasting capability, relying on Charisma with a saving throw DC of 19 to cast spells such as charm person, faerie fire, awaken, and geas up to three times each day.

For its actions, the Adult Silver Dragon can perform a "Multiattack," which involves a bite attack followed by two claw attacks or using "Spit Frost" in place of the bite. The bite attack has a +13 to hit and deals an average of 23 piercing damage plus 4 cold damage, while both claws deal an average of 20 slashing damage with the same attack modifier. With a tail attack, it can push a target back 10 feet while inflicting 16 bludgeoning damage. In humanoid form, it can utilize a rapier to deal 11 piercing damage, although its True Form is more fearsome.

In terms of breath weapons, the dragon possesses two powerful options. The "Frost Breath" creates a freezing blast in a 60-foot cone, forcing a DC 21 Constitution saving throw that, on failure, results in 72 cold damage and slowing the creature. The "Paralyzing Breath" functions similarly, producing a DC 20 save that can leave opponents paralyzed until the end of their next turn if they fail.

Additionally, the dragon can shapeshift using its "Change Shape" ability, allowing it to transform into a humanoid or beast while retaining its stats, except for size. However, some of its signature attacks are limited while it is in a non-draconic form.

As a reaction, the Adult Silver Dragon can use a "Tail Attack" when it is hit by a melee attack from a visible target within 10 feet, retaliating with a powerful strike.

In combat, the dragon also has access to legendary actions that allow it to act outside of its regular turn. The "Roar" can frighten nearby creatures, requiring them to succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or face dire consequences. It can also use "Wing Attack" to knock targets prone while flying. Lastly, the "Windstorm" creates a 20-foot radius area effect complications for its enemies by increasing the movement cost and dealing cold damage to creatures within the area. Each of these abilities can shift the dynamics of a battle, showcasing the cunning and might of an Adult Silver Dragon.

The Adult Silver Dragon is a massive and powerful creature, embodying both elegance and ferocity typical of its kind. With a challenge rating of 16, it presents a considerable threat to any adventurers who confront it. This dragon boasts formidable defenses, including a high Armor Class of 19 and an impressive pool of Hit Points totaling 267. It possesses exceptional physical and magical capabilities, making it a versatile opponent in combat. Its strengths lie in its ability to deal devastating damage with powerful attacks and its access to potent spells and abilities that can control the battlefield. While it is a fierce combatant, its challenges come from its reliance on powerful actions and the need to recharge certain abilities, which can limit its options in prolonged engagements.

The Adult Silver Dragon has the following attributes: Strength +8 (very good), Dexterity +5 (good), Constitution +12 (exceptional), Intelligence +3 (average), Wisdom +7 (very good), and Charisma +9 (exceptional). Its keen senses are represented by darkvision that extends to 120 feet and a keensense ability that allows it to enhance its perception up to 60 feet. Additionally, it has a Perception score of 22 (very good) and a Stealth score of 15 (average). The dragon can communicate using Common and Draconic languages.

Among its formidable capabilities is the Freezing Fog ability, which creates a chilling mist that affects creatures within a 20-foot radius of the dragon, requiring them to succeed on a DC 20 saving throw. The dragon also benefits from Legendary Resistance, allowing it to opt for a success on a failed save three times per day.

In combat, the Adult Silver Dragon makes use of its Multiattack action, which permits it to unleash its Frightful Presence to instill fear in its foes, followed by a bite attack and two claw attacks. It can substitute its bite with a Paralyzing Breath if it has that ability available. The Bite attack has a +13 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 19 piercing damage on a hit. Each Claw attack also has a +13 to hit, a 5-foot reach, and inflicts 15 slashing damage. The Tail attack, with the same +13 to hit and a 15-foot reach, deals 17 bludgeoning damage.

The Frightful Presence ability targets creatures within 120 feet of the dragon, compelling them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. Affected creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to end the effect, but if they succeed, they become immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. The Cold Breath ability (Recharge 5–6) allows the dragon to unleash a powerful icy blast in a 60-foot cone, forcing creatures in the area to make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, suffering 58 cold damage on a failure or half that on a success. The Paralyzing Breath ability, which recharges on a 6, functions similarly but also requires a DC 20 saving throw.

As a bonus action, the Adult Silver Dragon can Change Shape, transforming into a Beast or Humanoid with a challenge rating no higher than its own. In this form, it retains its Legendary Resistance, Hit Points, ability to speak, proficiencies, and mental abilities, while adopting the statistics and capabilities of the new form.

The dragon also possesses legendary actions, allowing it to take three actions at the end of others' turns. It can use Detect to pinpoint nearby creatures and traps, make a Tail attack, or, at the cost of two actions, execute an Elemental Roar that makes targets vulnerable to cold damage. Alternatively, it can perform a Wing Attack, which deals damage to creatures nearby and allows the dragon to fly away without provoking opportunity attacks.

In the event of the dragon's death, regional effects will dissipate over the course of 1d10 days.</detail>
