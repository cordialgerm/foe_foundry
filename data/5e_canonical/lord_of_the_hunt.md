<summary>The Lord of the Hunt is a powerful fey creature that embodies the spirit of the hunt, commanding both respect and fear on the battlefield. As a lawful neutral being, it operates with a code, focusing on achieving its goals through strategic planning and unwavering determination. The creature possesses exceptional physical attributes, particularly in strength and dexterity, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With a high armor class of 18 and significant hit points totaling 229, it is durable and difficult to bring down. The Lord of the Hunt excels in ranged and melee attacks thanks to its magical weaponry and can deal substantial poison damage in addition to its regular attacks. However, its reliance on physical prowess and magical capabilities can also be seen as a weakness, as it may struggle against opponents who can outmaneuver or outsmart it.</summary>

<detail>

The Lord of the Hunt has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 21 (with a modifier of +5, which is exceptional). 
- Dexterity: 18 (with a modifier of +4, which is very good). 
- Constitution: 19 (with a modifier of +4, which is very good). 
- Intelligence: 14 (with a modifier of +2, which is average). 
- Wisdom: 18 (with a modifier of +4, which is very good). 
- Charisma: 15 (with a modifier of +2, which is average). 

In terms of saving throws, it has strengths such as +11 in Strength, +10 in Wisdom, and +8 in Charisma, all of which are good. The creature has a solid skill set with proficiency in Athletics (+11), Perception (+10), and Survival (+10). The Lord of the Hunt is immune to cold and poison damage and resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources unless those attacks are made with cold iron weapons. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as exhaustion, being charmed, frightened, or poisoned. Its sensory capabilities include blindsight up to 10 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive perception of 20.

One of the creature's most noteworthy abilities is 'Huntsman’s Weapons,' where its weapon attacks are magical and inflict an extra 14 (4d6) poison damage upon hitting a target. The Lord's legendary resistance allows it to choose success over failure for a saving throw three times per day, enhancing its survivability in precarious situations. The 'Sure Seat' ability prevents it from being knocked prone while mounted, showcasing its command over its mount.

In terms of actions, the Lord of the Hunt can make multiple attacks with either a spear or a longbow. It has a multiattack feature that allows it to make three weapon attacks in one turn. When using the spear, it can deal either 8 (1d6 + 5) or 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage, followed by the additional poison damage. Interestingly, if it throws the spear, it can teleport it back to its hand at the beginning of its next turn, emphasizing its control and tactical advantage. The longbow attack follows a similar damage pattern, dealing 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.

The 'Hunter’s Quarry' action allows the Lord to magically summon various beasts, effectively augmenting its forces and creating chaos on the battlefield. It can call up to three d6 elk or boars, or one elephant, which serves as allies for one hour or until dismissed or killed.

As a bonus action, the Lord of the Hunt can summon a magical Fey mount, akin to a warhorse, which possesses 40 hit points and shares the creature's resistances and immunities. If the mount is slain, it disappears, and the Lord must wait an hour to summon another.

During combat, the Lord of the Hunt can utilize its reaction, 'Parry,' to increase its armor class by 6 against a single incoming attack it can see, provided it wields a melee weapon. 

Additionally, it can take three legendary actions after other creatures' turns. The options available include making an attack, moving without provoking opportunity attacks, and calling to the hunt. The 'Call to the Hunt' effect allows it to attempt to charm a creature within 60 feet, compelling them to obey its commands unless they succeed on a Charisma saving throw.

Overall, the Lord of the Hunt is a complex and versatile adversary with a variety of options in combat that can significantly impact gameplay and provide unique challenges for players.</detail>
