<summary>The Baliri Demon is a fearsome medium-sized fiend characterized by its chaotic evil nature. It possesses strong physical attributes, making it a formidable foe in combat, particularly with its high Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. With an Armor Class of 17, thanks to its natural armor, and a total of 190 hit points, the Baliri Demon can endure a significant amount of damage. The creature is rated with a Challenge Rating of 14, which denotes it as a difficult opponent for mid-level adventurers. Its notable abilities include magic resistance and unique attacks that can cripple foes by severing their limbs, along with a terrifying area-of-effect ability that can stun and damage multiple enemies at once. While it has immunities, including poison and the ability to resist a variety of damage types, the Baliri Demon is still vulnerable to magical attacks if they bypass its high saving throw modifiers.</summary>

<detail>

The Baliri Demon has the following attributes: Strength of 22 (+6), Dexterity of 16 (+3), Constitution of 20 (+5), Intelligence of 13 (+1), Wisdom of 17 (+3), and Charisma of 14 (+2). It possesses strong saving throw bonuses: +11 for Strength, +8 for Dexterity, +10 for Constitution, and +8 for Wisdom, which can be considered very good. The Demon is skilled in perception (+8), persuasion (+7), religion (+6), and stealth (+8), allowing it to be an effective manipulator and ambusher in the right scenarios. 

In terms of defenses, the Baliri Demon has damage immunities to poison, and it resists cold, fire, lightning damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. This gives it a significant edge when facing physical attacks, making it resilient in combat.

The Baliri's special abilities include Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it exceptionally difficult to control or harm with magic. Its "Praising Brays" ability allows it to channel power from a demon lord, granting up to three allies within a 30-foot range advantage on their next ability check or attack roll while also rendering them unaffected by the Baliri's own Blood Bray ability.

During combat, the Baliri can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks: one with its Bite and two with its Pincers. The Bite attack has a +11 to hit and deals 17 piercing damage plus an additional 10 necrotic damage on a successful hit. The Pincer attacks also have a +11 to hit and deal 15 slashing damage each. A critical hit with the Pincers may result in limb severing, which inflicts severe consequences on its target, such as the inability to use two-handed weapons or halving movement speed.

The Blood Bray ability, which has a recharge requirement, unleashes a horrific sound that causes necrotic damage and potential stunning effects to all creatures within 20 feet that can hear it. Targets must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw to avoid taking significant damage and being stunned. This makes the Blood Bray a highly impactful ability in battles, hampering the effectiveness of nearby enemies while dealing considerable damage. Creatures without internal organs, like constructs and elementals, are completely unaffected by this ability.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The baliri has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Praising Brays:** As a bonus action, the baliri brays praise to the demon lord that saved it from its previous life, channeling the demon lord’s might. The baliri chooses up to three demons within 30 feet of it. Each target has advantage on the first ability check or attack roll it makes before the start of the baliri’s next turn. In addition, the targets are unaffected by the baliri’s Blood Bray.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The baliri demon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its pincers.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.
- **Pincers:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage. If the baliri demon scores a critical hit against a creature, roll a d6. On a 1-3, it severs the target’s arm, and on a 4-6 it severs the target’s leg. A creature missing an arm can’t wield weapons that require two hands, and if a creature is missing a leg, its speed is halved. Creatures without limbs are unaffected.
- **Blood Bray (Recharge 6):** The baliri demon unleashes an otherworldly braying that causes the internal organs of nearby creatures to twist and rupture. Each creature within 20 feet of the baliri that can hear it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 36 (8d8) necrotic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn as it doubles over in agony. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned. The bray doesn’t affect creatures without internal organs, such as constructs, elementals, and oozes.
