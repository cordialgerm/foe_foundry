<MonsterName/>Krake Spawn</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Krake Spawn is a formidable creature characterized as a Huge Monstrosity with a neutral evil alignment. It possesses robust physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, making it exceptionally durable in combat. With a significant pool of hit points and a challenge rating of 14, it serves as a powerful adversary for adventurers. Its primary strengths lie in its multiple attacks, high damage output, and the ability to grapple opponents with its tentacles, all while being immune to cold, poison, and psychic damage. However, its relatively low Dexterity leaves it vulnerable to ranged attacks and finesse-based maneuvers. Notably, the Krake Spawn's amphibious nature allows it to thrive both underwater and on land, enhancing its versatility during encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Krake Spawn has an Armor Class of 16, which is considered good, providing it with decent defensive capabilities. It has 175 hit points, calculated from rolling 14d12 and adding 84, making it very tough to defeat. Its movement speed is 60 feet on land, allowing it to traverse combat effectively. It has an exceptional Strength of 24, translating to a +7 modifier, which enables it to execute powerful melee attacks. Its Constitution of 22, yielding a +6 modifier, contributes substantially to its resilience. It also maintains a respectable Intelligence of 17 (+3), Wisdom of 15 (+2), and Charisma of 18 (+4), enhancing its effectiveness in certain interactions. 

The Krake Spawn is adept at various saving throws, with bonuses that include +12 for Strength, +11 for Constitution, +8 for Intelligence, and +9 for Charisma, indicating a very good capability to resist various effects. It is immune to being charmed or poisoned, distinguishing it from many other creatures in combat. It possesses blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet, along with a passive Perception of 12, allowing it to detect foes in darkness or murky waters with ease. The languages it understands include Common, Infernal, Primordial, and Void Speech, offering it a diverse communication range.

Among its notable special abilities, the Krake Spawn is amphibious, enabling it to breathe both air and water, which enhances its combat options in aquatic environments. In combat, it can use a Multiattack action, which allows it to make one bite attack and eight tentacle attacks, or it can opt for four Freezing Water Bolt attacks.

The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +12 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. If it successfully hits a target, the bite inflicts 12 slashing damage, calculated as 1d10 plus its Strength modifier. The Tentacle attack, similarly, has a +12 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, dealing 10 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Notably, if a target is Large or smaller, the Tentacle attack grapples the target, requiring a DC 17 escape check. Once grappled, the target is restrained, affecting its own combat capabilities.

The Krake Spawn can also unleash ranged attacks using Freezing Water Bolt, which has a +9 to hit and a range of 60 feet. A successful hit delivers 13 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 10 cold damage, affecting both the target's hit points and potentially inducing chilling effects.

Additionally, it can create an Ink Cloud while underwater, emitting a 20-foot-radius cloud that heavily obscures the area for one minute. Creatures within this cloud must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, suffering 55 poison damage on failure, or half as much on a success. This ability can significantly alter battlefield dynamics, providing cover and inflicting substantial damage.

Lastly, Vomit Forth the Deeps is another powerful attack available to the Krake Spawn. It sprays a cone of half-digested food that requires creatures in the area to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, creatures suffer 27 acid damage plus 27 poison damage and are incapacitated, while a successful save halves the damage and negates the incapacitation effect.

As a bonus action, it can use Water Jet, which pushes back nearby creatures and allows it to swim up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. This ability is particularly useful for repositioning in the water and escaping dangerous situations without risking extra damage.</detail>
