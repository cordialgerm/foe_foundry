<summary>The Apaxrusl is a Medium Construct and a neutral entity that plays a unique role in combat due to its earth manipulation abilities and fiendish essence. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it possesses a total of 60 hit points, showcasing considerable durability for its level. The creature is notable for its ability to burrow through both earth and stone without leaving a trace, allowing for surprise attacks or tactical repositioning. It has a good Armor Class of 13, making it somewhat resilient to hits. However, its reliance on non-magical materials for its abilities and its vulnerability to thunder damage highlight its strategic weaknesses. The Apaxrusl's strength lies in its powerful melee attacks and the capability to inflict additional damage through fiery sand storms, making it a formidable opponent in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Apaxrusl has the following ability scores: Strength 17 (+3, which is very good), Dexterity 13 (+1, which is average), Constitution 16 (+3, which is very good), Intelligence 9 (-1, which is bad), Wisdom 6 (-2, which is very bad), and Charisma 7 (-2, which is very bad). The Apaxrusl excels in physical confrontations, particularly in melee attacks, but it has poor cognitive and social capabilities. The skills it is proficient in include Stealth, with a modifier of +3, which is good for stealthy maneuvers. 

One notable strength is its Damage Immunities, which include immunity to fire and poison damage. The creature is also immune to various conditions, such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. It possesses Darkvision, which allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light up to 60 feet, and Tremorsense, enabling it to detect creatures and objects in contact with the ground within a range of 30 feet. This makes it particularly adept at navigating through subterranean environments.

The special ability "Earth Glide" allows the Apaxrusl to burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing the material, enabling stealthy movement underground. Additionally, its type is considered fiend as well as construct, which can impact interactions with certain class features, such as a paladin's Divine Smite or a ranger's Primeval Awareness.

In terms of actions, the Apaxrusl can perform a "Multiattack," enabling it to make two slam attacks on its turn. Each slam attack has a +5 to hit and reaches a distance of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and if both attacks hit the same target, the target is blinded for 1 minute or until it uses an action to wipe its eyes, which can dramatically impact its effectiveness in combat.

Its special attack "Fiery Sands" has a recharge time of 5-6. When activated, sand whips vigorously around the Apaxrusl, forcing each creature within 10 feet to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage and 10 (3d6) fire damage, and half as much on a successful save. This ability can turn the tide of battle by creating area damage, potentially affecting multiple opponents simultaneously.

Lastly, the Apaxrusl has a reaction called "Shifting Sands." When it takes damage, it can roll a d12 to reduce the damage by the amount rolled. This reaction enhances its survivability, allowing it to persist longer in combat, thereby providing it with a tactical edge. Overall, the Apaxrusl is a versatile combatant that leverages its strengths in melee and area denial while mitigating damage through clever mechanics and special abilities.</detail>
