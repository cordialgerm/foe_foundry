<MonsterName/>Rakshasa, Pustakam</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>The Rakshasa, known as Pustakam, is a small, lawful evil fiend renowned for its cunning and magical prowess. With a commendable challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat, capable of dealing substantial psychic damage and charming opponents into submission. Despite its relatively modest armor class of 15 and hit points totaling 91, it more than makes up for this with its unique abilities, including limited magic immunity and the power to manipulate the minds of its foes. However, it is vulnerable to piercing damage from magic weapons wielded by good creatures, which can be exploited in combat situations. Overall, the Pustakam is a tricky adversary with potent combat capabilities and deceptive tactics.</summary>

<detail>

The Rakshasa possesses the following attributes: Strength: 12, Dexterity: 15, Constitution: 16, Intelligence: 13, Wisdom: 16, and Charisma: 18. These values yield modifiers of +1 for Strength (average), +2 for Dexterity (good), +3 for Constitution (very good), +1 for Intelligence (average), +3 for Wisdom (very good), and +4 for Charisma (exceptional). The high Charisma score enhances its spellcasting abilities and makes its charm effects more compelling and difficult to resist.

In terms of skills, the Pustakam has a perception score of +3, which is considered good. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a passive perception score of 13. The creature can communicate in Common and Infernal and possesses telepathy with a range of 60 feet.

The Pustakam has several noteworthy special abilities. Its "False Appearance" allows it to remain motionless and blend in with its surroundings as an ordinary object, making it an effective ambusher. The creature is also endowed with "Limited Magic Immunity," meaning it cannot be affected or detected by spells of the second level or lower unless it chooses to be. Additionally, it has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects, further underscoring its resilience against magical attacks.

When it comes to actions, the Pustakam can make a "Multiattack," allowing it to either perform two claw attacks or use "False Promises" twice, which can be replaced with a spellcasting action if desired. The "Claw" attack, which can only be used in its fiend form, involves a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit against targets within 5 feet, inflicting 7 slashing damage plus an additional 9 psychic damage on a hit.

"False Promises" is a compelling action where the Pustakam whispers alluring promises of power and riches into the mind of a creature within 60 feet. This attack deals 18 psychic damage (which can be halved if the target succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 15) and charmed the target for one minute. While under the charm effect, the creature suffers disadvantage on saving throws against the Pustakam's enchantment spells. The charmed creature can attempt to save again at the end of its turns, ending the effect if successful.

In terms of spellcasting, the Pustakam uses its Charisma modifier for spell DC (15). It can cast the following spells without needing material or somatic components: "Detect Thoughts" (which allows it to read minds), "Mage Hand" (enabling it to manipulate objects at a distance), and "Minor Illusion" (creating illusory objects or sounds) at will. Additionally, it can cast the spells "Command" and "Suggestion" three times each day, providing it with potent tools for manipulating creatures and gaining the upper hand in encounters.

As a bonus action, the Pustakam can use "Change Shape" to transform into a Tiny object or revert to its true fiend form. In either form, except for its size, its statistics remain the same, and any items it wears or carries do not transform. It will revert to its original form upon death.</detail>
