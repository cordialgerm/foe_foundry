<CreatureType/>Plant</CreatureType>

<summary>A Violet Fungus is a dangerous, carnivorous plant found in dark caves or underground caverns. Its long, spongy stalks end in whiplike tendrils that it uses to strike and rot the flesh of any creature that comes near. The fungus releases toxic spores and decays organic material, absorbing nutrients from its victims. Though slow-moving, Violet Fungi are highly dangerous in confined spaces, where their reach can easily catch the unwary. They often grow in clusters, making them even more of a threat to those exploring dungeons or the Underdark.</summary>
