<MonsterName/>Violet Fungus (Fungi)</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Plant</CreatureType>

<summary>A Violet Fungus is a dangerous, carnivorous plant found in dark caves or underground caverns. Its long, spongy stalks end in whiplike tendrils that it uses to strike and rot the flesh of any creature that comes near. The fungus releases toxic spores and decays organic material, absorbing nutrients from its victims. Though slow-moving, Violet Fungi are highly dangerous in confined spaces, where their reach can easily catch the unwary. They often grow in clusters, making them even more of a threat to those exploring dungeons or the Underdark.</summary>

<summary>The Violet Fungus is a medium-sized plant creature that serves as an unsettling and hazardous presence in the environments it inhabits. With very low mobility, moving only 5 feet, it relies on stealth and deception to ambush unsuspecting creatures. The Violet Fungus has an Armor Class of 5, which makes it exceptionally vulnerable in combat, and its Hit Points stand at 18, calculated from 4d8. This creature has a low Challenge Rating of 1/4, which signifies that it is relatively weak compared to other monsters in the game, rewarding players with 50 experience points upon defeat. Its most notable characteristics include being able to blend in with its surroundings and inflict necrotic damage through its attacks, despite its poor physical attributes.</summary>

<detail>

The Violet Fungus has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 1 (-5 modifier, very bad)
- Dexterity: 1 (-5 modifier, very bad)
- Constitution: 10 (+0 modifier, average)
- Intelligence: 1 (-5 modifier, very bad)
- Wisdom: 2 (-4 modifier, bad)
- Charisma: 1 (-5 modifier, very bad)

The creature possesses damage vulnerabilities to fire, which means it will take double damage from fire-based attacks. Additionally, it enjoys immunities to various conditions, including being blinded, charmed, deafened, fatigued, frightened, prone, restrained, and stunned, making it resilient to a range of debilitating effects that might affect other creatures.

In terms of senses, the Violet Fungus has blindsight with a range of 30 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on vision, but it is blind beyond this distance. Its passive Perception score is 6, indicating that it has average awareness of its immediate environment.

One special ability of the Violet Fungus is its False Appearance. When it remains motionless, it can perfectly mimic normal fungus, thus becoming indistinguishable from its environment. This makes it particularly effective at hiding until it decides to attack.

In terms of actions, the Violet Fungus can make a Multiattack, which allows it to execute a rotting touch attack against two different creatures during its turn. The rotting touch is a melee weapon attack that has a +2 to hit, with a reach of 15 feet. On a successful hit, it inflicts 5 points of necrotic damage, rolled as 1d10. This attack can pose a significant threat, especially if the creature targets multiple adventurers in one turn.

The Violet Fungus is a Medium plant creature known for its ability to blend seamlessly into its surroundings, resembling ordinary fungi when motionless. This creature serves as a minor hazard in dungeon environments or areas of decay. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is fairly weak, making it more of a nuisance than a significant threat. Its strengths lie in its resistance to certain conditions like exhaustion and paralyzed status, allowing it to endure longer than expected in combat. However, it possesses low physical attributes, resulting in very bad strength (-4), constitution (+0), intelligence (-5), wisdom (-4), and charisma (-5), meaning it lacks both combat capability and intellectual prowess. It compensates for these weaknesses by utilizing its special abilities effectively.

The Violet Fungus has an Armor Class of 10, which makes it easy to hit, and it has only 14 hit points, indicating that it can be defeated quickly if targeted. Its movement speed is 15 feet, restricting its ability to engage with threats from a distance. The creature has a keen sense of perception within a range of 30 feet and can attempt to hide with a stealth score of 5, but its effectiveness in these regards is limited.

One of the Violet Fungus's notable special abilities is False Appearance, which allows it to remain motionless and appear as regular fungus, making it difficult for adventurers to notice it until they are close. Additionally, with Plant Resilience, it is resistant to exhaustion and the conditions of being paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious, granting it exceptional durability against specific types of threats.

In terms of combat actions, the Violet Fungus can use Rotting Touch, which involves a melee weapon attack roll with a +2 modifier, allowing it to reach up to 10 feet to strike a target. On a hit, it deals 5 necrotic damage, calculated with 2d4 damage dice, making this a modest attack but with a necrotic damage type that might affect certain character types differently.

As a bonus action, the Violet Fungus can utilize Necrotic Spores if it has 8 hit points or fewer. This ability sends out a burst of spores within a 10-foot radius, targeting creatures that are not constructs. Those affected must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 10, suffering 5 necrotic damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful save. This adds an area-of-effect dynamic to its combat style, making it particularly dangerous to groups of adventurers who venture too close.</detail>
