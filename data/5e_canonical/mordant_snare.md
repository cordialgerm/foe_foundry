### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The mordant snare has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Mordant Puppets:** A mordant snare can spend 8 hours draining a dead Humanoid of its fluids and internal organs, replacing them with the snare’s acid and filaments. The Humanoid’s body then becomes a puppet controlled by the snare. Mordant puppets share a telepathic link with the snare, and each puppet uses the statistics of a zombie. The puppets can’t move more than 30 feet away from the snare. The mordant snare can have no more than twelve puppets under its control at one time.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The mordant snare makes one Bite attack and four Tentacle attacks, or it makes four Acid Spike attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18) if it is a Large or smaller creature. The mordant snare has eleven tentacles, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Acid Spike:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) acid damage.
- **Hidden Trap:** While underground, the mordant snare covers itself in dirt, sand, or other material and lurks just below the surface. The mordant snare is indistinguishable from the ground around it while motionless and covered in this way. When a creature enters the mordant snare’s space, the snare can make one Tentacle attack against the creature as a reaction, removing the covering material.
