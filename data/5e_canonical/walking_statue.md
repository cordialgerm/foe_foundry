<summary>The Walking Statue is a large construct that serves as a formidable guardian in various settings, often tasked with protecting valuable treasures or locations. Its notable features include a robust Armor Class of 16, making it relatively durable in combat, and a solid pool of hit points totaling 66, which allows it to withstand significant damage before succumbing. It has formidable strength with a score of 18 and a +4 modifier, making its melee attacks powerful and effective. However, the statue has low Dexterity (8) and Intelligence (1), leading to bad performance in agility and mental tasks—characteristic of a creature constructed for strength rather than finesse. The statue is immune to poison and psychic damage, as well as a wide range of conditions, making it a tough opponent that can endure most physical confrontations. Its challenge rating of 3 indicates it is a suitable encounter for a party of mid-level adventurers. The combination of its special abilities, like falling prone when taking excessive bludgeoning damage, adds strategic depth to how players may choose to engage with it.</summary>

<detail>

The Walking Statue has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 18, with a +4 modifier which is exceptional for melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 8, with a -1 modifier which is very bad, resulting in poor initiative and Armor Class.
- Constitution: 18, yielding a +4 modifier which is exceptional, granting it a high hit point pool.
- Intelligence: 1, providing a -5 modifier that is very bad, indicating it cannot perform any complex actions or thought processes.
- Wisdom: 10, with a +0 modifier which is average, showing it has a basic awareness of its surroundings.
- Charisma: 1, with a -5 modifier which is very bad, rendering it incapable of social interaction.

In terms of its special abilities:
- Bludgeoning Weakness: This ability triggers when the statue receives more than 10 bludgeoning damage from a single attack, causing it to fall prone. This can be particularly advantageous for players using an aggressive strategy to potentially limit the statue’s movements.
- False Appearance: The statue can blend in seamlessly with its surroundings if it remains motionless, making it indistinguishable from a typical statue until it moves or is hit. This ability allows it to ambush unsuspecting adventurers.
- Spell-created: The statue’s existence can be disrupted with a successful cast of dispel magic, which requires a spellcaster to beat a DC of 19 to destroy it, making it a priority in combat for any spellcasters in the party.

As for its actions:
- Smash: As a melee weapon attack, the statue uses its formidable strength with a +6 to hit, targeting one foe within 5 feet of it. On a successful hit, it inflicts 15 bludgeoning damage, averaging significant output that can change the tide of battle if it strikes a key opponent.

Overall, the Walking Statue is a heavy-hitting creature that poses unique challenges and requires tactical thinking to confront and defeat in combat.</detail>
