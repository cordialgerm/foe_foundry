<summary>The Eldritch Ooze is a formidable Large sized ooze with an unaligned nature. It has a challenge rating of 5, signifying a moderate threat to adventuring parties and yielding 1,800 experience points upon defeat. Its defensive capabilities are somewhat lacking, with an Armor Class of 8, but it boasts a substantial pool of hit points totaling 153, derived from 18d10+54, making it quite resilient. The ooze has a slow movement speed, only able to walk and climb at 10 feet per turn. Its attributes are noteworthy; it possesses a strong Strength score of 16, allowing for solid physical attacks, while its Constitution score of 16 provides it with durability. However, its Dexterity is relatively poor at 6, which reflects a very bad agility, making it vulnerable to ranged attacks. </summary>

<detail>

The Eldritch Ooze has a variety of impressive immunities, including complete resistance to acid, cold, lightning, and slashing damage, as well as an immunity to many debilitating conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or frightened. Senses are limited, conveying a blindsight of 60 feet but leaving it blind beyond that range, with a passive Perception score of 8. Notably, it does not have the ability to communicate.

The special abilities of the Eldritch Ooze enhance its lethality in combat. Its Amorphous trait allows it to pass through spaces as narrow as 1 inch, making it difficult to escape. Its Maddening Form ability targets creatures with an Intelligence higher than 3, imposing a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw within 30 feet. A failed save results in the creature taking 7 (2d6) psychic damage and being incapacitated until the end of its next turn. Creatures may attempt to avoid this effect by averting their eyes, albeit at the risk of missing its movements. Additionally, the Spider Climb ability grants it the freedom to traverse any difficult surface, including ceilings, without penalty.

In terms of actions, the Eldritch Ooze can utilize the Void-Infused Pseudopod, which functions as a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage alongside 10 (3d6) psychic damage. This attack also has the potential to reduce the target’s Intelligence by 1d4 with a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw; if this reduction brings a creature's Intelligence to 0, it leads to instant death.

As a reactive ability, the Eldritch Ooze can Split when subjected to lightning or slashing damage, provided it has 10 or more hit points. This ability allows it to divide into two smaller oozes, each with half of the original ooze's hit points, underscoring the threat it poses as defeating one may only lead to the emergence of several more.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The eldritch ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Maddening Form:** When a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher that can see the eldritch ooze starts its turn within 30 feet of the ooze, the ooze can force it to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw if the ooze isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the creature fails, it takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage and is incapacitated until the end of its turn.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the eldritch ooze until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the ooze in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw.
- **Spider Climb:** The eldritch ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Void-Infused Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or its Intelligence score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Intelligence to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

### Reactions

- **Split:** When an eldritch ooze that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new oozes if it has at least 10 hp. Each new ooze has hp equal to half the original ooze’s, rounded down. New oozes are one size smaller than the original ooze.
