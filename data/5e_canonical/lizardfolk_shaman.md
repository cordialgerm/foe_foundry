The shaman possesses two special abilities: "Heightened Smell and Taste," which allows it to have a Perception score of 20 when relying on its sense of smell or taste, making it highly effective in tracking or detecting creatures nearby; and "Hold Breath," enabling it to remain submerged underwater for up to 15 minutes without surfacing, which is advantageous in aquatic environments.

It can cast the following spells at will: druidcraft, guidance, and mending, all of which provide either utility or healing capabilities. Additionally, it has 2 uses each of cure wounds, entangle, and grease spells, which can be pivotal for both healing allies and controlling battlefield conditions. The shaman can cast ray of enfeeblement once per day to weaken an opponent's physical attacks, significantly impacting their damage output.

Finally, as a bonus action, when the shaman has 32 Hit Points or fewer, it can utilize its "Poisoned Body" ability to coat itself in poison, suffering 3 poison damage while dealing 7 poison damage to any creature that hits it with a melee attack before the start of its next turn. This ability serves as a deterrent, punishing foes for engaging in close combat. Overall, the Lizardfolk Shaman is a versatile combatant with capabilities for dealing damage, crowd control, and healing, making it a valuable asset in any encounter.</detail>
