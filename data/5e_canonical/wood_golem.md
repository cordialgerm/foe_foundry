<summary>The Wood Golem is a medium-sized construct that serves as a protector or enforcer, typically created by a powerful entity to fulfill its commands. This creature has considerable physical strength and durability, making it a formidable opponent in combat situations. However, its intelligence is remarkably low, rendering it unable to perform any complex tasks or engage in deep strategic thinking. The Wood Golem has a Challenge Rating of 3, which translates to an experience value of 700 XP, making it a suitable challenge for lower-level adventurers. Its primary strengths lie in its high Strength and decent Constitution, along with a strong physical defense. However, it is particularly vulnerable to fire damage, which is its only damage vulnerability.</summary>

<detail>

The Wood Golem has the following attributes: Strength: 18 (+4), Dexterity: 10 (+0), Constitution: 15 (+2), Intelligence: 3 (-4), Wisdom: 10 (+0), and Charisma: 1 (-5). Its Strength allows it to excel in melee combat, while its average Dexterity does not contribute significantly to its dodging capability. The Constitution score indicates that it can absorb a reasonable amount of damage, but its poor Intelligence and Charisma make it inept at reasoning and social interaction.

In terms of defenses, the Wood Golem has an Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor, resulting in a good defense against physical attacks. It has a total of 52 hit points from 8d8+16, which provides it with good durability in battles. It holds immunities to poison and psychic damage, as well as resistances to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, unless inflicted by adamantine weapons. Furthermore, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. These traits make the Wood Golem very resilient against a variety of attacks and effects.

The Wood Golem also possesses two special abilities: Immutable Form and Magic Resistance. Its Immutable Form grants it exceptional resistance to any spells or effects that could change its physical structure, which means it cannot be transformed or altered by magic. Magic Resistance gives the golem advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability in encounters with magic users.

In combat, the Wood Golem can utilize a Multiattack ability, allowing it to make two slam attacks during its turn. Each slam attack is resolved with a melee weapon attack modifier of +6 to hit, which is very good, allowing it to strike effectively against its foes at a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, the slam attack deals 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, which is substantial for a creature of its challenge rating.

Overall, the Wood Golem embodies the characteristics of a well-built defense mechanism with immense strength, making it a threat in battle despite its vulnerability to fire.</detail>
