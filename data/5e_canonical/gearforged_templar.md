<summary>The Gearforged Templar is a Medium-sized constructed being that embodies the principles of order and law. It is classified as Lawful Neutral and stands out as a formidable guardian and combatant in any encounter. With an Armor Class of 18, it boasts a solid defensive capability alongside a substantial pool of hit points totaling 71, derived from rolling 11d8 plus a constitution modifier of 2. This makes it moderately resistant to damage due to its immunities, which include poison and psychic damage, as well as resistances to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. While it is a strong fighter, its Dexterity is low, resulting in a poor initiative and agility due to a -1 modifier in that attribute, which is considered bad. Additionally, its average intelligence and charisma scores mean it is neither particularly insightful nor persuasive.</summary>

<detail>

The Gearforged Templar has the ability known as Construct Nature, which allows it to function without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep. This makes it highly efficient as it can operate continuously without the drawbacks faced by living creatures.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Gearforged Templar can make multiple attacks, employing the Multiattack feature. This allows it to perform four attacks with either its Greatsword or Javelins. When using the Greatsword, it has a +7 to hit, able to hit a target within 5 feet for 11 slashing damage on a successful strike. If it successfully lands two hits on a single opponent, that opponent must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw; on failure, they are pushed back up to 10 feet, which can be strategically advantageous for controlling the battlefield.

As for its ranged options, the Javelin attack also carries a +7 to hit with a damage potential of 7 piercing damage. The versatility of the Javelin allows it to be used either in melee at 5 feet or ranged within a distance of 30 feet (with a further range of 120 feet at disadvantage), making it adaptable to various combat situations.

One of its most devastating abilities is Whirlwind, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This action involves the Gearforged Templar swinging its greatsword in a wide arc, forcing all creatures within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 27 slashing damage, while those who succeed only take half damage, making it a potent area-of-effect attack that can turn the tide of battle.

Additionally, it has reactions such as Defensive Zone, which triggers when an enemy enters its reach, allowing it to make a Greatsword attack against that foe. The Parry ability allows the Gearforged Templar to enhance its Armor Class by 3 against one incoming melee attack, provided it can see the attacker and is wielding a melee weapon, showcasing its defensive capabilities even further.

Overall, the Gearforged Templar stands as a resilient and formidable presence on the battlefield, capable of both dealing and withstanding significant damage while controlling the combat space effectively.</detail>
