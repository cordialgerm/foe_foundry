The Hundun's attributes include a strength of 20, providing a +5 modifier, which is considered very good for melee attacks. It has a dexterity score of 14 (+2, good), a constitution of 16 (+3, good), intelligence of 4 (-3, very bad), wisdom of 20 (+5, exceptional), and charisma of 18 (+4, very good). Its saving throws are robust, with a +7 in constitution, +9 in wisdom, and +8 in charisma, making it particularly resilient against various magical effects. The Hundun also excels in skills such as Athletics (+9, good), Insight (+9, good), and Perception (+9, good), showcasing its capability to navigate physical and sensory challenges effectively. 

In terms of resistances and immunities, the Hundun has immunity to acid and psychic damage, and it resists lightning, radiant, and thunder damage as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, rendering it difficult to hurt significantly with physical attacks. It is immune to several conditions such as being charmed, frightened, or unconscious, making it a reliable ally in critical moments. With blindsight extending 60 feet and a passive perception of 19, it is adept at detecting threats around it without relying on vision.

The creature has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The Inscrutable ability makes it immune to effects that would allow others to read its emotions or thoughts, as well as divination spells it refuses. Furthermore, Wisdom (Insight) checks to gauge its intentions are made with disadvantage. Magic Resistance grants the Hundun an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, underscoring its resilience against magical attacks. The Radiant Fists ability elevates its Slam attacks by adding 2d6 radiant damage, making its melee capabilities even more pronounced.

For its actions, the Hundun can execute a Multiattack by using its Motivating Babble and subsequently making four Slam attacks. Each Slam attack has a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage and an additional 7 (2d6) radiant damage. Its Motivating Babble allows it to affect one creature within 60 feet by forcing the target to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, it suffers one of several effects determined by rolling a d4, thus adding a layer of unpredictability to the encounter.

The Hundun is also capable of casting spells, requiring no material components and utilizing wisdom as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 17. It can cast the following spells at will: create or destroy water, dancing lights, minor illusion, and prestidigitation. Additionally, it can use black tentacles, fabricate (as an action), and irresistible dance three times per day. Once per day, it can cast creation (as an action) and plant growth. These abilities grant it versatile options for manipulation of its environment or disruption of foes, significantly impacting gameplay dynamics.</detail>
