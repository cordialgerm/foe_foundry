<MonsterName/>Vorthropod</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Vorthropod is a medium-sized monstrosity characterized by its affinity for magma and lava environments. It possesses a distinctive ability to thrive in extreme heat, making it a formidable opponent in volcanic terrain. With a robust armor class of 15 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 127, this creature can endure a fair amount of damage. Its strengths lie in both natural defenses, such as damage immunities to fire and poison, and offensive capabilities with its claw attacks and fiery retaliatory strikes. However, its low intelligence and charisma scores suggest that it lacks cognitive and social capabilities, presenting a potential weakness when confronted with more cunning adversaries. The Vorthropod's challenge rating of 5 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, granting them 1,800 experience points upon defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The Vorthropod has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16 with a modifier of +3, making it very good for physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average, indicating no particular agility.
- Constitution: 19 with a modifier of +4, representing exceptional resilience.
- Intelligence: 3 with a modifier of -4, indicating a very bad capacity for problem-solving and strategy.
- Wisdom: 12 with a modifier of +1, which is average, suggesting basic awareness.
- Charisma: 3 with a modifier of -4, meaning it has very bad social skills.

The Vorthropod has perception as a skill with a modifier of +1, which is average, enabling it to be somewhat aware of its surroundings. It is immune to fire and poison damage, can resist slashing and piercing damage, and cannot be poisoned. Its senses include blindsight up to 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, with a passive perception of 11. It does not speak any languages.

The Vorthropod's special abilities include:
- **Lava Bound:** This ability allows the creature to exist outside of lava or magma for up to 4 hours each day. If it begins its turn outside of lava and has not taken fire damage since its last turn, its shell begins to cool and harden, reducing its walking speed to 20 feet, increasing its armor class to 18, and making it vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. If it is in lava or takes fire damage, its shell becomes molten again. If it spends more than 4 hours outside of lava, its shell petrifies, putting it in hibernation for a period that could last up to 110 years; during this time, it is effectively inactive and cannot be harmed unless submerged in lava for one round, which restores its normal form.
- **Lava Camouflage:** This grants the Vorthropod advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in lava or volcanic terrain, making it good at ambushing or evading detection in its native environment.
- **Molten Shell:** When its shell is not hardened, any creature that touches or hits the Vorthropod with a melee attack within 5 feet takes 7 fire damage.

In terms of actions, the Vorthropod can perform the following:
- **Multiattack:** It makes two claw attacks against a single target.
- **Claw:** This is a melee weapon attack that has a +6 to hit, with a range of 5 feet. It deals 8 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 fire damage, making it a powerful attacking option.
- **Molten Tail Slap (Recharge 4–6):** With a recharge cooldown, the Vorthropod can unfurl its tail to perform a sweeping attack that releases scalding sparks and rocks. Each creature within a 15-foot radius takes 28 fire damage, with a DC of 14 for a Dexterity saving throw to reduce damage by half. This can significantly impact opponents positioned close to the creature, making it a dangerous move in combat.</detail>
