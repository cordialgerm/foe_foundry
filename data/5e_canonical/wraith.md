<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>A Wraith is a malevolent, incorporeal undead creature that embodies death and darkness. It appears as a shadowy, wisp-like figure with glowing eyes, floating silently through the air. Wraiths are driven by a burning hatred for all life, and their touch drains the life force from living beings, turning their victims into wraiths or lesser undead. They are immune to most physical attacks and can pass through walls or objects, making them difficult to fight. Wraiths are often found in ancient crypts or haunted places, serving as guardians for cursed treasures or as agents of necromancers.</summary>
