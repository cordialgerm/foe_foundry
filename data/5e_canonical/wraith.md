<summary>A Wraith is a malevolent, incorporeal undead creature that embodies death and darkness. It appears as a shadowy, wisp-like figure with glowing eyes, floating silently through the air. Wraiths are driven by a burning hatred for all life, and their touch drains the life force from living beings, turning their victims into wraiths or lesser undead. They are immune to most physical attacks and can pass through walls or objects, making them difficult to fight. Wraiths are often found in ancient crypts or haunted places, serving as guardians for cursed treasures or as agents of necromancers.</summary>

<summary>The Wraith is a Medium Undead creature that embodies fear and death, often serving as a formidable opponent for adventurers. It has a significant challenge rating of 5, reflecting its potency and the threat it poses to any who cross its path. Wraiths are known for their incorporeal nature, allowing them to move freely through obstacles, and their ability to sap life from their victims. With an Armor Class of 13 and 67 hit points, they can withstand a moderate amount of damage but should not be underestimated due to their unique abilities and resistances. Notably, they are immune to necrotic and poison damage, making them especially dangerous in encounters with characters relying on such attack types. Wraiths excel in dealing necrotic damage and controlling the battlefield with fear, but their Light Sensitivity makes them vulnerable when exposed to bright light.</summary>

<detail>

The Wraith has a Strength of 8, giving it a very bad modifier of -1, which means it is physically weak and not adept in melee combat. Its Dexterity is 16, providing it with a good +3 modifier, granting it good agility and a better chance to evade attacks. With a Constitution score of 16, the Wraith has a good +3 modifier, which contributes positively to its hit points and resilience. The Intelligence score is 12, resulting in an average +1 modifier, which indicates basic understanding but not exceptional cunning. Wisdom is at 16 with a good +3 modifier, helping it resist certain effects and contributing to its fear aura. Finally, Charisma is 14, giving it a good +2 modifier, which is reflected in its ability to instill fear and manipulate the battlefield.

The Wraith possesses several special abilities that impact gameplay significantly. Its "Aura of Fear" causes creatures that start their turn within 10 feet to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in being frightened until the start of their next turn. Creatures that succeed or have the effect end for them become immune to this feat for 24 hours. The Wraith’s "Evil" aura radiates an unsettling presence that can influence interactions and weaken opponents. The "Incorporeal" trait allows the Wraith to pass through other creatures and objects, although it incurs damage if it ends its turn inside an object. However, it loses this ability when it takes radiant damage until the end of its next turn. "Light Sensitivity" imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks when in bright light. Lastly, the "Undead Nature" ability allows the Wraith to function without air, food, drink, or sleep, making it tireless and relentless.

In terms of actions, the Wraith has the "Life Drain" attack, which targets a creature within 5 feet and forces the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, or 21 (6d6) if it is frightened or surprised, along with a reduction in its hit point maximum by an amount equal to the damage taken until it finishes a long rest. If this reduction reduces the creature's maximum hit points to 0, it dies. The Wraith also has the ability "Create Specter," which allows it to touch a humanoid corpse it killed within the last day, causing the spirit to rise as a specter under the Wraith's control, thus expanding its undead influence over the battlefield.

The Wraith is a Medium undead creature known for its ethereal form and ability to drain the life from the living. With an Armor Class of 14 and 85 hit points, it is relatively resilient, especially considering its mobility. Its speed is unique, as the Wraith cannot move on the ground but can fly at a speed of 60 feet while hovering. The Wraith is a Challenge Rating 5 creature, making it a formidable opponent for low to mid-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its mobility, ability to drain life, and its capacity to create minions from the fallen. However, the Wraith suffers in sunlight, where it has disadvantage on attack rolls and reduced perception capabilities. 

The Wraith has a Strength score of -2, which signifies very bad physical strength, a Dexterity score of +4 (good), a Constitution score of +3 (good), an Intelligence score of +1 (average), a Wisdom score of +2 (average), and a Charisma score of +2 (average). Its Stealth skill is exceptional with a value of 17, allowing it to remain undetected easily. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Additionally, the Wraith speaks the languages it knew in life.

The Wraith has several special abilities that contribute to its unique combat style. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, although it takes damage if it ends its turn inside an object. Sunlight Sensitivity makes it weaker in bright light, impacting its ability to hit targets and its perception. Undead Nature indicates that the Wraith does not require basic needs like air, food, drink, or sleep, while Undead Resilience grants it immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition.

In terms of actions, the Wraith can perform a Multiattack, making two Life Drain attacks. The Life Drain move is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 18 points of necrotic damage (4d6 + 4), and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by the damage dealt until it finishes a long rest. This effect can lead to death if the target's maximum hit points drop to zero. The Wraith can also create a specter from a humanoid it can see that has died violently within the last minute, allowing it to control up to seven specters at once.

As a bonus action, the Wraith can use its Trail of Death ability, which allows it to move up to 30 feet in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. During this movement, if it enters a creature's space, that creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in the creature being afflicted with wasting doom, which deals 3 necrotic damage every turn until the creature starts in sunlight or regains hit points.

Finally, as a reaction, the Wraith can use Unravel Life when it sees a creature within 30 feet regaining hit points. This ability allows the Wraith to halve the amount of healing the creature receives, making it a potent foe for healing-focused parties. Overall, the Wraith is a cunning and dangerous undead creature that utilizes its abilities to weaken and control its enemies.</detail>
