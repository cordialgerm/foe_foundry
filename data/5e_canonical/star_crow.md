<MonsterName/>Star Crow</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Star Crow is a tiny aberration known for its unsettling features and arcane abilities. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is not particularly strong in combat but possesses unique strengths that can disrupt and manipulate foes. It has a natural armor granting it a decent Armor Class of 15, but its hit points are relatively low at just 12, making it vulnerable to damage. The Star Crow is exceptionally agile, boasting a Dexterity score of +3, which provides it with a good modifier for actions involving agility and stealth. Its special abilities, including Aberrant Resilience and Illumination, enhance its survivability and utility in both combat and exploration settings. While it can be a nuisance due to its ability to attach to opponents, it also has several weaknesses, particularly its low Strength and Intelligence scores.</summary>

<detail>

The Star Crow has the following attributes: Strength -2 (very bad), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +1 (average), Intelligence -5 (very bad), Wisdom +3 (good), and Charisma -5 (very bad). Its offensive capabilities rely primarily on its Dexterity and special abilities rather than brute force.

**Special Abilities:**

- **Aberrant Resilience:** This ability renders the Star Crow resistant to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, making it a tough opponent against spells and effects targeting these statuses. Additionally, it has the advantage on saving throws against spells or effects that would alter its form, which provides an exceptional defense against transformation and polymorph spells.

- **Illumination:** The Star Crow emits bright light within a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet. This ability can affect the stealth of creatures nearby as it can negate hiding spots in dim light.

**Actions:**

- **Radiant Touch:** The Star Crow can make a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. If the attack is successful, it deals 5 points of radiant damage and attaches itself to the target. While attached, the Star Crow can only use the Thought Share action and the Blinding Burst bonus action. It moves along with the target, complicating the target's movement and potentially restricting their options. Detaching requires 5 feet of movement, but the target can also expel the Star Crow by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.

- **Thought Share:** When attached to its target, the Star Crow can share thoughts, causing the target to experience flashbacks from other creatures the Star Crow has encountered. This action deals 5 psychic damage (2d4) to the target, and if the target fails a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, it is stunned until the end of its next turn. This ability can severely disrupt the target's ability to act.

**Bonus Actions:**

- **Blinding Burst (Recharge 5–6):** The Star Crow can create a blinding light burst, which requires a recharge roll. Each creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn. This can create tactical advantages in battle, potentially incapacitating multiple opponents.

The Star Crow’s combination of stealth, utility in combat, and unique psychic abilities make it an intriguing adversary or ally in any adventure. Its mobility and ability to inflict status effects can heavily influence the dynamics of a fight, especially at lower levels.</detail>
