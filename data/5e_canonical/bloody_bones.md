<summary>The Bloody Bones is a Medium-sized monstrosity characterized by its chaotic evil nature. Residing within the realm of horrors, it serves as a disturbing opponent in combat, leveraging both psychological and physical strategies to impose fear and inflict damage. It boasts a solid Armor Class of 13, allowing it to sustain some attacks while maintaining a health pool of 55 hit points, which translates to average durability for its Challenge Rating of 3, making it a notable threat to low-to-mid-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its powerful melee attacks and its ability to frighten enemies. However, its lower Dexterity limits its ability to doge attacks, and its Intelligence is particularly poor, indicating that it may struggle in complex scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes:
- Strength is 16, which provides a good modifier of +3, allowing for very good physical attacks.
- Dexterity is 12, granting a +1 modifier, which is average for agility and reflex-based tasks.
- Constitution is also 12, giving an average +1 modifier, allowing it to withstand some damage but not excelling in defense.
- Intelligence is notably low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, making it very bad at mental tasks and the use of complex spells.
- Wisdom is average at 10, which provides no modifier, making it neutral in many situations.
- Charisma is also neutral at 10, with no modifier, meaning it does not excel in social interactions.

The Bloody Bones has proficiency in deception with a +4 modifier, considered very good which helps it to deceive opponents effectively. It also has proficiency in stealth with a +3 modifier, deemed good for sneaking and ambushing targets. The creature has darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and a passive Perception score of 11, indicating average awareness. It does not speak any languages, yet it can engage in mimicry through its Horrific Imitation trait.

Special abilities enhance the Bloody Bones' threat in combat:
- The Horrifying Aura forces any hostile creature that begins its turn within 10 feet to pass a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn. A successful save grants immunity to this effect for 24 hours, creating a tactical disadvantage for any opponent within close proximity.
- Horrific Imitation allows the Bloody Bones to mimic a visible creature grotesquely. While this might confuse foes, they can discern the imitation with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check, meaning it has a mechanism for opponents to mitigate its psychological warfare.

Regarding actions:
- The creature can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two claw attacks and utilize its Dark Stare ability in place of one claw attack.
- The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and deals an average of 8 slashing damage, which is good for this tier of creature.
- The Dark Stare ability targets a creature up to 60 feet away, imposing a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in disadvantage on all attacks until the end of the creature's next turn, which can significantly hinder an opponent's effectiveness in combat.

Finally, as a reaction, Bloody Bones can utilize "Its Crown Runs Red." When hit by an attack, it regains 5 hit points and gains resistance to that specific damage type until the end of its next turn. This ability grants it additional sustainability in the heat of battle, exacerbating its longevity and ability to withstand incoming damage. Overall, the Bloody Bones poses a multifaceted challenge that combines physical prowess with psychological terror, ideal for players to encounter in campaigns exploring darker themes.</detail>
