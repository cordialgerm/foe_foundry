<MonsterName/>Swarm of Bats</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Swarm of Bats is a chaotic, flurry of small, nocturnal creatures that can overwhelm and disorient their prey. Found in caves, ruins, or forests, these swarms move with incredible speed, using their keen sense of echolocation to navigate the darkness. While individual bats are harmless, a swarm can be dangerous due to their numbers, as they bite and scratch in a frenzy. They are particularly troublesome in dark, confined spaces, where their collective movement creates confusion and panic. Swarms of Bats are often drawn to areas rich in insects or blood.</summary>
