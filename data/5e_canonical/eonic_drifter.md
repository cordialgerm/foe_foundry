<detail>

In terms of its attributes, the Eonic Drifter has a Strength score of 9 with a modifier of -1, which is poor and indicates it is physically weak. However, it possesses a Dexterity score of 14, granting a +2 modifier, which is good and aids its agility in combat. It also has a Constitution score of 14, leading to another +2 modifier, which is also good and contributes to its hit point total. The Drifter has an impressive Intelligence score of 18, resulting in a +4 modifier, which is exceptional for knowledge-based tasks. Its Wisdom is average, at 11 with no modifier, and it has a Charisma score of 13 with a +1 modifier, allowing for decent interactions with other characters.

The Eonic Drifter excels in Arcana and History skills, both at +6, indicating very good proficiency in these knowledge areas. Its passive perception is low at 10, so it might be less aware of surroundings compared to more perceptive creatures. The Drifter can communicate in several languages, including Common, Eonic, Giant, and Sylvan, enabling a variety of interactions.

In terms of actions, the Eonic Drifter has the ability called Time-Warping Staff, which allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit at a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 5 bludgeoning damage, with an additional 3 force damage. This combination can effectively deal a good amount of damage in combat.

The Drifter’s special ability, Drift Forward, has a recharge time of 5 to 6. It targets a creature it can see within 5 feet of its future self, who must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in 7 psychic damage and the target being pulled forward in time, disappearing along with the future self. Success halves the damage and negates the temporal displacement. This ability can significantly confuse and disrupt opponents as they reappear with disadvantage on their attack rolls, hampering their effectiveness in the following turn.

As a bonus action, the Eonic Drifter can use Call to the Future once per day. This summons a future version of itself to an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The future self can make one Time-Warping Staff attack or assist the Drifter each turn. Its stats make it somewhat durable, with an Armor Class of 13 and 30 hit points, alongside resistances to various damage types. If this future self is destroyed, the Eonic Drifter must pass a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or suffer being stunned on its next turn, adding a layer of risk to using this ability.</detail>

### Actions

- **Time-Warping Staff:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) force damage.
- **Drift Forward (Recharge 5–6):** The drifter chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of its future self. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage and is pulled forward in time. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn’t pulled forward in time. A target pulled forward in time disappears, along with the drifter’s future self, as the future self pulls the target with it. At the end of the drifter’s next turn, the target and the drifter’s future self reappear in the spaces they previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied spaces. When the target reappears, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn as it recovers from the disorienting experience.

### Bonus Actions

- **Call to the Future (1/Day):** The eonic drifter calls to a future version of itself, which appears in an unoccupied space the drifter can see within 30 feet of it. The drifter’s future self acts on the drifter’s turn, and each turn it makes one Time-Warping Staff attack against a creature of the drifter’s choice or uses the Help action to aid the drifter. The future self can be attacked and destroyed (AC 13; hp 30; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; immunity to poison and psychic damage), otherwise it remains until the drifter dismisses it as a bonus action or the drifter finishes a long rest. If the drifter’s future self is destroyed, the drifter must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
