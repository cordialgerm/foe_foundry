<detail>

In terms of core attributes, the Chaos Raptor possesses extraordinary Strength at 28, representing a modifier of +9, making its physical attacks highly effective. Its Constitution is also strong at 20 with a +5 modifier, contributing to its high resilience. However, the creature's Intelligence is very low at 5 (-3 modifier), indicating that it lacks cognitive abilities, and its Dexterity is average at 10 (0 modifier), showing no particular strengths or weaknesses in reflexes. Wisdom and Charisma are also average, both at 10 (0 modifier), indicating a balanced perception but no notable influence in social situations.

The Chaos Raptor has several notable special abilities that enhance its combat strategy. Its **Aura of Chaos** creates an area of unpredictable effects; any creature with an intelligence of 4 or higher that begins its turn within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the creature cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn and must roll a d8 to determine its actions, which can range from doing nothing to moving randomly or making a melee attack against a random target. The raptor can choose to activate this aura at the start of its turn.

The **Earth Glide** ability allows the raptor to move effortlessly through unworked earth or stone, providing tactical advantages by avoiding obstacles and surprising opponents. The **Keen Sight** trait gives it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, ensuring it can detect threats and movements effectively. Lastly, the **Regeneration** ability allows the raptor to regain 20 hit points at the start of its turn if at least half of its mass is buried in earth or stone; however, taking thunder damage prevents this regeneration for one turn. The raptor can only die if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and does not regenerate.

In combat, the Chaos Raptor can make use of its **Multiattack**, which allows it to perform one Beak attack and one Talons attack per turn. The **Beak** attack has a +14 to hit, with a significant damage output of 27 (4d8+9) piercing damage. The **Talons** attack also has a +14 to hit and deals 23 (4d6+9) slashing damage, additionally grappling the target on a successful hit with an escape DC of 18. This grappled condition restrains the target, preventing it from moving freely and hindering its actions while the raptor can focus on its primary target. Overall, the Chaos Raptor is a versatile and dangerous foe that can manipulate both the battlefield and its opponents with chaos and brute strength.</detail>
