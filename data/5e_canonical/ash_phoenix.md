<summary>The Ash Phoenix is a formidable Large Undead creature with a neutral evil alignment, making it a significant threat to adventurers. It boasts an impressive Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 105, drawn from 14d10+28, allowing it to endure considerable punishment in combat. The creature has a flying speed of 90 feet, enabling it to maneuver with grace, while its ability to hover allows it to stay in one place without needing to land. However, its Challenge Rating of 9 indicates that it is a high-level foe, earning a substantial 5,000 experience points upon defeat. The Ash Phoenix exhibits notable strengths, including its high Dexterity and stealth capabilities, making it hard to detect and hit, while weaknesses include its vulnerability to radiant damage and reliance on dim lighting for effective stealth.</summary>

<detail>

The Ash Phoenix's attributes include a Strength score of 17, providing a good modifier of +3, indicating above-average physical power. Its Dexterity score of 20 grants an exceptional +5 modifier, allowing it to excel in agility and evasion. With a Constitution of 15, it has a good +2 modifier for resilience against endurance challenges, while its Intelligence is quite low at 8, resulting in a bad -1 modifier, making it less effective in tasks requiring reasoning. The creature has an above-average Wisdom score of 14, translating to a good +2 modifier that helps it resist certain effects, while its Charisma of 9 results in a poor -1 modifier, indicating a lack of influence over others.

The Ash Phoenix is equipped with several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and resilience. The False Appearance ability allows it to blend seamlessly into its surroundings when motionless while hovering, disguising itself as harmless ash. Its Rejuvenation capability is particularly dangerous; if it is destroyed and its birth site remains unpurified, it can regenerate a new body within 1d10 days, returning fully healed and ready for battle. With Shadow Stealth, the Ash Phoenix can hide in dim lighting or darkness as a bonus action, enhancing its ability to ambush unsuspecting foes. However, in areas with strong winds of at least 20 miles per hour, it suffers a disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, reflecting its vulnerability in turbulent conditions.

In combat, the Ash Phoenix utilizes a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two Ash Talon attacks against a target. If both attacks successfully hit the same target, it can plunge its beak into them, imposing a DC 16 Strength saving throw. Failure results in the target taking 7 necrotic damage, while the Ash Phoenix heals for half of the damage dealt. The Ash Talons deal significant melee damage with an attack bonus of +8 to hit, dealing 14 slashing damage plus an additional 7 fire damage upon a successful hit. The Ash Storm ability, which requires a recharge on a roll of 5-6, unleashes a devastating blast of ash in a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught within must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 necrotic damage and becoming blinded on a fail, or suffering half damage without the blindness on a success. This ability can dramatically affect the battlefield by hindering multiple enemies at once, creating opportunities for the Ash Phoenix and its allies.</detail>

On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded.
