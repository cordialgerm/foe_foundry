<summary>The Cave Goat is a small, unaligned beast known for its agility and robust climbing capabilities. This creature possesses a moderate Armor Class of 11, making it relatively easy to hit, while its pool of 22 hit points, derived from rolling 4d6 and adding 8, provides a decent buffer against damage. It has a movement speed of 50 feet, allowing it to traverse terrain quickly. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is considered a minor threat in combat situations, typically yielding 50 experience points when defeated. The Cave Goat's strengths lie in its physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, which enhance its resilience and ability to climb. However, its mental attributes are notably low, indicating that it lacks cognitive capabilities, which reflects its behavior as a beast rather than a sentient creature.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Cave Goat include a Strength score of 14 with a +2 modifier, indicating a good level of physical power, a Dexterity score of 13 providing a modest +1 modifier, which contributes to its agility. The Constitution score of 15 lends a good +2 modifier, enhancing its hit points and survival in combat. Intelligence is exceptionally low at 2, resulting in a -4 modifier, indicating very bad cognitive functioning. Wisdom is average at 10 with a +0 modifier, and Charisma is also low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, suggesting that the creature is not socially adept.

The Cave Goat has two notable special abilities. Keen Hearing grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing, making it adept at detecting sounds in its environment. Sturdy Climber allows the Cave Goat to enjoy advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks when climbing rocky surfaces, reflecting its natural adaptation to rugged terrains.

In terms of actions, the Cave Goat can perform a melee attack called Ram. This action allows it to make a weapon attack with a +4 to hit, which is a good modifier for hitting targets in close quarters. It has a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to engage nearby opponents, and on a successful hit, it deals 4 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 1d4 plus its Strength modifier of +2. This makes the Ram attack a reliable option for the Cave Goat in combat, especially when it can leverage its climbing ability to maneuver effectively around the battlefield.</detail>
