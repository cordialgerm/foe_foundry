The spell "Flame Strike" creates a column of divine flame that requires a Dexterity saving throw, causing fire and radiant damage, while "Fire Storm" unleashes flames in a large area, also having devastating effects on objects and terrain. 

The "Holy Aura" spell provides a significant defensive advantage by giving targets within a 30-foot radius advantage on saving throws, while also imposing disadvantage on attacks against them. Additionally, any fiend or undead hitting a target is at risk of being blinded. The Archpriest can also use "Divine Word," which has effects that can incapacitate or even kill enemies based on their current hit points, significantly changing the tide of battle in its favor.
