<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>Duergar, also known as gray dwarves, are grim, stony-skinned dwarves who live deep underground. Their complexion is ashen, and their eyes glow with a faint red light, adapted to the darkness of the Underdark. Duergar are highly industrious and militaristic, often enslaving other creatures to work in their vast mines and forges. They possess the ability to turn invisible or grow to giant size, making them dangerous opponents in battle. Duergar society is harsh and oppressive, ruled by strict hierarchies, and they are known for their bitter enmity toward surface-dwelling dwarves. They are dour, cruel, and focused solely on expanding their subterranean empire.</summary>

<summary>The Duergar, a medium humanoid, is a formidable opponent that often serves as a cunning warrior or a stealthy ambusher within the game. With an armor class of 16 due to its scale mail and shield, it can withstand a fair amount of damage. The Duergar has 36 hit points, indicating a moderate level of resilience in battle. Its movement speed is 25 feet, which is average for humanoids. With a challenge rating of 1, the Duergar is an approachable threat for lower-level adventurers. Notable strengths include its darkvision, which allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light up to 120 feet, and its abilities to resist being charmed or paralyzed. However, Duergar have a weakness to sunlight, suffering disadvantages on attack rolls and lowered perception while exposed. </summary>

<detail>

The Duergar's attributes include a Strength of +2, Dexterity of +0, Constitution of +2, Intelligence of +0, Wisdom of +0, and Charisma of -1. The Strength and Constitution modifiers are good, allowing for effective melee combat and decent durability. The Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom modifiers are average, meaning the Duergar is neither particularly nimble nor wise, while the negative Charisma modifier is very bad, reflecting its lack of social prowess.

In terms of special abilities, the Duergar has several advantages and unique traits. Duergar Resilience grants resistance to charmed and paralyzed conditions and advantage on saving throws against spells and illusions, making it exceptionally resilient in magical encounters. The Reduce ability allows the Duergar to end the enlarged effect at the start of its turn without using an action, giving it flexibility in combat. However, it is also affected by Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on attacks and drastically reduces its perception when in sunlight.

The Duergar has access to various actions. For melee combat, it wields a War Pick with a +4 to hit and deals 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, increasing to 11 (2d8 + 2) damage when enlarged. It can also use a Javelin either in melee or ranged combat with the same +4 to hit, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage normally and 9 (2d6 + 2) while enlarged. 

For its special actions, the Duergar can turn invisible, allowing it to escape attention until it attacks or uses its Enlarge ability. This invisibility extends to all its equipment, making tactical retreats or surprise attacks easier for it. As a bonus action, the Duergar can enlarge itself, assuming a Large size, which doubles the damage dice on its weapon attacks and grants it advantage on Strength checks and saves, a feature that makes it exceptionally dangerous in combat. If it lacks sufficient space to enlarge, the action will fail.

Additionally, Duergar can use the Shield Wall reaction to increase their armor class by 2 against an incoming weapon attack, showcasing their defensive capabilities, particularly when fighting alongside other Duergar. This ability enhances their tactical presence when in groups and highlights their teamwork.

Overall, the Duergar is a well-rounded humanoid capable of adapting its combat style through size alteration and stealth tactics while maintaining a solid defense and moderate damage output, making it a versatile foe in any encounter.</detail>
