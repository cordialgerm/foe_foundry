<detail>

The Vampire Mage has the following ability scores: Strength is 20 with a +5 modifier, which is very good, Dexterity is 18 with a +4 modifier, which is good, Constitution is 20 with a +5 modifier, which is very good, Intelligence is 16 with a +3 modifier, which is average, Wisdom is 16 with a +3 modifier, which is average, and Charisma is 18 with a +4 modifier, which is good. The saving throws for the Vampire Mage are Dexterity +8, Wisdom +7, and Charisma +8, all of which are good. It possesses skills in perception at +7, persuasion at +8, and stealth at +8, indicating exceptional capabilities in manipulation and evasion. The creature has damage resistances against necrotic damage and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, making it more difficult to harm. Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 17, which is also good. The Vampire Mage can speak the languages it knew in life.

The Vampire Mage exhibits several special abilities. It has Legendary Resistance (3/day), allowing it to succeed on a failed saving throw, but it visibly ages each time it does this, reverting to its original appearance after a long rest. Misty Recovery allows the Vampire Mage to turn into mist when it drops to 0 hit points, instead of becoming unconscious, and it must return to its resting place within 2 hours to recover. Regeneration enables it to regain 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it did not take radiant damage since its last turn, which is exceptional. The Spider Climb ability allows the vampire to traverse difficult surfaces and even ceilings. However, it has weaknesses, such as taking 20 radiant damage if it ends its turn in sunlight or running water, and it cannot use its Regeneration or Mist Form abilities while affected by these weaknesses. The Resting Place is a required lair feature, where the vampire needs to rest for at least an hour each day, and if disturbed by spells like bless or hallow, it can be destroyed. 

In terms of spellcasting, the Vampire Mage serves as a 7th level spellcaster with an Intelligence-based spellcasting ability, having a spell save DC of 15. Its spells include cantrips such as mage hand and minor illusion, which provide utility in manipulation and deception. At the 1st level, it can cast disguise self to alter its appearance and shield to improve its defense. Its 2nd-level spells include darkness, which creates an area of magical darkness, and misty step, allowing it to teleport short distances. At the 3rd level, it can cast animate dead to raise undead minions and fireball, a powerful area damage spell that deals fire damage to targets in its area of effect. Lastly, the Vampire Mage can use blight as a 4th-level spell to drain the life energy from a target, dealing significant necrotic damage.

During combat, the Vampire Mage utilizes various actions. The Grab attack allows it to inflict melee weapon damage while grappling a target, which becomes restrained and vulnerable to further attacks. The Charm ability can incapacitate a creature for 24 hours, making it a willingly targeted victim for its bite. Additionally, the Vampire Mage can unleash a fireball on opponents using a well-spaced attack that forces creatures to make a Dexterity saving throw to reduce the damage taken. The blight spell is particularly devastating against living creatures and plants, requiring a Constitution saving throw to mitigate damage.

Bonus actions include the Bite, a powerful attack that deals piercing and necrotic damage and can reduce the target's hit point maximum while healing the Vampire Mage. The Hissing Scuttle reaction allows the Vampire Mage to escape a situation following radiant damage taken, while Warding Charm can preemptively charm an attacker. The Shield reaction provides a momentary defensive boost to its AC and immunity to magic missiles.

Legendary actions are additional ways the Vampire Mage can act outside its turn, allowing it to use Charm or make a Grab attack or transform into mist or a beast shape, enhancing its versatility and survivability in combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it visibly grows older. Its original appearance is restored when it finishes a long rest.
- **Misty Recovery:** When the vampire drops to 0 hit points, instead of falling unconscious, it turns into mist as if it had used the Mist Form legendary action. It can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to vampire form and is paralyzed for 1 hour, at which time it regains 1 hit point. While paralyzed in this way, it can be destroyed by fire damage, radiant damage, damage from a magical weapon, or a wooden stake driven through the heart, but it is otherwise immune to damage.
- **Regeneration:** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and hasnt taken radiant damage since its last turn.
- **Spider Climb:** The vampire can climb even on difficult surfaces and upside down on ceilings.
- **Vampire Weaknesses:** Vampires most common weaknesses are sunlight and running water. When the vampire ends its turn in contact with one of its weaknesses (such as being bathed in sunlight or running water), it takes 20 radiant damage. While in contact with its weakness, it can't use its Regeneration trait or its Mist Form or Shapechange actions.
- **Resting Place:** Every vampires lair contains a resting place, usually a coffin or sarcophagus, where the vampire must rest for at least an hour each day to recuperate its powers. This resting place is sprinkled with soil from its mortal homeland. If this soil is scattered or is subjected to a bless, hallow, or similar spell, the vampire is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.
- **Spellcasting:** The vampire is a 7th level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It has the following wizard spells prepared:
 Cantrips (at will): mage hand
 minor illusion
 1st-level (4 slots): disguise self
 shield
 2nd-level (3 slots): darkness
 misty step
 3rd-level (3 slots): animate dead
 fireball
 4th-level (1 slot): blight

### Actions

- **Grab (Vampire Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained while grappled in this way.
- **Charm:** The vampire targets a creature within 30 feet  forcing it to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the target is charmed by the vampire for 24 hours. While charmed it regards the vampire as a trusted friend and is a willing target for the vampires bite. The target repeats the saving throw each time it takes damage  ending the effect on itself on a success. If the targets saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it  it is immune to this vampires Charm for 24 hours.
- **Fireball (3rd-Level; V, S, M):** Fire streaks from the vampire to a point within 120 feet and explodes in a 20-foot radius  spreading around corners. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw  taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
- **Blight (4th-Level; V, S):** The vampire targets a living creature or plant within 30 feet  draining moisture and vitality from it. The target makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw  taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Plant creatures have disadvantage on their saving throw and take maximum damage. A nonmagical plant dies.

### Bonus Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target that is grappled, incapacitated, restrained, willing, or unaware of the vampires presence. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The targets hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt, and the vampire regains this number of hit points. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, it dies and rises the following night as a vampire spawn in the vampires thrall. Before the target first rises as a vampire spawn, a bless, gentle repose, or similar spell cast on the body prevents this transformation.

### Reactions

- **Hissing Scuttle (1/Day):** When the vampire takes radiant damage, it moves up to its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Warding Charm (1/Day):** When a creature the vampire can see targets it with a melee attack but before the attack is made, the vampire uses Charm on that creature.
- **Shield (1st-Level; V:** When the vampire is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, it gains a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of its next turn.



### Legendary Actions

- **The vampire can take 1 legendary action:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Blood Charm:** The vampire uses Charm. A creature makes its initial saving throw with disadvantage if the vampire has hit it with a bite attack within the last 24 hours.
- **Grab:** The vampire makes a grab attack.
- **Mist Form:** The vampire transforms into a mist or back into its true form. As mist, the vampire has a flying speed of 30, can't speak, can't take actions or manipulate objects, is immune to nonmagical damage from weapons, and has advantage on saving throws and Stealth checks. It can pass through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing but can't pass through water. Anything its carrying transforms with it.
- **Shapechange:** The vampire transforms into the shape of a Medium or smaller beast or back into its true form. While transformed, it has the beasts size and movement modes. It can't use reactions or legendary actions, and can't speak. Otherwise, it uses the vampires statistics. Anything its carrying transforms with it.
