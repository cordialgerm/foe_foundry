<summary>A Worg is a large, malevolent wolf-like creature with a cunning intellect and a taste for flesh. Unlike ordinary wolves, Worgs are capable of speech and often ally with goblins or orcs, serving as mounts or hunting companions. They are vicious predators that enjoy the thrill of the hunt, using their size and strength to overpower their prey. Worgs are often found in the wild, where they terrorize travelers and settlements. Their sharp teeth and powerful jaws make them deadly foes in combat, and their intelligence allows them to devise ambushes and traps.</summary>

A **worg** is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to speak Common as well.
