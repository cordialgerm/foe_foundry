<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Cauldronborn is a small construct that embodies a unique blend of magical abilities and specialized skills, making it an intriguing encounter for adventurers. Its unaligned nature means it doesn't lean towards good or evil, allowing it to pursue its goals without moral constraints. With a challenge rating of 2, its strengths lie in its ability to consume potions, enhance its health, and detect magical items, while its weaknesses include low Dexterity and Charisma scores, which make it relatively ineffective in social interactions and susceptible to attacks that require agility. The Cauldronborn can serve as a formidable opponent, especially in environments rich with potions and magical items, potentially overwhelming players with its ability to consume potions and heal itself while simultaneously fighting.</summary>

<detail>

The Cauldronborn has an Armor Class (AC) of 13, which provides moderate defense, and a total of 13 Hit Points, calculated with a roll of 3d6 plus an additional 3, giving it an average survivability in combat. Its movement speed is limited to 20 feet per turn, making it relatively slow. The attributes of the Cauldronborn are as follows: Strength is 14 with a plus 2 modifier, which is good for melee attacks; Dexterity is 7 with a minus 2 modifier, which is bad and hinders its agility; Constitution is 12 with a plus 1 modifier, making it average in resilience; Intelligence is 3 with a minus 4 modifier, resulting in very bad cognitive capabilities; Wisdom is 6 with a minus 2 modifier, reflecting its bad perception of situations; and Charisma is 1 with a minus 5 modifier, which is exceptionally poor for any social interactions.

In terms of resistances and immunities, the Cauldronborn is immune to poison damage and resistant to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that are not made with adamantine. It is also immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. It can see in the dark up to 60 feet and has a passive perception score of 8, allowing it to notice threats nearby, albeit poorly. The Cauldronborn does not understand any languages.

The special abilities of the Cauldronborn enhance its potency in combat and exploration. Its "Consumption" ability allows it to consume a potion within 5 feet as a bonus action, granting it the effects of the potion while increasing its hit point maximum by 3 and regaining corresponding hit points. "Detect Elixir" enables it to pinpoint potions and magic items within a 60-foot radius, and it can sense potions up to a mile away to a lesser degree. Its "Regeneration" ability allows it to regain 2 hit points at the start of its turn, provided it has at least 1 hit point, making it a resilient opponent. Additionally, "Sprint" allows the Cauldronborn to triple its movement speed toward a detected potion for a brief duration, enhancing its mobility when pursuing magical items.

In combat, the Cauldronborn can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two slam attacks against targets. These are melee weapon attacks with a +4 to hit, and if successful, they deal 7 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 2d4 plus its Strength modifier. The "Call Potion" ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, lets the Cauldronborn release a screech that magically compels nearby potions to move towards it. Creatures that are wearing or carrying potions must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to prevent their potions from being pulled within 5 feet of the Cauldronborn, which could be a significant strategic advantage in combat scenarios. Each potion requires a separate saving throw from the target for every potion they attempt to protect, making it a potentially overwhelming effect in the right circumstances.</detail>
