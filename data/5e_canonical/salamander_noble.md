<detail>

The Salamander Noble has an Armor Class of 15, which offers a good level of defense against attacks. Its hit points total 136, calculated from 16d12 plus an additional 32, making it a very durable opponent in battle. This creature possesses the following ability scores: Strength 18 (+4), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 12 (+1). The high Strength value indicates exceptional physical capabilities, while its Constitution gives it good resilience. It has saving throw bonuses of +5 for Constitution and +3 for Wisdom, providing quite effective defenses against various effects, specifically concerning physical resilience and effects that target mental fortitude. The Salamander Noble also has immunity to fire damage, resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons, darkvision with a range of 60 feet, and a passive perception score of 10, allowing it to see in darkness and discern its surroundings. It can communicate in the Ignan language.

One of the key special abilities of the Salamander Noble is its Heated Body trait. This trait allows it to deal fire damage to any creature that starts its turn grappled by it, touches it, or strikes it in melee while within 5 feet, inflicting 7 (2d6) fire damage—though this damage can only occur once per turn. Notably, this trait becomes ineffective if the Salamander has taken cold damage since its last turn, making it crucial for opponents to leverage cold attacks to mitigate the Salamander's damage output.

In terms of actions available during its turn, the Salamander Noble can perform a Multiattack, making one tail attack and one pike attack each round. For its tail attack, it rolls a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, has a reach of 10 feet, and on a hit, it deals 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target of this attack is also subjected to the Heated Body damage and grappled with an escape DC of 15. While grappled, the target is restrained, enabling the Salamander Noble to automatically hit with its tail attack each round as long as the grapple persists.

Furthermore, the Pike attack is another melee weapon attack, also with a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage, plus an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage, effectively combining multiple types of damage in one assault.

As a powerful area attack, the Salamander Noble possesses the Fire Breath ability, allowing it to exhale fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature caught within this area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes significant damage of 21 (6d6) fire damage, while a successful save results in only half damage. This area effect can dramatically alter the dynamics of a battlefield, forcing characters to react quickly to the threat of fire damage.</detail>
