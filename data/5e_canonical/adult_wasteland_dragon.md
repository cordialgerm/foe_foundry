<summary>The Adult Wasteland Dragon is a formidable creature known for its chaotic evil alignment. This huge dragon serves as a powerful antagonist in any campaign, capable of decimating foes with its impressive physical abilities and devastating breath attack. It boasts notable strengths, including high hit points, substantial melee damage output, a powerful breath weapon, and resistance to certain forms of damage, making it a challenging opponent. However, its relatively low Dexterity and reliance on strength and constitution can be considered weaknesses. This dragon's ability to instill fear among its enemies is complemented by its legendary resistances, making it a powerful force on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Wasteland Dragon has an Armor Class of 18, representing good protection due to its natural armor. It possesses 225 hit points, calculated from rolling 18d12 and adding 108, indicating exceptional durability for withstanding attacks. Its Speed attributes include burrowing at 30 feet, climbing at 40 feet, flying at 70 feet, and walking at 40 feet, allowing for great versatility in movement. The Challenge Rating is 17, which means it is intended for a party of high-level adventurers and offers 18,000 experience points upon defeat.

The dragon's attributes include a Strength of 26 (+8), which is exceptional, granting it significant power in melee combat, a Dexterity of 10 (+0), which is average, affecting its agility and finesse, a Constitution of 21 (+5), indicating very good resilience, an Intelligence of 14 (+2), showing it can think strategically during battle, a Wisdom of 13 (+1), which is average, and a Charisma of 16 (+3), representing its strong presence and ability to intimidate. It has saving throw proficiencies in Dexterity (+6) and Constitution (+11), both of which are exceptional, enhancing its survivability. Skills are specialized in Perception (+6) and Stealth (+5), which are both good, allowing it to detect hidden foes and move quietly when necessary. The dragon has damage immunity to force damage, which can be crucial in specific encounters, and possesses a range of senses including blindsight at 60 feet, darkvision at 120 feet, and a passive Perception score of 16. It communicates in Common and Draconic.

One of the dragon's prominent special abilities is Legendary Resistance, which it can use three times per day. This ability allows the dragon to choose to succeed on a saving throw it would otherwise fail, making it extremely difficult to incapacitate through magic or other effects.

In terms of actions during combat, the Adult Wasteland Dragon can execute a Multiattack, which includes its Frightful Presence ability. This requires each creature within 120 feet to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute, creating a tense atmosphere as characters may become immobilized by fear. The dragon can then attack three times per round: it can perform a Bite attack, rolling with a plus 12 to hit and dealing an average of 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage; two Claw attacks, also with a plus 12 to hit, each dealing an average of 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage; and a Tail attack dealing an average of 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

The Warped Energy Breath is a powerful 60-foot line attack that requires creatures in the area to succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 49 (11d8) force damage, with half damage for a successful save. This ability can drastically affect the combat landscape by potentially decimating a group of adventurers caught in its path.

Additionally, the dragon has three legendary actions it can use to manipulate the flow of battle. These include a Detect action, allowing it to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, a Tail Attack to strike with its tail, and a Wing Attack that costs two actions, inflicting damage on creatures within 10 feet and knocking them prone, while allowing the dragon to reposition strategically by flying up to half its flying speed. This adaptability makes the Adult Wasteland Dragon a challenging and dynamic opponent in any encounter.</detail>
