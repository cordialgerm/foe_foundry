<summary>Grimlocks are blind, humanoid creatures that dwell deep in the Underdark. Their pale, gray skin is leathery and scarred, and they rely on their keen sense of smell and hearing to hunt and navigate the pitch-black tunnels where they live. Grimlocks are savage and primitive, often traveling in packs to ambush their prey. Despite their lack of sight, they are skilled hunters, using their other senses to detect movement and sound. They are known for their brutal combat tactics, favoring crude weapons like clubs or stone axes to bludgeon their enemies.</summary>
