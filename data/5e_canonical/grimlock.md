<Subtype/>grimlock</Subtype>
<summary>Grimlocks are blind, humanoid creatures that dwell deep in the Underdark. Their pale, gray skin is leathery and scarred, and they rely on their keen sense of smell and hearing to hunt and navigate the pitch-black tunnels where they live. Grimlocks are savage and primitive, often traveling in packs to ambush their prey. Despite their lack of sight, they are skilled hunters, using their other senses to detect movement and sound. They are known for their brutal combat tactics, favoring crude weapons like clubs or stone axes to bludgeon their enemies.</summary>

<summary>The Grimlock is a medium humanoid creature that serves as a stealthy combatant adept at ambush tactics. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is considered a low-level threat, making it suitable for early encounters for adventurers. Its notable strengths include decent physical attributes, particularly its strength, dexterity, and constitution, all set at 14, which provides it a good modifier of +2 in relevant checks. While it has vulnerabilities due to its poor charisma and average wisdom, its ability to remain hidden in rocky terrains through camouflage and its keen senses gives it a tactical edge in combat situations. Despite its low hit points at 13, making it somewhat fragile, its melee and ranged capabilities allow it to inflict decent damage on adversaries.</summary>

<detail>

The Grimlock has the following attributes: strength 14 (+2), dexterity 14 (+2), constitution 14 (+2), intelligence 14 (+2), wisdom 10 (+0), and charisma 8 (-1). Its armor class is relatively low at 12, signifying it is not very good at avoiding attacks, placing it at a disadvantage in defensive situations. For its skills, the Grimlock excels in athletics with a +4 modifier, stealth with a +4 modifier, and engineering with a +4 modifier, making it very good in physical endeavors. It has a passive perception of 14, relying heavily on its keen hearing and smell to detect hidden threats, allowing it to be very effective in scouting and ambush scenarios while being immune to blindness.

In terms of actions, the Grimlock can attack with a spiked club, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and deals a total of 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 2 (1d4) piercing damage on a successful hit. For grappling, it employs a move called Throttle, which allows it to inflict the same amount of damage while also grappling the target with an escape DC of 12, preventing the victim from breathing. Additionally, it can attack at a distance using a sling, with the same +4 to hit and similar damage output of 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

The Grimlock also possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. With Camouflage, it receives advantage on Stealth checks made to hide in rocky terrain, effectively allowing it to blend in with the environment and ambush unsuspecting foes. Moreover, it boasts Keen Hearing and Smell, granting it advantage on Perception checks that rely on these senses, making it a formidable opponent for any adventurer trying to sneak past or deceive it. Overall, the Grimlock's blend of physical prowess and stealth capabilities makes it a versatile enemy in the subterranean realms it inhabits.

The Grimlock is a Medium humanoid creature who excels in stealth and perception, especially in rocky environments where it can camouflage effectively. It possesses a fair amount of physical strength and can deal moderate damage with its melee attacks, but it is somewhat limited in its magical abilities. While its defenses are weak, with an armor class of only 11 and 17 hit points, its keen senses allow it to detect prey easily. The Grimlock's abilities make it a cunning adversary, particularly in ambush scenarios, but its lack of defense and limited range capabilities make it vulnerable in direct confrontations.

The Grimlock has the following attributes: Strength of +3 indicating a good physical ability, Dexterity of +1 which is average, Constitution of +1 which is also average, Intelligence of -1 reflecting a very bad intellect, Wisdom of +1 providing an average sense of awareness, and Charisma of -2 which shows a very bad ability to interact socially. The combination of these attributes gives the Grimlock a base perception score of 11, but when utilizing its heightened senses for hearing or smell, its perception increases to 16, which is exceptional. In terms of stealth, the Grimlock has a score of 13, but in rocky terrain, this improves significantly to 18, which is very good.

One of the notable special abilities of the Grimlock is Heightened Hearing and Smell, which allows it to perceive its environment much more clearly, making it a threat in dimly lit or obscured conditions. However, if the Grimlock is deafened or unable to smell, its keensense is suppressed, significantly limiting its awareness and tactical options. Additionally, its Stone Camouflage makes it highly effective at hiding in rocky areas, granting it a major advantage when trying to ambush unsuspecting foes.

In combat, the Grimlock makes melee attacks using its Spiked Club, which has an attack modifier of +5 to hit, allowing for a good chance of hitting an opponent. On a successful hit, the Grimlock deals 5 points of bludgeoning damage plus an extra 2 points of piercing damage, making its overall damage output moderate.

The Grimlock also possesses unique bonus actions through its Strange Bauble ability. This allows it to throw a small object at a creature within 30 feet. It can choose from three different objects, each with its own effect:
- The **Flashing Rock** bursts with colors and can blind a target if they fail a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw until the end of their next turn.
- The **Illusory Dancer** creates a mesmerizing illusion that can incapacitate a target on a failed DC 11 Charisma saving throw.
- The **Whirling Death** is a threatening illusion that can frighten a target if they fail a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, creating a moment of fear until the end of their next turn, unless they succeed and realize the illusion.

Overall, the Grimlock is a creature that relies on stealth, awareness, and clever tactics to overcome its physical limitations in combat.</detail>
