<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Skeletal Champion is a Medium undead creature that serves as a formidable opponent in combat, especially noted for its resilience and attack capabilities. With a challenge rating of 3, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, especially those who are unprepared for its particular defenses. This undead warrior is well-rounded, boasting a good Armor Class of 15 and 58 hit points, making it a robust foe in battle. Its strengths lie primarily in its physical attributes, particularly strength and dexterity, both rated at +3, indicating above-average combat proficiency. However, it is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, which can be a crucial weakness for adventurers to exploit. Its undead nature grants it immunity to poison damage and conditions such as fatigue and being poisoned, which further enhances its durability in encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Skeletal Champion has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 6 (-2), Wisdom 8 (-1), and Charisma 5 (-3). Its saving throws reflect notable strengths with +5 in Strength and Dexterity, and +4 in Constitution, indicating good resilience against various effects targeting these attributes. Its skills do not provide any additional bonuses, but it has a darkvision of 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and a passive Perception score of 9, which is average in terms of noticing hidden threats. The creature understands the languages it knew in life, but it cannot communicate verbally, which may limit its tactical options during encounters.

Special abilities include "Undead Nature," indicating that the Skeletal Champion does not require air, food, or sleep, allowing it to persist indefinitely without the basic needs of living beings. This ability makes it particularly relentless in its pursuits.

In terms of actions, the Skeletal Champion can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike with two melee attacks in a single turn. The melee weapon attack uses a longsword with a +5 to hit, delivering 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage on a successful hit, making it a consistent threat in close quarters. Additionally, it can use a "Heavy Crossbow" for ranged attacks, which also has a +5 to hit and inflicts 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage, allowing it to engage opponents from a distance.

The Skeletal Champion possesses a reaction called "Shielding Riposte." When a creature within its reach misses with a melee attack against it or a nearby ally, the Skeletal Champion can respond by making a longsword attack against that creature. This ability not only provides retaliatory damage but can also shift the dynamics of combat as it punishes enemies for their misses, potentially deterring aggressive melee behavior against it or its allies.</detail>
