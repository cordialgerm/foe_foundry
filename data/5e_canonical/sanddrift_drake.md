<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>The Sanddrift Drake is a formidable dragon-type creature that thrives in sandy environments, exhibiting both agility and resilience. With a large frame and natural armor giving it a solid Armor Class of 16, it is quite difficult to hit. The drake possesses a hefty pool of 102 hit points, making it capable of sustaining considerable damage during encounters. It is strong in Dexterity and Constitution, granting it good saving throws and skill-based actions. However, its intelligence and charisma are notably low, making it less effective in situations involving mental acuity or persuasion. The Sanddrift Drake's notable abilities include its proficiency in stealth and its capacity to burrow through sand, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting foes. While it is immune to fire damage, it does take reduced damage from poison, and it boasts an array of dangerous attacks and abilities that make it a significant threat in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Sanddrift Drake are as follows: It has a Strength of 13, which provides a modest modifier of +1, indicating average power in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity is notably high at 19 with a +4 modifier, which is very good, allowing it to excel in stealth and agility. The Constitution score of 17 gives it a +3 modifier, reflecting good resilience to damage. Intelligence sits at a lowly 7 with a -2 modifier (very bad), indicating a lack of mental prowess. The Wisdom score is 15, providing a +2 modifier (good), useful in perception and awareness. Lastly, the Charisma is also low at 7 with a -2 modifier (very bad), impacting social interactions.

The Sanddrift Drake has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in sneaky situations. Its Desert Camouflage ability grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in sandy terrain, making it exceptionally adept at ambush tactics in its native environment. The Sand Glide ability allows the drake to burrow through nonmagical sand and worked earth without disturbing the surrounding material, making it an effective predator that can evade detection while moving through its habitat.

In terms of actions, the Sanddrift Drake can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks in one turn: one bite and two claw strikes. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 13 piercing damage (2d8 + 4). Additionally, it forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target’s speed is halved for 1 minute. If the target is already suffering from a speed reduction and fails the save, it becomes paralyzed for the same duration, with the chance to repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. The Claw attack also has a +7 to hit and deals 11 slashing damage (2d6 + 4), hitting an adjacent target within reach.

The Heatwave Breath is a powerful breath weapon that requires a recharge of 6 turns. When activated, the Sanddrift Drake exhales superheated air in a 30-foot cone, compelling every creature in that area to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature that fails the throw takes 21 fire damage (6d6) while those who succeed take half damage. Additionally, if a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it suffers one level of exhaustion, adding to the tactical challenges presented by this drake in combat.</detail>
