<summary>The Wind Witch is a Large chaotic evil Plant creature that poses a unique threat to adventurers with its ability to fly and its cunning use of fire-based attacks. It has a Challenge Rating of 3 and offers 700 experience points upon defeat. With an Armor Class of 13 and 66 hit points, it can withstand a respectable amount of damage. Its strongest abilities stem from its interactions with fire, making it a dangerous opponent when ignited. However, it suffers from very low Strength and Intelligence scores, indicating it is not physically strong nor particularly clever. Its primary strengths are its Dexterity, allowing it to be nimble and evasive, and its ability to regenerate and transform into an inanimate form under certain conditions. The Wind Witch thrives in environments conducive to flight and fire, while it also possesses resistances that can make traditional forms of attack less effective against it.</summary>

<detail>

The Wind Witch has the following attributes: 

- Strength: 6, with a modifier of -2, indicating very bad physical strength. 
- Dexterity: 16, with a modifier of +3, which translates to good agility and reflexes. 
- Constitution: 12, with a modifier of +1, reflecting an average resilience to physical challenges.
- Intelligence: 6, with a modifier of -2, indicating very bad cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 11, with a modifier of +0, reflecting an average insight and perception.
- Charisma: 8, with a modifier of -1, resulting in bad presence and social influence. 

It has saving throw bonuses of +5 for Dexterity and +5 for Constitution, giving it a good chance to avoid effects like spells or traps that rely on these attributes. The Wind Witch has a passive Perception of 12, which is average for detecting hidden creatures or objects.

The creature’s special abilities are noteworthy:
- Cursed Plant: If the Wind Witch is reduced to 0 hit points, it transforms into a tumbleweed that travels on the wind, regaining 5 hit points every hour until it regains consciousness, unless it was damaged by fire in the same round or destroyed. This ability allows it to escape defeat if not dealt with swiftly.
- Flammable: If the Wind Witch takes fire damage, it catches fire, taking 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns and continues to burn until it receives cold damage or is submerged in water. Any creature that touches it or attacks it in melee while it is burning also takes 3 (1d6) fire damage, making close combat a risky endeavor. Additionally, it deals extra fire damage while burning.
- Tumbleweed Form: This ability allows the Wind Witch to enter a hostile creature's space and halt movement there, making it particularly effective at engaging with its opponents.

In combat, the Wind Witch can perform the following actions:
- Multiattack: It can make two Slam attacks or one Slam attack combined with its Capture ability.
- Slam: This melee attack has a +5 to hit, reaches 5 feet, and deals 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage and 4 (1d8) piercing damage, making it a solid offensive action.
- Capture: This ability lets the Wind Witch envelop a Medium or smaller creature in its space. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained. While restrained, the creature cannot be hit by Slam attacks, but it suffers 5 (2d4) piercing damage if it uses an action that requires movement. The Wind Witch can only capture one creature at a time, but the captured creature moves with it. 

For reactions, the Wind Witch has:
- Bouncy Escape: When it suffers damage from a melee attack, it can move up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If it uses this ability, it releases any captured creature, highlighting its tactical maneuvering in combat situations.</detail>
