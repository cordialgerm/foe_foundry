<detail>

The Star Drake's statistics include a Strength score of 20 (+5), Dexterity of 17 (+3), Constitution of 21 (+5), Intelligence of 16 (+3), Wisdom of 24 (+7), and Charisma of 20 (+5). The high Dexterity modifier (+3) translates to a good advantage over many opponents in terms of avoiding attacks, while the outstanding Wisdom modifier (+7) indicates exceptional insight and perceptiveness. The Constitution modifier (+5) provides the drake with a very good level of resilience against effects that require saving throws. The saving throws for Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma are +8, +10, +12, and +10, respectively, granting it very good protection against various effects. Additionally, it boasts skills in Arcana, History, Insight, Perception, and Religion, all at average levels, making it well-rounded in knowledge and awareness.

The Star Drake has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. "Magic Resistance" grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very difficult to control or incapacitate with magic. The "Nimbus of Swirling Stars" ability forces creatures within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw each time the drake begins its turn; failure results in a creature being incapacitated until the end of its next turn, which can significantly impact combat dynamics. Its "Planar Weapons" ability makes all its weapon attacks magical while also dealing an additional 4d8 force damage, augmenting its already powerful melee strikes.

In terms of offensive actions, the Star Drake can perform a "Multiattack," which allows it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it can launch four "Searing Star" attacks. The "Bite" attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, inflicting 16 piercing damage along with an additional 18 force damage, making it a potent attack. The "Claw" attack also features a +10 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, causing 12 slashing damage plus 18 force damage. The "Searing Star" attack is a ranged spell attack with a +12 to hit, dealing 14 radiant damage and 9 force damage, effective at a distance of up to 120 feet. Should two "Searing Star" attacks successfully hit the same target, that creature must then make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn, which could severely limit its effectiveness in combat.

Other extraordinary actions include "Planar Traveler," enabling the drake to teleport to a different plane of existence, functioning similarly to the plane shift spell but targeting only itself. The "Plane-Altered Breath," which has a recharge time of 5 to 6, allows the drake to unleash a powerful breath attack in a 60-foot cone, demanding a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw from each creature in the area. Those who fail take 55 force damage, while successful saves result in half damage. This high damage potential combined with its ability to alter the battlefield makes the Star Drake an exceptionally dangerous foe for any group of adventurers.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The drake has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Nimbus of Swirling Stars:** At the start of each of the drake’s turns, each creature within 10 feet of it and that can see it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.
- **Planar Weapons:** The drake’s weapon attacks are magical. When it hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 force damage (included in the attack).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The drake makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it makes four Searing Star attacks. If two Searing Star attacks hit one creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) force damage.

- **Plane-Altered Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The drake exhales raw magic in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
