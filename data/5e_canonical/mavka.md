### Special Abilities

- **Mounted Warrior:** While the mavka is mounted, her mount can’t be charmed or frightened.
- **Nightmare Mount:** The mavka has formed a bond with a nightmare. The nightmare acts as a controlled mount while carrying the mavka, obeying the mavka’s spoken commands. Mounting and dismounting the nightmare costs the mavka only 5 feet of movement.
- **Sunlight Hypersensitivity:** The mavka takes 20 radiant damage when she starts her turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- **Undead Nature:** The mavka doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The mavka makes two Enervating Slam attacks or three Necrotic Bolt attacks. If she is riding a nightmare, the nightmare can then make one Hooves attack. If both Enervating Slam attacks hit one creature, the mavka regains hp equal to the total necrotic damage dealt by both attacks.
- **Enervating Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 16 (3d10) necrotic damage.
- **Necrotic Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (4d10 + 4) necrotic damage.
- **Flame Burst (Recharge 5–6):** While riding a nightmare, the mavka channels her power into her mount, causing its fiery light to burn those nearby. Each creature within 20 feet of the mavka must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Spellcasting:** The mavka casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):<br>At will: create or destroy water, dancing lights<br>3/day each: darkness, hold person, silence<br>1/day each: bestow curse, dispel magic
