<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The Dhampir is a Medium humanoid creature that blends the lineage of vampires with that of humans, allowing it to navigate both worlds with a unique set of abilities. It possesses a challenge rating of 1, making it a moderately strong adversary for low-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its nimble Dexterity and Charisma, making it effective in both combat and social situations. With damage resistance to necrotic damage and a useful ability to charm others, the Dhampir can manipulate encounters to its advantage, yet it can be vulnerable to attacks due to its lower health pool of 32 hit points. </summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Dhampir include Strength of 12 (+1), Dexterity of 15 (+2), Constitution of 14 (+2), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 10 (+0), and Charisma of 16 (+3). Its Dexterity gives it a good level of agility, allowing it to avoid attacks and perform stealthy maneuvers effectively. Charisma is especially notable for social interactions, granting the creature an exceptional ability to persuade and deceive others. The saving throws for Dexterity and Charisma are +4 and +5, respectively, indicating a very good level of defense against effects requiring these attributes. With skills including athletics (+3), deception (+5), persuasion (+5), and stealth (+4), the Dhampir excels in social and tactical environments.

One of the special abilities of the Dhampir is Undead Resistance, which grants it advantage on saving throws against disease, making it tough against afflictions that might hinder other humanoids. 

In terms of actions, the Dhampir can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to strike twice with either a rapier or a shortbow but also offers the option to grapple an opponent. It can make a rapier attack, which has a +4 to hit, reaching 5 feet with damage output of 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage. Alternatively, it can use a shortbow to deliver ranged attacks, similarly with a +4 to hit, reaching out to 80 feet, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

The Dark Thirst ability allows the Dhampir to exploit a grappled or incapacitated foe. This attack also deals necrotic damage; it has a +4 to hit and inflicts 1 piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage, with the added benefit that the Dhampir regains hit points based on the necrotic damage inflicted, enhancing its survivability in combat.

Finally, the Dhampir can employ Predatory Charm, a magical ability that attempts to beguile one humanoid within 30 feet for one hour. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to resist; failure means the Dhampir has advantage on Charisma checks against that target. This charm can only affect one creature at a time and ends if the target is damaged by the Dhampir or its allies. If the subject successfully saves or if the charm ends, they will be immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.

In conclusion, the Dhampir is a cunning and charismatic combatant capable of outmaneuvering opponents both in battle and social engagements, while its blend of abilities allows it to sustain itself through encounters.</detail>
