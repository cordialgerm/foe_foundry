<summary>The Ice Bogie is a small fey creature characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment. It possesses a modest armor class of 12 and is only moderately durable with hit points totaling 10, making it relatively weak but nimble. Its primary strengths lie in its dexterity and stealth capabilities, with a Dexterity score of 14 providing a +2 modifier that allows for effective evasion and quick movement. However, its Strength is notably low, which gives it a -2 modifier, making direct physical attacks less effective. The Ice Bogie is capable of quick getaways thanks to its special ability, Nimble Escape, allowing it to Disengage or Hide as a bonus action. With a challenge rating of 1/8, it represents a minor but tricky adversary for low-level adventurers, gaining an advantage in combat when working alongside allies due to its Pack Tactics ability.</summary>

<detail>

The Ice Bogie has the following core attributes: Strength is 7, resulting in a very bad modifier of -2; Dexterity is 14, resulting in a good +2 modifier; Constitution is 10, resulting in an average +0 modifier; Intelligence is 8, leading to a very bad -1 modifier; Wisdom is 7, resulting in a very bad -2 modifier; and Charisma is 12, resulting in a good +1 modifier. When it comes to saving throws, the Ice Bogie has a Dexterity saving throw of +4, which is good and reflects its ability to dodge attacks. It is adept at stealth, gaining a +4 bonus to stealth checks. 

In combat, the Ice Bogie has vulnerabilities and immunities that affect how it interacts with the environment. It is vulnerable to fire damage, which means it takes double damage from fire-based attacks. Conversely, it is immune to cold and poison damage, rendering those types of attacks ineffective against it. Moreover, it cannot be charmed, petrified, poisoned, or rendered unconscious, giving it exceptional resilience to various debilitating conditions.

The Ice Bogie's senses include darkvision, allowing it to see in darkness up to 30 feet, with a passive perception of 8. It communicates using the Primordial language.

Among its special abilities, Nimble Escape enables the Ice Bogie to effectively evade threats, allowing it to take the Disengage or Hide actions as a bonus action on each of its turns, enhancing its survivability. With Pack Tactics, the Ice Bogie can gain advantage on attack rolls against an enemy if an ally is nearby, ensuring that it excels in groups.

The Ice Bogie has two main attacks. Its Icicle Fist is a melee weapon attack, with a +4 to hit against one target within 5 feet, dealing 1 bludgeoning damage combined with an additional 2 cold damage (1d4). This allows it to inflict cold damage while also applying some physical pressure. Its ranged attack, Spiteful Hail, can hit a target up to 120 feet away, allowing for effective engagements from a distance. It also deals 2 cold damage (1d4) and imposes a speed reduction of 10 feet on the target until the end of its next turn, enabling tactical manipulation of the battlefield.

Finally, the Ice Bogie can use its reaction Frosty Aid once per day. When an allied ice bogie is reduced to 0 hit points within 30 feet, this ability allows the Ice Bogie to choose to sacrifice 3 hit points (1d6) to restore its ally's health by the same amount. This reaction can effectively keep its allies in the fight longer, showcasing the Ice Bogie's support role within its fey kin.</detail>
