The Eye of the Gods has the following ability scores: Strength 8 (very bad), Dexterity 18 (very good), Constitution 12 (average), Intelligence 13 (average), Wisdom 20 (exceptional), and Charisma 16 (good). Notably, it excels in Wisdom, granting it a substantial +5 modifier, which enhances its perception skills. The creature boasts a +9 bonus in perception, making it adept at noticing threats and hidden enemies. It is also immune to conditions like charmed, exhaustion, and poisoned, further solidifying its resilience. With a sense of truesight that extends 120 feet, the Eye can see through illusions and invisibility, making it a keen observer of its surroundings.

Among the Eye's special abilities is Blazing Nimbus, which deals 3 (1d6) radiant or necrotic damage to any hostile creature that touches it or attacks it with a melee attack while within 5 feet. This ability acts as a deterrent against melee attackers, either providing a minor offensive presence or punishing those who get too close. Another special ability is the Corona of Truth, which grants allies within 10 feet of the Eye truesight up to 20 feet, allowing them to perceive hidden creatures and objects as well as see through illusions. 

The Eye also has the Divine Conduit ability, through which its creator deity can see everything the Eye sees, creating a unique bond and tactical advantage in combat situations. The deity can summon the Eye back to its side at any moment, ensuring that the Eye is never out of reach when needed. Furthermore, the Eye of the Gods can use Ethereal Jaunt as a bonus action, allowing it to shift between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. This mobility enhances its tactics in combat and opens various strategic avenues.

In terms of actions, the Eye can perform a Slam attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 (1d6 + 4) damage that is either radiant or necrotic, depending on the Eyeâ€™s alignment. This attack allows it to deal consistent damage in close quarters. Additionally, it possesses a powerful action called Divine Inspiration, which has a recharge time of 5-6. When activated, this ability inspires all allied creatures within 10 feet, granting them advantage on saving throws against being frightened for one minute. This inspirational aspect greatly enhances the effectiveness of allies in tense situations, making the Eye of the Gods not just a passive defender but an active participant in ensuring the resilience of its companions.</detail>
