<summary>A Quipper is a small, carnivorous fish with razor-sharp teeth, known for its aggressive nature and ability to strip flesh from bone in seconds. Found in rivers, lakes, or coastal waters, Quippers often swim in large schools, which makes them particularly dangerous to any creature that ventures into their territory. While individually weak, the combined efforts of a school of Quippers can overwhelm even larger creatures. They are highly territorial and will attack anything that enters their waters.</summary>
