While under the geas, the affected creature must assist nonhostile creatures suffering from starvation or thirst by alleviating the starvation or thirst.

- **Glowing Feathers:** The firebird sheds bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The firebird can alter the radius as a bonus action.

- **Warming Presence:** The firebird and each creature within 5 feet of it are immune to the effects of cold environments, provided the cold is caused by naturally occurring weather and climate.
