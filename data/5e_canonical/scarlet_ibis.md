<detail>

The ability scores of the Scarlet Ibis are as follows: Strength is 13, which gives it an average modifier, Dexterity is 14, contributing a good modifier that enhances its attacks and defense, Constitution is 16, resulting in a very good modifier that boosts its Hit Points, Intelligence is 11, which is average, Wisdom is 15, providing a good modifier that aids in Wisdom saving throws, and Charisma is 18, delivering an exceptional modifier that enhances its curse abilities and interaction with other creatures. The Ibis has a Wisdom saving throw bonus of +5, indicating a good resilience against effects targeting its Will. It has skills in Arcana (+3, averaging effectiveness) and Insight (+8, very good effectiveness), alongside darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 12, which allows it to notice movement and hidden creatures effectively. It communicates fluently in Common and Sylvan languages.

One of the most significant special abilities of the Scarlet Ibis is its Death Curse. Upon dying, all curses inflicted by the Ibis become permanent until removed by magic such as the Remove Curse spell. Moreover, the creature that deals the killing blow must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw to avoid becoming cursed with the same options targeted by the Ibis's beak attack. If someone attempts to use Remove Curse on a cursed creature, they also must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw; failure results in them suffering from the same curses that were just removed.

In combat, the Scarlet Ibis utilizes a Multiattack feature, allowing it to make three strikes in one turn: one with its beak and two with its talons. The beak attack has a +5 to hit, and with the potential to deal 11 piercing damage (rolling 2d8 + 2), it also compels the target to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw to avoid being cursed. Cursed targets are burdened with disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws, or alternatively, the Ibis can grant advantage to the Ibis's enemies on attack rolls against the cursed creature. The effects of the curse last for 24 hours or until removed by a spell. The talon attacks also have a +5 to hit and deal 9 slashing damage (rolling 2d6 + 2), making them a reliable option for dealing consistent damage during melee combat. 

Overall, the Scarlet Ibis is a formidable opponent in D&D 5e that combines physical attacks with debilitating curses, making it a dangerous adversary on the battlefield.</detail>
