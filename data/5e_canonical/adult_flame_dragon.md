<summary>The Adult Flame Dragon is a formidable creature that embodies chaos and destruction with its chaotic evil alignment. As a Huge Dragon, it boasts incredible strength, resilience, and a fierce array of abilities that make it a significant threat in any encounter. With a Challenge Rating of 16, it poses a serious challenge to adventurers, boasting high hit points at 275 and a robust Armor Class of 19 thanks to its natural armor. The dragon's capability to fly, coupled with its fire-based powers, allows it to dominate the battlefield both physically and psychologically. Its special abilities, such as being immune to fire damage while still being able to deal it without restriction, make it an extraordinary foe. However, its primary weakness lies in its susceptibility to certain forms of non-magical attacks since it lacks immunity beyond fire.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Flame Dragon has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 19, which translates to a +4 modifier, indicating a good effectiveness in physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 14, with a +2 modifier, considered average, making it somewhat nimble but not exceptionally so.
- Constitution: 23, providing a +6 modifier that is very good, enabling it to endure significant damage.
- Intelligence: 17, granting a +3 modifier that reflects good cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, indicating average perceptiveness and insight.
- Charisma: 20, with a +5 modifier, offering exceptional abilities in manipulation and presence. 

The dragon has saving throw proficiencies in Dexterity (+7), Constitution (+11), Wisdom (+7), and Charisma (+10). These values convey that the dragon is quite adept at evading traps and magical effects that rely on these stats, with very good to exceptional effectiveness.

In terms of skills, it excels in Deception (+10), Persuasion (+10), and has exceptional Perception (+12). Stealth is at a more average level (+7). The dragon possesses damage immunity to fire, making it highly resistant to fire-based attacks, while it has keen senses including blindsight up to 60 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet, enhancing its ability to engage foes even in low visibility.

The Adult Flame Dragon possesses several special abilities:
- **Fire Incarnate** allows it to bypass resistances to fire damage that other creatures might have, though those immune to fire sustain their immunity.
- **Heated Body** inflicts 10 (3d6) fire damage to any creature that comes into contact with the dragon or strikes it with melee attacks while within 5 feet, making close combat risky.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)** lets the dragon succeed on saving throws even when it fails, enhancing its durability against spells and abilities that require saving throws.

During combat, the dragon can take a multiattack action, beginning with its **Frightful Presence**, which forces nearby foes to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. This powerful ability limits opponents' actions and control during engagements. The dragon then can make one **Bite** attack, dealing 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage and an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage, alongside two **Claw** attacks, each inflicting 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, and a **Tail** attack that deals 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

The dragon's **Fire Breath** ability is particularly devastating; it can exhale fire in a 60-foot cone once per recharge. Creatures caught must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 56 (16d6) fire damage. Additionally, those affected must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or go on a rampage for a minute, forcing them to attack the nearest creature on their turn.

For bonus actions, the dragon can use **Shifting Flames** to transform into a fire-based elemental form, impacting its flying capabilities while maintaining its statistics otherwise. It can also make a **Tail Attack** or utilize **Wing Attack**, which knocks creatures within 10 feet prone and allows the dragon to reposition itself in the air.

Lastly, the dragon can utilize legendary actions, allowing it to make additional attacks or perform actions with the same conditions of limited usage at the end of another creature's turn. These actions include detection checks, tail strikes, or wing assaults, making it a highly mobile and tactically flexible adversary in combat scenarios.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Fire Incarnate:** Creatures with resistance to fire damage don’t have resistance to the fire damage dealt by the flame dragon. A creature with immunity to fire damage is still immune to the dragon’s fire damage.
- **Heated Body:** A creature that touches the flame dragon or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each creature in that area must also succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or go on a rampage for 1 minute. A rampaging creature must attack the nearest creature other than the dragon on its turn. If no other creature is near enough to move to and attack, the rampaging creature stalks off in a random direction, seeking a target for its rage. The rampaging creature can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shifting Flames:** The dragon magically transforms into a Huge or smaller fire-based Elemental (such as a salamander, magma mephit, or fire elemental) or back into its true form, which is a Dragon. Without wings or other way of flying, it loses its flying speed. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a Tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a Tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
