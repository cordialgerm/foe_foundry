<summary>The Vine Golem is a medium-sized construct characterized by its ability to blend seamlessly into its surroundings and its formidable nature in combat. Created to serve under a master, this golem boasts a blend of offensive capabilities, impressive defensive traits, and unique communication skills with its creator, making it a valuable ally in various situations. While it possesses good mobility with a climbing speed of 30 feet, it has vulnerabilities to slashing damage and limited potency against magical attacks. Its primary strength lies in its ability to manipulate the battlefield by ensnaring enemies, while its overall challenge rating of 3 indicates a moderate level of threat for adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Vine Golem has an Armor Class of 14, offering average protection, which enables it to withstand some hits. With 67 hit points, derived from rolling 9d8 plus a modifier of 27, it possesses a solid buffer against damage, enhancing its durability in combat situations. Its Strength score is 12, granting a modifier of +1, which is considered average and allows for decent physical capability. However, it excels in Dexterity with a score of 18 and a modifier of +4, which is good and enables effective agility in both offense and evasion. The Constitution score of 17 with a +3 modifier is very good, contributing to its hit points and resilience against physical challenges. Its Intelligence score is notably low at 6 (-2), which is very bad, meaning it cannot engage in complex problem-solving independently. Wisdom is average at 10 (+0), while Charisma is low at 5 (-3), both indicating a lack of interpersonal interaction capabilities.

In terms of skills, the Vine Golem possesses a +6 modifier in Stealth, making it very effective at hiding and ambushing foes in environments filled with plant life, due to its Plant Camouflage ability which grants advantage on Stealth checks. Its passive perception score of 12 helps it to notice hidden creatures or objects with average effectiveness. It has vulnerabilities to slashing damage and is immune to poison, while it resists bludgeoning and piercing damage from nonmagical attacks unless made with adamantine weapons. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as charm, exhaustion, fright, paralysis, and poison.

The Vine Golem's special abilities grant it several tactical advantages in combat. The Bound ability allows it to communicate telepathically with its creator, and they can know each other's distance and direction as long as they are on the same plane, fostering a tightly-knit tactical relationship. The Creator's Eyes and Ears ability allows the creator to see and hear through the vine golem, enabling spellcasting through it while temporarily rendering the creator blind and deaf in their own perspective. This feature is particularly potent for strategic positioning in battle. The Immutable Form ability ensures that its physical form cannot be altered by spells or other magical effects, reinforcing its structure as a reliable combatant. With Magic Resistance, it gains advantage on saving throws against spells, significantly improving its resilience to magical attacks.

In combat, the Vine Golem can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two thorned vine attacks in a single action. The Thorned Vine attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 15 feet, dealing 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet closer to the Vine Golem, allowing it to control enemy positioning. The Thorned Embrace attack is also a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and if it successfully hits a Medium or smaller creature, they are grappled with an escape DC of 11, thereby restraining them until the grapple ends. This ability can significantly hinder an opponent’s mobility during combat, allowing the Vine Golem to dominate the battlefield.

Overall, the Vine Golem combines its stealthy nature, telepathic abilities, and formidable physical attacks to act as a formidable guardian and enforcer for its creator.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Bound:** The vine golem is psychically bound to its creator and can communicate telepathically with its creator as long as neither is incapacitated. In addition, each knows the distance to and direction of the other. The golem and its creator don’t have to be on the same plane of existence to communicate telepathically, but they do have to be on the same plane to know each other’s distance and direction.
- **Creator’s Eyes and Ears:** As a bonus action, the creator can see through the vine golem’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of the creator’s next turn, gaining the benefits of the vine golem’s darkvision. During this time, the creator is deaf and blind with regard to its own senses. While using the construct’s senses, the creator can cast a spell through the vine golem, using those senses to target the spell. The range, area, and effect of the spell are calculated as if the spell originated from the vine golem, not the master, though the master must still cast the spell on the master’s turn. Spells that require concentration must be maintained by the master.
- **Immutable Form:** The vine golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

- **Plant Camouflage:** The vine golem has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain that contains ample obscuring plant life.

- **Thorned Embrace:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 11). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the vine golem can’t embrace another target.
