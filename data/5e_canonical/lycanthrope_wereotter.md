<summary>The Wereotter is a medium-sized humanoid lycanthrope that embodies the playful and tenacious nature of otters while retaining human intelligence and capabilities. These chaotic good creatures are known for their adaptability both in water and on land, exhibiting skills that make them formidable opponents in combat. The Wereotter boasts a decent hit point pool, an average Armor Class, and possesses strong Dexterity and Charisma, making it agile in battles and effective in social interactions. However, like many lycanthropes, it is vulnerable to silvered weapons, and its moderate Strength and Constitution score means that while it can deal some decent damage, it may struggle against tougher foes.</summary>

<detail>

For attributes, the Wereotter has a Strength of 13 (+1, which is average), Dexterity of 16 (+3, which is very good), Constitution of 13 (+1, which is average), Intelligence of 12 (+1, which is average), Wisdom of 15 (+2, which is good), and Charisma of 17 (+3, which is very good). It has a total of 44 hit points, calculated as 8d8 plus 8, which is a good amount for its Challenge Rating of 2, allowing it to withstand moderate amounts of damage. Its Armor Class of 13 is considered average, meaning it can be hit fairly easily by most attacks. The Wereotter also possesses damage immunities to nonmagic bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing, provided the attacks are not made with silvered weapons. Additionally, it has darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light up to 60 feet in its otter and hybrid forms, and a passive perception score of 14, giving it a good sense of its surroundings.

The special abilities of the Wereotter enhance its capabilities: it can hold its breath for an impressive 10 minutes while underwater, which enables extended exploration or combat in aquatic environments. Its keen hearing and smell grant it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on these senses, making it adept at detecting subtle cues in its environment.

In terms of actions, the Wereotter can make a multiattack, which affords it the ability to either throw three javelins or execute a combination of one bite and two javelins. The bite, available only in otter or hybrid form, is a melee weapon attack that hits with a +5 modifier, dealing 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage. If it bites a humanoid, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wereotter lycanthropy, presenting a unique challenge for its foes. For its javelin attack, the Wereotter has a +3 modifier and can strike an opponent from either 5 feet away or within a range of 30 to 120 feet, dealing 4 (1d6+1) piercing damage. 

Additionally, as part of its ranged options, the Wereotter can use a net to restrain creatures that are large or smaller. The net attack has a +3 to hit, and if successful, the target is restrained until it can escape by using its action to succeed on a DC 11 Strength check. For added strength, the creature can deal 5 slashing damage to the net (which has an AC of 10) to free a restrained ally without harming them.

As a bonus action, the Wereotter possesses the Change Shape ability, allowing it to transform into either a medium otter-humanoid hybrid or a large otter, reverting back to its true humanoid form when necessary. While its size changes, its statistics remain the same across forms, and any items it is wearing or carrying are not transformed. This transformation grants tactical flexibility, making the Wereotter a resourceful and unpredictable presence in any encounter. Overall, the Wereotter is a creature that combines versatility with charm, presenting both a challenge in battle and a unique role in social situations.</detail>
