Special abilities enhance the Cloud Giant's effectiveness in battle. With **Cloud Sight**, it can see clearly through clouds and fog, negating environmental disadvantages. Its **Innate Spellcasting** allows it to cast spells using Charisma as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 15. The giant can cast spells such as **detect magic**, **fog cloud**, and **light** at will, while it can use **feather fall**, **fly**, **misty step**, and **telekinesis** three times a day. These spells allow it to manipulate the environment and evade attacks smoothly.

The Cloud Giant's actions include:
- **Multiattack:** It can attack twice with its glaive, greatly enhancing its offensive capabilities.
- **Glaive:** This melee weapon attack boasts a +12 to hit and has a reach of 15 feet. It inflicts 24 slashing damage (3d10 + 8) and can knock prone any targeted Large or smaller creature that fails a DC 20 Strength saving throw.
- **Rock:** As a ranged weapon attack, the Cloud Giant can strike with rock, having a +12 to hit and dealing 39 bludgeoning damage (9d6 + 8) at a range. Similar to the glaive attack, it can push down smaller creatures that fail the same DC 20 Strength saving throw, sending them prone.

Among its spell-like abilities, we have:
- **Fog Cloud:** This 1st-level spell creates a heavily obscured area of fog within a 20-foot radius, lasting for an hour, which can disrupt visibility and strategy in combat.
- **Arc Lightning (1/Day):** This ability strikes up to three visible creatures within 60 feet, requiring them to make DC 15 Dexterity saving throws to avoid taking 42 lightning damage (12d6) or suffer half damage on a success.
- **Blinking Blades (1/Day):** This spell allows the giant to teleport multiple times, attacking each creature of its choice within a 30-foot radius, potentially hitting up to six targets.
- **Reverse Gravity (1/Day):** This powerful effect hurls chosen creatures 60 feet into the air, dealing damage upon hitting an obstacle or from falling.
- **Silver Tongue (1/Day):** This charm effect affects one creature that can hear the giant, compelling them to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to avoid being charmed for an hour, unless harmed by the giant or its allies.

As a bonus action, the Cloud Giant can use:
- **Gust:** This ability pushes one creature within 10 feet away (up to 30 feet) if they fail a DC 15 Strength saving throw, adding further crowd control.
- **Misty Step:** A 2nd-level spell that allows the giant to teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet, offering exceptional mobility in combat.

This combination of physical prowess, spellcasting, and tactical abilities makes the Cloud Giant Noble a significant threat, capable of controlling the battlefield and decimating adversaries with both brute strength and clever magic.</detail>
