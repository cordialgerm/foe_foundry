In terms of attributes, the Wyvern Knight has the following scores: Strength 16, Dexterity 10, Constitution 18, Intelligence 10, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 15. Its Strength grants a modifier of +3, which is considered good for engaging in melee combat, while its Constitution provides a +4 modifier, allowing it to maintain high hit points effectively. The knight also showcases a +2 Charisma modifier, making its presence more imposing in social interactions. The creature has saving throw bonuses of +6 for Strength and +7 for Constitution, both of which are good, ensuring resilience against physical threats. Additionally, it possesses proficiency in Perception, giving it a +4 bonus, which is also good for noticing threats around it.

The Wyvern Knight benefits from certain immunities and resistances: it is immune to poison damage and has resistance to it, which diminishes its vulnerability during encounters involving poisonous attacks. Its senses include passive Perception at 14, which is above average, allowing it to detect hidden foes. The knight can converse in Common and Draconic languages, facilitating interactions within its own culture and with adventurers.

Special abilities include being brave, granting the Wyvern Knight advantage on saving throws against being frightened. It also wears a Ring of Feather Falling, which allows it to descend safely from heights without taking damage when falling.

In combat, the Wyvern Knight can perform a multiattack, allowing it to make two lance attacks. When mounted on a war wyvern, the creature can command its mount to attack as well. The lance attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 9 piercing damage plus 10 poison damage upon a successful strike. However, it suffers disadvantage when attacking targets within 5 feet, making it less effective in close-range combat situations. The knight can wield the lance with one hand while mounted, adding versatility to its combat style.

The Wyvern Knight can also use a Heavy Crossbow at a range of 100/400 feet, with a +3 to hit, dealing 5 piercing damage plus an additional 10 poison damage. As an alternative option, it can employ a dagger for melee or ranged attacks, with the same +6 to hit modifier, inflicting 5 piercing damage and 10 poison damage, showcasing its adaptability in different combat scenarios.

For defensive strategies, the Wyvern Knight can utilize the Protection reaction to impose disadvantage on an attack roll made against an ally within 5 feet that it can see. This ability reflects tactical awareness and enhances the knight's role as a protective figure on the battlefield, especially when wielding a shield.</detail>
