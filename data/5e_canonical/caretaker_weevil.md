<summary>The Caretaker Weevil is a medium-sized beast that serves an unusual role in the D&D ecosystem. With an unaligned disposition, this creature is not inherently good or evil, but rather finds itself in the unique position of providing support to allies and incapacitating enemies through its special abilities. It boasts a solid pool of hit points, making it capable of enduring in combat, while also possessing an average Armor Class that allows it to avoid some hits. The Caretaker Weevil is particularly notable for its abilities to calm hostile creatures and stabilize allies, making it a valuable ally in various scenarios. However, it is relatively weak in terms of offensive capabilities, relying on its actions to deal moderate damage and support its fellow creatures.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Caretaker Weevil has a Strength score of 10, indicating average physical power; a Dexterity score of 12, reflecting a slight agility; and a Constitution score of 18, which is very good and contributes to its high hit points of 51, determined by rolling 6d8 and adding a substantial 24. The creature possesses a very low Intelligence score of 3, showcasing its lack of cognitive ability, while its Wisdom score of 14 is good, enabling it to perceive its surroundings adequately with a +2 modifier to Wisdom-related checks. Its Charisma score of 4 is very bad, indicating a significant lack of social grace or charm.

The Caretaker Weevil has a perception skill bonus of +2, and it features a tremorsense that allows it to detect movement within 30 feet. With a passive Perception score of 14, it can effectively notice hidden threats nearby. This creature does not communicate in any languages.

The Caretaker Weevil is equipped with special abilities that enhance both its defensive and support roles. Its Calming Presence ability creates a zone of peace around it; any creatures that enter a space within 5 feet of the weevil or begin their turn there must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. Failed saves result in the creature becoming indifferent to the Caretaker Weevil and any of its allies, as long as they remain within 60 feet. However, this effect is broken if the affected creature is attacked, harmed by a spell, or witnesses allies being harmed. Diligent Preservation allows the Caretaker Weevil to stabilize any non-Construct or non-Undead creature that starts its turn with 0 hit points within its 60-foot range. Additionally, any corpse within this area is shielded from decay and cannot rise as an Undead for as long as it remains in proximity to the weevil and for 24 hours afterward.

In combat, the Caretaker Weevil has two main actions: a melee attack with its mandibles that has a +3 to hit and deals 10 slashing damage, and a ranged Glue Glob attack that also has a +3 to hit. This glob can hit targets up to 30 feet away and deals 7 acid damage while restraining the target for 1 minute, forcing them to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; their speed is halved during this time. The target can attempt to save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect. The weevil possesses one further action, Regenerative Spittle, which it can use three times a day. This ability allows it to regurgitate a spittle at a creature within 10 feet, restoring 2 hit points. For the next minute, the target continues to regain 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns. 

Overall, the Caretaker Weevil stands out as an unusual companion, offering stabilization and calming powers that can greatly influence the course of a battle or narrative.</detail>
