<summary>The Sigilian is a Medium Construct known for its unique abilities which allow it to manipulate books and utilize the energies within. This creature presents a challenge for adventurers, possessing good mobility and the ability to restore its health through its environment. The Sigilian's strengths lie in its resilience to many forms of damage, as well as its ability to delve into the abilities of those it encounters. Its primary weaknesses include vulnerability to psychic damage and its low physical strength. The Sigilian's power is amplified when it interacts with spellbooks, allowing it to absorb magical energies, making it a fascinating yet formidable opponent for those who may underestimate its capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Sigilian has an Armor Class of 14, which provides a good level of defense against attacks. With 65 hit points, it can endure moderate to heavy damage in combat. Its movement is primarily aerial, with a speed of 60 feet when flying, but it cannot move on foot. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 2, indicating that it is designed for encounters appropriate for 2nd-level characters.

In terms of attributes, the Sigilian has a Strength score of 6 with a modifier of -2, making its physical strength very bad, which reduces its effectiveness in physical confrontations. However, it compensates with a Dexterity score of 18, resulting in a +4 modifier, classifying its agility as very good, improving its ability to dodge attacks and make ranged attacks. The Constitution score of 14, with a +2 modifier, provides average durability. Its Intelligence is very low at 5 (-3), presenting as an exceptional weakness in this area, but it boasts a Charisma score of 20 (+5), granting it exceptional potency in social interactions and abilities tied to charisma. Its Wisdom score of 10, with a modifier of +0, is average and does not significantly impact its perception or insight.

The Sigilian possesses skills in perception with a +2 modifier (average) and stealth with a +6 modifier (good), making it quite adept at sneaking and observing. It has vulnerabilities, notably to psychic damage, which can significantly impact its effectiveness in combat. On the other hand, it is immune to poison damage and resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, making it fairly resilient against common physical attacks. The creature is immune to a wide range of conditions, including being blinded, charmed, or frightened, thus enhancing its survival in combat scenarios. It has darkvision to a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and a passive perception score of 12.

The Sigilian's special abilities are quite remarkable. It has the Amorphous ability, which allows it to move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without difficulty, enhancing its stealth and evasion. The Cognivore ability enables the Sigilian to remove words from the pages of a non-spellbook and regain health, which is a strategic way to maintain its vitality during encounters. Its Home Sweet Tome ability allows the Sigilian to enter a book, and if that book is carried by another creature, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to prevent the Sigilian from entering. Creatures can find and extract the Sigilian from a book through an Intelligence check or by destroying the book itself, which causes a portion of damage to the Sigilian.

In terms of actions, the Sigilian is capable of making multiple attacks per turn. It uses a Multiattack to perform three attacks: one with its "Cut" ability and two with its "Paste" ability. The Cut attack is a ranged weapon strike with a +6 to hit, and if successful, it deals 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage and allows the Sigilian to copy one of the target's weapon attacks for one minute, making it versatile in combat. The Paste attack is a melee or ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit and adapts the damage type to whatever weapon the Sigilian copied with its Cut attack, which can confuse opponents and increase damage output.

Additionally, the Sigilian has the Devour Spell ability, which allows it to consume a spell from a spellbook and use that power in its next attack or regain health. This ability can be game-changing, as it allows the Sigilian to effectively amplify its damage output based on the spells it consumes. However, it can only consume one spell at a time and must strategically utilize that power before entering another spellbook, managing its magical potential carefully. The overall combination of these abilities makes the Sigilian a crafty and unpredictable opponent in combat scenarios.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The sigilian can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Cognivore:** At the start of each of its turns if the sigilian is inside a book that is not a spellbook, it removes the words from 3 (1d6) pages and regains 7 (2d6) hp.
- **Home Sweet Tome:** The sigilian can move half its speed to enter a book. If the book is being worn or carried by a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or the sigilian enters the book. A creature can take its action to find the sigilian in a book by succeeding on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If successful, a creature can use a bonus action to tear out the pages where the sigilian is hiding, forcing the sigilian out of the book and into an unoccupied space within 5 feet. Alternatively, a creature can destroy the book with a successful melee attack, dealing half of the damage to the sigilian and forcing it out of the book into an unoccupied space within 5 feet.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sigilian makes three attacks: one with its cut and two with its paste.
- **Cut:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage and the sigilian copies one of the target's weapon attacks for 1 minute.
- **Paste:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: Damage die and type are determined by the copied weapon attack from Cut. Glowing runes in the image of that weapon appear as the sigilian attacks.
- **Devour Spell:** While inside a spellbook, the sigilian eats one spell of the highest level present then exits the spellbook. It chooses to either make its next Paste attack with a number of damage dice equal to the eaten spell's level or regain 3 hp per spell level. The sigilian can only eat one spell at a time and must use the devoured spell's energy before attempting to enter another spellbook. The eaten spell's entry is garbled, but the owner can repair it for half the gold and time usually spent to copy a spell. If the owner has the spell prepared, it can re-record the spell during a long rest for no additional cost.
