<summary>An Ape is a large, muscular primate with powerful limbs and a thick coat of fur. Its long arms are perfectly adapted for climbing and swinging through trees, though it can also walk on two legs when needed. Apes are highly intelligent and often display strong social behavior, living in family groups and communicating through a variety of vocalizations and gestures. In combat, an ape relies on its immense strength, using its fists to deliver crushing blows. Apes are territorial and will defend their group fiercely if threatened, though they are generally peaceful when unprovoked.</summary>

<summary>The Ape is a Medium-sized beast known for its agility and physical strength, often acting as a brute force combatant in the wild. With a well-rounded physical presence and decent climbing abilities, it can prove to be a formidable opponent in melee encounters. The Ape's strengths lie in its impressive Strength score of 16, granting it an attack bonus of +5, and its decent Dexterity of 14, which contributes to its combat agility. However, its intelligence is remarkably low at 6, making it poor at complex problem-solving, and though it possesses average Wisdom, its lack of Charisma means it may struggle in social situations. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it represents a threat primarily to low-level adventurers, and while it has good hit points at 19, its moderate Armor Class of 12 means it can be vulnerable to more experienced foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Ape has the following ability scores: 
- Strength (STR): 16 (+3) - This indicates that the Ape has very good physical power and can effectively deal damage in melee combat.
- Dexterity (DEX): 14 (+2) - This score results in a good level of agility and reflexes, allowing the Ape to move swiftly and avoid some attacks.
- Constitution (CON): 14 (+2) - Providing the Ape with good resilience, this score enhances its hit points and makes it tougher in combat.
- Intelligence (INT): 6 (-2) - A very bad score reflecting the Ape's limited cognitive abilities, indicating it struggles with tasks requiring intelligence.
- Wisdom (WIS): 12 (+1) - An average score which gives the Ape some perception and instinctual understanding of its surroundings.
- Charisma (CHA): 6 (-2) - This very bad score reveals the Ape's inability to charm or interact effectively in social situations.

In terms of skills, the Ape has proficiency in Athletics (+5), allowing it to excel in physical endeavors like climbing and jumping. It also has a Perception skill of +3, resulting from its average Wisdom, which helps it notice dangers in its environment. Its passive Perception score is 13, meaning it can detect hidden foes or traps without actively searching.

The Ape has two main types of attacks during its turn in combat. Its first action is the Multiattack, allowing the Ape to strike twice with its fists each turn. Each fist attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet, and dealing 5 (1d4+3) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

The Ape can also perform a Rock attack as a ranged option, throwing a rock at a target. This ranged weapon attack also has a +5 to hit, with a range of 25 feet for normal range and 50 feet for disadvantage. This attack deals 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage if successful. 

Overall, the Ape’s combination of strength and agility makes it a noteworthy opponent for low-level adventurers, capable of dealing consistent damage in direct combat encounters.

The Ape is a Medium beast that serves as a physical threat in any encounter, particularly for lower-level adventurers. With an Armor Class of 12 and 25 hit points, it offers moderate resilience in combat. The Ape's primary strengths lie in its action economy, as its Multiattack ability allows it to strike twice in a single turn, increasing the likelihood of dealing more damage. However, it has limitations in terms of intelligence with an Intelligence score of -2, making it relatively simple-minded and unable to cast spells. The Challenge Rating of 1/2 indicates that it is more appropriate for inexperienced players or lower-level characters looking for a straightforward combat challenge. 

The Ape has the following attributes: Strength 5 (very good), Dexterity 2 (good), Constitution 2 (good), Intelligence -2 (very bad), Wisdom 1 (average), and Charisma -2 (very bad). Its Strength makes it a formidable grappling opponent, while its Dexterity allows decent stealth capabilities. However, its low intelligence affects its ability to engage in more complex tactics or diplomacy.

Its special abilities include Multiattack, allowing it to make two Fist attacks against a target. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, that creature is grappled with an escape DC of 13, meaning it must succeed on a check to escape the grapple. This can be a significant disadvantage for the targeted character, as it limits their mobility. The Fist attack has a +5 modifier to hit, reaching a range of 5 feet, dealing an average of 5 bludgeoning damage on a hit. The Rock attack serves as a ranged option, also with a +5 modifier to hit and a range of 25 feet (or 50 feet at disadvantage), dealing an average of 7 bludgeoning damage. 

In summary, the Ape is a straightforward, yet dangerous opponent, particularly when it grapples characters, inhibiting their actions and making it easier for the Ape to follow up with attacks. It exemplifies a classic beastly combat role in D&D, where brute strength and physical prowess can significantly impact gameplay dynamics.</detail>
