<summary>The Pale Screamer is a Medium Aberration known for its neutral evil alignment, characterized by both its physical prowess and disturbing capabilities. With an Armor Class of 14 and a total of 52 hit points, it presents a reasonable challenge for lower-level adventurers. It can swim and walk at a speed of 30 feet, making it quite versatile in different environments. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 3, granting it 700 experience points upon defeat. Its strength lies in its physical attacks and its powerful scream, but it suffers from low intelligence and charisma, which may limit its social interactions and cunning strategies.</summary>

<detail>

The Pale Screamer has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3, which is very good), Dexterity 14 (+2, which is good), Constitution 17 (+3, which is very good), Intelligence 7 (-2, which is very bad), Wisdom 13 (+1, which is average), and Charisma 8 (-1, which is bad). These attributes allow it to be an effective combatant while being decidedly poor at any interaction requiring intelligence or charm.

In terms of skills, the Pale Screamer has proficiency in Athletics, with a skill total of +5, which is good, and Perception, which has a total of +3, deemed average. It resists bludgeoning, cold, and force damage, allowing it to withstand various types of attacks. Additionally, it has darkvision reaching 90 feet and a passive Perception of 13, enabling it to perceive its surroundings effectively in low-light conditions. The creature understands Deep Speech, engaging in communication typical of its kind.

Special abilities enhance the Pale Screamer's versatility. The Amphibious trait enables it to breathe both air and water, allowing it to thrive in diverse environments.

For its actions, the Pale Screamer can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make two tentacle attacks against a single target. If both tentacle attacks land, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute. This paralysis can be resisted by repeating the saving throw at the end of each turn, making it a significant threat in combat.

Its Tentacle attack operates as a melee weapon attack with a +5 modifier to hit, extending its reach to 10 feet and dealing 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. 

Additionally, the Pale Screamer can unleash its Scream of the Deep ability, which has a recharge time of six rounds. This powerful scream affects a cone with a 30-foot range. Any creature within this area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) thunder damage and is deafened until the end of its next turn. A successful save results in halved damage with no deafening effect. This ability not only inflicts damage but can also disrupt enemy actions due to the deafened condition.</detail>
