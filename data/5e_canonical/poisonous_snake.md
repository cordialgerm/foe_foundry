<summary>A Poisonous Snake is a small, stealthy predator known for its venomous bite. These creatures are commonly found in forests, jungles, or deserts, where they hide in tall grass, under rocks, or in trees. Poisonous Snakes strike quickly, injecting venom into their prey, which paralyzes or kills smaller creatures. Though they are not typically aggressive unless threatened, their venomous bite can be deadly to unprepared adventurers. Their natural stealth and ability to blend into their environment make them difficult to spot until itâ€™s too late.</summary>

<summary>The Poisonous Snake is a tiny beast that poses a surprising threat despite its small size. With a challenge rating of 1/8, it is considered a relatively weak opponent, suitable for low-level encounters. However, its ability to deal poison damage can catch unsuspecting characters off guard. The snake is stealthy, thanks to its decent Dexterity score, making it good at avoiding attacks. While its physical attributes are weak, its use of poison can be a notable factor in combat, effectively depleting the health of characters that fail their saving throws.</summary>

<detail>

The Poisonous Snake has the following attributes: Strength 2 (-4 modifier, which is very bad), Dexterity 14 (+2 modifier, which is good), Constitution 10 (+0 modifier, which is average), Intelligence 2 (-4 modifier, which is very bad), Wisdom 10 (+0 modifier, which is average), and Charisma 4 (-3 modifier, which is bad). It can move with a speed of 30 feet on land and swim at the same speed, providing good mobility in various environments. The snake has an Armor Class of 12, which provides it with a moderate level of defense against attacks, and it has 2 hit points, making it very fragile. 

The Poisonous Snake has blindsight up to 10 feet, allowing it to sense its surroundings without requiring sight, and a passive Perception score of 10. It does not speak any languages, remaining an instinctual creature focused on survival and hunting.

In terms of its actions, the primary one available to the Poisonous Snake is its Bite attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, which is a good chance of landing a strike due to its effective modifier. The reach of this attack is 5 feet, allowing it to strike opponents that are within close proximity. On a successful hit, the target takes 1 point of piercing damage and must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Should they fail this saving throw, they suffer an additional 5 points of poison damage (2d4), or half that damage on a successful save. This ability makes the Poisonous Snake particularly dangerous to characters with low Constitution, as the poison damage can quickly add up.</detail>
