<summary>A Poisonous Snake is a small, stealthy predator known for its venomous bite. These creatures are commonly found in forests, jungles, or deserts, where they hide in tall grass, under rocks, or in trees. Poisonous Snakes strike quickly, injecting venom into their prey, which paralyzes or kills smaller creatures. Though they are not typically aggressive unless threatened, their venomous bite can be deadly to unprepared adventurers. Their natural stealth and ability to blend into their environment make them difficult to spot until itâ€™s too late.</summary>
