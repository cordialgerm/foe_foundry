<summary>The Derro Shadowseeker is a small humanoid creature that embodies chaotic evil, adept in stealth and unpredictable movements. With a notable armor class of 17, it is quite resilient in combat, boasting a substantial pool of hit points totaling 112. This creature can be a formidable opponent due to its dexterous nature, featuring an exceptional Dexterity score of 20 which translates to a +5 modifier. Shadowseekers excel in agility and evasion, making them challenging targets in battle, but they are weakened by exposure to sunlight, suffering from disadvantage on attacks and Wisdom checks that require sight. Their ability to use the environment to their advantage, along with a potent sneak attack feature, makes them excellent ambushers and skirmishers on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Derro Shadowseeker are as follows: 
- Strength: 9, with a modifier of -1, which is very bad, indicates that it is physically weak.
- Dexterity: 20, with a very good modifier of +5, reflects its exceptional agility.
- Constitution: 18, with a good modifier of +4, signifies a robust ability to withstand damage.
- Intelligence: 13, with an average modifier of +1, shows decent mental acuity.
- Wisdom: 7, with a bad modifier of -2, indicates poor perception and insight.
- Charisma: 14, with a good modifier of +2, suggests a reasonable social capability and charm.

In terms of saving throws, it has a Charisma saving throw of +5, which is considered good. It also possesses skills in acrobatics and stealth, both at +8, indicating very good proficiency in those areas, while its perception skill is at +1, which is average. The creature has darkvision that extends up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 11, allowing it to navigate well in low-light conditions. The languages it can speak include Common, Dwarvish, and Undercommon.

The Derro Shadowseeker has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat:
- Erratic Movement allows it to use the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each turn, making it very elusive. Additionally, opportunity attacks against it are made with disadvantage, which is very advantageous for avoiding damage.
- Evasion enables it to avoid damage entirely from area effects that require a Dexterity saving throw if it succeeds. If it fails, it only takes half damage, which is significantly beneficial for its survival.
- Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, reinforcing its resilience.
- The Sneak Attack ability allows it to deal an extra 14 damage (4d6) once per turn if it has the upper hand in combat, which can greatly enhance its potential damage output in a single strike.
- Sunlight Sensitivity imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight while exposed to sunlight, creating a notable vulnerability.

In combat, the Derro Shadowseeker can utilize the Multiattack action to perform three melee attacks on its turn, showcasing its aggressive nature. Its preferred weapon is a Dagger, with a +8 to hit and dealing an average of 7 piercing damage on a successful strike. Alternatively, it can employ a Light Crossbow for ranged attacks, also with a +8 to hit, inflicting an average of 9 piercing damage. Furthermore, it can unleash Maddening Convulsions, a powerful special attack that, upon a successful recharge roll, can cause confusion among creatures nearby. This ability forces non-derro creatures within 5 feet to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be subject to confusion for up to a minute, adding a strategic crowd control element to its combat style. A creature can attempt to break free from this confusion at the end of its turns.

Overall, the Derro Shadowseeker is a well-rounded adversary in combat, thriving on its agility and tactical abilities while maintaining vulnerabilities that can be exploited by clever opponents.</detail>

- **Magic Resistance:** The shadowseeker has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Sneak Attack (1/Turn):** The shadowseeker deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the shadowseeker that isn’t incapacitated and the shadowseeker doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the shadowseeker has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the shadowseeker’s Maddening Convulsions for the next 24 hours.
