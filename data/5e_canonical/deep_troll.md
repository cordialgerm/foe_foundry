<summary>The Deep Troll is a formidable adversary categorized as a Large Giant with chaotic evil tendencies. Known for its resilience and remarkable regenerative capabilities, this creature can be an intimidating presence in any encounter. Its high Constitution score provides a significant pool of hit points, allowing it to outlast many foes in battle. Coupled with its ability to spawn oozing duplicates of itself when injured, the Deep Troll can overwhelm adventurers by increasing the number of threats on the battlefield. While it excels in physical combat, especially with its Multiattack feature that combines bite and claw strikes, the Deep Troll does have a low Intelligence and Charisma, making it less effective in areas requiring cunning or social interaction.</summary>

<detail>

The Deep Troll has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good for a creature of its size. It possesses 63 hit points, calculated as 6d10 plus an additional 30 points from its high Constitution score of 20 (+5), resulting in exceptional durability. When it comes to movement, the troll has a walking speed of 30 feet and can burrow at a speed of 20 feet, giving it good mobility, particularly in underground environments.

In terms of attributes, the Deep Troll boasts a Strength score of 18 (+4), indicating a very good melee combat capability. Its Dexterity score of 13 (+1) is relatively average, providing modest defense against attacks that require agility. However, its Intelligence of 7 (-2), Wisdom of 9 (-1), and Charisma of 7 (-2) are all very poor, reflecting its lack of intelligence, perception, and social skills.

The creature has unique special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and survivability. The Malleable Internal Structure ability allows it to squeeze through openings suitable for Tiny creatures at half its burrowing speed, which can be strategically advantageous in various terrains. When the Deep Troll takes at least 15 points of slashing damage in one hit, its Oozing Body ability triggers, causing a chunk of its flesh to detach and become an independent oozing ally. This oozing flesh has its own action and can attack with a +6 to hit and deal 7 (2d6) acid damage, adding yet another layer of threat to encounters with the troll. Moreover, this oozing body persists for one week unless destroyed. 

The Deep Troll also benefits from Regeneration, which allows it to recover 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns. However, if the troll takes fire damage, this ability is temporarily disabled until its next turn, making it vulnerable at least for a short time.

In combat, the Deep Troll can unleash a powerful Multiattack, making two separate melee attacks, one with its Bite and another with its Claw. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage on a successful hit. Meanwhile, the Claw attack is even more potent, also with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, delivering 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, making it a significant threat to PCs standing close by. 

Overall, the Deep Troll is a potent combination of offensive power and regenerative ability, capable of complicating battles while relying on its damaging attacks and oozing flesh to maintain pressure on its foes.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Malleable Internal Structure:** Provided there is suitable room to accommodate its volume, a deep troll can move at half its burrowing speed through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature.
- **Oozing Body:** When the deep troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time, a chunk of its oozing flesh falls off into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. This flesh isn’t under the deep troll’s control, but it views the troll as an ally. The oozing flesh acts on the deep troll’s initiative and has its own action and movement. It has an AC of 10, 10 hp, and a walking speed of 15 feet. It can make one attack with a +6 to hit, and it deals 7 (2d6) acid damage on a hit. If not destroyed, the oozing flesh lives for 1 week, voraciously consuming any non-deep troll creature it encounters. After that time, it dissolves into a puddle of water and gore.
- **Regeneration:** The deep troll regains 10 hp at the start of its turn. If the troll takes fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the troll’s next turn. The deep troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn’t regenerate.
