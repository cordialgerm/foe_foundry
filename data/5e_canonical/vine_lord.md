The attributes of the Vine Lord reveal various levels of effectiveness in different categories. With a Strength score of 12, it has an average physical capability for melee attacks. Its very good Dexterity enables nimbleness, allowing for quick actions and evasive maneuvers. Its Constitution of 16, with a +3 modifier, provides good toughness, granting important bonuses to its saving throws against harmful effects. An Intelligence of 14 contributes to its strategic capabilities and use of spells. The Vine Lord’s Wisdom and Charisma scores of 16 (+3) and 18 (+4) respectively empower its spellcasting and interaction with other creatures, reflecting its exceptional ability to influence and control.

The Vine Lord possesses several notable special abilities. Its Green Regeneration allows it to regain 10 hit points at the beginning of its turn while in a forest, making it difficult to wear down during extended combat. Magic Resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further enhancing its resilience against spellcasters. The Root Mind allows for telepathic communication with its tendril puppets within a mile and grants it the ability to avoid surprise in forested environments, which can significantly alter the dynamics of ambush encounters. Meanwhile, the Vine Seed ability inflicts debilitating effects on infected creatures, causing them continuous pain and reducing their hit point maximum if not cured. This disease mechanic adds a layer of urgency and strategy for players to find a cure before meeting a dire fate. The Woodland Walk ability ensures that the Vine Lord moves freely through natural terrain, emphasizing its role as a master of the plant world.

In terms of actions during combat, the Vine Lord can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to perform one Tendril attack and two Thorned Slam attacks in a single turn. The Tendril attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, reaching up to 10 feet, capable of inflicting 7 slashing damage plus an additional 7 poison damage, along with a possibility of infecting the target with Vine Seed if they fail a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. The Thorned Slam attack also has a +9 modifier and deals more damage at close range, resulting in 14 bludgeoning damage and an additional 10 piercing damage. Finally, the ability Forest Protectors, usable once per day, allows the Vine Lord to summon allies in battle, whether they are awakened trees or other plants of lesser challenge rating, greatly enhancing its strategic options in combat scenarios. These actions combined make the Vine Lord a versatile and dangerous opponent for adventurers, capable of controlling both the battlefield and the flow of combat through its unique plant-themed abilities.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Green Regeneration:** While in a forest, the vine lord regains 10 hp at the start of its turn if it hast at least 1 hp.
- **Magic Resistance:** The vine lord has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Root Mind:** The vine lord and the tendril puppets it has created are connected via a hive mind. The vine lord and its puppets can telepathically communicate with each other, provided the communicating creatures are within 1 mile of each other. In addition, while in a forest, the vine lord can’t be surprised.
- **Vine Seed:** A creature infected with a vine lord’s vine seed suffers near-constant pain as the seed takes root and spreads tendrils throughout its body. For the first 24 hours after infection, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, as the pain from the spreading roots distracts it. Then, the seed becomes a disease, devouring the creature from the inside as it grows vines throughout the creature’s body. Until the disease is cured, the infected creature can’t regain hp, and its hp maximum decreases by 7 (2d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if this disease reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Woodland Walk:** Difficult terrain composed of plants doesn’t cost the vine lord extra movement. In addition, it can pass through plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vine lord and obeying its spoken commands. The Plants remain for 1 hour, until the vine lord dies, or until the vine lord dismisses them as a bonus action.
