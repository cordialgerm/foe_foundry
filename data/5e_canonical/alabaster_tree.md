<summary>The Alabaster Tree is a large celestial creature embodying neutral goodness, serving as a guardian of nature and a protector of the virtuous. Its formidable presence is characterized by a high Armor Class of 18, making it difficult to hit, and it possesses 105 hit points, offering a substantial buffer against damage. Its movement speed is limited to 10 feet, but this is offset by its ability to traverse the battlefield quickly with its special ability Churning Advance. The Alabaster Tree excels at defending allies; it can bolster good-aligned creatures and disrupt enemies through various powerful actions and abilities. However, it is vulnerable to magical damage as it has resistances to nonmagical attacks but not to magical ones. </summary>

The creature's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 20 (+5), which indicates it has exceptional physical power, making its melee attacks very effective.

The Alabaster Tree's saving throws include a significant bonus of +8 to Strength saving throws, highlighting its exceptional capability in resisting grappling or physical restraints. It has skills in perception at +5, allowing it to sense threats effectively. The creature has damage immunities against radiant damage, resistances against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and it is immune to the stunned condition. With blindsight extending up to 60 feet, it can detect creatures in that radius regardless of visibility, although it is blinded beyond that range. It understands and can communicate in all languages and has telepathy that operates within 120 feet.

In combat, the Alabaster Tree utilizes several special abilities:
- Churning Advance allows it to move up to five times its speed, albeit leaving difficult terrain in its wake, which can hinder opponents' movement.
- Foster the Grasses grants advantage on saving throws to hallowed reeds within 60 feet, enhancing the survivability of allies near it.
- Like Calls to Like permits the Alabaster Tree to ascertain the alignment of creatures within 60 feet, enabling it to identify potential threats or allies.
- Soul's Respite enables good-aligned creatures resting near it to gain the benefits of a long rest, promoting recovery and healing for those in its vicinity.

The Alabaster Tree can perform a Multiattack, making two slam attacks that are very effective in combat. Each slam has a +8 to hit and deals an average of 12 bludgeoning damage along with 4 radiant damage. It also has a grappling mechanic with an escape DC of 16, allowing it to restrain foes. One of its signature moves, Serrated Squeeze, allows it to attack a creature it is grappling, inflicting slashing damage while blinding and restraining the target. The creature can only engulf one target at a time and must make a saving throw if the engulfed creature deals significant damage back to it. 

The Toss action, available when in Oak form, allows the Alabaster Tree to throw a grappled creature or object up to 40 feet, potentially knocking it prone and adding bludgeoning damage based on the distance thrown. The Cloud of Needles attack, available in Pine form and recharge-based, can inflict heavy piercing damage to multiple foes simultaneously, requiring them to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid or reduce damage.

Overall, the Alabaster Tree stands as a powerful protector with unique abilities that can turn the tide of battle and support its allies while embodying the essence of good in its actions.</detail>
