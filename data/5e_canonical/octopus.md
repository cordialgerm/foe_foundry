<summary>An Octopus is a small, intelligent sea creature known for its ability to camouflage and squeeze through tight spaces. With its eight tentacles lined with suction cups, it can grasp objects or prey with ease. Octopuses are found in shallow coastal waters, where they hunt small fish and crustaceans. Though not aggressive, an Octopus can use its ink cloud to obscure predators and escape quickly. Its intelligence and problem-solving abilities make it one of the more curious and crafty creatures in the ocean, but it is not typically a threat to adventurers.</summary>

<summary>The octopus is a tiny beast that excels in stealth and aquatic environments. With a speed of 30 feet when swimming and the ability to camouflage itself, it is adept at hiding and maneuvering in water. However, its low hit points and relatively low armor class make it vulnerable in combat situations. The octopus's abilities allow it to escape dangerous encounters by creating clouds of ink, which can provide crucial cover. Although its physical attacks are weak, its ability to grapple opponents allows it to control foes and limit their actions effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The octopus has a low Strength score of 4, with a modifier of -3, indicating that it is very bad in melee combat strength. It possesses a Dexterity score of 14, meaning it has a good modifier of +2 which enhances its stealth capabilities. The Constitution score of 10 gives it an average resilience to damage, while its Intelligence score of 3 reflects an exceptional deficiency in cognitive abilities, making it very bad at complex tasks. The Wisdom score of 10 is average, and the Charisma score of 4 is very bad, suggesting it lacks any personal charm or influence.

In terms of skills, the octopus has a stealth bonus of +4, making it effective in avoiding detection. Its darkvision extends to 30 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright, while its passive perception of 10 means it can perceive surroundings at a basic level but is not particularly astute. The octopus is capable of water breathing, allowing it to thrive underwater and hold its breath for up to 30 minutes when out of water.

The octopus can take the following actions during gameplay: 

- **Tentacles:** This melee weapon attack has a +4 bonus to hit, allowing it to reach up to 15 feet. When it hits a target, it inflicts 1 bludgeoning damage. If the target is another creature, it becomes grappled with an escape DC of 10. While the target remains grappled, it is restrained, meaning it cannot move freely, and the octopus cannot grapple a different target with its tentacles. 

As a bonus action, the octopus can use its **Ink Cloud** ability once per day while underwater. It exudes a cloud of ink in a 5-foot radius, heavily obscuring the area for 1 minute unless dispelled by a strong current. This ability can be crucial for evading threats or creating an opportunity for escape.

The octopus is a small beast characterized by its aquatic nature and unique abilities that make it adept at surviving in underwater environments. It possesses a relatively low armor class of 11 and a modest 8 hit points, making it vulnerable in combat. Despite its weaknesses, such as poor physical strength and intelligence, the octopus excels in dexterity which allows for good stealth capabilities. Its challenge rating of 0 indicates that it is not a significant threat to adventurers. Notable strengths include its ability to hold its breath for extended periods while out of water, exceptional underwater camouflage, and the capacity to breathe underwater, enabling it to thrive in aquatic settings.

The octopus has the following attributes: Strength -3 (very bad), Dexterity +1 (average), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence -4 (very bad), Wisdom +0 (average), and Charisma -3 (very bad). Its senses include a darkvision range of 30 feet, allowing it to see in dark environments, while its perception score of 12 gives it good awareness of its surroundings. In stealth situations, it boasts a score of 13, which is considered good. However, the octopus cannot communicate verbally as it has no language capabilities.

Regarding its special abilities, the octopus can hold its breath out of water for 30 minutes. This remarkable adaptation allows it to survive during short excursions outside of its aquatic habitat. When submerged, it benefits from underwater camouflage, giving it a significantly improved stealth score of 18, allowing it to hide effectively from predators and threats. Additionally, the octopus has the ability to breathe only underwater, making it ill-suited for life on land.

In terms of actions, the octopus can use its tentacles to make a melee weapon attack against a target within 5 feet. It has a +3 to hit and can deal an average of 3 bludgeoning damage with a successful strike (calculated via 1d4 + 1). Notably, if it hits a Medium or smaller creature, the octopus grapples that target, creating opportunities for strategic advantage. The escape difficulty for the grapple is a DC of 11, which can strain the opponent's ability to extricate themselves.

For its reaction, the octopus possesses the Ink Dash ability, which can be used once every 6 rounds upon taking damage from a visible creature. During this reaction, if the octopus is underwater, it can release a cloud of ink in a 5-foot radius that heavily obscures the area until the end of its next turn. A significant current may disperse the ink prematurely. Following the release of the ink, the octopus can swim up to its swimming speed, but it must immediately release any creature it is currently grappling.

Overall, the octopus is a creature that thrives in its aquatic environment, utilizing its dexterity and specialized abilities to survive. While it may not be a formidable opponent in combat, its unique adaptations allow it to navigate threats effectively and contribute to the aquatic ecosystem.</detail>
