<summary>An Octopus is a small, intelligent sea creature known for its ability to camouflage and squeeze through tight spaces. With its eight tentacles lined with suction cups, it can grasp objects or prey with ease. Octopuses are found in shallow coastal waters, where they hunt small fish and crustaceans. Though not aggressive, an Octopus can use its ink cloud to obscure predators and escape quickly. Its intelligence and problem-solving abilities make it one of the more curious and crafty creatures in the ocean, but it is not typically a threat to adventurers.</summary>
