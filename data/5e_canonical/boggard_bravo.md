<summary>The Boggard Bravo is a medium humanoid creature, serving as a unique and agile combatant in its environment. With an Armor Class of 12 and 27 hit points, it possesses moderate durability, but is not particularly tough when facing stronger opponents. Its amphibious nature allows it to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial settings, presenting a tactical advantage during encounters. The Boggard Bravo excels with its mobility, having the ability to leap great distances and strike opportunistically. While its physical prowess and dexterity (with a Dexterity score of 14, giving it a good +2 modifier) make it a competent combatant, it does not possess high intelligence or wisdom (both rated at 10, which is average), making it somewhat predictable in tactics.</summary>

<detail>

The Boggard Bravo's Strength is rated at 12 (+1 modifier), indicating average physical strength. Its Constitution score is 10 (+0), suggesting that it does not have any exceptional resilience against damage. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it poses a minor threat, with encounters against it yielding just 100 experience points. The creature’s skills include a stealth proficiency (+4 modifier) that allows it to blend into its surroundings effectively and a survival skill (+2 modifier) that provides average efficacy in navigating natural terrains. Its senses include a passive Perception of 10, which is average, meaning it can notice ordinary details but may struggle with more subtle cues.

Unique to the Boggard Bravo are its special abilities. It possesses the Amphibious trait, which permits it to breathe both air and water, facilitating mobility in different environments. Additionally, it can Speak with Frogs and Toads, enabling communication and potentially influencing other amphibious creatures.

In combat, the Boggard Bravo has several actions at its disposal. Its Vaulting Leap ability allows it to jump up to its speed horizontally and half its speed vertically without provoking opportunity attacks. If it lands within 5 feet of a creature, it can make a spear attack against that target with advantage, making this ability a potent tool for closing distances quickly while maximizing its threat in melee.

The Boggard Bravo wields a spear, allowing it to make both melee and ranged attacks. It has a +3 to hit with the spear, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20/60 feet. A successful hit deals 4 piercing damage (1d6 + 1). Additionally, it has a bite attack, with a +4 to hit and dealing 4 piercing damage (1d4 + 2), which makes it slightly more effective than its spear attack in close-range combat.

As a bonus action, the Boggard Bravo can use its Tongue attack, which has a +3 to hit and a reach of 15 feet. On a successful hit, the target must make a DC 11 Strength saving throw. If the target fails, the Boggard can pull them up to 10 feet closer, knock them prone, or force them to drop one item they are holding at the creature's discretion. This versatility in the Tongue ability can disrupt opponents’ strategies and control the battlefield effectively.

Overall, the Boggard Bravo is a nimble and capable opponent, thriving in its natural habitats and able to utilize guerrilla tactics to great effect.</detail>
