<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>The Corrupted Pixie is a tiny, chaotic evil fiend known for its deceptive nature and magical abilities. With a solid Armor Class of 15, it can withstand some attacks but is quite fragile, possessing only 5 hit points. Its speed allows it to walk 10 feet and fly 30 feet, making it agile and difficult to target. The Corrupted Pixie's challenge rating of 1/2 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to lower-level characters. Notably, its significant Dexterity score of 20 grants it a good chance to evade attacks, while its magical abilities allow it to manipulate others and cause chaos on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Corrupted Pixie's attributes are as follows: Strength is 2 with a very bad modifier of -4, making it ineffective in physical confrontations. Dexterity is 20, providing an exceptional modifier of +5, resulting in excellent agility. Constitution is average with a score of 10 (+0), indicating no particular strength or weakness in resilience. Intelligence is 12 (+1), which is considered average, allowing for some basic cunning. Wisdom stands at 14 (+2), giving it a good understanding of its surroundings, while Charisma is 15 (+2), reflecting a good personality suitable for magic and manipulation.

The creature's skills include a perception score of +4, which is good, making it fairly observant, and stealth at +7, which is exceptional, allowing it to hide effectively from enemies. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 14. The Corrupted Pixie can understand several languages, including Abyssal, Infernal, Primordial, and Sylvan, reflecting its fiendish and mystical origins.

In gameplay, the Corrupted Pixie possesses several special abilities. Its Magic Resistance allows it to have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it less susceptible to magical assaults. Its Innate Spellcasting ability, based on Charisma, enables it to cast spells without needing material components. It has a spell save DC of 12 and can add +4 to its spell attack rolls. The pixie can cast the cantrip "vicious mockery" at will, dealing psychic damage to its target and imposing disadvantage on their next attack roll. Additionally, it can cast spells such as "bestow curse," "charm person," "confusion," "detect thoughts," "dispel magic," "fire bolt," "hideous laughter," "ray of enfeeblement," and "suggestion" once per day each, allowing a variety of control and damage options in combat.

The Corrupted Pixie also has two notable actions. The "Confusion Touch" ability allows it to inflict confusion on a creature it touches, forcing them to either attack an ally or themselves unless they succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. This can potentially create chaos among a party. Its "Superior Invisibility" action lets it become invisible, along with any equipment it carries, until it chooses to end the effect. This ability, akin to concentrating on a spell, allows it to evade detection and reposition itself for strategic advantages.</detail>
