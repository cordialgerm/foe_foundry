<detail>

The Brine Hag has impressive attributes: a Strength of 17 provides a good modifier of +3, enabling strong physical attacks. Its Dexterity of 12 gives a modest +1 modifier, which is average for agility. With a Constitution of 16, it has a good +3 modifier, contributing to its robust hit points. The Intelligence score of 14 offers a good +2 modifier, enhancing its cunning nature. Its Wisdom at 16 provides a good +3 modifier, valuable for perception and insight. The highest attribute is Charisma at 19, which yields an exceptional +4 modifier, enhancing its spellcasting abilities and ability to manipulate other beings.

Its skills include a +3 modifier in perception, reflecting its ability to observe its surroundings keenly, which is particularly useful for locating prey in dark waters. The Brine Hag is immune to being charmed and poisoned, allowing it to resist various effects that could hinder its capabilities. Its darkvision extends to 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness. The creature can communicate in Aquan, Common, and Sylvan languages.

Special abilities enhance the Brine Hag's capabilities significantly. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, making it highly versatile in aquatic scenarios. It possesses Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it exceptionally hard to incapacitate through magical means. The Polluted Aura creates a detrimental area around the hag, poisoning any creature starting its turn within 20 feet, which embodies its nature as a toxic entity. A creature can save against the poison effect but must continue to make checks if it exits the aura. The Skilled Submariner ability provides advantage on perception and survival checks while in water, alongside better stealth capability in similar environments. Additionally, the Hag can speak with aquatic creatures, allowing it to interact strategically using local fauna.

In its actions, the Brine Hag can perform a Multiattack, making two claw attacks and one tail slap. The Claw attack has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage complemented with an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage. If the target fails a Constitution saving throw (DC 16), it becomes incapacitated until the end of its next turn, and failing the save by 5 or more results in paralysis. The Tail Slap also has a +7 to hit and inflicts an average of 16 (2d12 + 3) bludgeoning damage, forcing the target to make a Strength saving throw to avoid being pushed away. 

The Shriek is a powerful ability that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, delivering a blast of thunder damage in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in this area suffers an average of 33 (6d10) thunder damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn unless they succeed on a Constitution save (DC 16). Furthermore, the Denizens of the Deep allows the Brine Hag to summon aquatic creatures to aid in combat, which can significantly shift the battle's dynamics. Once per day, she can call four reef sharks, two swarms of quippers, or one beast with a challenge rating of up to 2, with these creatures acting as her allies for an hour.

The Brine Hag is also capable of spellcasting, with Charisma as its spellcasting ability (DC 16). It has the ability to cast the at-will spell Minor Illusion, which can be used strategically in combat or exploration. Additionally, it can cast Charm Person and Major Image three times a day each, and Control Water once per day. These spells enable it to manipulate its environment, deceive characters, and potentially charm or control them, enhancing its dominance over encounters.</detail>
