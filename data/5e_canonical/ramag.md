<summary>The Ramag is a Medium humanoid creature characterized by its neutral alignment. It is somewhat resilient due to its average armor class of 13 and a total of 27 hit points, making it a moderately difficult opponent for lower-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its proficiency with magic resistance, providing it with a very good advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. Additionally, the Ramag possesses an exceptional ability known as Portal Sense, enabling it to locate planar portals and learn about their properties. However, with a Strength score of 9, the Ramag is physically weak, resulting in a very bad modifier for Strength-related tasks. Overall, the Ramag serves as a smart and tactical combatant, relying on its agility and magical knowledge to gain an upper hand.</summary>

<detail>

The Ramag has the following ability scores: 
- Strength 9 (-1), which reflects a very bad capability in physical confrontations such as melee attacks.
- Dexterity 14 (+2), providing a good advantage in agility and ranged attacks.
- Constitution 10 (+0), demonstrating an average capacity for stamina and resilience.
- Intelligence 16 (+3), indicating an exceptional level of cognitive ability, useful for knowledge checks and spellcasting.
- Wisdom 12 (+1), suggesting an average ability to make perceptive judgments and decisions.
- Charisma 11 (+0), representing an average effectiveness in social interactions.

With skills in Arcana and Investigation both rated at +5, the Ramag has an exceptional ability to gather information on magical lore and conduct thorough searches. Its passive perception score is 11, which is average and allows it to notice threats or hidden objects within its vicinity.

The Ramag communicates in Common, making it accessible for interaction with most adventurers. Its special abilities include Magic Resistance, which grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells, enhancing its durability against magical attacks, and Portal Sense, which allows it to detect and analyze planar portals within a 100-foot radius or sense their general direction up to a mile away.

In combat, the Ramag can perform the following actions:
- Scimitar: This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit modifier and can reach targets within 5 feet. When it successfully hits, it deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.
- Shortbow: As a ranged weapon, this attack also has a +4 to hit modifier, effective within a range of 80 feet (and up to 320 feet in a less precise shot), dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage upon a successful hit.

Additionally, the Ramag has a special bonus action titled Portal Traveler, which can be used if it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the Ramag to create a small portal, step through it, and emerge from a corresponding portal within 60 feet. If an enemy occupies the destination space, they must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. A failed save results in the Ramag swapping places with the creature, while a successful save means that the Ramag’s teleportation fails. Regardless of the outcome, the portal disappears after the action. This ability offers tactical movement options and can disrupt an enemy’s positioning in combat.</detail>
