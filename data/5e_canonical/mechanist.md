### Special Abilities

- **Tools of** the Trade. The mechanist is proficient with tinker tools and doubles its proficiency bonus for any ability check it makes with tinker tools.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The mechanist makes two Warhammer or Light Crossbow attacks.
- **Warhammer.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.
- **Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.
- **Repair (Recharge 4–6).** The mechanist touches one friendly Construct it can see. The target regains 5 (2d4) HP.

### Bonus Actions

- **Quick Creation (Recharge 4–6).** The mechanist cobbles together various machine parts it is carrying and creates a Tiny Construct. The Construct obeys the mechanist’s spoken commands. It uses the statistics of a solodron (see page XX), but it isn’t a mechadron or part of the Plan. The mechanist can have up to two such Constructs under its control at one time. Each Construct remains for 1 minute, until the mechanist dies, or until the mechanist uses this bonus action again to dismiss one or both of them.

### Reactions

- **Magnetic Pulse.** When a creature the mechanist can see attacks it with a weapon made at least partially of metal while within 5 feet of it, the mechanist can release a magical, magnetic pulse. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or have disadvantage on the attack roll.
