<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Grave Behemoth is a formidable opponent in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, characterized as a Huge undead creature with a neutral evil alignment. With a Challenge Rating of 10, it possesses remarkable durability and damage potential, boasting 210 hit points derived from a substantial pool of 20d12+80. Its Armor Class of 9 indicates that it may be easier to hit compared to more agile foes, but its high hit points allow it to endure a significant amount of punishment before going down. The Grave Behemoth excels in close combat with powerful melee attacks and has the ability to summon zombies to assist in battle, increasing the threat level significantly. However, its low Dexterity and limited speed may render it vulnerable to nimble opponents that can maneuver around it.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Grave Behemoth has a Strength score of 22 (+6), allowing it to exert incredible physical force, resulting in exceptional performance in melee attacks. Its Constitution score of 19 (+4) contributes to its high hit point pool, making it very resilient. Conversely, its Dexterity score of 8 (-1) is very poor, which means it is not very nimble and can be easily targeted by ranged attacks. The creature's Intelligence of 13 (+1) and Wisdom of 10 (+0) suggest average cognitive abilities and awareness, while a Charisma of 8 (-1) indicates it lacks any significant influence over others. The Grave Behemoth's saving throws reflect strong resilience with a +8 bonus to Constitution and a +4 bonus to Wisdom, making it good at resisting conditions that affect its durability.

The Grave Behemoth has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The "Fleshbag" ability imposes restrictions if limbs are lost; losing arms prevents multiattacks and slamming, while losing legs halves speed or causes it to fall prone if both are lost. The "Flesh Wound" ability adds an element of self-damage, allowing the behemoth to create additional zombies if it takes significant damage, effectively continuing its offensive capabilities. The "Turning Defiance" ability grants it and any nearby zombies advantage on saving throws against effects that might turn undead, making it resistant to certain forms of control. Additionally, the "Zombie Keeper" ability ensures that any zombies created are automatically controlled by the Grave Behemoth and are unaffected by necrotic damage.

In terms of actions in combat, the Grave Behemoth can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two slam attacks. The "Slam" action is a melee weapon attack that strikes with a +10 to hit and does an impressive 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. The "Gorge" action is even more devastating, dealing 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage along with an additional 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on a successful hit. Its special "Hurl Flesh" ability allows the behemoth to vomit a mass of putrid flesh, affecting an area with a 30-foot cone and summoning additional zombies while dealing necrotic damage. Targets must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to avoid full damage and the debilitating effect of being covered in rotting slime, which is detrimental in that it provides zombies controlled by the Grave Behemoth an advantageous position when attacking affected creatures.

Overall, the Grave Behemoth is a terrifying embodiment of necromancy in an encounter, relying on brute strength and the ability to command lesser undead to overwhelm opponents. Its resilience and ability to summon minions make it a serious threat on the battlefield, while its limitations regarding mobility provide unique opportunities for clever adventurers looking to exploit its weaknesses.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Fleshbag:** The behemoth starts with two arms and two legs. If it loses one arm, it can't multiattack. If it loses both arms, it can't slam. If it loses one leg, its speed is halved. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed.
- **Flesh Wound:** At the end of any turn in which the behemoth took at least 30 damage, roll a d8. On a 1, it loses an arm. On a 2, it loses a leg. In addition, 2 (1d4) zombies fall prone in unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of the behemoth, spilling from the wound.
- **Turning Defiance:** The grave behemoth and any zombies within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
- **Zombie Keeper:** Zombies created by a grave behemoth's Flesh Wound and Hurl Flesh share a telepathic link with it, are under its control, are immune to necrotic damage, and act immediately and on the grave behemoth's initiative.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The grave behemoth makes two slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
- **Gorge:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.
- **Hurl Flesh (Recharge 5-6):** The grave behemoth vomits putrid flesh and 5 (2d4) zombies in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 38 (11d6) necrotic damage and is covered in rotting slime for 1 minute. On a success, a target takes half the necrotic damage and isn't covered in slime. A creature, including the target, can take an action to clean off the slime. Zombies under the grave behemoth's control have advantage on attack rolls against creatures covered in a grave behemoth's slime.
