<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>A Roc is an enormous bird of prey, large enough to carry off an elephant in its talons. These majestic creatures soar high above mountains and open plains, hunting for massive prey. Rocs are often solitary and territorial, making their nests on remote mountain peaks or cliffs. Their immense size and strength make them formidable predators, capable of snatching up entire caravans or ships. While they are awe-inspiring, Rocs are also highly dangerous to anyone who ventures too close to their hunting grounds.</summary>
