<detail>

The Elder Shadow Drake possesses the following attributes: 

- Strength: 22 (+6) – exceptional, enabling powerful melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 13 (+1) – average, affecting its ability to evade attacks but not significantly.
- Constitution: 18 (+4) – very good, contributing to its hit point total and overall durability.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1) – very bad, indicating low cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 9 (-1) – very bad, suggesting a lack of insight.
- Charisma: 13 (+1) – average, affecting its social interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the drake has a Dexterity save of +4 (average), a Constitution save of +7 (good), and a Charisma save of +4 (average). It boasts skills in Perception at +5 (good) and Stealth at +7 (very good), enhancing its capabilities in ambush scenarios. The drake has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 120 feet and a passive Perception of 15, further emphasizing its stealthy nature.

The drake’s special ability, Shadow Sight, allows it to have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in dim light or darkness, making it exceptionally effective in dark environments where it can surprise its foes. Magical darkness does not hinder its darkvision, allowing it to maneuver and attack without the limitations faced by other creatures.

For its actions, the Elder Shadow Drake has a Multiattack option, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Tail Slap attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +9 to hit and can deal an impressive 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage, showcasing its strength. The Tail Slap attack also has a +9 to hit and deals 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, providing further offensive capabilities.

The drake can use the Invisibility action to magically turn invisible until it attacks or begins its turn in sunlight. This ability allows it to reposition without being seen, giving it the strategic advantage of surprise against its opponents when in dim light or darkness.

Additionally, the Stygian Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the drake to expel a ball of black liquid that creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of black mist centered on a point visible to it within 60 feet. This mist inflicts cold damage and creates magical darkness that obscures vision and dispels any natural light. Creatures caught within this mist must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take a devastating 42 (12d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

For bonus actions, the elder shadow drake can utilize Shadow Step, enabling it to teleport up to 60 feet to a space it can see, provided both the starting and ending locations are in dim light or darkness. This mobility allows the drake to reposition quickly, escape danger, or avoid attacks.

In combat encounters, the Elder Shadow Drake serves as a challenging enemy that utilizes its stealth capabilities, devastating breath weapon, and mobility to control the battlefield, making it a memorable encounter for adventurers.</detail>
