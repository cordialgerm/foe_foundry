<summary>An Eagle is a large bird of prey known for its sharp talons, keen eyesight, and graceful flight. It soars through the sky, using its incredible vision to spot prey from great distances. Eagles are often symbols of strength and freedom, admired for their independence and hunting prowess. In the wild, they hunt small mammals, fish, and birds, diving at great speeds to capture their prey with deadly precision. Eagles are also known to defend their nests fiercely, and while they are not magical creatures, their natural agility and strength make them formidable in their own right.</summary>

<summary>The Eagle is a small beast known for its keen eyesight and swift flying abilities. With an Armor Class of 12, it can take a hit but has limited resilience due to its low hit points of just 3. The Eagle's primary strengths lie in its Dexterity of 14, which grants it a good attack bonus when it strikes with its talons, and its exceptional perception skills. However, it has very poor strength with a score of 6, making it ineffectual in melee combat beyond its unremarkable talon attack. This creature is best utilized for reconnaissance and support, rather than as a direct combatant.</summary>

<detail>

The Eagle has the following attribute scores: Strength 6 (which equates to a modifier of -2, considered very bad), Dexterity 14 (+2 modifier, classified as good), Constitution 10 (+0 modifier, average), Intelligence 2 (-4 modifier, very bad), Wisdom 14 (+2 modifier, good), and Charisma 6 (-2 modifier, very bad). The Eagle is somewhat agile and perceptive, which enhances its effectiveness in scouting and observation tasks. It has proficiency in Perception, offering a +4 bonus to its checks, demonstrating its notable ability to notice details in its environment.

The Eagle's senses include a passive Perception score of 14, indicating it is adept at noticing as soon as potential threats or prey appear within its field of view. This makes it an effective scout for any adventuring party. However, the Eagle does not understand any languages, limiting its ability to engage in complex communication.

One of the Eagle's special abilities is Keen Sight, which grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight. This means that whenever the Eagle is required to make a Perception check involving sight, it rolls two d20 dice and takes the higher result, significantly increasing its chance to succeed on these checks.

In terms of actions, the Eagle can make a melee weapon attack with its talons, rolling with a +4 to hit over a reach of 5 feet against a single target. If successful, this attack deals 1 point of slashing damage. While the damage output is minimal, the talon attack still allows the Eagle to contribute to combat if necessary. Overall, the Eagle is a nimble and perceptive creature, better suited for flight and observation than for direct confrontation.

The eagle is a small beast known for its agility and keen senses, suitable for aerial surveillance and rapid movement. With a challenge rating of 0, it poses little threat to adventurers but can provide valuable support in scouting missions or as an animal companion. Its notable strengths include heightened perception, making it an exceptional observer, and the ability to swim, which adds a layer of versatility to its movement. However, it has weaknesses such as low hit points and poor physical strength, making it vulnerable in direct combat.

The eagle has an Armor Class of 11, which is average, and only 8 hit points, making it easily defeated. Its movement consists of a speed of 10 feet on the ground and an impressive flying speed of 60 feet, allowing it to navigate quickly in aerial combat or while scouting. 

In terms of ability scores, the eagle has a Strength score of -2, which is very bad and indicates poor physical prowess. Its Dexterity is +1, considered average, and grants it some agility. The eagle has Constitution at +0, which is average; its Intelligence is -4, notably very bad, reflecting its lack of cognitive abilities. Wisdom is +2, which is good, reflecting its attunement to its environment and enabling heightened sensory perception. Finally, the Charisma score of -2 is very bad, indicating that the eagle lacks social interaction capabilities.

The eagle's special abilities enhance its utility: its heightened sight ability increases its Perception score to 19 when using sight, making it exceptional for spotting hidden creatures or objects. Additionally, as a seabird, the eagle can swim up to 30 feet but must ensure it starts and ends its movement on solid surfaces or flying. If it fails to manage its position correctly while swimming, it risks sinking and suffocating unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw of DC 10. If it finds itself suffocating, it must succeed on a Strength check of DC 8 to escape the water.

For actions, the eagle has a talons attack. It makes a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, which is considered good. If it hits, it deals 3 slashing damage, calculated by rolling 1d4 and adding 1 to the result.

Overall, the eagle serves as a nimble and perceptive creature in the wilderness, providing utility without posing a significant threat in combat. Its ability to fly and swim adds an interesting dynamic, primarily when used alongside characters who require scouting or reconnaissance.</detail>
