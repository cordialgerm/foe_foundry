<summary>A Nalfeshnee is a grotesque, towering demon that combines the features of a boar, an ape, and a vulture. Its massive, bloated body and wings give it a horrifying, bloated appearance, and its tusked face is filled with hunger and rage. Nalfeshnees are known for their intelligence and cruelty, often serving as judges or overseers in the Abyss. They can unleash waves of demonic energy, spreading madness and confusion among their enemies. In battle, they rely on both their physical strength and their ability to summon dark magic to crush their foes. Though they are brutish in appearance, Nalfeshnees are cunning and manipulative, using their power to command legions of lesser demons.</summary>

<summary>The Nalfeshnee is a formidable Large Fiend, embodying the essence of chaos and evil in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. With a high Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of 184 hit points, it can endure significant damage before succumbing in battle. This creature is proficient in both melee and magical combat, making it a versatile threat to any adventurer. With a Challenge Rating of 13, it presents a considerable challenge, capable of dealing heavy damage with its melee attacks as well as powerful area-of-effect spells. However, its speed is somewhat sluggish, only moving 20 feet on the ground and 30 feet while flying, which can be a weakness if it faces more agile opponents. The Nalfeshnee uses both its physical prowess and its magical abilities to dominate the battlefield, making it a dangerous foe when encountered.</summary>

<detail>

The Nalfeshnee has the following attributes: Strength is 20 with a modifier of +5, making it exceptionally strong; Dexterity is 16 with a +3 modifier, indicating good reflexes; Constitution is 22 with +6, reflecting its exceptional toughness; Intelligence is 20 with +5, showcasing its cunning and tactical awareness; Wisdom is 16 with +3, showing a good degree of insight; and Charisma is also 16 with +3, highlighting its menacing presence. Its saving throws are formidable: Strength +10, Constitution +11, Intelligence +10, Wisdom +8, and Charisma +8, each representing good effectiveness against attempts to debilitate it. The creature has immunities to poison damage and conditions, resisting cold, fire, and lightning damage as well as damage from nonmagical weapons, making it exceptionally resilient against a variety of attacks. It possesses truesight, allowing it to see through illusions and invisibility up to 120 feet away, and understands Abyssal while being able to communicate telepathically within the same range.

Among its special abilities, the Nalfeshnee radiates a Chaotic Evil aura, reinforcing its nature. It also benefits from Magic Resistance, giving it advantage on saving throws against spells, which increases its survivability against casters. Its actions in combat include the Multiattack, where it can make both bite and claws attacks. The bite attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 32 piercing damage. Notably, if it uses this attack on a dead non-demon creature, it regains 27 hit points and recharges its Horror Nimbus ability, allowing for strategic play in combat. The claws attack is equally potent, also with +10 to hit but dealing 31 slashing damage.

The Chaos Blast ability allows the Nalfeshnee to unleash beams of multicolored light in a 15-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of itself. Any creature without a Chaotic alignment must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take a substantial 52 force damage on failure, or half damage on success, potentially resetting the battlefield dynamics by causing widespread harm.

As a bonus action, the Nalfeshnee can activate Horror Nimbus once a day. This ability causes it to glow with an unholy radiance, forcing creatures within 15 feet that can see it to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Failing this save results in the creature being frightened for one minute, significantly affecting their ability to fight. Victims can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect. Additionally, the Nalfeshnee has the ability to teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, providing exceptional mobility and allowing it to reposition strategically during combat.

The Nalfeshnee is a formidable Large fiend, specifically a demon, known for its terrifying presence and cunning predatory skills. With an armor class of 18 and hit points totaling 196, it poses a significant threat in combat situations, making it a challenging opponent for adventurers. The creature has impressive defensive and offensive capabilities, including flight and an extensive array of attacks. It is capable of both damaging foes and maintaining its own durability. However, despite its strengths, the Nalfeshnee is relatively slow when it comes to movement speed, and its dexterity is moderate, which presents some weaknesses that can potentially be exploited by agile foes.

The creature's attributes are as follows: Strength is +5, Dexterity is +0 (average), Constitution is +11 (exceptional), Intelligence is +8 (very good), Wisdom is +6 (good), and Charisma is +7 (very good). The Constitution modifier contributes to its impressive hit points, while its Wisdom and Charisma modifiers enhance its special abilities, allowing it to both intimidate foes and resist magical effects. The Nalfeshnee’s power is further augmented by its Demonic Resilience, which grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, alongside immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. 

In terms of senses, the Nalfeshnee possesses truesight out to 120 feet, granting it a tactical advantage in discerning hidden or invisible creatures. Its Perception score of 16 allows it to be aware of its surroundings, and its Stealth score is 10, which is fairly average. It communicates in Abyssal and can use telepathy within a range of 120 feet.

The Nalfeshnee has several notable special abilities. It can emit a Horrific Nimbus that creates a disorienting and frightening effect on mortals within 15 feet of it. Creatures that begin their turn within this radius must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of their next turn. If they fail the saving throw by 5 or more, they must Dash away from the Nalfeshnee, effectively limiting their actions. Additionally, it has Magic Resistance, which provides it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it hard to incapacitate through magical means.

During its turn, the Nalfeshnee can make multiple attacks. Its Multiattack allows it to perform one Bite attack, one Gore attack, and two Claw attacks in one action. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit, and if it strikes a frightened creature, it deals 28 piercing damage, while also allowing the Nalfeshnee to regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt. The Claw attack also has a +10 to hit and deals 19 slashing damage. The Gore attack, also with a +10 to hit, inflicts 21 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

For its mobility, the Nalfeshnee has the ability to Teleport as a bonus action, allowing it to relocate up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, enabling it to maintain advantageous positioning in battle. 

The Nalfeshnee also has a notable reaction called Sudden Feast. When a creature it can see within 20 feet is reduced to 0 hit points or dies, the Nalfeshnee can move toward that creature without provoking opportunity attacks. If it reaches within 5 feet, it can feast on the creature, regaining hit points equal to twice the defeated creature’s challenge rating or class level. This ability not only provides immediate healing but can also impose disadvantage on the creature's next death saving throw, preventing it from easily recovering from its death state. 

Overall, the Nalfeshnee presents a mix of deception, fear, and brutal strength, making it a unique and dangerous adversary for any adventuring party. Its combination of physical attacks, special abilities, and mobility make it a versatile threat on the battlefield.</detail>
