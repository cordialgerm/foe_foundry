<MonsterName/>Nalfeshnee (Demon)</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>A Nalfeshnee is a grotesque, towering demon that combines the features of a boar, an ape, and a vulture. Its massive, bloated body and wings give it a horrifying, bloated appearance, and its tusked face is filled with hunger and rage. Nalfeshnees are known for their intelligence and cruelty, often serving as judges or overseers in the Abyss. They can unleash waves of demonic energy, spreading madness and confusion among their enemies. In battle, they rely on both their physical strength and their ability to summon dark magic to crush their foes. Though they are brutish in appearance, Nalfeshnees are cunning and manipulative, using their power to command legions of lesser demons.</summary>
