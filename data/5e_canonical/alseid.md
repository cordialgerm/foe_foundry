<MonsterName/>Alseid</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Alseid is a medium-sized monstrosity that embodies chaotic neutral alignment. Renowned for its agility and stealth in forested environments, this creature excels in both ranged and melee combat. With an Armor Class of 14 provided by its leather armor, it has a moderate level of protection. The Alseid has 33 hit points, derived from rolling six eight-sided dice plus an additional six points, which indicates an average endurance for creatures within its challenge rating of 1/2, allowing it to remain a valid threat while presenting a reasonable challenge for lower-level adventurers. Its primary strengths include high Dexterity, which affords it good initiative and agility in combat, as well as notable skills in Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival. However, the Alseid has weaknesses, having relatively low Constitution, Intelligence, and Charisma, which can affect its resilience and effectiveness in social interactions and spellcasting.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Alseid are as follows: Strength is 13, giving it an average modifier (+1) for physical attacks; Dexterity is 17, allowing for good (+3) agility, impacting initiatives and ranged attacks; Constitution is 12, which is average (+1), providing modest health; Intelligence is 8, yielding a bad (-1) modifier for knowledge checks; Wisdom is 16, granting a good (+3) modifier for perception and insight; and Charisma is 8, resulting in a bad (-1) modifier for social interactions. 

In terms of special abilities, the Alseid possesses the "Woodfriend" trait. When in a forest, this ability allows the Alseid to leave no tracks and automatically discern true north, significantly enhancing its stealth and navigation capabilities in natural environments.

The Alseid can perform several actions during combat. It can attack with a spear, which allows for either a melee or ranged weapon attack. The hit modifier is +3, and it has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 20 to 60 feet for ranged attacks. A successful hit deals 4 piercing damage if used one-handed or 5 piercing damage if wielded two-handed. The Alseid can also attack with a shortbow, using a +5 hit modifier along with a range of 80 to 320 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, it can utilize a thorned staff for a melee attack that also involves a +3 hit modifier, inflicting 4 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 5 piercing damage due to its thorny nature. The "Thorn Bolt" is a ranged attack option, executed with a +5 hit modifier and a range of 120 feet, delivering 8 piercing damage on a successful hit.

As a spellcaster, the Alseid has access to a variety of spells, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 13. At will, it can cast "Animal Friendship," which allows it to befriend a creature, "Animal Messenger," which enables it to send messages via animals, and "Druidcraft," which offers minor magical effects related to nature. The Alseid can also cast "Cure Wounds," "Faerie Fire," and "Lesser Restoration" once per day each. "Cure Wounds" heals damage to a target, "Faerie Fire" outlines creatures in light, making them easier to hit, and "Lesser Restoration" removes conditions such as blindness or paralysis. Collectively, these spells enhance the Alseid's versatility both in and out of combat settings, providing support to allies or hindrances to its foes.</detail>
