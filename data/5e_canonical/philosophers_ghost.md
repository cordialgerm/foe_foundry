<summary>The Philosopher's Ghost is a Medium-sized ooze with a burning presence that symbolizes profound thoughts turned chaotic. Functioning primarily as an offensive creature, it possesses the ability to inflict persistent fire damage and is uniquely adept at moving through narrow spaces without hindrance. It thrives in combat scenarios where it can maximize its area effects, particularly in environments where targets can be caught off guard or remain immobilized. Despite its strengths, the Philosopher's Ghost is vulnerable to water, which can severely impair its mobility and effectively neutralize its burning touch damage capabilities. Its defensive capabilities are bolstered by its immunities and resistances but are somewhat offset by its low Constitution score, which results in an average resistance to general damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Philosopher's Ghost has an Armor Class of 13, making it relatively easy to hit compared to more heavily armored foes. With 77 hit points derived from 14d8 + 14, it possesses a decent threshold for absorbing damage, suggesting good longevity in combat encounters. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 4, which indicates that a party of low-level adventurers may find it to be a challenging opponent. 

In terms of attributes, the Philosopher's Ghost exhibits a Strength of 9 (-1 modifier, very bad), a Dexterity of 17 (+3 modifier, good), and a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier, average). Its Intelligence of 2 (-4 modifier, very bad) and Charisma of 6 (-2 modifier, bad) highlight its lack of mental acuity and social competence, while it has a Wisdom of 10 (+0 modifier, average). This setup emphasizes its role as a physical threat rather than a tactical thinker or social participant.

The Philosopher's Ghost possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat efficacy. With the Illumination ability, it emits bright light within a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, which can affect visibility for both itself and its foes. The Persistent Burning Form grants it the unique ability to move through extremely narrow spaces, and any creature that comes into contact with it or is attacked while nearby suffers fire damage. When the Philosopher's Ghost enters a hostile creature's space, it causes immediate fire damage and ignites the target, subjecting them to ongoing damage until they extinguish the flames.

The Siege Monster trait allows the Philosopher's Ghost to deal double damage to structures and objects, making it effective in scenarios where it needs to break through barriers. However, the Water Vulnerability ability is a significant drawback. When fully immersed in water, its mobility is halved until it becomes incapacitated, rendering it unable to cause damage or escape effectively until it can dry out.

In combat, the Philosopher's Ghost can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to perform two burning touch attacks in one turn. The Burning Touch is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 fire damage on a hit. Additionally, any creature hit by this attack suffers a burning lesion, incurring extra fire damage at the start of their turns until treated or healed. This creates a sense of urgency for opponents, as they may not only want to escape the Philosopher's Ghost but also attend to their burning wounds promptly.

Overall, the Philosopher's Ghost represents a unique blend of danger and vulnerability, primarily functioning as a relentless fire-inflicting entity while also being obligated to navigate the battlefield with caution in wet environments. Its abilities and weaknesses create dynamic interactions within gameplay, compelling players to devise strategies to counter its threats effectively.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Illumination:** The philosopher's ghost sheds bright light in a 20-foot-radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
- **Persistent Burning Form:** The philosopher's ghost can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the ghost or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the philosopher's ghost can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire; until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
- **Siege Monster:** The philosopher's ghost deals double damage to objects and structures.
- **Water Vulnerability:** If completely immersed in water, a philosopher's ghost's movement halves each round until it stops moving completely, becoming incapacitated, and contact with it no longer causes damage. As soon as any portion of it is exposed to the air again, it resumes moving at full speed.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The philosopher's ghost makes two burning touch attacks.
- **Burning Touch:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it suffers a burning lesion, taking 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Any creature can take an action to soothe the burning lesion with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The lesion is also soothed if the target receives magical healing.
