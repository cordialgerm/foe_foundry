<summary>The Moldering Devil is a small, lawful evil fiend known for its corrupting touch and ability to decay food and water in its vicinity. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it is a lower-tier threat, but its capabilities can catch unsuspecting adventurers off guard. It has a respectable Armor Class of 13 due to its natural armor, allowing it to withstand some attacks while its 27 hit points provide a decent buffer in combat. With a speed of 30 feet and the ability to fly up to 40 feet with its Field Hopper ability, it can maneuver effectively in battle. The creature excels in creating hazardous environments where food and drink are rendered poisonous, making it a unique opponent in encounters. However, its low Charisma at -2 renders it less effective in social situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Moldering Devil has the following attributes with their corresponding modifiers: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 6 (-2). The Strength modifier of +2 is good for melee attacks, while the Constitution modifier contributes to its resilience. Wisdom is also good, enhancing its perception skills. However, the Dexterity score is average, meaning it is neither particularly nimble nor clumsy. The low Charisma score denotes a very bad capability for social interactions or influences.

In terms of skills, the Moldering Devil has a +2 to Perception, which is good, providing it with heightened awareness of its surroundings. For resistances and immunities, this creature is immune to fire and poison damage while possessing resistance to cold damage. It is also immune to the poisoned condition. Its darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and with a passive Perception of 12, it can spot hidden creatures moderately well. The creature can communicate in Common and Infernal languages.

The Moldering Devil has several special abilities: 

- **Devil’s Sight:** This ability allows the Moldering Devil to see in magical darkness as though it were dim light, making it a dangerous foe in dark environments. 
- **Field Hopper:** This ability enables it to fly for distances of 40 feet during its turn, provided it starts and ends its movement on a solid surface like the ground or a rooftop. If it fails to land properly by the end of its turn, it falls, suffering falling damage. This allows it to maintain a strategic height in combat but also carries a risk if not managed carefully.
- **Rotting Death:** Upon its demise, the Moldering Devil unleashes its corruption, causing all food and drink within a 100-foot radius to decay as the devil's Touch of Rot trait activates.
- **Touch of Rot:** This trait makes contact with any food or beverage result in immediate decay, rendering it inedible or undrinkable. If a creature consumes such contaminated food or drink, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in taking 7 (2d6) poison damage and becoming poisoned for 24 hours, whereas a successful save results in halving the damage and being poisoned for just 1 hour.

In addition, the Moldering Devil can attack with a **Bite**, which is a melee weapon attack that allows it to hit with a +4 bonus to hit against a target within 5 feet. This attack deals 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage combined with 3 (1d6) necrotic damage, making it an effective option for dealing damage in close quarters. 

Overall, the Moldering Devil presents a unique challenge that focuses on environmental hazards and offensive capabilities rather than brute force, making it a compelling adversary for adventurers.</detail>
