<summary>A Glabrezu is a towering, demonic creature with the body of a monstrous beast and four arms—two ending in massive pincers, and two in clawed hands. These demons are masters of deception, often offering tempting deals and corrupting mortals through manipulation. Despite their cunning and deceitful nature, Glabrezus are also powerful combatants, capable of tearing through foes with their pincers or using their innate magical abilities to summon darkness, cast illusions, and control others. They serve as generals in the demonic armies of the Abyss, relishing both physical combat and psychological warfare.</summary>

<summary>The Glabrezu is a large fiend known for its chaotic and evil nature, making it a formidable enemy in combat and a dangerous entity in social encounters. With an Armor Class of 17 and a significant pool of 157 hit points, it has solid defenses and can endure prolonged engagements. It is rated as a Challenge Rating 10, indicating that it presents a significant challenge to a party of adventurers. Its physical capabilities are strong, boasting a Strength score of 20 (+5), allowing it to perform powerful melee attacks, and it also possesses high Constitution and Charisma scores, giving it exceptional durability and effectiveness in manipulation. However, its weaknesses include vulnerability to radiant damage and limitations against certain types of magic. The Glabrezu’s unique abilities, especially its access to the spell Wish, make it a creature that not only fights fiercely but also can alter the course of events with the right conditions.</summary>

<detail>

The Glabrezu has a range of attributes including Strength 20 (+5), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 20 (+5), Intelligence 18 (+4), Wisdom 18 (+4), and Charisma 18 (+4). Its high Strength allows it to be very effective in physical combat. Its Dexterity provides a good level of agility but is not exceptional, leading to an average impact on initiative rolls. The exceptional Constitution score ensures it has a strong chance of withstanding damage, while its high Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores enable it to excel in mental challenges and social interactions. The modifiers for saving throws are as follows: Strength +9 (very good), Constitution +9 (very good), Wisdom +8 (good), and Charisma +8 (good). The Glabrezu has skills in Deception at +8 (good) and Stealth at +7 (average). It is immune to poison damage, resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage, and can only be affected by magical weapons, which presents both an advantage and a limitation against certain types of foes. The Glabrezu has truesight up to 120 feet, allowing it to see through illusions, and it communicates in Abyssal and through telepathy within 120 feet.

The Glabrezu's special abilities amplify its menace in combat. Its Chaotic Evil nature empowers its aura, making it a compelling adversary. With Magic Resistance, it gains advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, significantly increasing its survivability against spellcasting foes.

In terms of actions, the Glabrezu can perform a Multiattack, making two pincer attacks. Each Pincer attack has a +9 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is Medium or smaller, the Glabrezu grapples them, with an escape DC of 17. This ability to grapple makes it challenging for smaller foes to escape its grasp, as it can hold two targets simultaneously. The Wish ability, usable once every 30 days, allows it to cast the spell without any material components but demands a cruel act from the target in return.

For bonus actions, the Glabrezu can perform Fists attacks, which also have a +9 to hit and deliver 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If it is grappling a target with both pincers, it can execute a Rend attack, dealing 27 (4d10 + 5) slashing damage, which can be fatal, tearing the victim in two. The Glabrezu can also cast Darkness, creating magical darkness in a 15-foot radius that is impenetrable to darkvision and nonmagical light. Finally, it can use Confusion once per day, targeting up to three creatures within 90 feet. Each target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes confused for 1 minute, severely hindering its ability to act coherently in combat. This adds another layer of chaos and unpredictability to encounters with the Glabrezu.

The Glabrezu is a formidable large fiend classified as a demon, known for its cunning and brutal combat capabilities. With an Armor Class of 17, it possesses robust defenses, enhanced by its natural armor. The creature boasts 154 hit points, making it quite durable in battles. It has a speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively. The Glabrezu has a Challenge Rating of 9, signifying it is a powerful adversary for mid-level adventurers. Among its many strengths, the Glabrezu's Demonic Resilience grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. Additionally, Magic Resistance provides it with an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it a challenging opponent in magical encounters.

The ability scores of the Glabrezu demonstrate its strength, agility, and mental prowess. It has a Strength score of 9, indicating exceptional physical capability; this is important for its melee attacks. With a Dexterity score of 2, its agility is average, but it compensates with a Constitution score of 9, providing it decent endurance. The Intelligence score of 4 indicates it can employ strategic thinking tactics, while a Wisdom score of 7 signifies very good perception and insight abilities. Finally, the Charisma score of 7 allows the Glabrezu to manipulate and influence other creatures effectively.

The Glabrezu's special abilities enhance its combat proficiency. Its Demonic Resilience is a significant defensive trait, significantly reducing damage from elemental attacks. Magic Resistance boosts its survivability against magical effects. The Point Blank Grappler ability allows the Glabrezu to maintain accuracy when casting spells while grappling a target, which enhances its offensive capabilities in close quarters.

In terms of actions, the Glabrezu can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make two Claw attacks and two Pincer attacks, or execute four Crackling Flame Bolt ranged spell attacks. The Claw attack offers +9 to hit and deals 10 slashing damage along with additional fire and lightning damage. The Pincer has a longer reach of 10 feet and delivers 16 bludgeoning damage; it also grapples a Medium or smaller target with an escape DC of 17, restricting their movement. The Crackling Flame Bolt ranged attack has a +7 to hit, delivering fire and lightning damage combined, making it a potent option for ranged combat.

As a bonus action, the Glabrezu can utilize Manipulating Whispers to influence a creature's actions from a distance. It targets a creature within 120 feet, and if the target fails a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, it can be compelled to act out in various ways—either becoming boastful and vulnerable, obsessively checking its valuables, or lashing out in anger against an ally. This manipulation can change the tide of battle by distracting and disrupting the actions of adversaries.</detail>
