<summary>The Valkyrie is a powerful celestial creature that serves as a warrior and protector on the battlefield. With a neutral alignment, it provides both offensive and supportive abilities, enhancing its allies while dealing significant radiant damage to its enemies. The Valkyrie's best strengths include a high armor class of 18, a substantial pool of hit points totaling 150, and impressive saving throws, particularly in charisma and constitution. Its notable weaknesses include vulnerability to magical damage types not specified in its resistances, making it susceptible to well-placed spell attacks. With a challenge rating of 11, the Valkyrie poses a formidable challenge for lower-level adventurers, embodying the role of both a fierce combatant and a divine healer.</summary>

<detail>

The Valkyrie's attributes reflect its celestial nature. It has a Strength score of 18, granting a +4 modifier, which is considered very good for melee attacks. Its Dexterity and Charisma are both also at 18, providing +4 modifiers that empower its offensive capabilities and enhance its spellcasting. The Constitution score of 16 offers a +3 modifier, giving it good resilience in combat. Its Intelligence score of 12 results in a +1 modifier, which is average but not particularly useful for its role. Lastly, its Wisdom score of 19 provides a +4 modifier, which is very good for perception checks and saving throws.

The Valkyrie possesses several powerful abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. The Aura of Valor grants friendly creatures wielding weapons within a 30-foot radius advantage on weapon attack rolls and ability checks, significantly improving their chances of success. At the beginning of each turn, the Valkyrie can choose to exclude friendly creatures from this effect without requiring any action. Its Immortal Nature means it does not require food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. Additionally, the Magic Resistance ability gives the Valkyrie advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, aiding its resistance against enemy casters. Its Radiant Weapons property ensures that all of its weapon attacks are considered magical and deals an extra 16 radiant damage, making each successful hit devastating for foes.

In terms of actions, the Valkyrie can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to utilize its Gaze of Doom ability before making two Longsword attacks and one Spear attack, or alternatively, it can opt for three Radiant Bolt attacks for effective ranged damage. The Longsword delivers an impressive slashing damage of 8 (1d8 + 4) or 9 (1d10 + 4) if used two-handed, adding 16 (3d10) radiant damage. The Spear can be used for both melee and ranged attacks, delivering 7 (1d6 + 4) or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, plus the same radiant damage as the longsword. The Radiant Bolt acts as a potent ranged spell attack, inflicting substantial damage of 26 (4d10 + 4) radiant. The Gaze of Doom can inflict fear upon an enemy, requiring them to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw to resist being frightened for one minute, offering a tactical advantage by potentially incapacitating high-threat targets. Lastly, the Healing Touch ability allows the Valkyrie to restore 21 (6d6) hit points to an ally, freeing them from status conditions like curses and blindness.

The Valkyrie also has a noteworthy reaction known as Ascension. When a friendly creature within its Aura of Valor is knocked to 0 hit points while engaged in melee combat, the Valkyrie can reincarnate that creature as a gladiator. If the newly reborn gladiator manages to reduce at least three enemies to 0 hit points within one minute, it will transform into an einherjar, which further enhances its power. The Valkyrie can use this ability for up to two creatures per hour, making it a pivotal element in battle for sustaining ally presence and potentially turning the tide in their favor.</detail>
