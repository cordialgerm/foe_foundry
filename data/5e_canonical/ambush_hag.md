<summary>The Ambush Hag is a Medium fey creature known for its cunning and deception. With an Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of 156 hit points, it poses a formidable challenge to adventurers with a Challenge Rating of 9. Hags are often characterized by their sinister nature, and the Ambush Hag excels at ambushing unsuspecting targets, using its high Dexterity and Charisma to enhance its stealth and spellcasting abilities. While it has good offensive capabilities, especially with its poison-infused attacks, the creature's reliance on deceptive tactics can make it vulnerable if its tricks are discerned by attentive foes.</summary>

<detail>

The Ambush Hag's attributes are as follows: Strength 3 (bad), Dexterity 8 (very good), Constitution 3 (bad), Intelligence 3 (bad), Wisdom 2 (average), and Charisma 8 (very good). Its exceptional Dexterity allows for high stealth, granting it a Stealth score of 18, and it can see in complete darkness up to 120 feet with darkvision. The hag can communicate in Common and Sylvan, making it versatile in interactions with various characters.

Among its special abilities, Fey Resilience grants the hag resistance to being charmed or rendered unconscious, making it difficult to incapacitate. Its Mimicry ability allows it to imitate animal sounds and humanoid voices, although characters may discern the ruse with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check. With Spider Climb, the hag can navigate vertical surfaces effortlessly, enhancing its ambush tactics.

In combat, the Ambush Hag can employ a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two Claw attacks or three Poison Spray attacks in a single turn, integrating its spellcasting abilities for additional damage. The Claw attack has a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 13 slashing damage plus 18 poison damage. Additionally, targets must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for one minute, repeating the save at the end of each turn. This ability can significantly incapacitate foes, making the hag a dangerous opponent. The Poison Spray is a ranged spell attack with the same +8 to hit, capable of inflicting 22 poison damage. Targets must also succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become restrained until the end of their next turn.

In its spellcasting, the Ambush Hag can cast a variety of spells using its Charisma score for spell attack rolls and determining the saving throw DC of 16. It can use the spells message, minor illusion, and prestidigitation at will, while having daily access to more powerful spells such as blur, charm, and hallucinatory terrain, which can creatively manipulate the battlefield. Once per day, it can cast hypnotic pattern, major image, and seeming, allowing it to control and confuse opponents effectively.

As a bonus action, the hag can create an Illusory Appearance, disguising itself as another creature of similar size and shape. The illusion can be dispelled by the hag or if it is killed. Physical inspection reveals discrepancies, but discerning the illusion requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check, making it a clever tactic to escape or deceive foes. 

Overall, the Ambush Hag is a resourceful and deadly opponent, blending physical attacks with potent illusions and the ability to control the battlefield, ensuring that it can catch adventurers off guard and manipulate encounters to its favor.</detail>
