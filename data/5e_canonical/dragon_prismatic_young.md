The dragon’s saving throws are:

- Charisma +5, also good for charm effects.

In terms of skills, it has a perception score of +2, which is average but supplemented by its high passive perception of 18. The Prismatic Young Dragon is immune to radiant damage, and it cannot be blinded, which may alter how it combats certain types of foes. It possesses senses including blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision extending to 120 feet, enhancing its ability to detect creatures in the dark. The languages it understands are Common and Draconic, allowing it to communicate effectively with a broad range of beings.

In combat, the Prismatic Young Dragon can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to deliver one bite and two claw attacks in a single turn. Its Bite attack has a +7 to hit and inflicts 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage, making it a strong choice for close-range assaults. Each Claw attack also has a +7 to hit and deals 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, being efficient for dealing sustained damage over time.

One of the dragon's most notable abilities is the Light Beam, which can be used after a recharge of 5-6. This action projects a beam of radiant energy in a long line, affecting creatures within a 60-foot range that is 5 feet wide. Targets must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 36 (8d8) radiant damage, or they take half damage on a successful save. 

Furthermore, the dragon has Spellcasting abilities, with a spellcasting DC of 14 utilizing Intelligence. It can cast at will dancing lights for basic illumination, and it has three uses per day of charm person, capable of charming a humanoid for persuasion or tactical advantages. Once per day, it can use color spray, which can blind a group of opponents in a sweeping area, enhancing its tactical prowess in combat. Finally, it can cast prismatic spray, a potent spell that unleashes a burst of colorful energy, dealing various effects based on the color that it strikes, significantly impacting the battlefield. This diverse arsenal makes the Prismatic Young Dragon a complex and engaging opponent for any adventuring party.</detail>
