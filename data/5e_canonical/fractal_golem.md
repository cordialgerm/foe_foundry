<summary>The Fractal Golem is a large, unaligned construct that serves as a formidable combatant in battle. It possesses strong defenses, with a high Armor Class of 18, making it quite resilient against physical attacks. With 8 hit points, the golem can endure some damage before being defeated. Its Challenge Rating of 8 indicates that it is a formidable foe for a party of adventurers. The golem is particularly notable for its unique ability to replicate itself upon destruction, creating duplicates that can continue to threaten enemies. However, its intelligence is very low, meaning it cannot form complex strategies, and it is entirely immune to mental effects. The golem has a mix of skills that contribute to its survivability in combat, but it is vulnerable to being overrun by coordinated attacks due to its relatively low hit points. </summary>

<detail>

The Fractal Golem has the following attributes and mechanics: 
- Strength: 16 (+3), which suggests a good capacity for physical tasks and combat effectiveness, making its melee attacks quite potent.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), providing an average ability to avoid attacks but not particularly agile.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), contributing to its good durability and resistance against effects that may harm its physical wellbeing.
- Intelligence: 6 (-2), indicating that the golem struggles with logic and problem-solving, which is very bad for any puzzles or knowledge-based challenges.
- Wisdom: 8 (-1), suggesting that it has a bad perception of its surroundings, meaning it may not be adept at noticing threats.
- Charisma: 1 (-5), indicating very poor social skills, making it ineffective in any interactions that require charm or presence.

Combat skills are varied, with notable abilities such as:
- Perception: +2, allowing it to achieve an average level of awareness in detecting nearby threats.
- Stealth: +4, enabling the golem to move unnoticed to a good degree, useful for ambush strategies.
- Survival: +5, which is a very good score for tracking and enduring in adverse conditions.

The Fractal Golem is immune to several forms of damage, particularly poison and psychic damage, and it is invulnerable to non-magical physical attacks that are not made with adamantine weapons. It is also immune to a variety of debilitating conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, making it a reliable frontline combatant. Additionally, it has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark conditions effectively. It understands the languages of its creator, though it cannot communicate verbally.

In terms of special abilities:
- Fractalize: When the golem is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes, dealing 4 (1d8) force damage to nearby creatures unless they succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. This not only damages but also creates two smaller duplicates of itself, maintaining pressure on the battlefield. The duplicates act on the same turn, meaning they can overwhelm opponents quickly.
- Immutable Form: This grants the golem exceptional resilience, as it cannot be altered in form by spells or effects.
- Magic Resistance: Providing the golem with advantage on saving throws against magical effects makes it quite robust against spellcasters.
- Magic Weapons: Its melee attacks count as magical, allowing it to bypass certain resistances that many creatures possess.

The golem's primary action in combat is:
- Slam: This melee weapon attack has a +6 bonus to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals significant damage of 13 (3d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, making its strikes impactful and capable of threatening players if they get too close. 

Overall, the Fractal Golem represents a formidable challenge, especially when considering its ability to replicate, making it a unique threat on the battlefield.</detail>
