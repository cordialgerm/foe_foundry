<summary>The Pixie is a diminutive fey creature known for its whimsical and mischievous nature. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it is generally weaker in terms of health and damage output, possessing only 2 hit points and dealing minimal piercing damage with its thorn dagger. Its greatest strengths lie in its agility and magical abilities, highlighted by a high Dexterity score of 20, providing it with exceptional stealth capabilities and a rapid flight speed of 30 feet. The Pixie's ability to resist spells with its Magic Resistance makes it a challenging opponent for spellcasters, offering strategic advantages during encounters. Its primary weaknesses include low Strength and Constitution scores, rendering it physically weak and unable to sustain much damage. The Pixie's skills in perception and stealth further enhance its versatility, allowing it to remain hidden while observing its surroundings.</summary>

The Pixie has several special abilities:
- Faerie Light: As a bonus action, the Pixie can create dim light that extends 30 feet around it or extinguish its glow, allowing it to navigate or hide effectively.
- Magic Resistance: The Pixie has an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it significantly harder for magical attacks to affect it.

- Thorn Dagger: This attack has a +7 to hit and can be used in melee or ranged scenarios, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 10/30 feet. A successful hit deals 1 piercing damage.
- Faerie Blessing (usable three times per day): The Pixie can target a willing creature within 30 feet, granting one of three benefits that last for one hour: truesight up to 120 feet, the effects of its Magic Resistance, or the ability to speak Sylvan.
- Faerie Curse: This action targets a creature within 30 feet that is not already cursed. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or suffer from a magical curse lasting 1 hour. The Pixie can select the curse's effect upon failure, which could blind the target, charm them, induce sleep if already charmed, or transform its head into that of a beast, making it unable to speak. The curse can be lifted in several ways, including the Pixie's actions, damage taken, or specific spells.

As a bonus action, the Pixie can use:
- Invisibility: This ability renders the Pixie and its equipment invisible until it attacks, casts a spell, becomes incapacitated, or chooses to end the effect with another bonus action, enabling it to ambush or escape with ease.</detail>
