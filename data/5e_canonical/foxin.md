<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Foxin is a small fey creature exuding a neutral alignment, characterized by its unique blend of charm and agility. With a decent Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor, it is not overly formidable but possesses a notable speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat. The Foxin has a Challenge Rating of 1/2, indicating it's a relatively low-level threat, yielding 100 experience points upon defeat. This creature showcases various strengths including its high Dexterity and Charisma scores, rated at +3, making it both nimble and inherently persuasive. It is particularly adept at perception, gaining a +4 bonus in that skill, and is immune to being charmed, giving it considerable durability in social encounters and battles. However, the Foxin's Constitution and Intelligence scores sit at a modest +2 and +0 respectively, which can be seen as average, leaving it vulnerable to attacks that target its physical stamina and mental acuity.</summary>

<detail>

The Foxin has several special abilities that enhance its survival and efficacy in encounters. Its Keen Senses ability allows it to have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to sight, hearing, or smell, making it very good at detecting hidden threats or detecting other creatures. The Neutral Presence ability enables the Foxin to exude an air of belonging, causing other creatures to perceive its presence as unobtrusive. This makes the Foxin excellent for infiltration and provides strategic advantages when navigating enemy territory.

In combat, the Foxin can perform a Bite attack as a melee weapon attack. It has a +5 to hit, allowing it to successfully strike targets frequently. Upon a successful hit, it deals 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. Additionally, the target must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, disrupting the target's action and providing the Foxin with tactical superiority.

The Foxin also has a unique special ability called Illusory Calm. This ability targets any number of non-Foxin creatures within a 30-foot radius, requiring each target to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they are treated as charmed, perceiving no enemies or dangers for one minute. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield dynamics by neutralizing threats temporarily, though affected creatures can repeat their saving throws at the end of their turns to shake off the effect. Notably, if the charmed creature takes any harm, it gains advantage on the saving throw, creating a dynamic interaction in combat scenarios.

Overall, the Foxin is a cunning and elusive creature, adept in the arts of stealth and charm, making it a versatile opponent or ally in various D&D scenarios.</detail>
