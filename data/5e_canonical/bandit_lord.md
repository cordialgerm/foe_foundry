<summary>The Bandit Lord is a formidable and cunning leader among non-lawful humanoids, embodying the essence of a skilled combatant and strategic thinker in battle. With an impressive armor class of 16 and 91 hit points, this medium humanoid is capable of withstanding significant damage while dealing out fearsome attacks. The Bandit Lord is particularly effective in a group, using its ability to gain advantage on attacks when allies are nearby, making it dangerous both as a front-line fighter and a tactical commander. Although it possesses good strength and dexterity, its moderate wisdom and charisma suggest that it might not excel in skills that require keen insight or persuasion. Notable for its brute strength and tactical acumen, it is capable of leading other bandits into battle effectively, though it may struggle against well-coordinated and heavily armored opponents.</summary>

The Bandit Lord has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16 (+3) which translates to a good modifier of +5 for strength saving throws, making it effective at physical challenges and melee combat.

- Charisma: 14 (+2) yields an average modifier of +2 for charisma saving throws, allowing it some presence in social interactions.

The Bandit Lord has a passive perception of 10 and can communicate in any two languages, enhancing its tactical versatility in both combat and negotiation situations.

Special abilities enhance the Bandit Lord’s effectiveness:
- Brute: This ability allows the Bandit Lord to deal an additional die of damage when it hits with melee weapons, significantly increasing its damage output.
- Pack Tactics: It has the advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one ally is within 5 feet, showcasing its strategy in group encounters.

During combat, the Bandit Lord can perform the following actions:
- Multiattack: This allows it to make two attacks with a longsword and one with a dagger in a single turn, maximizing its potential damage.
- Longsword: The Bandit Lord uses a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. It can deal 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage if wielding it with two hands.
- Dagger: With this weapon, it can either perform a melee attack or a ranged attack, also with a +5 to hit. It deals 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage in melee, or 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage if used as a melee weapon.

The Bandit Lord has a powerful Leadership ability that recharges after a short or long rest. For one minute, it can give commands that allow allies within 30 feet to add a d4 to their attack rolls or saving throws, amplifying the group's effectiveness.

For reactions, the Bandit Lord can perform:
- Parry: This reaction can add 2 to its AC against a melee attack that would hit, allowing it to better defend itself in combat.
- Protect Me!: This action enables the Bandit Lord to shift behind an ally within 5 feet when targeted by an attack, redirecting that attack to the ally, demonstrating its tactical awareness.

Overall, the Bandit Lord is a dynamic and aggressive character that excels in both direct combat and the management of battlefield dynamics, making it a dangerous opponent to confront in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition.</detail>

<p data-content-chunk-id="217d742b-35f0-46a5-90c8-dbbfffefdd9c">The black knight commander strikes an imposing figure upon its chosen mount; one that inspires bloodlust in its allies and fear in its foes.

Whether the knight fights for a dark lord or a demonic god, all its foes will be trampled into the dust and their families slaughtered so there can be no revenge. The only victory is a total victory.</p>
