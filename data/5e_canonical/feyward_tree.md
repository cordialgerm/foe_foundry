<summary>The Feyward Tree is a huge construct that embodies a blend of magical resilience and physical might, making it a formidable adversary in combat. With an impressive armor class of 17 and 126 hit points, the Feyward Tree is quite durable, capable of taking significant damage before being incapacitated. It excels in melee engagements with its potent attacks and has several special abilities that protect it from various damage types and conditions. However, its low mobility, limited to walking at only 20 feet, and its vulnerability to cold damage are notable weaknesses. Challenging to defeat, this creature operates best in proximity to its foes, where it can leverage its powerful attacks and ability to control the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Feyward Tree possesses the following attributes: Strength is 25 (+7) which means it has exceptional physical power, Dexterity is 10 (+0), indicating average agility, Constitution is 18 (+4), showcasing very good toughness, Intelligence is 3 (-4) revealing a very bad capacity for logic and reasoning, Wisdom is 11 (+0) denoting average perceptiveness, and Charisma is 6 (-2) marking it as having very bad personal magnetism. 

In terms of saving throws, it has Dexterity +3, Wisdom +3, and Charisma +1, which are all considered average. Skills-wise, it has a Perception modifier of +3, considered good, allowing it to detect hidden threats. It is immune to lightning, poison, and psychic damage, demonstrating its remarkable resilience, while it also has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, except for those delivered with adamantine weapons. Furthermore, it is immune to several conditions, including being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, which is exceptional for maintaining its effectiveness in battle. With darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 13, the Feyward Tree has an average capacity to notice hidden creatures. It understands the languages of its creator, although it is incapable of speaking.

The Feyward Tree has several special abilities that enhance its combat capabilities. It suffers an aversion to cold; when hit with cold damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. Being a construct, it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, granting it certain advantages in lengthy conflicts. Its Razor-Leafed Branch attacks are magical, and upon a successful hit, the tree inflicts an extra 9 (2d8) force damage, substantially increasing the potency of its melee strikes. Due to its immutable form, it is immune to effects that would alter its shape, making it a challenging opponent to deal with. Additionally, the Feyward Tree showcases lightning absorption, regaining hit points equivalent to any lightning damage it would normally take. With magic resistance, it has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability. Finally, creatures that move away from the Feyward Tree provoke an opportunity attack within 15 feet, which adds a layer of tactical advantage during encounters.

In combat, the Feyward Tree can perform a multiattack, allowing it to make two Razor-Leafed Branch attacks in one turn. Each of these melee weapon attacks has a +10 to hit with a reach of 15 feet, dealing 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage plus an additional 9 (2d8) force damage on a successful hit. For crowd control, it has an ability called Flaying Leaves, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the Feyward Tree to launch a barrage of razor-sharp leaves in a 20-foot area, forcing each creature in that range to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 28 (8d6) slashing damage, or half as much on a successful save, making it a devastating area-of-effect attack.</detail>
