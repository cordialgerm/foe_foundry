<summary>A Lemure is the lowest form of devil, a mindless and formless mass of flesh that writhes and groans in eternal torment. These pitiful creatures are the damned souls of mortals, reduced to their most basic form in the Nine Hells. Lemures have no will of their own and are often used as fodder in the endless wars between devils and demons. Though weak and easily destroyed, Lemures are nearly impossible to kill permanently, as they reform in the Hells after being slain. They are slow and grotesque, serving as a reminder of the eternal suffering that awaits those who fall into infernal hands.</summary>

<summary>The Lemure is a Medium Fiend, typically serving as a low-ranking denizen of the infernal realms. With a notably low Armor Class of 7 and only 13 hit points, it is not particularly durable in combat. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/8, making it a minor threat in a D&D encounter. Its strengths lie in its damage immunities to fire and poison, as well as its ability to see in the dark and penetrate magical darkness. However, its physical and mental attributes are exceptionally poor, especially in Dexterity and Intelligence, where it suffers severe penalties. Overall, the Lemure is not a formidable opponent on its own but can serve as an interesting encounter due to its unholy nature and special abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Lemure has the following ability scores: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 4 (-3), Constitution 10 (+0), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 2 (-4). It possesses average Strength and Constitution, but its Dexterity is very bad, making it easy to hit. The Intelligence and Charisma scores are exceptionally poor, indicating a lack of mental acuity and social capability.

In terms of defensive capabilities, the Lemure is immune to fire and poison damage, making it resilient against those types of attacks. It has resistance to cold damage and is immune to the poisoned condition, which helps mitigate the risks of certain status effects. The creature has darkvision with a range of 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light, and it has a passive Perception score of 10, which is average for noticing hidden threats. The Lemure understands the Infernal language but is unable to speak, limiting its ability to communicate.

The Lemure possesses some notable special abilities. First, "Devils Sight" allows it to see in magical darkness, giving it a significant tactical advantage against opponents relying on such effects. The "Eerie Groan" ability adds a haunting auditory dimension; while it can see a non-devil creature within 100 feet, it emits a groan that can be heard from 300 feet away, potentially disorienting or alarming nearby characters. Lastly, its "Lawful Evil" nature radiates a palpable aura that may affect interactions with other creatures, particularly those sensitive to alignments.

In terms of offensive capabilities, the Lemure can use a melee weapon attack called "Fist." It has a +2 to hit with this attack, which is average, and can reach targets 5 feet away. On a hit, it deals 2 points of bludgeoning damage (1d4), which is minimal. Overall, the Lemure is not a strong combatant; however, its unique characteristics and thematic presence as a lowly fiend could add flavor to encounters for players navigating infernal environments.

The Lemure is a Medium fiend classified as a devil, known for its resilience and its connection to the Hells. It has a low Armor Class of 8 and 17 hit points, making it somewhat fragile for combat situations. However, its unique abilities and resistances give it a niche role as a harbinger of chaos and minor torment, often serving more powerful devils. The Lemure has a challenge rating of 1/4, indicating it is a minor threat to adventurers. Its strengths lie in its immunities to fire and poison damage, as well as its ability to rejuvenate after death, making it a persistent foe. On the other hand, its low Dexterity and Intelligence scores leave it vulnerable to more agile and intelligent foes.

The Lemure has the following attributes: a Strength score of 12 (+2 modifier, considered average), Dexterity of 8 (-2 modifier, categorized as bad), Constitution of 11 (+1 modifier, average), Intelligence of 5 (-3 modifier, very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0 modifier, average), and a Charisma of 6 (-4 modifier, classified as very bad). It possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception score is an average 10, while its Stealth score is 7, which is relatively good due to the negative Dexterity modifier.

The Lemure has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat. "Devil’s Sight" allows the Lemure to see through magical darkness, making it difficult for enemies to hide from it. "Devilish Resilience" grants resistance to cold damage and immunity to both fire damage and the poisoned condition, allowing it to shrug off many types of attacks. "Hellish Rejuvenation" gives the Lemure a unique mechanic where it can return to life within 1d10 days if it dies in the Hells, regaining all hit points and becoming active once more; this can only be thwarted by the application of holy water to its remains.

In combat, the Lemure has a melee weapon attack called "Fist." This attack has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet and can target one creature. On a successful hit, it inflicts 4 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 2 fire damage, combining physical and elemental attacks, which can be particularly useful against foes vulnerable to fire.

The Lemure also has a bonus action called "Rippling Heat," usable once per day. This ability creates an aura of intense heat for 1 minute, affecting creatures that start their turn within 15 feet if they are not devils. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their attack rolls and deal only half damage with strength-based weapon attacks until their next turn. If they fail the save by 5 or more, they also gain one level of exhaustion. A creature suffering from exhaustion due to this effect cannot be affected again by the same lemure for 24 hours, making it a potent crowd control ability in appropriate encounters.</detail>
