<detail>

The Duelist has an Armor Class of 16, which means they have good protection against physical attacks, making it relatively challenging for opponents to hit them. With 90 hit points, derived from rolling 12d8 plus a constitution modifier of 36, their durability in battle can be classified as good, allowing them to sustain a fair amount of damage before being incapacitated.

The Duelist's core attributes are impressive. Their Strength is 18, giving them a +4 modifier, allowing them to be exceptionally effective in physical confrontations. Their Dexterity is also 18, providing the same +4 modifier, which contributes to their agility, attack effectiveness, and a high stealth skill. With a Constitution of 16, the Duelist benefits from a +3 modifier, enhancing their hit points and resilience. Their Intelligence sits at an average level of 10, while their Wisdom of 12 gives them a +1 modifier. Finally, their Charisma is 14, contributing a +2 modifier that aids in social interactions and intimidation attempts.

When it comes to saving throws, the Duelist excels in Strength (+7), Dexterity (+7), and Constitution (+6), reflecting their capability to resist physical effects and conditions. They also possess decent saving throws for Wisdom (+4) which can help in resisting mental effects. Their skill proficiencies are quite strong as they have +7 in Athletics and Stealth, a +5 in Intimidation, and a +4 in both Perception and Survival. Their passive perception is 14, allowing them to notice hidden creatures and objects effectively.

In terms of actions, the Duelist is capable of performing a Multiattack, allowing them to attack twice during their turn, making them significantly more dangerous. Their primary weapon is the Rapier, which they wield with a +7 to hit, giving them an above-average chance to land their blows on targets within a 5-foot reach. When they hit with the rapier, they deal 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, which can significantly harm foes.

One of the Duelist's notable abilities is the Riposte reaction. When the Duelist is missed by a melee attack from an attacker they can see within 5 feet, they can respond by making a rapier attack against that attacker with advantage. This means they roll two d20s for the attack, significantly increasing their chances of successfully hitting back and potentially punishing foes who aim poorly.

Overall, the Duelist is a combat-savvy character with strong offensive capabilities, defensive qualities, and reactive strategies that make them a potent adversary for any adventuring party.

The Duelist is a Medium humanoid of lawful evil alignment that excels in combat through agility and cunning. With an Armor Class of 17, this creature is quite difficult to hit, and its 117 hit points allow it to endure a fair amount of damage before being taken down. The Duelist utilizes its exceptional Dexterity, boasting a +5 modifier that significantly enhances its attacks and evasion tactics, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. However, it is hampered by its Sunlight Sensitivity, giving it disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks when exposed to sunlight.

- Strength: 13 (+1), which is considered average for physical attacks.

- Intelligence: 13 (+1), also regarded as average for any required mental checks.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), slightly below average but still useful.
- Charisma: 16 (+3), which is very good and aids in social interactions.

The Duelist's saving throws include a +8 modifier to Dexterity saves (very good) and a +6 modifier to Charisma saves (good). Their skills feature proficiency in Acrobatics (+8, very good), Deception (+6, good), Perception (+4, average), and Stealth (+8, very good). With darkvision for 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 14, the Duelist can effectively see in low-light situations.

Notable special abilities include:
- Duelist's Mobility, which grants disadvantage on opportunity attacks made against the Duelist and allows it to stand up without using movement if prone at the beginning of its turn. This ability is exceptionally useful for maintaining position in combat.
- Fey Ancestry gives the Duelist advantage on saving throws against being charmed and immunity to magical sleep effects, making it resilient against many control spells.
- Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based perception while in sunlight, is a significant weakness.

For actions, the Duelist can perform a Multiattack consisting of two Rapier attacks and one Dagger attack. 
- The Dagger is a melee or ranged attack with a +8 to hit, capable of dealing 7 piercing damage plus an additional 14 poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute, which can severely impair their effectiveness in combat.
- The Rapier attack also carries a +8 to hit and deals 9 piercing damage per hit.

The Duelist can also perform the following bonus and reaction actions:
- Shadow Traveler allows it to vanish into shadows or darkness and reappear within 30 feet, utilizing this ability three times per day. This provides significant tactical flexibility in combat.
- As a reaction, the Duelist can use Parry to add 3 to its AC against one melee attack, a useful defensive maneuver when anticipating an enemy's strike. This ability requires the Duelist to see the attacker and wield a melee weapon.

Overall, the Duelist is a clever and agile foe, using its abilities and skills to outmaneuver and outwit opponents, while also posing a direct threat with its potent melee attacks and poison capabilities.</detail>
