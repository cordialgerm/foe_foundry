<summary>The Giant Ape is an enormous, towering primate, standing as tall as a small building. Its massive arms are powerful enough to uproot trees and smash through rock, making it a formidable force in battle. Giant Apes are usually found in remote jungles or mountains, where they rule their territory with unmatched strength. Despite their size and power, they are intelligent and capable of using simple tools or weapons. When angered or threatened, a Giant Ape becomes a fearsome opponent, capable of hurling boulders or swatting foes aside with terrifying ease.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Ape is a formidable creature in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a Huge beast. Renowned for its immense physical power, it boasts high hit points and a solid challenge rating of 7, making it a significant foe in combat scenarios. The creature's key strengths lie in its formidable attacks that can deal substantial bludgeoning damage, particularly with its multiattack capability that allows it to strike twice in a single turn. However, it does have limitations, such as its low Armor Class of 12, which makes it somewhat vulnerable to attacks. The Giant Ape's ability to grapple opponents adds a layer of tactical depth, allowing it to control the battlefield by restricting movement and potentially throwing enemies.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Ape has the following attributes:
- Strength: +8 (exceptional)
- Dexterity: +2 (average)
- Constitution: +4 (good)
- Intelligence: -2 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +1 (average)
- Charisma: -2 (very bad)

For senses, the Giant Ape does not have any special features, but its Perception score of 14 provides a good awareness level, while a Stealth score of 12 indicates an average ability to remain unnoticed.

The Giant Ape possesses several special abilities:
- Multiattack allows the ape to make two attacks either with its fists or by throwing rocks. If it uses its fists and successfully hits the same Large or smaller creature with both attacks, it grapples the target, which can make it difficult for other players to maneuver.
- The Fist attack is a melee weapon strike that has a +8 to hit and deals 27 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. With a reach of 10 feet, it remains effective at close quarters.
- The Rock attack is a ranged option with the same +8 to hit, a range of 50 feet normal and 100 feet at disadvantage, dealing 23 bludgeoning damage.

In terms of actions, the Giant Ape can again use Multiattack, Fist, or Rock in its turn. Additionally, it has a notable Bonus Action:
- The Throw action allows the Giant Ape to toss a grappled Large or smaller creature up to 50 feet in a random direction, knocking it prone. This can be particularly devastating as the creature takes 3 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet thrown and can potentially strike another creature, forcing a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the same consequences.

Overall, the Giant Ape excels in physical combat and battlefield control, making it both a dangerous opponent and a source of strategic opportunities for its handler.

The Giant Ape is a formidable creature in Dungeons & Dragons 5e, classified as a Huge Beast. With a solid armor class of 14 and 115 hit points, it can absorb a significant amount of damage while dealing it out effectively with its powerful melee and ranged attacks. This creature serves as a strong combatant for adventurers facing off against it, boasting a challenge rating of 7, which translates to 2,900 experience points for defeat. The Giant Ape's high strength and constitution make it exceptionally tough in melee scenarios, but its intelligence and charisma scores are quite low, making it less effective in social interactions and complex problem-solving situations.

The Giant Ape has the following attributes: 
- Strength is 20, giving it a modifier of +5, which is very good for physical attacks and grappling.
- Dexterity is 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is average and provides some agility.
- Constitution is 18, which translates to a +4 modifier, showing it has very good durability.
- Intelligence is 6, with a -2 modifier, indicating very bad mental acuity.
- Wisdom is 12, leading to a +1 modifier, which is average for perception checks.
- Charisma is 6, with a -2 modifier, reflecting a very bad ability to influence others.

In terms of skills, the Giant Ape excels at athletics with a +8 modifier, demonstrating its capability in physical confrontations, while its perception skill is also commendable with a +4 modifier. Its passive perception of 14 means it is fairly aware of its surroundings.

For actions, the Giant Ape performs the Multiattack ability, allowing it to strike twice with its fists each turn, enhancing its combat effectiveness. The Fists attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 21 bludgeoning damage on a hit, which is quite powerful for a single attack. Additionally, the Rock ability allows the ape to throw a large object at an opponent. This ranged weapon attack also has a +8 to hit, with a range of 50 feet normally and 100 feet at disadvantage, and it inflicts an impressive average of 26 bludgeoning damage, making it a significant threat from a distance. Overall, the Giant Ape stands out as a powerful adversary that can dominate both close and ranged combat with its raw physical prowess.</detail>
