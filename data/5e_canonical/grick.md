<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>A Grick is a serpentine predator with a rubbery, gray body and a beak-like maw surrounded by tentacles. These creatures live in dark caves or dungeons, where they blend into the shadows and strike at unwary prey. Gricks are ambush predators, using their tentacles to lash out and grab victims before delivering a vicious bite with their sharp beaks. They are nearly silent and can climb walls with ease, making them difficult to detect. Their tough, rubbery hide protects them from most physical attacks, and they are skilled at hunting in the darkness.</summary>
