<MonsterName/>Hebi-Doku</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Hebi-Doku is a formidable Medium-sized Fey creature, embodying chaotic evil with its sleek and serpentine form. With an Armor Class of 15 and 123 hit points, it can sustain a fair amount of damage in combat, making it a resilient adversary. It boasts impressive Dexterity and Constitution scores of 21, granting it good evasion and the capacity to endure physical turmoil. Additionally, the Hebi-Doku’s Challenge Rating of 8 indicates its high level of threat in battle, with an expected experience value of 3,900 for defeating it. This creature excels in offensive capabilities, leveraging multi-attack options and venomous attacks to incapacitate foes. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage, a fact that players can exploit to turn the tide of battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Hebi-Doku's attributes are well-rounded, featuring a Strength of 17 (+3), Dexterity of 21 (+5), Constitution of 21 (+5), Intelligence of 15 (+2), Wisdom of 13 (+1), and Charisma of 17 (+3). The Dexterity modifier is very good, enabling it to act quickly in combat. Its Constitution gives it a very good modifier as well, enhancing its resilience. The creature’s proficiency in perception, yielding a +4 to rolls, combined with its keen smell ability, grants it an exceptional capacity to detect hidden foes or ambushes. Furthermore, the Hebi-Doku has damage immunity to poison and is immune to the poisoned condition, making it particularly dangerous as it can withstand many forms of attack that would harm other creatures.

The Hebi-Doku’s special abilities further contribute to its menace in battle. Its Keen Smell ability allows it to gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks reliant on smell. This makes it especially adept at detecting hidden enemies or tracking prey. The Serpentine Mind special ability enables it to command snakes within 120 feet telepathically, making it potentially an ally for other snake creatures and allowing it tactical advantages in combat.

In terms of actions, the Hebi-Doku can execute a Multiattack, which permits it to either utilize its Transfixing Rattle before attacking with its Bite and Disabling Sting or rely on two uses of Toxic Spittle. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that employs a +8 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 14 piercing damage plus an additional 14 poison damage on a successful hit. The Disabling Sting also uses a melee weapon attack with the same +8 to hit bonus, inflicting 12 piercing damage and requiring the target to succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to avoid losing the ability to use bonus actions and reactions until the end of their next turn. 

The Toxic Spittle is a ranged attack (+8 to hit) that has a range of 30 feet or 90 feet at disadvantage. It does 10 poison damage with a successful hit, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute, with the option to repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn. A successful saving throw results in the target being poisoned for the same duration, which can significantly hinder their combat effectiveness. Lastly, the Transfixing Rattle ability targets a creature within 30 feet, demanding a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in that creature becoming incapacitated and having its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. 

The combination of these attacks and abilities makes the Hebi-Doku a versatile and dangerous opponent that can control the pace of combat while potentially incapacitating or weakening its foes, thereby allowing it to dominate the battlefield.</detail>
