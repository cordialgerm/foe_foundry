<MonsterName/>Butatsch</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Butatsch is a gargantuan aberration with a chaotic neutral alignment, dominating its environment with a strategy of ambush and area denial. It wields formidable physical strength and possesses notable magical capabilities, making it a considerable threat in combat. With a high armor class of 17 and an impressive hit point total of 248, it can withstand significant damage. The creature is particularly resilient against bludgeoning attacks, while it enjoys immunity to acid and fire, making it difficult to damage with typical elemental attacks. However, its speed is below average on land, limiting its mobility to 20 feet when on foot, though it compensates with a swimming speed of 50 feet. It excels in combat through its unique abilities, namely its Immolating Gaze and grappling actions, both of which can severely hinder or eliminate opponents. </summary>

<detail>

The Butatsch possesses the following attributes: Strength 23 (+6), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 21 (+5), Intelligence 16 (+3), Wisdom 17 (+3), and Charisma 14 (+2). Its high Constitution score grants it a proficiency bonus of +11 on Constitution saving throws, providing a very good level of resilience against effects that may drain its health or impair its abilities. Wisdom saving throws are also notably strong at +8, indicating that it can effectively resist mind-affecting spells or abilities. Its perception skill is exceptional with a +13, allowing it to detect hidden foes or ambushes effectively. The Butatsch has truesight up to 120 feet, enabling it to see through illusions and invisibility, enhancing its tactical advantages in encounters. It can communicate in Common and Deep Speech.

The Butatsch’s special ability, "Thousands of Eyes," grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks based on sight and on saving throws against being blinded. This ability effectively counters ambush tactics used by enemies and allows the Butatsch to maintain visibility in challenging situations. Moreover, it prevents attacking creatures from benefiting from tactical advantages that depend on allies distracting or surrounding it, such as Pack Tactics or Sneak Attack, indicating its strong defensive stance.

In terms of actions, the Butatsch can execute a multiattack, which includes using its Immolating Gaze followed by two melee slam attacks. The Immolating Gaze allows it to target up to three creatures within 60 feet, forcing them to make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 10 (3d6) fire damage and immolation, while success reduces the damage taken by half without the immolation effect. The immolation effect inflicts ongoing fire damage of 7 (2d6) at the start of the affected creature's turns until they extinguish the fire, creating significant ongoing pressure in combat. 

Its slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +11 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 10 (1d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage in addition to 7 (2d6) fire damage. The combination of bludgeoning and fire damage makes it effective against multiple types of enemies. The Ingest ability allows the Butatsch to swallow a Large or smaller creature it has grappled, inflicting blindness and restraint on that creature while dealing 17 (5d6) acid damage at the start of each of the Butatsch's turns. It has a capacity for ingesting multiple creatures, amplifying its threat in a battle scenario. If it takes significant damage from an ingested creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate its victims, creating a tactical opportunity for those who manage to strike from within. Death of the Butatsch also allows swallowed creatures to escape, which could drastically shift the dynamics of the encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Thousands of Eyes:** The butatsch has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on saving throws against being blinded. In addition, if the butatsch isn’t blinded, creatures attacking it can’t benefit from traits and features that rely on a creature’s allies distracting or surrounding the butatsch, such as the Pack Tactics or Sneak Attack traits.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The butatsch can use its Immolating Gaze. It then makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Large or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 17), and the butatsch uses its Ingest on the target.
- **Immolating Gaze:** The butatsch chooses up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and is immolated. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t immolated. Until a creature takes an action to smother the fire, the immolated target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Water doesn’t douse fires set by the butatsch’s Immolating Gaze.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Ingest:** The butatsch ingests a Large or smaller creature grappled by it, ending the grapple. While ingested, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the butatsch, and it takes 17 (5d6) acid damage at the start of each of the butatsch’s turns. A butatsch can have up to four Medium or smaller targets or up to two Large targets ingested at a time. If the butatsch takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from an ingested creature, the butatsch must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all ingested creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the butatsch. If the butatsch dies, an ingested creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.
