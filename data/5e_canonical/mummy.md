<summary>A Mummy is an undead creature, preserved through ancient embalming techniques and bound to serve in death. Wrapped in decayed bandages, Mummies possess supernatural strength and resilience, making them formidable opponents in combat. They are often found in tombs or pyramids, guarding the resting places of ancient kings or priests. Mummies can strike fear into the hearts of their enemies with their mere presence, and their touch carries a deadly curse that can rot the flesh of those they strike. Though mindless compared to their Mummy Lord masters, they are relentless in carrying out their duty.</summary>

<summary>The Mummy is a Medium undead creature that serves as an intimidating foe in D&D encounters, often found in ancient tombs or cursed places. It boasts a modest Armor Class of 11 and a respectable 67 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being defeated. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it is considered a formidable enemy, offering a challenge to parties composed of lower-level adventurers, rewarding them with 700 experience points upon its defeat. Mummies are known for their unique abilities, particularly the dreaded Mummy Rot curse, which can significantly weaken and potentially eliminate characters if they fail to evade its effects. While they possess average Dexterity and poor mobility—only capable of walking at 20 feet per round—they exhibit strength in their Constitution and Strength, giving them good durability in combat. However, they are significantly hindered by their very low Dexterity, making them vulnerable to ranged attacks and nimble opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The Mummy's attributes are as follows: it has a Strength score of 16, which grants it a +3 modifier—this is considered a good bonus for making physical attacks. With a Dexterity score of 8, it has a -1 modifier, which is very bad, affecting its initiative and ranged attack rolls. Its Constitution score of 16 provides another good +3 modifier, enhancing its hit points and overall resilience. Intelligence and Wisdom are both average at a score of 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, and its Charisma is slightly above average with a score of 12, granting a +1 modifier that is useful for any Charisma-based interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Mummy is particularly resilient against Wisdom saves, with a +2 modifier, making its chances to withstand effects relying on this ability average. It has damage immunities to necrotic and poison damage, and it resists damage from nonmagical weapons, showcasing a good resilience against both physical and magical attacks. The Mummy is immune to a range of conditions including charm, fatigue, fright, paralysis, and poison, giving it exceptional durability against effects that would incapacitate or debilitate other creatures. Senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 10, allowing it to detect creatures within its range adequately. Mummies can communicate in the languages they knew in life, though their interaction is typically limited to combat scenarios.

Key special abilities of the Mummy include its Flammable trait, where it catches fire after taking fire damage and suffers ongoing damage if not extinguished. This introduces an interesting dynamic in combat where players can strategically use fire to weaken the Mummy further. The Mummy Rot curse is one of its most dangerous abilities; upon touching a target, it curses them, preventing any regained hit points and lowering their hit point maximum over time, which can ultimately lead to death if not removed by magic like Remove Curse.

When it comes to actions in combat, the Mummy can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to use its Dreadful Glare ability followed by a melee attack with its rotting fist. The Dreadful Glare can instill fear or even paralysis into a target within 60 feet, relying on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. Failure renders the target frightened, while a significant failure (by 5 or more) leads to paralysis, significantly hindering their ability to act in combat. A successful saving throw grants the target immunity to this frightening gaze for 24 hours. Lastly, its Rotting Fist is a melee weapon attack that applies excellent damage, dealing 10 bludgeoning damage alongside 10 necrotic damage, and placing anyone hit at risk of the Mummy Rot curse if they fail a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Overall, the Mummy can be a devastating adversary if players do not adequately prepare for its potent abilities and curses.

The mummy is a Medium undead creature that serves as both a formidable opponent and a lingering threat, particularly in campaign settings steeped in ancient tombs and curses. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it poses a moderate risk for adventurers. The mummy possesses a robust set of hit points at 80 and has an Armor Class of 13, making it somewhat resilient in combat, though less agile due to its low Dexterity. Its special abilities grant it immunity to poison and the poisoned condition, while its undead nature means it does not require sustenance, allowing it to function effectively in any environment. However, it is worth noting that the mummy's speed is relatively slow at 20 feet, which can hinder its ability to close gaps in battle. 

The mummy's statistics are as follows: Strength is +3, providing a good boost to physical attacks; Dexterity is -1, which is bad and affects its ability to dodge or avoid attacks; Constitution is +3, granting it good resilience to effects that require saving throws; Intelligence is -2, making it quite poor in mental tasks; Wisdom is +2, giving it a good level of perceptiveness; and Charisma is +1, indicating average capabilities in social interactions or effects related to its presence.

In terms of abilities, the mummy has Undead Nature, which denotes that it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep. This allows it to function continuously without hindrance. The Undead Resilience ability makes it immune to poison damage and exhausted conditions, enhancing its survivability.

In combat, the mummy can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to perform two Rotting Fist attacks. When both attacks hit a target that is not a Construct or Undead, the affected creature must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 13. Failure results in being cursed with mummy rot, which has detrimental effects on the victim's health. The Rotting Fist attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit, and it can deal significant damage by inflicting 7 bludgeoning damage as well as an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. 

As a bonus action, the mummy can use Dreadful Glare, targeting one creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 13 or become frightened until the end of its next turn. If the target fails by 5 or more, they are also paralyzed for the same duration, significantly impacting their ability to participate in combat.

Overall, the mummy combines defensive resilience with offensive capabilities, making it a noteworthy adversary that can inflict lasting curses while taking advantage of its undead nature in the heat of battle.</detail>
