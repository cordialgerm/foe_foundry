<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>A Mummy is an undead creature, preserved through ancient embalming techniques and bound to serve in death. Wrapped in decayed bandages, Mummies possess supernatural strength and resilience, making them formidable opponents in combat. They are often found in tombs or pyramids, guarding the resting places of ancient kings or priests. Mummies can strike fear into the hearts of their enemies with their mere presence, and their touch carries a deadly curse that can rot the flesh of those they strike. Though mindless compared to their Mummy Lord masters, they are relentless in carrying out their duty.</summary>

***Dreadful Glare***. The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.
