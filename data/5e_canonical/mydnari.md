<summary>The Mydnari is a medium humanoid creature with a neutral evil alignment, recognized for its unsettling nature and symbiotic relationship with a unique jelly substance. With a challenge rating of 1/2, this creature poses a moderate challenge due to its cunning and deceptive abilities. The Mydnari excels in dexterity and charisma, allowing it to evade attacks and manipulate others effectively. Its combat prowess is enhanced by its ability to deal acid damage and cause poisoning, making it a threat in both melee and ranged encounters. However, it relies heavily on its jelly; if separated, it suffers significant drawbacks, including the loss of its blindsight, key offensive abilities, and special traits. </summary>

<detail>

The Mydnari's statistics include a Strength of 12, which contributes a good modifier of +1 in melee combat. Its Dexterity is notable at 16, giving it a very good +3 bonus, enhancing its armor class and attack rolls. The Constitution score is average at 13, translating to a +1 modifier which helps to sustain its hit points of 22, calculated as 4d8+4. Intelligence is above average at 14, allowing for a +2 modifier, while Wisdom sits at 16 providing a very good +3 modifier crucial for perception checks. Finally, its Charisma also rates at 14, contributing a good +2 modifier for social interactions. 

In terms of skills, the Mydnari possesses a +4 modifier in deception and intimidation, making it quite effective at misleading and frightening adversaries. Its perception score, boosted by a +5 modifier, allows it to be highly aware of its surroundings, reinforcing its tactical edge in encounters. 

The Mydnari benefits from certain immunities: it is immune to acid damage, which makes it resilient against such attacks, and it cannot be paralyzed, allowing it to maintain its actions in various situations. It has blindsight out to 60 feet; however, it is blind beyond this distance. Its passive perception is calculated at 15, ensuring it can detect opponents before they realize it’s aware of them. The languages it speaks are Deep Speech and Undercommon, making it capable of communicating with other creatures familiar with these languages.

The Mydnari has special abilities that significantly shape its interactions and combat strategy. The Bound in Jelly ability establishes a critical connection between the Mydnari and its jelly. If they become separated, the jelly dies rapidly, and the Mydnari loses several key traits, making it vulnerable. Jelly Symbiosis means that any creature that touches the Mydnari or strikes it in melee must suffer 2 (1d4) acid damage, providing a layer of protection and counterattack. The Ooze Empathy ability allows the Mydnari to effectively manage ooze-type creatures, employing its Animal Handling skill even if those creatures have a low intelligence, ensuring they remain non-aggressive unless provoked.

In terms of actions, the Mydnari can attack with a shortsword, which has a +5 to hit and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, making it a competent melee attacker. It also possesses the Acid Glob ranged attack, which also has a +5 to hit, functioning up to a distance of 30 feet normally and 60 feet at disadvantage. On hitting, it inflicts 5 (1d4 + 3) acid damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned for up to a minute, a debilitating condition that can shift the dynamics of combat. The target has the opportunity to repeat the saving throw each turn to shake off the effect, adding an element of tension to encounters where the Mydnari engages at range.</detail>
