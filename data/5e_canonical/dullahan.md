<summary>The Dullahan is a formidable entity from the fey realm, embodying lawful evil capable of instilling fear and dread in its enemies. This large creature boasts a high armor class of 17, thanks to its natural armor, and an impressive 178 hit points, which grants it exceptional durability in combat. With a movement speed of 60 feet, the Dullahan is adept at traversing the battlefield swiftly. It has a challenge rating of 11, indicating a significant threat level and awarding 7,200 experience points to those who manage to defeat it. The Dullahan's strengths lie in its high physical attributes, particularly in its Strength of 19, Dexterity of 18, and Constitution of 20, which yield very good modifiers of +4 and +5 respectively. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, while still above average, limit its versatility in social situations. </summary>

<detail>

The Dullahan possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Baleful Glare can incapacitate foes by frightening them, forcing them to flee. This ability requires a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 17; failure imposes restraint on the victim if they are already deemed "doomed." The Relentless Advance ability allows it to move through difficult terrain without affecting its speed and enables it to traverse water as solid ground, granting significant mobility advantages. Additionally, its Relentless Nature means that it does not require food, drink, or sleep, making it a constant threat with no need for rest.

In terms of actions, the Dullahan can execute multiattacks, making three attacks with either its Spine Whip or Necrotic Bolt. The Spine Whip is a melee attack that has a +8 to hit with a reach of 10 feet. It deals 11 slashing damage plus an additional 10 necrotic damage. If it hits a creature, that target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall prone due to excruciating pain. The Necrotic Bolt functions as a ranged spell attack, with a +7 to hit and a range of 120 feet, delivering an impactful 21 necrotic damage to its target.

One of its most fearsome abilities is Seal the Doom, which targets a creature that is deemed "doomed." The targeted creature within 40 feet must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 17. If they are below half their maximum hit points, failure results in them immediately dropping to 0 hit points. If they succeed, they are made immune to Seal the Doom for the next 24 hours.

As a bonus action, the Dullahan can use Deathly Doom to designate a target for 1 hour. This ability can only affect one creature at a time, and if the Dullahan chooses another target, the effect on the previous target ends. The Dullahan also gains the advantage of knowing the location of the doomed creature, as long as they are on the same plane.

Overall, the Dullahan's impressive combination of abilities, high damage output, and unique advantages on the battlefield make it a fearsome adversary for any party brave enough to confront it.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Baleful Glare:** When a creature that can see the eyes of the dullahan’s severed head starts its turn within 30 feet of the dullahan, the dullahan can force it to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw if the dullahan isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. While frightened in this way, the creature must take the Dash action and move away from the dullahan by the safest available route. A doomed creature that fails this saving throw is restrained while frightened instead.
- **Relentless Advance:** Moving through difficult terrain doesn’t cost the dullahan extra movement, and the dullahan can move across the surface of water as if it were harmless, solid ground.
- **Relentless Nature:** The dullahan doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dullahan makes three Spine Whip or Necrotic Bolt attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Seal the Doom.
- **Spine Whip:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall prone as it is wracked with pain.
- **Necrotic Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage.
- **Seal the Doom:** The dullahan points at a creature doomed by Deathly Doom within 40 feet of it that it can see. The creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target immediately drops to 0 hp if it is below half its hp maximum. On a success, the target is immune to the dullahan’s Seal the Doom for the next 24 hours.

### Bonus Actions

- **Deathly Doom:** The dullahan magically dooms a creature for 1 hour. It can have only one creature doomed at a time. If it dooms another, the effect on the previous target ends. The dullahan knows the direction to the doomed creature as long as both are on the same plane of existence.
