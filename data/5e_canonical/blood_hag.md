<summary>The Blood Hag is a medium-sized fey creature embodying chaotic evil, making it a formidable and sinister presence in any campaign. With a robust armor class of 16 and exceptionally high hit points of 204, this creature can endure significant damage in battle. Its primary role is that of a combatant who specializes in grappling and draining life from her foes, leveraging her special abilities, such as Blood Sense and a variety of devastating melee and spell attacks. The Blood Hag excels with her high strength and constitution, represented by scores of 20 and 18, respectively, providing her with both offensive and defensive capabilities, as well as critical survivability. Despite her strengths, she has a weakness to radiant damage and can be overwhelmed by swift attacks if caught off-guard, particularly by characters that can negate her grapple capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Blood Hag possesses the following ability scores: Strength 20 (+5), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 19 (+4), Wisdom 21 (+5), and Charisma 17 (+3). Her strength is exceptionally high, making her very effective in physical attacks, while her reasonable dexterity and constitution allow her to maintain a solid defense. She has good saving throw bonuses, gaining a +7 in Dexterity, +8 in Constitution, and +7 in Charisma, making her tough to debilitate through those means. Her skills, including Deception +7, Intimidation +7, Perception +9, and Stealth +7, show her proficiency in social manipulation and stealth tactics. Notably, she is immune to being charmed or poisoned, granting her resilience against specific status effects that could incapacitate other characters.

The Blood Hag's special ability, Blood Sense, allows her to detect living creatures that aren't constructs or undead within 60 feet, providing her with tactical advantages in combat by knowing the location of her foes. This ability can sense the direction of such creatures up to 1 mile away, making her a relentless hunter.

In combat, the Blood Hag can perform a Multiattack, allowing her to make three attacks with either her Claws or Blood Bolt options and utilize her unique abilities, Blood-Drinking Hair or Face Peel. Her Claws attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit. Upon a successful hit, it deals 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it becomes grappled, requiring a DC 17 escape check to break free.

Her Blood Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit and a range of 60 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 18 (3d8 + 5) necrotic damage. Importantly, if the target has blood, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn, which can significantly affect the target's combat effectiveness.

The Blood-Drinking Hair ability allows her to drain blood from grappling foes. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, suffering 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half that on a success. The Blood Hag regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt, enhancing her sustainability in prolonged encounters.

With her Face Peel ability, if the target fails a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, it takes 14 (4d6) slashing damage and becomes stunned until the end of its next turn. Moreover, the target's maximum hit points are reduced by the damage taken until it completes a long rest, and it suffers disadvantage on Charisma checks during this time.

The Sanguine Curse ability allows the Blood Hag to curse a creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated for 1 minute, taking 9 (2d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns as its blood vessels rupture. The cursed creature can attempt to break the curse at the end of its turns through repeated saving throws.

In addition to her physical attacks, the Blood Hag has access to powerful spells aimed at manipulation and stealth. She can cast spells such as Disguise Self, Knock, and Tongues at will, allowing for effective deception and interaction with other creatures. She can also cast Modify Memory and Pass Without Trace three times per day each, further enhancing her capabilities for subterfuge and stealthy movement. Her spellcasting ability is based on Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 17, making her spells difficult to resist.

In summary, the Blood Hag is a dangerous foe that combines swift physical attacks and potent magical abilities, capable of draining the life from her enemies while evading capture. As a chaotic evil creature, she provides unique challenges for adventurers, requiring clever strategies and resilience to face her formidable arsenal of attacks and spells.</detail>
