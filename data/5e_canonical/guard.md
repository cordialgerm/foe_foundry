<summary>A Guard is a professional soldier or watchman tasked with protecting a city, keep, or noble estate. Clad in armor and carrying weapons such as swords, spears, or crossbows, Guards are disciplined and trained to maintain order and defend their posts. They are often part of a larger force, patrolling streets, manning walls, or standing watch over important locations. Though not as skilled as elite soldiers, Guards are reliable and capable of working together to fend off intruders or maintain peace. Their loyalty to their employers or rulers makes them steadfast defenders.</summary>

<summary>The Guard is a Medium humanoid creature designed to serve as a basic defensive unit in various situations. It has a reasonable armor class of 15, making it moderately difficult for attackers to land successful hits. With 11 hit points, it can sustain a small amount of damage before being defeated, but it is not particularly resilient. The Guard's speed is typical, allowing it to move at a rate of 30 feet per turn. Its challenge rating is 1/8, which indicates that it is not a formidable opponent, typically posing minimal threat to more experienced adventurers. The creature's primary strength lies in its basic combat capabilities, particularly its spear attack, but it lacks any significant special abilities or spells, making it relatively straightforward in terms of encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Guard's statistics are as follows:

- Strength: 10, which is average. Its modifier of +0 means it is not particularly strong or effective in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 12, yielding a +1 modifier, indicating a slightly above-average agility, which can help in dodging attacks or performing tasks that require finesse.
- Constitution: 12, also granting a +1 modifier. This provides the Guard with a decent level of endurance and helps with its overall hit points.
- Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma all sit at 10, which is average, translating to a +0 modifier for each. This means the Guard does not excel in mental attributes and has no particular advantages or disadvantages in interaction or perception checks beyond its skills.

In terms of skills, the Guard has a +2 bonus in perception, reflecting its ability to notice its surroundings and detect potential threats or intruders. Its passive perception score is 12, which is decent for spotting ambushes or hidden enemies. The Guard is capable of understanding any one language, allowing for basic communication, but it does not necessarily possess the ability to speak fluently.

The Guard can perform the following action:

- **Spear:** This is a melee or ranged weapon attack. The Guard has a +2 modifier to hit, making it an average attacker when using this weapon. The spear has a reach of 5 feet for melee combat or a range of 20 feet for short-range and 60 feet for long-range targets. If the attack is successful, it deals 3 piercing damage (1d6), which can contribute to the overall damage output in encounters, albeit limited due to its low hit points.

Overall, while the Guard can present a challenge in numbers or as a defensive unit, it is not likely to create significant obstacles for a well-prepared party.

The Guard is a medium humanoid creature that serves the role of a frontline defender with enough combat capability to pose a threat if needed. With a challenge rating of 1/8, the Guard is suitable for low-level encounters and is primarily focused on protection. Its strengths lie in its decent armor class of 14 and the ability to perform both melee and ranged attacks with a spear, dealing reasonable damage. However, its hit point total of 8 is relatively low, suggesting that it can be taken down quickly if faced with sustained fire. The Guard's defensive maneuver, Protector’s Parry, allows it to provide assistance to allies, making it a valuable asset in combat situations.

The Guard possesses the following attributes: Strength +1 (average), Dexterity +1 (average), Constitution +1 (average), Intelligence +0 (very bad), Wisdom +1 (average), and Charisma +0 (very bad). Its overall attributes suggest a balanced but not particularly standout combatant. The Guard has a Perception skill score of 13, which is good, allowing it to notice hidden threats, and a Stealth skill score of 11, which is also average, giving it reasonable ability to move unnoticed. The Guard can understand any one language, typically Common.

The Guard is equipped with a spear, which it can employ both in melee and at range. When making a melee or ranged weapon attack with the spear, it has a +3 to hit, indicating a good chance of successfully striking its target. The spear inflicts 4 piercing damage on a hit when used one-handed (1d6 + 1) or 5 piercing damage when wielded with two hands (1d8 + 1), providing versatile attack options depending on the situation.

In terms of reactions, the Guard has Protector’s Parry, which allows it to protect a nearby ally from an incoming attack. When an ally within 5 feet of the Guard is targeted, it can use its reaction to grant that ally a +2 bonus to their Armor Class against the attack. This ability is useful for helping to shield more vulnerable allies, but requires the Guard to see both the attacker and to be wielding a melee weapon to utilize effectively. 

Overall, the Guard serves as a competent low-level soldier, capable of engaging in combat and also providing protective support to its teammates.</detail>
