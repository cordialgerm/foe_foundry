<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>A Guard is a professional soldier or watchman tasked with protecting a city, keep, or noble estate. Clad in armor and carrying weapons such as swords, spears, or crossbows, Guards are disciplined and trained to maintain order and defend their posts. They are often part of a larger force, patrolling streets, manning walls, or standing watch over important locations. Though not as skilled as elite soldiers, Guards are reliable and capable of working together to fend off intruders or maintain peace. Their loyalty to their employers or rulers makes them steadfast defenders.</summary>
