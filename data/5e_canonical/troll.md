<summary>Trolls are large, hulking humanoids known for their incredible regenerative abilities. Standing over 10 feet tall, with long limbs and green, warty skin, Trolls are fearsome predators that hunt anything they can overpower. Their ability to regenerate from nearly any wound makes them particularly difficult to kill, as they can regrow lost limbs and recover from severe injuries in moments. Trolls are not very intelligent, but they are cunning hunters, using their brute strength and sharp claws to tear apart enemies. They dwell in caves, swamps, and forests, always hungry and ready to devour anything in their path.</summary>

<summary>The troll is a large giant known for its formidable physical capabilities and regenerative abilities, making it a tough opponent in combat. With a high hit point total of 84 and solid armor class of 15, it can endure significant damage while dishing out powerful attacks of its own. The troll's challenge rating of 5 indicates that it poses a serious threat to mid-level adventurers. Its keen sense of smell enhances its ability to detect foes, giving it an edge in stealthy environments. However, it has notable weaknesses, primarily its vulnerability to fire and acid damage, which can negate its remarkable regeneration ability. Overall, the troll is a versatile and dangerous foe that requires strategic planning to defeat effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The troll has a Strength score of 18, translating to a +4 modifier, which is very good for physical attacks. It has a Dexterity score of 12 (+1), considered average, while its Constitution score is 20 (+5), marking it as exceptional in terms of health and resilience. Intelligence is low at 8 (-1), categorized as bad, suggesting a lack of cunning. Wisdom is at 12 (+1), typically viewed as average, while its Charisma is also low at 8 (-1), indicating poor social skills.

The troll has skills in stealth, with a +4 modifier, representing a good ability to remain undetected in the environment. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light. Its passive perception score is 11, providing it with a basic awareness of its surroundings. The troll communicates using the Giant language.

Its special abilities greatly enhance its survivability and combat options. The Keen Smell ability grants the troll advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell, allowing it to detect hidden creatures or track enemies effectively. Regeneration is a defining trait, allowing the troll to recover 10 hit points at the start of its turn, making it particularly challenging to defeat unless fire or acid damage is dealt to inhibit this regeneration. The troll's Severed Limbs ability allows it to retain some effectiveness even when injured, enabling it to control and see through its severed extremities, which can still attack. If it loses an arm, it can still make claw attacks with the severed arm, while losing its head allows the severed head to make bite attacks.

In terms of actions, the troll can perform a Multiattack, using its bite and claw attacks to inflict significant damage. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and deals an average of 11 piercing damage (2d6 + 4) upon a successful hit. The Claw attack has the same +7 to hit but has a longer reach of 10 feet, dealing 9 slashing damage (2d4 + 4). This combination of attacks provides the troll with a balanced offensive strategy, capable of dealing a range of damage to its foes.

The troll is a formidable large giant creature known for its regenerative abilities, making it a threatening presence in any encounter. With an Armor Class of 15 due to its natural armor, it offers decent protection. It boasts 94 hit points, allowing it to endure a significant amount of damage before being defeated. As a Challenge Rating 5 creature, it is suitable for mid-level parties, presenting a balance of risk and reward. The troll’s strengths include its exceptional Constitution modifier of +5 which bolsters its resilience, alongside its frightening regeneration ability that allows it to heal rapidly unless countered by fire or acid damage. However, it has notable weaknesses, being vulnerable to falling prone. The troll also has an average intelligence and low Charisma, which makes it less effective in social interactions. With darkvision and heightened senses, it can detect creatures in darkness effectively, thus enhancing its role as a predator.

The troll has the following ability scores: Strength +4 (very good), Dexterity +1 (average), Constitution +5 (exceptional), Intelligence -2 (very bad), Wisdom -1 (bad), and Charisma -2 (very bad). It can perceive its surroundings with a Perception score of 12, which is average, and has a Stealth score of 13, also average for a creature of its size and type. It understands the Giant language, enabling communication with other giants.

Several special abilities enhance the troll's combat prowess and survivability. Its "Giant Attributes" ability grants it resistance to being stunned, making it challenging to incapacitate during combat, while its vulnerability to the prone condition leaves it susceptible to tactics that can knock it down. The "Heightened Smell" ability boosts its Perception to 17 when detecting scents, allowing it to track foes effectively even in obscured conditions. Most notably, the troll has a "Regeneration" ability which allows it to recover 10 hit points at the start of its turn, providing it with sustainability in prolonged fights—unless it takes fire or acid damage in which case this ability will not function until its next turn. The only way to permanently defeat a troll is to bring its hit points to zero and keep it in that state without allowing it to regenerate.

In terms of actions, the troll can use an ability called "Multiattack" to make a combination of one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, allowing it to unleash a flurry of damage in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit and deals 13 piercing damage on a successful hit, while each Claw attack also has a +7 to hit, inflicting 11 piercing damage. 

Additionally, the troll has a "Ravenous Frenzy" bonus action that it can activate when it has 52 hit points or fewer. In this state, the troll can move up to half its speed towards a visible creature and make a Bite attack, recovering hit points equal to half the damage dealt. This creates a dynamic where the troll becomes increasingly dangerous as it is injured, potentially turning the tide of combat in its favor by regaining health mid-fight.</detail>
