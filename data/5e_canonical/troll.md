<summary>Trolls are large, hulking humanoids known for their incredible regenerative abilities. Standing over 10 feet tall, with long limbs and green, warty skin, Trolls are fearsome predators that hunt anything they can overpower. Their ability to regenerate from nearly any wound makes them particularly difficult to kill, as they can regrow lost limbs and recover from severe injuries in moments. Trolls are not very intelligent, but they are cunning hunters, using their brute strength and sharp claws to tear apart enemies. They dwell in caves, swamps, and forests, always hungry and ready to devour anything in their path.</summary>
