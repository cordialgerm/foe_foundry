In terms of its skills, it has an Athletics score of +6, which is exceptional, making it very effective in physical contests. Its Intimidation skill is at +3, which is average, while its Survival skill shows a good +5, enhancing its ability to navigate or endure harsh conditions. Boreas' Chosen is immune to being charmed, exhausted, or frightened, thus showing a good resistance to mental manipulation. Its senses allow for a passive Perception score of 12, and it communicates in Common and Giant.

Boreas' Chosen has several notable special abilities. The "Frozen Blood" ability inflicts 4 cold damage on a creature that strikes Boreas' Chosen in melee while within 5 feet, making it punishing for close-range attackers. Its "Ice Runes" ability enhances its weapon attacks, adding an additional 2d8 cold damage to any successful hits, which can significantly increase damage output during combat since this extra damage is included with the regular attack. The "Ice Walk" ability permits Boreas’ Chosen to traverse icy surfaces easily and ignores difficult terrain created by ice or snow, allowing for strategic movement on frozen battlefields.

In combat, Boreas' Chosen can utilize the "Multiattack" feature, allowing it to make two attacks with its spear. It has two options for spear attacks: making a melee attack with a reach of 5 feet or a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 feet. A successful spear attack deals 6 piercing damage normally or 7 damage if wielded with both hands. Additionally, its attacks inflict 9 cold damage thanks to the Ice Runes ability. 

One of its powerful actions is the "Breath of the North Wind", which requires a recharge of 5-6 turns. This ability presents a cone of freezing breath measuring 15 feet in length, affecting all creatures in the area who must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in 28 cold damage and a speed reduction of 10 feet until the end of their next turn; success results in halved damage without the speed penalty. Critically, a creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more becomes petrified in ice until the end of its next turn, which can incapacitate enemies and give Boreas' Chosen a significant tactical advantage.</detail>
