<MonsterName/>Purple Slime</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Ooze</CreatureType>

<summary>The Purple Slime is a large ooze that presents a formidable challenge in combat, primarily using its unique abilities and attacks to weaken foes while remaining incredibly resilient. With an armor class of 7, the Purple Slime is not particularly sturdy defensively, but its high hit points of 76, due to a constitution score of 18, make it quite durable. This creature is challenging for adventurers with a challenge rating of 3, worth 700 experience points upon defeat. It has the ability to thrive both underwater and on land, allowing it to traverse difficult terrain with great ease. However, its intelligence is very low, indicating a lack of tactical skill or complex thought.</summary>

<detail>

The Purple Slime's strength is exceptional at 17, enabling it to hit hard and potentially incapacitate enemies, while its dexterity is poor at 8, making it less effective at dodging attacks. In terms of skills, it has an effective stealth rating of +1, which is average due to its low dexterity and limited mobility. The slime is immune to damage from acid and cold, which can significantly impact the tactics used against it, as it can easily resist certain elemental attacks. It is also immune to various conditions, including being blinded, charming effects, exhaustion, fear, and being prone, which makes it stable in battle.

The special abilities of the Purple Slime enhance its survivability and effectiveness in combat. Its Amorphous ability allows it to squeeze through tight spaces, making it hard to corner or escape from. Being Amphibious means it can breathe in both air and water, providing versatility in different environments. Additionally, its Underwater Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while submerged, making it an effective ambush predator in aquatic settings.

In combat, the Purple Slime can perform a Multiattack action, making two separate spike attacks against its foes. The Spike attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, making it good at landing strikes thanks to the lure of its high strength. Each successful hit deals 6 piercing damage and a substantial 10 poison damage. Moreover, on a hit, the victim must pass a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure to do so results in a reduction of their Strength score by a roll of 1d4. If this reduction drops their Strength to 0, the target dies. If not, the effects last until the target completes a short or long rest, effectively crippling opponents for the duration of the encounter or beyond.</detail>
