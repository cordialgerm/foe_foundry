<summary>The Mirage Monster is a huge monstrosity that excels in deceptive tactics and control during combat. Its challenge rating is 4, providing a moderate threat to parties, particularly through its unique abilities that can ensnare and restrain foes, making it a potent ambush predator. With an armor class of 12 and hit points totaling 76, it can endure several hits while imposing significant damage with its melee attacks. However, its intelligence is quite low, which limits its strategic options. The creatureâ€™s strong physical attributes, particularly its strength of 18 (+4), enable it to grapple effectively and deal substantial damage through its biting and pseudopod attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The Mirage Monster has a strong melee weapon attack bonus of +6, indicating a good effectiveness in physical confrontations. It boasts a stealth skill of +4, making it very good at remaining unnoticed while it lays in ambush. Its unique abilities grant various advantages and tactics: it can disguise itself indistinguishably as an inanimate object when motionless, making it exceptionally good at deception. It can also stick targets that come into contact with it using its Sticky mechanic, requiring a DC 14 Strength check to escape. This adds strategic depth to its encounters as it can control the battlefield by limiting the movements of its opponents. 

The creature's Telepathic Sense enables it to sense humanoids within 120 feet, thus enhancing its ambush potential by gaining mental images of desired inanimate objects around it. This ability is blocked by obstacles such as 3 feet of wood or dirt. Additionally, the Mirage Monster has a vulnerability; it assumes its true form if splashed with at least 1 gallon of water, which reduces the difficulty to escape its grips. The Legendary Resistance allows it to automatically succeed on a failed saving throw once per day, providing it with exceptional resilience against spells or effects that could otherwise incapacitate it.

In terms of combat abilities, the Mirage Monster can perform a Multiattack action, allowing it to deal damage through both a bite attack and a pseudopod attack in one turn. The bite attack deals 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage and restrains the target if they are already stuck, while the pseudopod deals 6 (1d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage and also applies the Sticky effect. The Swallow action is particularly dangerous, as it allows the creature to consume a Medium or smaller creature, granting it cover while dealing ongoing acid damage each turn until the swallowed creature manages to damage the Mirage Monster enough or it dies.

As a bonus action, the Mirage Monster can shapeshift, enabling tactical versatility during combat by changing its form to mimic an inanimate object of similar size or return to its true form. This keeps its statistics unaffected, allowing it to maintain combat effectiveness while altering its appearance. 

When it comes to legendary actions, the Mirage Monster can use two at the end of other creatures' turns, which allows it to react effectively in combat. It can perform a Grasping Pseudopod attack to pull enemies closer, which enhances its ability to capture targets. Alternatively, it can launch a bite attack which can serve as a devastating follow-up if it needs to strike harder.

Overall, the Mirage Monster is primarily a cunning ambusher with significant physical strength and crowd control capabilities, making it a formidable opponent in a variety of combat scenarios.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the mimic is motionless, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate object.
- **Sticky:** A creature, object, or weapon that touches the mimic is stuck to the mimic. A creature can use an action to make a DC 14 Strength check, freeing itself or an object or creature within reach on a success. The effect also ends when the mimic chooses to end it or when the mimic dies.
- **Telepathic Sense:** A mimic telepathically senses the presence of humanoids within 120 feet and gains a mental image of any inanimate object desired by any of the creatures it senses. This ability is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead.
- **Water Soluble:** If the mimic is splashed with at least 1 gallon of water, it assumes its true form and the DC to escape its Sticky trait is reduced to 10 until the end of its next turn.
- **Legendary Resistance (1/Day):** If the mirage monster fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it immediately shapeshifts into its true form if it has not already done so.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The mimic makes a bite attack and a pseudopod attack.
- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage  and the target is subjected to the mimics Sticky trait.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature stuck to the mimic. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage  and the target is restrained until it is no longer stuck to the mimic. While a creature is restrained by the mimic  the mimic can't bite a different creature.
- **Swallow:** The mimic makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature restrained by it. If the attack hits and the mimic has not swallowed another creature  the target is swallowed and no longer stuck to the mimic. A swallowed creature has total cover from attacks from outside the mimic  is blinded and restrained  and takes 5 (2d4) acid damage at the start of each of the mimics turns.
- **If a swallowed creature deals 10 or more damage to the mimic in a single turn, or if the mimic dies, the target falls prone in an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the mimic and is no longer swallowed:** 

### Bonus Actions

- **Shapeshift:** The mimic changes its form to resemble an inanimate object of its approximate size or changes into its true form, which is an amorphous blob. Objects it is carrying or stuck to are not transformed. While shapeshifted, its statistics are unchanged. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

- **The mirage monster can take 2 legendary actions:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Grasping Pseudopod:** The mirage monster makes a pseudopod attack with a range of 15 feet. On a hit, the target makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is pulled up to 15 feet towards the mirage monster.
