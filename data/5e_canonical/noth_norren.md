The Noth-norren exhibits exceptional physical strength and dexterity, which enhance its melee and ranged attack capabilities. While it has weaknesses against certain magical effects, its ability to resist damage from various types of attacks makes it a challenging adversary. Players must tread carefully when facing this elemental, as its ability to manipulate its environment can turn the tide of combat in its favor.</summary>

The Noth-norren has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 21 (+5), which is exceptional, allowing for powerful melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 18 (+4), which is very good, enhancing its speed and defense.
- Constitution: 18 (+4), also very good, contributing to its robustness and hit points.

The creature has saving throw bonuses of +8 in Dexterity and +8 in Constitution, both of which are good. It is immune to poison and thunder damage, showcasing its elemental nature, and it also resists lightning damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to being deafened, exhausted, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious, making it a highly durable foe. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 12, while it communicates in the Auran language.

The Noth-norren possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess:
- Air Turbulence: Any flying creature that enters or begins its turn within 60 feet of the Noth-norren must land by the end of its turn or risk falling, and ranged attack rolls against the Noth-norren have disadvantage, complicating the attackers’ strategies.
- Magic Weapons: All weapon attacks made by the Noth-norren are considered magical, allowing them to bypass damage resistances that non-magical attacks might face.

During combat, the Noth-norren can perform the following actions:
- Multiattack: It can make two slam attacks or throw debris twice in a turn.
- Slam: This melee attack has a +9 to hit and can reach up to 15 feet, dealing an average of 27 (4d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If a target is hit, it must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, making it vulnerable to further attacks.
- Throw Debris: This ranged attack has a +8 to hit with a range of 60/180 feet, inflicting 22 (4d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage upon hitting a target.
- Fling Victim: When it catches a Large or smaller creature in its vortex, the creature is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If it collides with a solid surface, the target takes additional bludgeoning damage, while the impact can also affect other nearby creatures.
- Vortex (Recharge 5-6): This ability allows the Noth-norren to pull creatures within 5 feet into its vortex, dealing 21 (6d6) slashing damage each turn they remain inside. However, if it takes 30 or more damage from a creature within the vortex in one turn, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or release all trapped creatures, which will fall prone nearby. If the Noth-norren is defeated, it dissolves into a pile of teeth, releasing all trapped victims.

In battle, the Noth-norren presents a daunting challenge with its ability to control the movement of its foes, deliver formidable attacks, and resist a range of damaging effects.</detail>
