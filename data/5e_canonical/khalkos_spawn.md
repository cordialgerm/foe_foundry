<summary>The Khalkos Spawn is a tiny aberration known for its cunning and strategic approach in combat. With an Armor Class of 16 and a total of 27 hit points, it combines decent protection with moderate durability, making it a formidable opponent despite its small size. While its Challenge Rating of 2 indicates that it is suitable for low-level encounters, its 18 Intelligence grants it a high level of cunning and tactical awareness. The creatureâ€™s impressive Dexterity score allows it to evade attacks effectively, making it quite mobile with a walking speed of 30 feet and a flying speed of 30 feet. Notably, the Khalkos Spawn has abilities that manipulate the battlefield and confuse its foes, giving it an edge in tactical scenarios. However, its physical strength is significantly lacking, with a Strength score of 6, making it reliant on its other attributes and abilities for effectiveness in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Khalkos Spawn has the following attributes: Strength of 6, which results in a very bad modifier of -2, indicative of its frailty in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity is quite high at 16, providing a good modifier of +3, allowing it to avoid attacks and act swiftly. The Constitution score is 14, giving it an average modifier of +2, which provides a reasonable amount of hit points for its size. Intelligence is exceptionally high at 18, resulting in a +4 modifier, reflecting its cunning and strategic capabilities. Wisdom is at 14, resulting in a good modifier of +2, enhancing its perception and insight. Finally, its Charisma is 12, yielding a +1 modifier, which is average and makes it a decent communicator for its telepathic abilities.

The creature is resilient against damage types such as fire, psychic, and radiant, indicating a versatile defensive strategy. It is also immune to the charmed condition, offering it protection against certain magical influences. With darkvision that extends up to 60 feet, it can see in dim light as if it were bright light, which aids its ability to navigate environments. The Khalkos Spawn communicates telepathically within a range of 120 feet, allowing it to strategize and convey messaging without verbal speech.

One of its special abilities is "Detect Alignment," which allows the Khalkos Spawn to sense the presence of creatures with alignment traits within 30 feet. This ability provides it with significant tactical knowledge about potential threats and allies, giving it an advantage in planning its actions.

In terms of actions, "Chaos Pheromones" allows the Khalkos Spawn to release a cloud of pheromones in a 10-foot radius, causing confusion among non-Khalkos creatures in the area. Those creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or become confused for up to one minute, repeating the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. This ability can disrupt enemy strategies and create opportunities for the Khalkos Spawn and its allies. If a creature succeeds on its saving throw or the effect ends, it becomes immune to the Khalkos Spawn's pheromones for the next 24 hours.

The "Sting" attack allows it to make a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet against one target. On a successful hit, it deals 5 piercing damage from a 1d4 roll plus an additional 3 poison damage from a 1d6 roll. This action allows the Khalkos Spawn to inflict significant damage despite being a small creature, combining both physical and poison damage to make it a dangerous presence in close combat.</detail>
