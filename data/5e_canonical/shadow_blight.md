<summary>The Shadow Blight is a small, neutral evil plant creature that lurks in the shadows and thrives on darkness and decay. It possesses a decent level of resilience and can inflict significant cold and necrotic damage through its attacks. The Shadow Blight is particularly effective in ambush situations, utilizing its False Appearance ability to blend in with the environment. However, it is vulnerable to fire damage, which can easily disrupt its plans. With its spell-like abilities, it can animate other plants to serve as additional threats, making it a formidable opponent in environments rich with vegetation.</summary>

<detail>

The Shadow Blight has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average for its challenge rating, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of physical damage before succumbing. It has 65 hit points, calculated from rolling 10d6 and adding 30, which grants it good durability. In terms of attributes, its Strength is 13 (+1 modifier, average), Dexterity is 15 (+2 modifier, good), and Constitution is 16 (+3 modifier, very good). It has low Intelligence (5, -3 modifier, very bad) and Charisma (3, -4 modifier, very bad), while Wisdom is relatively strong at 16 (+3 modifier, very good). The creature has proficiency in stealth, providing a +4 bonus, which enhances its ability to avoid detection.

The Shadow Blight is vulnerable to fire damage, meaning it takes double damage from such attacks. It has resistances to cold and necrotic damage, reducing incoming damage from these sources, giving it good survivability against certain types of attacks. Furthermore, it is immune to being blinded and deafened, protecting it from effects that could hinder its awareness.

In terms of senses, the Shadow Blight has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures in that range without relying on sight. Beyond that distance, it is blinded. Additionally, it has a passive perception of 13, which is average and helps it notice stealthy intruders or other threats nearby.

The Shadow Blight has one notable special abilityâ€”False Appearance. While it remains motionless, it can appear as a stump of a dead tree, making it difficult for creatures to identify it until it moves or is attacked.

For actions in combat, the Shadow Blight can use Frozen Shadow Tendril, a melee spell attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, targeting a single creature. On a successful hit, the attack deals 7 (2d6) cold damage and an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic damage, making it quite dangerous if it manages to strike.

The creature can also utilize the Animate Plants action, which recharges after a short or long rest. This ability allows the Shadow Blight to magically animate 1d4 plants within 60 feet, transforming them into awakened shrubs under its control. The attacks of these animated shrubs inflict an extra 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. If not destroyed within one hour, these shrubs can develop into new Shadow Blights, potentially multiplying threats on the battlefield.</detail>
