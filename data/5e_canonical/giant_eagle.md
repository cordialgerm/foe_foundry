<summary>A Giant Eagle is a majestic, soaring predator with a wingspan that can reach up to 20 feet. These creatures are intelligent and often form close bonds with good-aligned humanoids, sometimes acting as guardians or mounts for noble warriors. Giant Eagles are typically found in high mountains or wide open skies, where they hunt for large prey such as deer or smaller predators. In combat, they dive at their foes with sharp talons and powerful beaks, using their speed and flight to gain an advantage. Giant Eagles are proud creatures, and their presence often symbolizes freedom and nobility.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Eagle is a large beast characterized by its keen senses and aerial prowess, making it an effective scout and a fierce combatant. With a moderate Armor Class of 13 and 40 hit points, it presents a small challenge to unprepared adventurers, earning a Challenge Rating of 1. This creature combines decent physical abilities, particularly in Dexterity with a +3 modifier, which is considered good, allowing it superior agility in flight and combat. However, its Constitution is only average, with a +1 modifier, and it has low mental abilities with its Intelligence being -1, deemed very bad. Notably, the Giant Eagle possesses heightened sight, greatly enhancing its Perception when relying on vision. Its special ability to swim adds versatility, although it can face dangers if it remains submerged too long.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Eagle has the following attributes: Strength is +3 (average), Dexterity is +3 (good), Constitution is +1 (average), Intelligence is -1 (very bad), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +0 (average). It can perceive its environment with a Perception skill of 14, benefiting from exceptional sight with its heightened sight ability, which increases its Perception to a remarkable 19 when using vision alone. Additionally, it has a Stealth value of 13, making it fairly adept at moving unseen. This eagle understands Common and Auran but cannot speak either language.

In combat, the Giant Eagle can utilize several actions. They are capable of Multiattack, allowing it to take one Beak and one Talons attack in a single turn. For its Beak attack, it makes a melee weapon attack roll with a +5 to hit, which is considered good. The Beak does an average of 6 piercing damage on a hit. On the other hand, the Talons attack also has a +5 to hit and deals significantly more damage, at an average of 10 slashing damage, and it can grapple a Medium or smaller target, restricting their movement until they successfully escape the grapple with a DC 13 check.

The Giant Eagle's special abilities enhance its utility in both exploration and combat. The Heightened Sight ability allows it to see exceptionally well, improving its ability to detect hidden creatures or objects. The Seabird ability grants it the capacity to swim up to 40 feet, although it must always transition to flying or end its movement on solid ground. This adds a layer of strategy, as if the eagle ends its turn submerged, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to avoid suffocating, making it potentially vulnerable in dangerous aquatic environments. Overall, the Giant Eagle is a versatile creature, effective in various contexts, but it does possess some limitations with its swimming ability.

The Giant Eagle is a large beast that plays a versatile role in both combat and scouting. Boasting a decent Armor Class of 12 and a total of 26 hit points, it can withstand some damage while being agile enough to evade attacks, thanks to its flying speed of 80 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it presents a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, offering 200 experience points upon defeat. Notably, its keen sight allows it to excel in perception checks, making it an excellent scout in various environments. While its mental attributes are relatively low, with an Intelligence of 8 and a Charisma of 10, its physical attributes—particularly its Strength and Dexterity at 14—make it a fierce creature in battle. However, its relatively low Constitution score of 12 indicates it may struggle against sustain damage in prolonged encounters.

For its attributes, the Giant Eagle has the following scores: 

- Strength: 14 (+2, which is good for physical attacks)
- Dexterity: 14 (+2, providing a good boost to its agility and effectiveness in avoiding attacks)
- Constitution: 12 (+1, which is average and helps with its hit points)
- Intelligence: 8 (-1, indicating very poor reasoning ability)
- Wisdom: 14 (+2, allowing for good perception and insight)
- Charisma: 10 (+0, showing average personal magnetism)

The Giant Eagle is skilled in perception, receiving a +4 bonus to its checks. This, combined with its passive perception of 14, allows it to detect hidden creatures or objects effectively. It can communicate in its own language, Giant Eagle, and understands Common and Auran but cannot speak them.

One of its special abilities is Keen Sight, which gives the Giant Eagle advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight. This means it can roll two d20s and take the higher result, significantly increasing the chance of spotting hidden enemies or important details.

In terms of combat actions, the Giant Eagle can execute a Talons attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it inflicts 9 (2d6+2) slashing damage and grapples its target, making it difficult for the target to escape or retaliate; the escape difficulty is DC 13. The eagle cannot attack a different target while grappling one with its talons.

Additionally, as a bonus action, the Giant Eagle can use its Beak attack on one creature that it has grappled. This attack also has a +4 to hit and deals 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage. This ability allows the Giant Eagle to maintain pressure on its grappled target, effectively controlling the battlefield while dealing consistent damage.</detail>
