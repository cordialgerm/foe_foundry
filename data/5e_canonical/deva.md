Its saving throws for Wisdom and Charisma are both +9, which are very good and enhance its durability against mind-affecting and charm spells.

Its senses include truesight 30 feet and a passive Perception of 19, allowing it to perceive hidden or invisible creatures.

The Deva's special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness and its role as a celestial being. "Magic Resistance" grants the Deva advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making its magical defenses good. The "Aligned" ability signifies its inherent Lawful and often Good aura. "Celestial Dissolution" describes how the Deva's body and equipment dissolve into light upon death, a trait common among celestial entities. The "Detect Alignment" ability allows it to ascertain the alignment of creatures within 30 feet that it can see, aiding in tactical decisions. Furthermore, the "Immortal Nature" ability means the Deva does not need air, food, or sleep, making it exceptional in prolonged encounters.

In combat, the Deva can take multiple actions due to its "Multiattack" feature, allowing it to make two attacks in one turn. It wields the "Celestial Hammer," making a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage alongside 17 (5d6) radiant damage, making the total potential damage very good. Additionally, if it hits, the target cannot make opportunity attacks against the Deva until the beginning of its next turn, offering tactical advantages.

The "Divine Blast" allows the Deva to make a ranged spell attack with a +8 to hit, targeting a creature within 60 feet and dealing a substantial 22 (5d8) radiant damage upon a hit. For its healing capabilities, the "Radiant Energy" ability allows the Deva to touch a willing creature, and if the target is unwilling, the Deva can make a +8 attack roll. This ability can heal 60 hit points while also ending conditions such as blindness, deafness, disease, or poison. Alternatively, the Deva can use this ability to inflict 60 radiant damage on an unwilling target, adding versatility to its role in combat.

Lastly, the "Change Form" ability enables the Deva to transform into a beast or humanoid form or revert back to its true form while retaining its statistics, speech, and telepathy. This ability provides strategic options for the Deva in various scenarios.

In summary, the Deva embodies a capable celestial warrior with strong offensive and defensive abilities, powerful in both combat and support roles, making it a formidable opponent or an invaluable ally in any adventurer's tale.

The Deva is a powerful Medium celestial being often regarded as an angelic figure in Dungeons & Dragons. With a challenge rating of 10, it serves as a formidable ally or a daunting adversary in any encounter. Its defense is notably strong, boasting an Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of 165 Hit Points, allowing it to endure significant damage in battle. The Deva possesses exceptional abilities in combat and healing, making it exceptionally useful for providing support to allies or punishing foes.

Overall, the Deva balances offense and defense with high mobility, impressive damage output, and powerful restorative abilities.

The Deva's attributes are as follows: Strength 18 (+4, good), Dexterity 18 (+4, good), Constitution 18 (+4, good), Intelligence 16 (+3, average), Wisdom 24 (+9, exceptional), and Charisma 24 (+9, exceptional).

Its weapon attacks are magical and inflict an extra 4d8 radiant damage, significantly increasing its threat level in combat. With Immortal Nature, the Deva does not require food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. It also benefits from Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. One of its group-supporting abilities, Reviving Prayer, allows the Deva to return a creature to life within 24 hours of its death, restoring half of its maximum hit points, but it cannot revive the same creature again within 30 days.

In combat, the Deva can initiate a Multiattack, making three attacks with its Mace, which has a +8 to hit and deals 7 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 18 radiant damage on a successful strike. The Healing Touch ability, usable three times per day, allows the Deva to touch a creature to restore 20 hit points while also curing any curses, diseases, poisons, blindness, or deafness that may afflict the target.

As a bonus action, the Deva can use Change Shape to magically transform into a Large or smaller Beast or Humanoid with a challenge rating not exceeding its own. This transformation preserves several of its key traits, including Angelic Resilience, Angelic Senses, and Immortal Nature while adapting its statistics to fit the new form. The Deva will revert to its true celestial form upon death. This versatility allows the Deva to strategically alter its appearance to suit various situations in combat or exploration.</detail>
