<summary>The Spider Drake is a formidable creature in Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a Large Dragon of lawful evil alignment. It possesses a combination of strengths that make it a challenging foe, including high armor class, significant hit points, and a versatile array of attacks. Its climbing and flying speed, coupled with its poison immunity, adds to its resilience in combat and makes it an unpredictable opponent. However, despite its impressive attributes, it is less effective in terms of intelligence and charisma, which can limit its tactical options in certain scenarios. </summary>

<detail>

The Spider Drake has an armor class of 18, which is considered good, making it relatively difficult to hit in battle. It has 136 hit points, reflecting a strong capacity to withstand damage, indicated by its 16d10 + 48 hit die roll. Its challenge rating of 9 signifies that it presents a significant challenge to a party of adventurers and is worth 5,000 experience points upon defeat. 

In terms of attributes, the Spider Drake boasts a strength score of 19, providing it with a +4 modifier, which is exceptionally good for physical attacks. Its dexterity of 13 grants a +1 modifier, which is average, while its constitution of 17 allows for a +3 modifier, making it good in resisting physical attacks. The drake has a very low intelligence score of 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, which is very bad for mental challenges. It has a wisdom of 16, with a +3 modifier that is good for perception and survival checks. Lastly, its charisma score of 15 yields a +2 modifier, which is average for social interactions.

The Spider Drake is proficient in several saving throws, receiving a +5 bonus in dexterity, +7 in constitution, +7 in wisdom, and +6 in charisma. Its skills reflect its capability with a +7 bonus in perception and survival, and a +5 bonus in stealth, enabling it to be an effective ambusher. It is immune to poison damage and is also immune to the poisoned condition, highlighting its biological fortitude. With a blindsight range of 30 feet and darkvision extending to 120 feet, it has excellent sensory perception, and its passive perception of 17 is quite good. It understands Common and Draconic languages, granting it some communicative ability.

The Spider Drake has a special ability known as Sticky Secretions, which activates when it is hit with a melee attack. The attacker’s weapon becomes stuck to these secretions unless they either didn’t use a weapon or succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw. If they fail, they become restrained in the webbing. The affected creature can attempt to escape by making a DC 16 Strength check on their turn.

In combat, the Spider Drake can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks per turn: one bite and two claw strikes. The bite attack has a +8 to hit with a range of 10 feet, dealing 15 piercing damage and an additional 7 poison damage on a successful hit. Its claw attacks also have a +8 modifier and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 11 slashing damage with each hit.

The Spider Drake also possesses two significant abilities that recharge on a roll of 5 or 6: Poison Breath and Web. Poison Breath is a cone attack that extends 30 feet and requires creatures in that area to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in 42 poison damage and the poisoned condition, while a successful save halves the damage and negates the condition. The poisoned character can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns, granting a chance to escape from the condition.

The Web ability is a ranged attack with a +5 to hit and a range of 60/120 feet. If successful, the target becomes restrained. They can escape on their next action by making a DC 16 Strength check, or the web can be destroyed. The webbing has low hit points and is particularly vulnerable to fire damage, but is immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage, creating a strategic challenge for players attempting to rescue their allies ensnared in it.</detail>

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
