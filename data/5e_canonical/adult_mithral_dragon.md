<summary>The Adult Mithral Dragon is a powerful and majestic creature known for its exceptional capabilities in combat and magic. Standing as a Huge Dragon, it possesses a neutral alignment, making it both a potential ally and a formidable adversary. With an Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 253, it is quite resilient in battle. Its Challenge Rating of 18 indicates that it is a significant threat, providing 20,000 XP upon defeat. The dragon's strengths lie in its high Dexterity, allowing for agile movements and excellent stealth, making it an effective opponent. However, it has a lower Strength score, which is not exceptionally significant for a dragon, indicating that it may rely more on cunning and magical abilities than sheer brute force.</summary>

<detail>

For its attributes, the Adult Mithral Dragon has a Strength score of 12 (+1), which is average for a creature of its size but not particularly strong. Its Dexterity is 22 (+6), a very good score that enhances its agility. The Constitution score is 21 (+5), providing it with good resilience. Its Intelligence is 18 (+4), allowing for strategic thinking and manipulation. Wisdom sits at 19 (+4), providing insight and awareness, while its Charisma score is 18 (+4), essential for persuasion and presence in social situations. 

In terms of saving throws, it excels with a Dexterity modifier of +12 (very good), Constitution +11 (good), Wisdom +10 (good), and Charisma +10 (good). The dragon also possesses a range of skills, including History and Insight at +10 (good), Perception at +16 (exceptional), Persuasion at +10 (good), and Stealth at +12 (very good). It is immune to slashing damage and is charmed, has blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and has a passive Perception score of 26, indicating sharp awareness. The dragon can communicate in all languages and has telepathy up to 120 feet.

The Adult Mithral Dragon has several special abilities. Legendary Resistance allows it to automatically succeed on saving throws three times per day if it would otherwise fail, which is an exceptional defensive tactic. Its Magic Resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further enhancing its resistive qualities. The Mithral Scales ability provides a unique reflection mechanic where a successful saving throw against a spell not only negates the effect but also allows the dragon to redirect the spell back at the caster.

In terms of combat, the dragon can utilize its Multiattack to make a variety of attacks, including its Frightful Presence, which can potentially frighten nearby creatures unless they succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. The Bite attack has a +12 to hit, reaches 10 feet, and deals 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage while having the added option to end one magical effect on a target. The Claw attack, also with a +12 to hit, deals 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage and can inflict continual damage unless a target succeeds on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. The Tail attack inflicts 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage and has a range of 15 feet.

The Shard Breath, a powerful area effect attack with a recharge of 5-6, allows the dragon to deal significant slashing damage in a 60-foot cone and creates difficult terrain, making it difficult for enemies to maneuver without taking additional damage while moving through the area.

The Adult Mithral Dragon can also take three legendary actions. It can detect creatures within 60 feet with a Wisdom (Perception) check, make a tail attack, or execute a Wing Attack that deals area damage and can knock creatures prone. The Wing Attack costs two actions, showcasing the dragon's ability to control the battlefield effectively and maintain its advantageous position.

Overall, the Adult Mithral Dragon serves as a potent, multifaceted enemy with numerous special abilities and potent attacks, capable of shaping the battlefield while resisting many forms of magical effects.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Magic Resistance:** The dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Mithral Scales:** If the dragon rolls a 20 on a saving throw against a spell that targets only it, the dragon is unaffected, and the spell is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the dragon, turning the caster into the target.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the dragon can end one magical effect of its choice of 5th level or lower on the target.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 +6) slashing damage, and if the target isn’t a Construct or Undead, it must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or lose 7 (2d6) hp at the start of each of its turns as a piece of metallic claw breaks off in the wound. Any creature can take an action to remove the claw with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The claw pops out of the wound if the target receives magical healing.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Shard Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The mithral dragon spits metallic shards in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute, then the shards dissolve into wisps of silvery smoke. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a Tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
