<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Saber-Toothed Tiger is a large, prehistoric predator with long, curved canine teeth that protrude from its powerful jaws. These big cats are fast, agile, and ferocious hunters, often stalking prey before ambushing with swift, deadly strikes. Their sharp claws and massive jaws allow them to take down large animals with ease. Found in cold, mountainous regions or ancient forests, Saber-Toothed Tigers are solitary creatures, relying on their stealth and raw power to survive. Their fangs are their most notable feature, capable of piercing through flesh and bone with ease.</summary>
