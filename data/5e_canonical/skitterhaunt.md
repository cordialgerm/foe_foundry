<MonsterName/>Skitterhaunt</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Ooze</CreatureType>

<summary>The Skitterhaunt is a Large ooze creature that operates unaligned in nature. This monster is particularly known for its ability to infest other creatures, making it dangerous to any large or smaller beasts it encounters. Its relatively good Armor Class of 14 and solid Hit Points totaling 95 give it respectable durability in combat. The Skitterhaunt excels at delivering acid damage, boasting a combination of natural attacks and special abilities that can severely debilitate its opponents. However, it suffers from rather low Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, which make it less effective in initiating interactions or avoiding detection. Its unique abilities, like Vermin Encasement, allow it to persist even when reduced to zero hit points, transforming into a smaller, but still threatening ooze form.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Skitterhaunt are as follows: Strength is 15, granting it a good +2 modifier that allows it to hit hard in melee combat. Dexterity is average at 11, yielding no modifier, indicating it lacks nimbleness. Constitution is particularly high at 19, giving a very good +4 modifier which contributes significantly to its Hit Points. Intelligence is very low at 3 with a -4 modifier, meaning it struggles with tasks that require thought and reasoning. Wisdom is also poor at 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, causing it to be vulnerable to perception challenges. Charisma is extremely low at 1 with a -5 modifier, making social interactions almost impossible for the creature.

The Skitterhaunt possesses several remarkable special abilities. **Broken Shell** causes any creature that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet to incur 4 (1d8) acid damage, acting as a deterrent to close-range attackers. With **Ooze Nature**, it is immune to the need for sleep, allowing it to remain vigilant indefinitely. The **Vermin Encasement** ability allows the Skitterhaunt to survive in a host's exoskeleton, becoming a Small ooze when reduced to 0 hit points, with lower armor class and hit points but increased mobility.

In combat, the Skitterhaunt uses a **Multiattack** to either deliver one Mandibles attack and one Sting attack, or two Sting attacks. The **Mandibles** attack has a +4 to hit, and it deals 5 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage along with 9 (2d8) acid damage, and it can grapple Medium or smaller creatures with an escape DC of 12, effectively restraining them. The **Sting** attack also has a +4 to hit, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage, presenting a formidable risk for opponents.

The most sinister ability, **Infest Vermin**, allows the Skitterhaunt to invade the body of a large or smaller beast, requiring a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to resist its poison. Failure to save leads to taking 7 (2d6) acid damage daily and a reduction in hit point maximum until a long rest is completed. If the target acquires the fortunate circumstance of succeeding two consecutive saves, it can force the Skitterhaunt out, gaining immunity to further infestations for 24 hours.

Finally, the Skitterhaunt demonstrates its offensive prowess with **Acid Spray** (Recharge 6), an attack that involves spitting acid in a 30-foot long and 5-foot wide line. Creatures within this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) acid damage if they fail, or half as much damage on a success. This ability allows it to strike multiple foes at once, amplifying its threat on the battlefield.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Broken Shell:** A creature that hits the skitterhaunt with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage.
- **Ooze Nature:** The skitterhaunt doesn’t require sleep.
- **Vermin Encasement:** The creature within the vermin’s shell is a shapeless ooze protected by the vermin’s exoskeleton. When the skitterhaunt is reduced to 0 hp, the exoskeleton breaks, and the skitterhaunt ooze exits it. Once out of its exoskeleton, the ooze is Small, has an AC of 10, 10 hp, and a speed of 15 feet, and it can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In addition, its only attack is a Slam that uses the same statistics as its Sting, except it deals bludgeoning damage instead of piercing damage. The skitterhaunt dies if it remains outside of a host for more than 24 hours. It can exit or enter a dead host’s exoskeleton as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The skitterhaunt makes one Mandibles attack and one Sting attack, or it makes two Sting attacks.
- **Mandibles:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained, and the skitterhaunt can’t use its Mandibles on another target.
- **Sting:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.
- **Infest Vermin:** The skitterhaunt infests a Large or smaller Beast with an exoskeleton within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the skitterhaunt no longer infests it. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw or take 7 (2d6) acid damage, and its hp maximum is reduced by that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the skitterhaunt no longer infests it. The target dies if this reduces its hp maximum to 0. The skitterhaunt then takes control of the body, dissolving the flesh and hiding within the exoskeleton. A target that succeeds on two consecutive saving throws forces the skitterhaunt out of its body and is immune to the skitterhaunt’s Infest Vermin for the next 24 hours.
- **Acid Spray (Recharge 6):** The skitterhaunt spits acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
