<summary>The Monolith Champion is a formidable large construct that embodies neutral alignment. It is designed for combat encounters, functioning as a powerful melee attacker with devastating potential due to its high damage output and unique abilities. With an armor class of 17 and a substantial 102 hit points, it is well-equipped to withstand assaults from adventurers. Its challenge rating of 8 indicates that it presents a significant challenge to a party of players, making it a noteworthy opponent. Notable strengths include immunity to various damage types and conditions, as well as damage-dealing weapon attacks amplified by magical effects. However, it is limited in terms of dexterity and intelligence, which may hinder its mobility and strategic versatility in certain scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Monolith Champion possesses the following attributes: 
- Strength: 19 (+4), which is exceptional, enabling it to hit hard in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), which is average, providing minimal benefits to its agility.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), which is good, giving it resilience and a substantial pool of hit points.
- Intelligence: 10 (+0), which is average, indicating it does not excel in cognitive tasks.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), which is also average, reflecting a neutral perception and insight.
- Charisma: 10 (+0), again average, suggesting no particular influence in social interactions.

The Monolith Champion's benefits include damage immunities to poison and psychic damage, as well as immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons unless wielded with adamantine. It is also immune to being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, making it a resilient foe with protection against various debilitating effects. It has darkvision, allowing it to see in darkness up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 10, which is average. The Champion can communicate in Elvish and Umbral.

Among its special abilities is **Coldfire Weapons**, which enhances its weapon attacks with blue fey fire, allowing it to deal an additional 3d8 damage of either cold or fire type on successful hits. This means it can vary its elemental damage based on the situation. Its **Construct Nature** grants it the ability to ignore basic necessities such as air, food, and sleep, making it relentless in any prolonged encounter.

In terms of actions, the Monolith Champion can perform a **Multiattack**, enabling it to make one Greatsword attack and one Slam attack in a single turn. The **Greatsword** is a melee weapon attack with a +7 bonus to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 18 (4d6 + 4) slashing damage plus an additional 13 (3d8) cold or fire damage, depending on its choice. Importantly, if the target is within a fey court or castle, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be rendered invisible and paralyzed for 1 minute, subjecting it to control by the Champion with an illusory double created to distract its allies. The target can make attempts to escape at the end of its turns.

The **Slam** attack also carries a +7 to hit and similarly has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage along with the additional 13 (3d8) cold or fire damage. This provides the Monolith Champion with diverse ways to engage its opponents and adapt its strategy in battle.</detail>
