<summary>The Qumdaq is a small elemental creature that embodies the essence of sand and earth. It is considered neutral in alignment, making it less likely to take sides in conflicts. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it is relatively low-power compared to other creatures, but it possesses unique abilities that allow it to disrupt foes and support its allies effectively. Its strengths lie in its ability to manipulate its environment through burrowing and its capacity to enhance its allies' effectiveness in combat. However, it has low hit points, which makes it vulnerable if not utilized strategically. </summary>

<detail>

The Qumdaq has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average for its Challenge Rating, offering it some protection against attacks. Its hit points total 18, indicated by 4d6+4, which is on the lower end, suggesting it can be defeated relatively quickly if targeted. The creature has a walking speed of 30 feet and can burrow through unworked earth or stone at the same speed, showcasing its ability to maneuver around the battlefield efficiently.

In terms of attributes, the Qumdaq has a Strength of 8 (-1), which is very bad; Dexterity of 14 (+2), which is good; Constitution of 13 (+1), which is average; Intelligence of 6 (-2), which is very bad; Wisdom of 11 (+0), which is average; and Charisma of 10 (+0), which is average. For saving throws, it has a +2 to Wisdom saves, which is average, and it has skills related to perception with a modifier of +0, meaning it can detect danger but is not particularly skilled at it. The Qumdaq also enjoys several condition immunities, including exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, poison, and unconsciousness, making it very resilient to various control effects, and it has darkvision and tremorsense that allow it to perceive its surroundings effectively within 30 feet.

The Qumdaq possesses several notable special abilities. Its Earth Glide ability enables it to burrow through nonmagical unworked earth or stone without disturbing the material around it, allowing it to reposition stealthily. The Elemental Nature ability means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it an enduring presence in prolonged encounters. Upon death, it releases a Final Gift, causing a burst of sand that can restore 5 hit points to nearby qumdaqs or grant temporary hit points if the target is at maximum health. 
Through Horde Tactics, the Qumdaq gains an advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one ally is close by, enhancing its offensive potential in coordinated attacks. Additionally, its weapons deal extra bludgeoning damage if multiple allies are within proximity, encouraging teamwork. Lastly, it has the ability called Sense Magic, which grants it awareness of magical auras nearby, functioning like the detect magic spell but without consuming magical resources.

In combat, the Qumdaq has a Slam attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing 4 bludgeoning damage. Finally, it has a special action called Desiccation Field, usable once per day, wherein it expands its arms to create a swirling field of sand that damages and exhausts nearby non-qumdaq creatures. This ability deals 5 bludgeoning damage and potentially inflicts one level of exhaustion, leading to significant debuffs to affected creatures. It also imposes a Constitution saving throw (DC 10) for half damage and to avoid exhaustion, and importantly, it can contribute to multiple levels of exhaustion but imposes a limit to prevent stacking damage from several Qumdaqs at once.</detail>
