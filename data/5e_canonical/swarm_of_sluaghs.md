<summary>The Swarm of Sluaghs is a medium-sized fey creature that represents chaotic evil. With a unique blend of mobility and magical abilities, this swarm poses a significant challenge to adventurers. It can both walk swiftly and fly, allowing it to maneuver around the battlefield effectively. With a total of 54 hit points, the swarm can endure a fair amount of damage before being defeated. However, its dependence on stealth and its weaknesses when exposed to sunlight can be exploited by cunning opponents. It operates under the challenge rating of 3, which signifies it is a moderate threat for a party of adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of its core attributes, the Swarm of Sluaghs has a Strength score of 6, which yields a very bad modifier of -2, indicating its physical prowess is lacking. Its Dexterity score is notably high at 16, resulting in a very good +3 modifier, making it quite agile. The swarm's Constitution score is average, sitting at 11, which gives it a 0 modifier. Intelligence is low at 6, resulting in another very bad -2 modifier, while its Wisdom is slightly above average at 13, granting a +1 modifier. Charisma is neutral at 10, providing a 0 modifier. 

The swarm is skilled in Stealth, receiving a good +5 bonus, enhancing its ability to hide and ambush targets. It has several resistances and immunities, including vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold damage, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Additionally, the swarm is immune to numerous conditions, such as being charmed, frightened, or paralyzed. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 11, indicating it can navigate in low-light conditions effectively. The swarm is able to communicate using both Common and Sylvan languages.

The Swarm of Sluaghs has two notable special abilities. The first is Sunlight Weakness, which drastically affects its combat effectiveness; while in sunlight, the swarm rolls with disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, making it significantly less formidable during the day. The second ability, Swarm, allows it to occupy the same space as another creature and move through tight spaces, reflecting its nature as a swarm. However, it cannot regain or gain temporary hit points, which limits its longevity in prolonged encounters.

In terms of actions, the Swarm of Sluaghs can use Chilling Touch as a melee weapon attack, which has a +5 to hit against opponents within its space. On a successful hit, it inflicts a substantial 28 cold damage (or reduced to 14 if at half or lower hit points). Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be unable to regain hit points for one minute. This could be critical in a fight, particularly against healing-focused characters, as the target can attempt to end this effect by succeeding on subsequent saving throws at the end of its turns.

As a bonus action, the swarm has access to Shadow Stealth, allowing it to take the Hide action while in dim light or darkness. This ability enhances its stealth capabilities, enabling it to ambush foes more effectively and take control of the battlefield dynamics when shadows are present.</detail>
