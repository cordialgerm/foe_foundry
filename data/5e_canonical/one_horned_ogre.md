As a Large Giant with a challenge rating of 5, it poses a serious threat to adventurers, boasting strong hit points and decent armor. Its strengths lie in its high Strength score of 21, enabling it to deal considerable damage with melee attacks, and its Charisma score of 18, which enhances its spellcasting abilities.

<detail>

The One-Horned Ogre has an Armor Class of 14, which indicates an average level of defense for a creature of its size and type. It has 93 hit points derived from 11d10 plus a constitution modifier of 33, making it relatively resilient and hard to defeat in battle. It can walk at a speed of 40 feet, allowing it to cover ground quickly against its opponents. 

In terms of attributes, the One-Horned Ogre presents the following scores: a Strength of 21, providing a very good +5 modifier, which translates to exceptional melee attack power; a Dexterity of 10, giving a modifier of +0, classified as average, meaning it has no particular advantage in agility; a Constitution of 17, yielding a +3 modifier which is good for maintaining hit points; an Intelligence of 8 resulting in a -1 modifier, categorizing it as very bad for mental acuity; a Wisdom of 10, again yielding +0 which is average for perception and insight; and a Charisma of 18, leading to an exceptional +4 modifier which enhances its spellcasting ability and social interactions.

The One-Horned Ogre possesses several notable special abilities. Its Magical Horn is the source of its powers; should the horn be removed, the ogre loses crucial actions and its Charisma score drops to 8, significantly hampering its effectiveness. However, if it regains a horn through magical means, it can recover its full capabilities. Another special ability, Ruthless Weapons, allows the ogre to deal an additional 1d6 psychic damage whenever it successfully hits a creature that is blinded, charmed, or frightened, thus emphasizing its focus on debilitating enemies. 

The One-Horned Ogre also has innate spellcasting abilities. Its spells are cast using its Charisma as the spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 15. Each day, it can cast the spells darkness and misty step twice, and suggestion once per day, showcasing its ability to manipulate the battlefield and hinder opponents. Additionally, it can cast the fear spell once daily, instilling dread in its foes.

In combat, the One-Horned Ogre's actions include Multiattack—allowing it to use its Fiendish Horn Blast and then make a melee attack with a greatsword. The greatsword attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, averaging 19 slashing damage per successful hit. Its javelin attack also has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet or a range of 30/120 feet, dealing an average of 12 piercing damage.

The Fiendish Horn Blast is a powerful ranged attack that requires the target within 30 feet to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target suffers 10 psychic damage and is subjected to an additional debilitating condition based on the color of the ogre’s horn (blinded, charmed, or frightened). Targets that succeed on their saving throw take half damage and avoid the condition, but can attempt to break free from the condition at the end of each of their turns. 

Overall, the One-Horned Ogre combines brute strength with tactical spellcasting, making it a versatile challenge for any adventuring party, especially if they underestimate its psychological and magical capabilities.</detail>
