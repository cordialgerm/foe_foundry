<summary>An Acolyte is a devout follower of a deity or religious order, often seen as an apprentice or lower-ranking member of a temple or church. They wear simple robes, usually bearing the symbol of their faith, and carry religious icons or holy books. While they may not be physically imposing, Acolytes possess divine magic, allowing them to heal the wounded, ward off evil, or offer blessings to those in need. They are deeply devoted to their god or goddess and often serve as assistants to higher-ranking clergy, tending to shrines, performing rituals, and spreading the teachings of their faith.</summary>

<summary>The Acolyte is a Medium humanoid creature often found in religious settings, acting as a novice priest or an assistant to more experienced clergy members. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it presents a moderate level of threat in combat primarily due to its spellcasting abilities rather than physical prowess. Its strengths lie in its access to supportive spells, such as healing and blessings, and its ability to deal radiant damage from a distance. However, with low armor class (10) and limited hit points (11), the Acolyte is vulnerable if engaged directly, making it reliant on allies and careful positioning during encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Acolyte has the following basic attributes: Strength is 10, Dexterity is 10, Constitution is 12 (resulting in an average modifier of +1), Intelligence is 10, Wisdom is 14 (giving a good modifier of +2), and Charisma is 10. Its defensive capabilities are not strong, and with an Armor Class of 10, it is very susceptible to physical attacks. The Acolyte has 11 hit points, which means it can withstand a small number of attacks before falling in battle.

In terms of skills, the Acolyte is proficient in medicine, providing a +4 modifier, which indicates a very good ability to treat wounds, and in religion, offering a +2 modifier for related checks, which is average. The Acolyte has a passive perception of 12, allowing it to notice hidden creatures fairly well. Additionally, it can understand and communicate in one chosen language, providing flexibility in conversations.

The Acolyte's special abilities include spellcasting, functioning as a 2nd level spellcaster with a Wisdom-based spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12, while its spell attack bonus is +4, which is an average effectiveness for hitting targets. The Acolyte has the following spells prepared: 

- Cantrips (which can be cast an unlimited number of times): 
  - **Light**: This creates a luminous orb that can illuminate dark areas.
  - **Sacred Flame**: A damage-dealing cantrip that forces a creature within 60 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw; failure results in 4 radiant damage that bypasses cover.
  - **Thaumaturgy**: This cantrip allows the Acolyte to create minor magical effects to impress or distract.

- 1st-level spells (with three available slots): 
  - **Bless**: This spell enhances the skill of up to three allies by allowing them to add a d4 to their attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute, significantly increasing their chances of success in combat.
  - **Cure Wounds**: Through touch, the Acolyte can restore a significant 6 hit points to a willing creature, which can be crucial during battle.
  - **Sanctuary**: This spell grants a target protection from being targeted by attacks until they make an offensive move or the spell ends.

In physical combat, the Acolyte can attack with a club, making a melee weapon attack with a +2 modifier for reach 5 feet, dealing 2 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Although modest in offensive capabilities, the Acolyte's potential for healing and support spells makes it a valuable asset in party dynamics, especially in settings rich with combat or conflict.

The Acolyte is a Medium humanoid creature that serves a supportive role in encounters, often acting as a healer or buffer for allies. Its strengths lie in its ability to provide advantages in crucial situations, primarily through its special ability, Divine Providence, which enhances the survivability of nearby allies during death saves. However, with an Armor Class of 10 and only 15 hit points, the Acolyte is quite vulnerable in combat, making it important for them to stay protected during battles. The Acolyte has a Challenge Rating of 1/4, indicating that it is a low-level threat but can be quite beneficial when strategically utilized in group settings.

The Acolyte has the following attributes: Strength +0 (average), Dexterity +0 (average), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence +0 (average), Wisdom +4 (very good), and Charisma +0 (average). With a Wisdom modifier of +4, the Acolyte excels in Wisdom-based checks and saving throws, particularly in their spellcasting capabilities.

The Acolyte's special ability, Divine Providence, allows each friendly creature within 20 feet that is not a Construct or Undead to have advantage on death saving throws. This effect is particularly useful in dire situations where characters are on the brink of death, significantly improving their chances of recovering.

In terms of actions, the Acolyte can make a melee weapon attack with a mace, which has a +2 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it inflicts 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic or radiant damage, depending on the Acolyte’s selection. This makes the mace a modest offensive option.

For ranged attacks, the Acolyte can use Radiant Bolt, making a ranged spell attack with a +6 to hit and a range of 60 feet. Upon a successful hit, it deals 6 (1d4 + 4) radiant damage, making it a decent choice for attacking foes from a distance.

As a spellcaster, the Acolyte can utilize its Wisdom as the spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 13. The Acolyte has access to various spells that enhance their support capabilities: 
- At will, they can cast Light, which creates a bright light in a specific area, and Thaumaturgy, allowing them minor magical effects that can influence the environment or create sounds. 
- They can cast Bless three times a day, granting allies a bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, making this spell a key part of their role in buffing teammates. 
- Cure Wounds, also available three times a day, allows the Acolyte to heal an ally, which can swing the outcome of battles. 
- Sanctuary can be cast three times per day, protecting a target from attacks and making it harder for enemies to target that character directly.

Overall, the Acolyte plays an essential role in enhancing the performance and survivability of its allies, although its own defenses are quite weak, requiring careful positioning in combat.</detail>
