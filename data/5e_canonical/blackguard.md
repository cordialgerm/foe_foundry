<summary>The Blackguard is a formidable medium humanoid creature, often serving as an antagonist in various campaigns due to its high armor class, substantial hit points, and powerful attacks. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, particularly because of its ability to bolster allies through its Aura of Anger. The Blackguard excels in close combat, utilizing its Multiattack ability to strike multiple times with a greatsword and inflict decent damage through its other attacks. Although it has respectable physical attributes, its effectiveness is somewhat hampered by average dexterity, leading to a reliance on melee combat strategies.</summary>

<detail>

The Blackguard has the following attribute values: Strength at 16 (+3) makes it very good for melee damage; Dexterity at 12 (+1) is average, offering minimal benefit; Constitution at 16 (+3) grants a very good resilience and enhances hit point totals; Intelligence at 12 (+1) is average; Wisdom at 14 (+2) is good for perception checks; and Charisma at 14 (+2) is good, enabling effective use of intimidation. In terms of saving throws, it fares very well with a +6 to Strength and Constitution saving throws and good with a +5 to Wisdom saves. Its skill proficiencies include athletics at +6, intimidating foes at +5, and a good perception of +5, benefiting from a passive perception score of 15. The Blackguard can communicate using any two languages of its choice.

The Blackguard's special ability, Aura of Anger, enhances the melee effectiveness of all allies within a 10-foot radius, granting them a +2 bonus to their melee weapon damage. This makes the creature not only a strong combatant but also a supportive leader on the battlefield.

In combat, the Blackguard employs a Multiattack ability, allowing it to strike three times with its greatsword in a single turn. This attack has a +6 to hit and deals an average of 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage with each successful strike. If the Blackguard is mounted, it can utilize a lance attack, which also has a +6 to hit but with a reach of 10 feet. If the Blackguard charges at least 20 feet towards a target before the lance attack, it deals an additional 13 (2d12) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone. However, this attack is made at disadvantage against targets within 5 feet, limiting its effectiveness in close quarters.

For ranged combat, the Blackguard can use a heavy crossbow, which has a +4 to hit and a range of 100/400 feet, inflicting an average of 6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage, along with an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage, making it a versatile threat from a distance.

Additionally, the Blackguard can invoke a powerful curse once per day through its Vile Curse ability. By uttering sinister words, it can curse all living creatures within 30 feet that can hear and understand it for 1 minute. A cursed creature suffers a -1d4 penalty to attack rolls and saving throws, severely weakening its combat capabilities. However, creatures that are immune to the frightened condition are also immune to this curse, providing a potential counter to its effects.</detail>
