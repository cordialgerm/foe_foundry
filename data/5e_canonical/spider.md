<summary>A Spider is a small, predatory arachnid known for spinning webs to trap its prey. Found in forests, caves, and other dark places, Spiders are stealthy hunters that rely on their webs to ensnare creatures before delivering a venomous bite. While common Spiders pose little threat to adventurers, their larger cousins, such as Giant Spiders, can be deadly. Spiders are highly adaptable, able to climb walls and ceilings with ease, and their natural camouflage allows them to blend into their surroundings to ambush unsuspecting prey.</summary>
