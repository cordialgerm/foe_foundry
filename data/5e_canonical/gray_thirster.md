<summary>The Gray Thirster is a Medium-sized Undead creature with a Neutral Evil alignment, serving as a formidable foe in combat through its unique abilities and resilience. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it presents a good challenge for lower-level adventurers, boasting a decent Armor Class of 13 and 52 hit points, stemming from eight dice rolls of eight plus an additional sixteen. Its speed is average at 30 feet, allowing it to engage effectively in close combat. Notably, the Gray Thirster features damage immunities to fire and poison, resistance to necrotic damage, and various immunities to conditions such as being charmed or frightened, making it quite resilient in confrontations. However, its intelligence is notably low at a score of 6, reflecting its simplicity in tactics beyond its abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Gray Thirster are as follows: Strength is 12, granting it a modifier of +1 which is considered average for melee purposes; Dexterity is 16, giving it a +3 modifier, which is good for its attacks and maneuverability; Constitution is 15, providing a +2 modifier, which is considered average, aiding its survivability; Intelligence is low at 6, resulting in a -2 modifier, which is very bad for mental challenges; Wisdom is at 12, giving it a +1 modifier, which is average for perception and saving throws; and Charisma is 14, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is considered good, bolstering its presence and influence over other creatures.

The Gray Thirster possesses a notable special ability called Thirst Aura, which affects creatures starting their turn within 30 feet. They must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion, which severely impacts their performance. A successful saving throw grants immunity to this aura for 24 hours, underscoring the importance of positioning when facing this creature. Additionally, the Thirsting Dead Nature ability allows the Gray Thirster to operate without the need for air, food, or sleep, enhancing its endurance in prolonged encounters.

In terms of combat actions, the Gray Thirster can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Claw attacks or a combination of one Claw attack and one Withering Turban attack. The Claw attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 8 slashing damage. The Withering Turban attack also has a +5 to hit but extends out to 10 feet. It deals 7 necrotic damage, and a failed DC 12 Constitution saving throw results in a reduction of the target’s maximum hit points by the damage dealt. If the target is affected by its Thirst Aura, they suffer disadvantage on this saving throw.

The Gray Thirster has a powerful ability called Drought, usable once per day, which allows it to drain moisture from its surroundings within a 20-foot radius. Non-magical liquids in this area turn to dust, severely hindering any creature carrying them. Creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, failing which they take 9 necrotic damage and lose up to 5 gallons of nonmagical liquid they are carrying. Success halves the damage with no additional losses. This ability is particularly devastating against creatures made mostly of water, giving them disadvantage on their saving throws.

Overall, the combination of the Gray Thirster's abilities makes it an effective adversary that thrives in ambush scenarios, punishing adventurers for getting too close while being aware of its capacity to sap their strength and resources.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Thirst Aura:** A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the gray thirster must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the gray thirster’s Thirst Aura for the next 24 hours.
- **Thirsting Dead Nature:** The gray thirster doesn’t require air, food, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The gray thirster makes two Claw attacks, or it makes one Claw attack and one Withering Turban attack.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Withering Turban:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target has disadvantage on this saving throw if it failed the saving throw against the thirster’s Thirst Aura. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest with no levels of exhaustion. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Drought (1/Day):** The gray thirster draws the moisture from containers and creatures around it. Nonmagical water and other liquids within 20 feet of the thirster that aren’t being worn or carried turn to dust. Each creature within 20 feet of the thirster that isn’t a Construct or Undead must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and up to 5 gallons of nonmagical liquid it is wearing or carrying turn to dust. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, and nonmagical liquids it is wearing or carrying don’t turn to dust. Plants, Oozes, creatures with the Amphibious or Water Breathing trait, and creatures made mostly of water, such as water elementals or steam mephits, have disadvantage on the saving throw.
