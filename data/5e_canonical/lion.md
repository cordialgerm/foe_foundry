<summary>A Lion is a large, powerful predator found in grasslands and savannas. Known as the 'king of the beasts,' lions are apex predators that hunt in prides, using their strength and coordination to take down large prey like antelope, buffalo, or zebras. Lions have muscular bodies, sharp claws, and powerful jaws, making them fearsome hunters. Male lions are distinguished by their thick manes, while females, the primary hunters, are sleeker and faster. Though lions are often seen as majestic and noble, they are fierce and aggressive when defending their territory or pride.</summary>
