<summary>The Thorned Sulfurlord is a formidable Huge Fiend that embodies chaos and evil in its very essence. As a challenge rating 11 creature, it possesses a high degree of durability and offensive capability, making it a significant threat on the battlefield. With an impressive 171 hit points, the Thorned Sulfurlord can endure substantial damage before going down. Its high Armor Class of 17 provides a solid defense against attacks. While its movement speed is relatively low at 20 feet, its special abilities compensate for this limitation, allowing it to manipulate the terrain and deal consistent damage to nearby foes. Vulnerable only to cold damage while immune to fire and poison, it presents a unique challenge for adventurers, who must strategize carefully to overcome its strengths.</summary>

<detail>

The Thorned Sulfurlord has the following attributes: Strength 20 (+5, which is exceptional), Dexterity 14 (+2, good), Constitution 16 (+3, very good), Intelligence 10 (+0, average), Wisdom 9 (-1, bad), and Charisma 12 (+1, average). Its saving throw for Strength is +9, which is exceptional, making it highly resistant to effects that rely on strength. In addition, it excels in physical contests, as evidenced by its athletics skill of +9 and perception skill of +7, making it a well-rounded opponent that can both grapple and sense threats efficiently.

In terms of damage vulnerabilities and immunities, the Thorned Sulfurlord is vulnerable to cold damage, while it is immune to fire and poison damage. It is also immune to being charmed and poisoned, enhancing its durability against various control and status effects. The creature has truesight out to 120 feet and a passive perception of 17, allowing it to see through illusions and detect hidden foes easily. It communicates using Abyssal and Infernal languages and can engage in telepathy with creatures up to 120 feet away.

The Thorned Sulfurlord has several special abilities that significantly impact gameplay. Its Burning Tangle ability makes the ground difficult terrain within a 10-foot radius, hindering the movement of enemies. The Hell Core ability deals 7 (2d6) fire damage to creatures within 10 feet at the start of its turns, adding a reliable source of damage each round unless it takes cold damage, which temporarily disables this effect. Through the Like Calls to Like ability, the sulfurlord can sense whether nearby creatures are evil-aligned, furthering its role as a malevolent enforcer. The Root ability allows it to immobilize itself while becoming immune to movement effects for 1 minute, trading speed for resilience and control over its surroundings.

In combat, the Thorned Sulfurlord can take advantage of its Multiattack feature, making two melee attacks of either sulfur slam or fiery spike types. The Sulfur Slam attack has a +9 to hit, deals 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage and an additional 9 (2d8) fire damage, and can blind the target on a failed DC 17 Constitution saving throw, making it a potent threat. The Fiery Spike ranged attack has a +6 to hit, with a range of 60/240 feet, dealing 12 (3d6 + 2) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) fire damage upon a hit. Its most devastating action, The World Shall Know Fire, targets creatures that have taken fire damage within the last minute. This action can unleash a fiery explosion in a 30-foot radius, requiring a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 35 (10d6) fire damage or half on a success. This ability not only inflicts significant damage but also has the potential to set the environment ablaze, adding further chaos to the encounter.</detail>
