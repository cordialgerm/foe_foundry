<summary>A Giant Weasel is a large, sleek predator known for its agility and stealth. These creatures are often found in forests or grasslands, where they hunt small to medium-sized prey such as rabbits or birds. Giant Weasels have long, muscular bodies and sharp teeth, which allow them to kill with a swift bite to the neck. They are skilled at sneaking up on their prey and are known for their intelligence and curiosity. Though not naturally aggressive towards larger creatures, they will defend themselves fiercely if threatened.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Weasel is a medium-sized beast known for its agility and keen senses, making it an adept hunter and scout. It possesses a decent Armor Class of 12, which provides it with a modest level of defense, while its low Hit Points of 9 (calculated from rolling 2d8) indicate that it is somewhat fragile and should avoid direct confrontations with stronger foes. With a movement speed of 40 feet, the Giant Weasel can swiftly maneuver around the battlefield, allowing it to engage or evade targets effectively. It is rated at a Challenge Rating of 1/8, making it a weaker opponent intended for low-level encounters, yielding 25 experience points upon defeat.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Giant Weasel include a Strength score of 10, giving it an average physical power, Dexterity at 14, which provides it with a good level of quickness, Constitution at 10 resulting in average endurance, Intelligence at 4 denoting very bad cognitive capabilities, Wisdom at 12 indicating an average awareness, and Charisma at 4 reflecting very bad social skills. Its Dexterity modifier of +2 enhances its agility-related tasks, while the Wisdom modifier of +1 improves its perception abilities.

The Giant Weasel has proficiency in two skills: Perception with a total modifier of +3, which is good, allowing it to detect hidden foes or obstacles, and Stealth with a total modifier of +4, which is very good, enabling it to move quietly and avoid detection. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, making it effective in low-light conditions. Its passive Perception score of 13 suggests it is quite aware of its surroundings, helping it to notice hidden creatures or traps easily.

The Giant Weasel has a special ability called "Keen Hearing and Smell," which grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on these senses. This means when attempting to detect sounds or scents, the Giant Weasel can roll twice and take the higher result, significantly enhancing its capability to track or identify nearby creatures.

In terms of actions, the Giant Weasel can make a Bite attack, which uses a melee weapon attack modifier of +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet against one target. Upon a successful hit, it deals 4 piercing damage (calculated as 1d4 + 2), or 7 piercing damage (calculated as 2d4 + 2) if the target is currently grappled by the weasel. Additionally, it can perform a Grab attack, also using a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, which, upon hitting, allows it to grapple the target with an escape DC of 12. This grappling ability makes the Giant Weasel a tactical opponent, as it can restrain enemies and potentially set them up for further attacks or allow allies to capitalize on the situation.

The Giant Weasel is a Medium beast that serves primarily as a cunning and agile creature in Dungeons & Dragons. With its relatively low hit points of 14, the weasel is not particularly resilient, making it vulnerable in direct combat. However, its high speed of 40 feet allows it to maneuver quickly around the battlefield, often evading attacks. The challenge rating of 1/4 indicates it is a low-level threat, ideal for encounters with novice adventurers. Notable for its strong stealth capabilities and enhanced senses, the Giant Weasel can slip into shadows and avoid detection while also detecting creatures nearby through its heightened perception. 

The Giant Weasel has an Armor Class of 13, which is average for a creature of its type, allowing it to withstand some attacks. Its ability scores include a Dexterity of +3, which is good, making it nimble and evasive. The weasel has a Wisdom score of +1, which provides a perceptive edge in detecting threats. However, its other attributes, such as Intelligence and Charisma, are quite low, with scores of -3, indicating it has very bad skills in reasoning and influencing others.

Special abilities of the Giant Weasel include "Heightened Hearing and Smell," which gives it a Perception score of 18 when using its auditory or olfactory senses. This makes it exceptional at locating creatures and detecting hidden enemies.

In terms of actions, the Giant Weasel's primary offensive capability is its "Bite" attack. It has a +5 to hit, meaning it is likely to succeed in striking a target, with a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 5 piercing damage from a roll of 1d4 plus its Dexterity modifier. Notably, instead of inflicting damage, the Giant Weasel can attempt to steal an item weighing up to 10 pounds from its target, making it a clever distraction in combat.

The Giant Weasel also has a defensive reaction called "Repellent Spray." When an enemy comes within 15 feet, the weasel can release a foul-smelling spray. This requires the affected creature to make a Constitution saving throw against a difficulty of 13. If they fail, they become poisoned until the end of their next turn, which restricts their movement and makes them wary of approaching the weasel. This ability can significantly impact tactics, creating a buffer zone around the weasel that enemies will find hazardous to approach.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Heightened Hearing and Smell.** The weasel’s Perception is 18 when perceiving by hearing or smell.

### Actions

- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the weasel can steal one item the target is wearing or carrying, provided the item weighs no more than 10 pounds, isn’t a weapon, and isn’t wrapped around or firmly attached to the target. For example, a weasel could steal a hat or belt pouch but not a creature’s shirt or armor.

### Reactions

- **Repellent Spray.** When a creature the weasel can see moves to a space within 15 feet of it, the weasel can release a pungent spray at the creature. The target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned, the creature can’t move to a space within 5 feet of the weasel.
