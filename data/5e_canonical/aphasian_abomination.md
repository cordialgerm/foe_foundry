<summary>The Aphasian Abomination is a formidable Large Construct, designed to operate independently without alignment to any particular moral code. This creature boasts a solid Armor Class of 15 and a substantial Hit Points total of 170, providing it with an impressive degree of resilience in combat, classified as Challenge Rating 10, which means it is appropriate for mid-level adventurers. It possesses exceptional Dexterity, allowing it to avoid attacks with a +9 modifier on Dexterity saving throws, while its considerable intelligence and wisdom also enhance its effectiveness in encounters. However, its physical strength is incredibly weak, rated at one with a -5 modifier. The Aphasian Abomination thrives in environments where it can utilize its unique abilities, particularly those related to psychic manipulation and resistance to magic, but it lacks the capacity for social interaction due to severely low Charisma.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Aphasian Abomination has a Strength score of 1, which is very bad for physical confrontations. Its Dexterity is notable at 20, granting it a good plus 5 modifier, enhancing its evasiveness and ability to act quickly. The Constitution score of 16 contributes a +3 modifier, providing it with good durability. It boasts intelligent capabilities with an Intelligence of 17 (+3), indicating a good understanding of its abilities. Wisdom is exceptional at 20, offering a +5 modifier, which benefits perception and saving throws. Charisma, however, is very weak at a score of 5 (-3).

The Aphasian Abomination has several remarkable special abilities. It can exert its Amorphous trait, allowing it to move through spaces as narrow as 1 foot without any squeezing penalties. Its Aphasic Field creates an area of psychic distortion, where creatures within a 60-foot radius must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw at the start of their turn. If they fail, they lose the ability to speak coherently, often uttering nonsensical phrases instead. Additionally, if these creatures attempt to cast spells that require verbal components while in the field, they will take psychic damage and lose the spell slot, which can heavily disrupt spellcasting parties. The Aphasian Abomination does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, due to its Construct Nature, making it a persistent threat. Its Immutable Form provides immunity to form-altering effects and spells, while Made of Magic allows it to temporarily disappear from existence in an antimagic field and reappear once the spectrum is clear. Any attempt to dispel magic on it can result in significant damage, near 21 points plus an additional 7 per spell level beyond the third. Finally, its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it exceptionally resilient against magic.

In combat, the Aphasian Abomination can perform a Multiattack, delivering three Force Blast attacks. Each Force Blast is a ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit, capable of targeting foes from as far away as 120 feet or engaging them in melee range. Each successful hit inflicts 23 (4d8+5) points of force damage, making it a potent source of damage both at a distance and in close quarters.</detail>
