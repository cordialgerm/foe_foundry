<detail>

The Spirit Lamp has the following attributes: Strength is 12 with a modifier of +1, which is considered average; Dexterity is 19 with a modifier of +4, which is very good; Constitution is 16 with a +3 modifier, implying good health; Intelligence is 13, also average; Wisdom is 14 with a modifier of +2, which is average; and Charisma is 19, yielding an exceptional +4 modifier. In terms of saving throws, it is particularly proficient in Dexterity with a +7 (good) and Constitution with a +6 (good). The creature also has a +5 to Perception skills, demonstrating enhanced awareness. It is immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage and resists bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, making it a tough adversary to deal with. It is also immune to being charmed, frightened, poisoned, or rendered unconscious.

The Spirit Lamp possesses several special abilities. The "Jumpy" ability allows it to never be surprised and grants it the option to use a bonus action to Disengage, enhancing its maneuverability during combat. Its "Lantern's Light" ability enables it to open or close a lantern, granting bright light in a substantial area of 30 feet along with dim light up to an additional 30 feet. This ability is powerful as it allows the Spirit Lamp to see only within the light while becoming blind when closed, creating strategic opportunities for combat. The light can penetrate all forms of darkness, and if a creature dies within this light, its spirit becomes trapped, further amplifying the Spirit Lamp's menacing influence.

The "Lantern Spirits" ability summons spirits of creatures that have died within its light. While the lantern is open, the Spirit Lamp slows and damages all creatures within its luminous reach. A creature that enters this area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, which is especially dangerous given the combination of health depletion and speed reduction. Even if the Spirit Lamp is slain while the lantern is open, these spirits continue to attack until the lantern is destroyed or closed.

The "Spirit Lantern" is a vital component of the Spirit Lamp's power. While it remains intact and the Spirit Lamp is alive, the lantern cannot be harmed or targeted, boasting an impressive Armor Class of 17 and 50 hit points. If a creature touches the lantern, it must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to avoid being cursed, suffering debilitating effects like fear of darkness and vision restricted to the lantern's light. This curse can only be lifted under specific conditions, making it a powerful method of control. If the Spirit Lamp successfully curses a creature for 30 days, that creature permanently transforms into a new Spirit Lamp.

In terms of actions, the Spirit Lamp can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make three separate attacks in one turn. Its primary weapon is the "Spirit Claw," which performs a melee attack with a +7 to hit, dealing 7 (1d6 + 4) necrotic damage if successful. Additionally, it can use the "Lantern Beam," a ranged spell attack that also carries a +7 to hit, dealing 11 (2d10) fire damage on a successful hit. These actions combined with its special abilities create a challenging adversary that can dictate the pace and outcomes of encounters with adventurers.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Jumpy:** The spirit lamp can't be surprised and can use a bonus action to take the Disengage action.
- **Lantern's Light:** As a bonus action, the spirit lamp can open or close its lantern. When open, the lantern sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The spirit lamp can only see objects within the lantern's light and is blind while the lantern is closed. The lantern's light pierces magical and nonmagical darkness and can't be dispelled by magical darkness. If a creature dies in the lantern's light, its spirit is trapped in the lantern.
- **Lantern Spirits:** Spirits of creatures that died within the lantern's light haunt it. While the lantern is open, these spirits surround the spirit lamp, slowing and attacking all creatures within the lantern's light. A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the spirit lamp has its speed halved and must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the spirit lamp dies and the lantern is open, the lantern's spirits continue to harm creatures within 30 feet of it until the lantern is destroyed or closed.
- **Spirit Lantern:** The spirit lamp's lantern is immune to damage and can't be the target of spells or effects as long as the spirit lamp lives. When the spirit lamp dies, the lantern floats gently to the ground and opens, if it was closed. The lantern has AC 17, 50 hp, and is immune to piercing, poison, and psychic damage. A creature that touches the lantern must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be cursed. A cursed creature is frightened of darkness, can't see anything outside of the lantern's light, and is unable to drop the lantern. The cursed creature will risk its own life to protect the lantern. A creature can repeat the saving throw each day at dawn, lifting the curse and ending the effects on itself on a success. If this occurs, the lantern disintegrates. After three failed saving throws, remove curse or similar magic is required to end the curse. 

If the creature remains cursed after 30 days, it is irreversibly changed by the curse, and it becomes the lantern's new spirit lamp. Voluntarily opening the lantern counts as a failed saving throw. If the lantern is destroyed, all captured spirits are put to rest and the cursed bearer, if it has not yet changed into a spirit lamp, is freed of the curse.
