<detail>

The Myrmex has an Armor Class of 13 due to its natural armor, which gives it a good level of protection. It has 54 hit points, calculated as 12d6+12, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being incapacitated. The creature’s speed is versatile; it can walk 30 feet, burrow at 15 feet, and climb 30 feet, making it mobile in various environments. The Myrmex has the following ability scores: Strength 12 (+1, average), Dexterity 13 (+1, average), Constitution 13 (+1, average), Intelligence 8 (-1, bad), Wisdom 10 (+0, average), and Charisma 8 (-1, bad). 

In terms of skills, the Myrmex has passive perception with a value of +0, indicating a neutral awareness of its surroundings. It has resistance to poison damage, making it less susceptible to certain attacks. Furthermore, it is immune to conditions such as exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, and poison, which showcases its endurance in prolonged encounters. The Myrmex has a blindsight of 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its immediate surroundings without the need for light, and it understands the Terran language but cannot speak it.

The Myrmex possesses several notable special abilities. Its Elemental Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it exceptionally resilient in prolonged adventures. With Keen Smell, it gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, enhancing its ability to detect nearby creatures. Its Limited Telepathy allows it to convey simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet that understands a language; however, it does not provide a means for the target to respond telepathically. The ability Spider Climb permits the Myrmex to effortlessly move on difficult surfaces or ceilings without any checks. With Stone Walk, it can traverse terrain made of earth or stone without incurring additional movement costs.

In combat, the Myrmex can execute two key actions. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit and affects a single target within 5 feet. It deals 5 piercing damage plus an additional 3 poison damage, providing a total potential damage of 8 per hit. Additionally, the Myrmex can use the Earth Shift ability, which acts as a ranged spell attack with a +2 to hit that functions up to 60 feet away. It allows the Myrmex to push a target up to 10 feet in a direction of its choice and reduces the target’s speed by 5 feet until the end of their next turn.

For its bonus action, the Myrmex can use Earth Manipulation, enabling it to manipulate earth within a range of 30 feet that fits in a 5-foot cube. This ability is only limited by the Myrmex's imagination. It can create terrains or sculptures, tell stories, etch symbols, and even change the nature of the ground around it, altering difficult terrain to normal or vice versa as long as the area is comprised of earth or stone. Such changes are permanent, allowing the creature to significantly influence its environment during and after encounters.</detail>
