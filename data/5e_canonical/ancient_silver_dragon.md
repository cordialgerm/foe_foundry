<summary>The Ancient Silver Dragon is a noble and compassionate creature, with scales that gleam like pure silver. These dragons are often mistaken for statues or icy outcroppings when resting in their high mountain homes. Silver Dragons are known for their deep sense of honor and their dedication to protecting the innocent. They can take human form, allowing them to walk among mortals and assist in their struggles. Their breath weapon is a cone of freezing cold, and they can also emit a gas that paralyzes their foes. Despite their immense power, Silver Dragons prefer to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and peaceful means.</summary>

<summary>The Ancient Silver Dragon is a formidable gargantuan creature and serves as one of the most powerful dragon types in the game. It possesses an impressive armor class of 22 and boasts a staggering 429 hit points, making it highly durable in battle. The dragon's movement capabilities are exceptional, with a walking speed of 40 feet and a flying speed of 80 feet, allowing it to maneuver easily on the battlefield. With a challenge rating of 25, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, and its various abilities enhance its effectiveness in combat. Notably, the dragon has strong cold damage resistance, advanced spellcasting abilities, and the capacity to change shape, making it a versatile opponent. However, it may be vulnerable to certain magical effects if it exhausts its legendary resistances.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient Silver Dragon has the following attributes:
- Strength: 30 (+10, exceptional)
- Dexterity: 14 (+2, average)
- Constitution: 28 (+9, very good)
- Intelligence: 18 (+4, good)
- Wisdom: 14 (+2, average)
- Charisma: 22 (+6, very good)

For saving throws, it has the following bonuses:
- Dexterity: +9 (very good)
- Constitution: +16 (exceptional)
- Wisdom: +9 (very good)
- Charisma: +13 (very good)

In terms of skills, the dragon excels in:
- Arcana: +11 (very good)
- History: +11 (very good)
- Perception: +9 (very good)
- Stealth: +9 (very good)

The dragon has immunity to cold damage and possesses advanced senses, including blindsight out to 60 feet and darkvision up to 120 feet. The passive perception score of 22 indicates its high awareness of surroundings. It can communicate in several languages, including Common, Draconic, and two additional languages of its choosing.

The dragon's special abilities significantly enhance its combat capabilities. With "Cloud Strider," the dragon can fly at high altitudes without consequences, allowing it to discorporate into clouds after concentrating for one minute. In this cloud form, it gains advantage on Stealth checks, can move much faster, and becomes immune to nonmagical damage while resisting magical damage. However, if it takes damage or drops down drastically, it reverts to its corporeal form. 

The "Legendary Resistance" ability allows the dragon to choose to succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail, limited to three times each day. This ability increases its resilience, although it comes at the cost of diminished armor class when used excessively. 

Utilizing its innate spellcasting, the dragon can employ its Charisma-based spells without material components. It can cast spells like "Charm Person," "Faerie Fire," and "Awaken" three times per day. Additionally, once a day, it can cast "Heroes Feast" as well as "Telepathic Bond," providing tactical advantages in social interactions and during combat.

In terms of offensive actions, the Ancient Silver Dragon can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to attack with its bite and twice with its claws. Its bite attack is particularly powerful, with a +17 to hit, dealing 32 piercing damage plus an additional 9 cold damage. The claws also have a +17 to hit and deal 23 slashing damage, while its tail can push targets away, offering control over the battlefield. 

The "Spit Frost" ability targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing them to make a Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in substantial cold damage and a speed reduction, providing tactical control during encounters. 

The dragon harnesses powerful breath weapons, including "Frost Breath," which deals massive cold damage across a 90-foot cone, and "Paralyzing Breath," incapacitating foes within the same range unless they succeed on a saving throw.

The "Change Shape" ability enables the dragon to assume a humanoid or beast form, retaining its stats, but limiting its attack capabilities in those forms. 

As a reaction, the dragon can perform a "Tail Attack" against a creature within 10 feet that strikes it, showcasing its defensive combat prowess.

Moreover, the dragon can utilize legendary actions, such as the "Roar" which can frighten multiple creatures, "Wing Attack" to push enemies back and fly, and "Windstorm," creating an area that hinders movement and deals cold damage. Each of these actions demonstrates the dragon's immense potential in combat, making it a threat that demands careful tactics from any adventurers daring enough to confront it.

The Ancient Silver Dragon is a gargantuan creature known for its exceptional power and role as a formidable opponent in Dungeons & Dragons. With an impressive challenge rating of 20, it embodies agility, resilience, and intelligence. The dragon's notable abilities include its potent breath attacks that can inflict massive cold damage and paralyze foes, as well as its capacity to frighten and manipulate its enemies in battle. This dragon possesses extraordinary defensive and offensive capabilities, enhanced by its formidable natural armor class of 21 and a staggering 355 hit points. Despite its strengths, it is still susceptible to strong magical attacks and clever tactics devised by players. Its ability to shape-shift into other forms adds a layer of unpredictability in encounters. 

The Ancient Silver Dragon has the following attributes: Strength of +10, Dexterity of +6, Constitution of +15, Intelligence of +4, Wisdom of +9, and Charisma of +11. These values signify that the dragon has exceptional physical toughness and a notably high Charisma, indicating strong social influence. Its Dexterity is good, making it relatively nimble for its size, while its Wisdom and Intelligence scores provide it with advantages in perception and tactical decision-making.

The dragon possesses special abilities such as Freezing Fog, which affects creatures within a 30-foot radius, requiring them to make a DC 23 saving throw to avoid being negatively impacted. Additionally, it boasts Legendary Resistance, which allows it to choose to succeed on saving throws a total of three times per day, providing an exceptional defensive advantage.

In terms of actions, the Ancient Silver Dragon can make multiple attacks per turn through its Multiattack ability, allowing it to use Frightful Presence to instill fear, followed by its Bite attack, Claw attacks, or deploy its potent Paralyzing Breath if it is available. The Bite has a +17 to hit and deals an average of 21 piercing damage, the Claw attack also has a +17 to hit and deals an average of 17 slashing damage, and the Tail attack pays a +17 to hit with an average damaging of 19 bludgeoning damage. 

The Frightful Presence ability can cause targets within 120 feet to become frightened for one minute on a failed DC 19 Wisdom saving throw, although the effects can end if the creature succeeds on subsequent turns. The Cold Breath attack can deal massive area damage, where targets within a 90-foot cone must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or suffer a staggering 99 cold damage (22d8), with half damage on a success. The Paralyzing Breath, similar to its young counterpart, also functions in a 90-foot cone, demanding a DC 23 saving throw from affected targets.

As a bonus action, the dragon can use Change Shape to transform into a Beast or Humanoid of an equal challenge rating or revert to its true dragon form. This ability allows the dragon to maintain its legendary traits and statistics while adopting the capabilities of its new form.

In combat, the dragon can utilize legendary actions, allowing it to take three actions per turn only at the end of another creature's turn. Options include the Detect action for pinpointing nearby creatures and traps, a Tail Attack, and more complex actions like Elemental Roar, which can make creatures vulnerable to cold damage, and Wing Attack, enabling it to deal damage and reposition itself effectively without provoking opportunity attacks.

Lastly, the Ancient Silver Dragon has regional effects that may manifest if it is present in an area, but these effects diminish and fade if the dragon is slain, further amplifying the threat it poses in any campaign.</detail>
