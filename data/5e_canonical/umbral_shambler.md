<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Umbral Shambler is a medium-sized aberration with a neutral evil alignment, embodying a creature of shadows and darkness. It is capable of dealing both slashing and necrotic damage, which makes it a threat in combat situations while also providing it with a decent amount of hit points at 39, making it moderately resilient. The shambler excels in low-light environments, where its mobility increases significantly, allowing it to evade attacks and strike from the shadows. However, it struggles in bright sunlight; its abilities are hindered, causing disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks. It has a challenge rating of 2, indicating it can pose a challenge to low-level adventurers, particularly if they are unprepared for its unique traits and attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The Umbral Shambler has the following attributes: 
- Strength is 17, translating to a +3 modifier, which is considered good for melee attacks.
- Dexterity is 16, giving it a +3 modifier that is also good, contributing positively to its agility and defensive abilities.
- Constitution is 15 with a +2 modifier, leading to an average level of durability.
- Intelligence is 11, resulting in a +0 modifier, which is very bad in terms of mental prowess.
- Wisdom is 14, granting a +2 modifier, considered average for perception and insight.
- Charisma is 12 with a +1 modifier, which is poor for social interactions.

It has saving throw advantages with Dexterity at +5, and Wisdom at +4, both of which are good for evading effects that require these saving throws. The creature has a passive perception of 14, which is also decent for detecting hidden threats. It is vulnerable to radiant damage, meaning such damage is particularly effective against it, while it resists necrotic and psychic damage, providing a buffer against those damage types. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed and exhausted, making it resilient against certain types of crowd control.

The Umbral Shambler possesses several special abilities enhancing its combat effectiveness:
- Sunlight Sensitivity causes it to have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks when exposed to sunlight, limiting its effectiveness during the day.
- Tenebrous Agility allows its speed to double in dim light or darkness, enabling it to move stealthily without provoking opportunity attacks if it stays within shadows. When an attacker relies on sight to target the shambler in dim lighting conditions, they do so with disadvantage, enhancing its survivability.
- Void Traveler enables the shambler to exist without basic survival needs like air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure, making it difficult to incapacitate through conventional means.

In terms of its actions during combat, the Umbral Shambler has the following:
- It can make a Multiattack, allowing it to deliver two claw strikes in one turn. 
- Each Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit within a 5-foot range, dealing 5 slashing damage plus an additional 3 necrotic damage. This dual damage type can be particularly harmful to unprepared opponents.
- The Twisted Step ability allows the shambler to temporarily project itself beyond typical reality. For one turn, it can move through solid objects as if they were difficult terrain, as long as the objects are no thicker than three feet and at least one side is in dim light or darkness. However, if the shambler starts its turn inside an object, it takes 5 force damage. This ability can be utilized to surprise opponents or reposition without fear of opportunity attacks.

Overall, the Umbral Shambler is a cunning creature, leveraging darkness to outmaneuver foes while blending its physical attacks with magical effects to destabilize its adversaries.</detail>
