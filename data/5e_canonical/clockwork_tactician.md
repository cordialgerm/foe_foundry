With a darkvision range of 120 feet, it can perceive its surroundings in complete darkness, bolstering its effectiveness in dimly lit environments.

As for special abilities, the Clockwork Tactician has several noteworthy features. Its Construct Nature ensures it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without the need for rest. Immutable Form provides immunity to effects that would alter its form, enhancing its combat reliability. Magic Resistance grants the Tactician advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it exceptionally good at resisting magical attacks. Additionally, its attacks are considered magical, which allows it to bypass resistances against non-magical damage. The Pack Tactics ability allows the Tactician to gain advantage on attack rolls against a creature if there is at least one other ally within 5 feet, enhancing its ability to deal damage.

In combat actions, the Clockwork Tactician can make multiple attacks, featuring the Multiattack ability which allows it to make four separate Multiweapon attacks. Each Multiweapon attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 14 (2d8+5) damage, choosing from bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage types, adjusting its attacks based on the situation. For ranged combat, it can use a Heavy Crossbow, which has a +6 to hit and deals 7 (1d10+2) piercing damage at a range of 100 feet, extending its reach in engagements.

The Tactician can also use Bonus Actions to enhance its allies' effectiveness through Battlefield Commands, which grants up to three friendly creatures within 60 feet advantage on their next ability check or attack roll. Its Press the Attack ability allows it to make an additional Multiweapon attack after successfully hitting a target with two attacks or landing a critical hit.

In reaction to attacks, the Clockwork Tactician can utilize Quick Study, which allows it to analyze incoming threats and gain advantageous benefits based on a successful intelligence check. The potential benefits include gaining advantage on melee attacks against the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attacker's rolls, or resistance to the damage type of the attack that hit it. This ability can stack benefits and can remain active until the Tactician targets a different creature, allowing for versatile tactical options in battle.</detail>
