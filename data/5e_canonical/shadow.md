<summary>A Shadow is an undead entity formed from the darkness and negative energy, often the remnant of a corrupted soul. Shadows are insubstantial creatures that lurk in dark places, attacking living creatures to drain their strength and vitality. They are difficult to fight, as normal weapons pass through their shadowy forms with little effect. Shadows can slip through cracks and hide in the darkness, waiting for the right moment to strike. They are cold, malevolent beings driven by a need to consume the living, and their touch saps the life from those they attack.</summary>
