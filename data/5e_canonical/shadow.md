<summary>A Shadow is an undead entity formed from the darkness and negative energy, often the remnant of a corrupted soul. Shadows are insubstantial creatures that lurk in dark places, attacking living creatures to drain their strength and vitality. They are difficult to fight, as normal weapons pass through their shadowy forms with little effect. Shadows can slip through cracks and hide in the darkness, waiting for the right moment to strike. They are cold, malevolent beings driven by a need to consume the living, and their touch saps the life from those they attack.</summary>

<summary>The Shadow is a Medium Undead creature known for its stealth and ability to instill fear in its foes. With a Challenge Rating of 1, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers and relies on its agility and the element of surprise to inflict damage. The Shadow has a moderate Armor Class of 12, making it reasonably difficult to hit, and it possesses a modest pool of Hit Points totaling 18. Its primary strength lies in its agility, as indicated by a Dexterity score of 14, giving it a good modifier of +2 that enhances its stealth capabilities. The creature is vulnerable to radiant damage but is immune to necrotic and poison damage, offering a solid defense against many types of attacks. While the Shadow can be effective in combat, it has a significant downside in the presence of sunlight, which hampers its abilities considerably.</summary>

<detail>

The Shadow has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 6 (modifier -2, which is very bad for physical attacks)
- Dexterity: 14 (modifier +2, which is good, aiding in stealth and dexterity-based checks)
- Constitution: 10 (modifier +0, considered average for health)
- Intelligence: 8 (modifier -1, which is very bad for intelligence checks)
- Wisdom: 10 (modifier +0, average in wisdom-related situations)
- Charisma: 14 (modifier +2, which is good for its interactions)

The creature has a skill in Stealth with a +4 modifier, enabling it to hide effectively in dim light or darkness. Its damage vulnerabilities include radiant damage, while it is immune to necrotic and poison damage, as well as possessing resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage. Additionally, the Shadow is immune to several conditions including being charmed, fatigued, frightened, and poisoned, which makes it resilient against many forms of debilitation. Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet, which allows it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, and a passive perception of 10.

The Shadow possesses notable special abilities:
- Amorphous: This ability allows the Shadow to pass through tight spaces as narrow as 1 inch wide without the need to squeeze, facilitating unexpected movement and positioning in combat.
- Sunlight Weakness: In sunlight, the Shadow suffers from disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, which severely limits its effectiveness in bright conditions.
- Undead Nature: Shadows do not require air, food, or sleep, making them relentless in pursuit and ambush tactics.

In combat, the Shadow can perform the following actions:
- Claw: This melee weapon attack allows the Shadow to strike a target using a +4 to hit. It has a reach of 5 feet and upon a successful hit, it deals 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must then succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed until the end of a short or long rest. While cursed, the target suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws. If the cursed target dies, it becomes a new Shadow within 1d4 hours, complicating matters for the party as they lose the opportunity for resurrection until the new Shadow is eliminated.

Additionally, the Shadow can use its Bonus Action to perform:
- Shadow Sneak: This ability allows the Shadow to take the Hide action, even when only obscured by dim light or darkness, making it difficult for opponents to detect its presence and allowing it to effectively set up ambushes or escape when needed. 

Overall, Shadows are cunning adversaries that utilize their stealth and unique abilities to debilitate foes and create new threats from the remains of the fallen. They excel in darkness and can turn the tide of battle through effective ambushes and curses.

The Shadow is a Medium undead creature that excels in stealth and mobility. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it serves as a subtle threat in combat, often stalking its prey from the shadows. Its strengths lie in its agility, enhanced by a high Dexterity score of +4, which enables it to move swiftly and remain unnoticed. However, its weaknesses are significant; notably, it suffers in the presence of sunlight, which hampers its abilities. Shadows are particularly dangerous due to their Strength Drain attack, which not only inflicts necrotic damage but can also diminish the strength of their victims, leading to potential death if their strength score falls to zero.

The Shadow possesses an Armor Class of 12, which provides a baseline level of defense. With 17 hit points, it can endure some damage before being taken down, but this is relatively low compared to sturdier monsters. The creature has a movement speed of 40 feet, allowing it to close distance quickly, and it can climb at 20 feet due to its Spider Climb ability, making it exceptionally mobile in various environments.

The Shadow's ability scores are:
- Strength: -2 (very bad), which means it is physically weak.
- Dexterity: +4 (very good), granting it excellent agility.
- Constitution: +1 (average), giving it decent resilience.
- Intelligence: -2 (very bad), indicating a lack of mental capability.
- Wisdom: +0 (average), suggesting standard perception and insight.
- Charisma: -1 (bad), reflecting its minimal social presence.

In terms of senses, the Shadow has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light. Its Perception score is 10, denoting an average ability to notice hidden objects or creatures. The Shadow excels in stealth with a Stealth score of 14 (good), making it proficient at hiding in dimly lit or dark areas. Although it understands languages it knew in life, it cannot communicate verbally.

The Shadow has several notable special abilities:
- Amorphous: It can move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, allowing it to infiltrate tight spots.
- Spider Climb: The Shadow can climb difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without needing to perform any checks, enhancing its tactical options.
- Sunlight Weakness: If exposed to sunlight, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, making it vulnerable in bright conditions.
- Undead Nature: It does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, which could be advantageous in long-term scenarios.
- Undead Resilience: It is immune to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, enhancing its durability against specific types of attacks.

In combat, the Shadow can engage with its key action:
- Strength Drain: This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it connects, it deals 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage. More importantly, the attack reduces the target's Strength score by 1d4, which can be critical for characters who rely on physical power. If a target's Strength is reduced to zero, they die, further increasing the Shadow's lethality. If a humanoid dies from this effect, it can rise again as a new Shadow after a period of 1d4 hours.

The Shadow also has two bonus actions to enhance its combat tactics:
- Shadow Bond: One creature within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become bonded with the Shadow's own shadow for 1 minute. This bond allows the Shadow to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bonded creature, enabling quick repositioning during combat as long as the creature remains within 120 feet.
- Shadow Stealth: The Shadow can take the Hide action, which is particularly effective in dim light or darkness, allowing it to stealthily evade detection and launch surprise attacks.

Overall, the Shadow is a cunning adversary that thrives in low-light conditions, making it a formidable challenge for adventurers unprepared for its ambush tactics.</detail>
