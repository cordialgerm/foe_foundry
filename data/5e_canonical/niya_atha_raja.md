<summary>The Niya-Atha Raja is a formidable Medium Fey creature characterized by its lawful neutral alignment. With a strong ability to command the battlefield through a combination of physical prowess and magical abilities, it stands out as a significant challenge for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 17 and 117 hit points, the Raja can endure considerable damage while delivering its own through powerful melee and ranged attacks. It excels in Dexterity, granting it a good modifier of +5, which translates into superior agility and attack accuracy. However, its Wisdom and Intelligence scores are average, which limits its capacity for insight and knowledge-based interactions. This creature has notable strengths in resisting magical effects, but these advantages are somewhat diminished while it is enlarged.</summary>

<detail>

The Niya-Atha Raja has the following attributes: Strength at 14 provides a good modifier of +2, contributing to its melee effectiveness; Dexterity at 21 provides an exceptional modifier of +5, enhancing its agility and ranged attacks; Constitution at 14 gives it a good modifier of +2, adding to its durability; Intelligence is at 10, resulting in an average modifier of +0; Wisdom is 13, resulting in an average modifier of +1; and Charisma is 19, providing a very good modifier of +4, which is essential for its abilities that rely on charm and fear.

For saving throws, the Raja has +8 in Dexterity, +3 in Intelligence, and +4 in Wisdom, showcasing its exceptional ability to dodge effects and its average resistance to mental influences. While it has immunity to being charmed and frightened, it has a passive perception score of 14, indicating its average ability to notice other creatures or hidden traps. It can communicate fluently in both Common and Sylvan.

The Niya-Atha Raja possesses several remarkable special abilities. Its "Commanding Bulk" ability enables it to protect allies within a 30-foot radius from being charmed or frightened while it is enlarged, enhancing teamwork during encounters. Its "Evasion" ability allows it to take no damage from effects that require a Dexterity saving throw on a successful save, which is very good for avoiding area-of-effect spells or traps, though it cannot activate this ability when enlarged. With "Magic Resistance," it gains advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, bolstering its defense against magic, but also cannot use this ability when enlarged. The "Reduce" ability allows it to return to its normal size without any action once its turn begins while enlarged, providing tactical flexibility.

In combat, the Niya-Atha Raja can execute a multiattack action, allowing it to use a "War Bellow" followed by a series of melee or ranged attacks. The "Tulwar" attack is a melee weapon strike with a +8 to hit, dealing 9 slashing damage, or up to 14 slashing damage when enlarged. Similarly, the "Dart" ranged attack has the same attack bonus and can deal 7 piercing damage normally or 10 piercing damage when enlarged. 

The "War Bellow" is a particularly impactful action; it releases a booming bellow that can frighten all hostile creatures within 60 feet who can hear it, requiring a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to resist. If the save is successful, the creature is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours, introducing a significant strategic element in combat. 

As a bonus action, the Raja can use "Enlarge" to magically increase its size, which doubles its weapon damage dice for attacks and grants advantage on Strength checks and saves. However, while enlarged, it loses the ability to use Evasion and Magic Resistance, making the decision to enlarge a tactical one depending on the battlefield situation. Overall, the Niya-Atha Raja combines solid combat abilities with impressive magical resistance and area control, making it a versatile opponent in various encounters.</detail>
