<summary>The Aboleth is a massive, aberrant creature that dwells in the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean or underground lakes. Its body is long and eel-like, covered in slimy, mucus-coated skin that reeks of decay. It has three glowing eyes stacked one on top of the other, and four long, powerful tentacles that it uses to ensnare prey. The Aboleth is incredibly ancient, with memories stretching back to primordial times, and it has powerful psychic abilities, including mind control and telepathy. It is a manipulator and enslaver of other creatures, twisting their minds and bodies to serve its purposes.</summary>

<summary>The Aboleth is a large aberration known for its cunning intellect and formidable presence, often lurking in the depths of dark waters. With a robust armor class of 17 and a substantial pool of hit points at 171, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who venture too close to its lair. The creature's speed allows it to move swiftly in water, swimming at 40 feet, but its terrestrial movement is limited to only 10 feet. The Aboleth operates at challenge rating 11, making it a powerful adversary for parties of lower levels, and it can be expected to provide a serious combat challenge with its multiattack capabilities and potent special abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Aboleth boasts an impressive array of physical and mental attributes. Its Strength is 20, providing an exceptional +5 modifier, allowing for powerful melee attacks, while its Dexterity is average at 12 (+1), and its Constitution is very good at 18 (+4), granting it durability in battle. Intellectually, the Aboleth is outstanding, with both Intelligence and Wisdom at 20, translating into +5 modifiers that enhance its spellcasting and perception. Its Charisma also stands at a notable 18 (+4), allowing for effective social interactions and innate spellcasting. The creature excels in saving throws with very good proficiency in Constitution (+8), Intelligence (+9), and Wisdom (+9), making it resilient against various effects.

Additionally, the Aboleth possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat strategies. Its amphibious nature allows it to breathe both air and water, making it versatile in different environments. With innate spellcasting rooted in Charisma, the Aboleth can cast spells such as Detect Thoughts, Project Image, and Phantasmal Force three times a day without the need for any material components. This ability grants it significant advantages in manipulating and controlling encounters through telepathy and illusions.

In combat, the Aboleth can utilize its Multiattack feature to strike three times with its tentacles, which have a reach of 15 feet and deal an average of 19 bludgeoning damage. Moreover, the tentacle attack can inflict a debilitating disease known as Sea Change. When an opponent is hit, they must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in contracting the disease, causing disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and a time-sensitive transformation that forces the victim to become more aquatic in nature if not treated. This disease can be removed with high-level spells and becomes even more dangerous should the afflicted remain dry for extended periods.

The Aboleth can also unleash its Slimy Cloud ability once per day while bloodied. This action creates a heavily obscured area filled with inky slime that poisons creatures caught within it unless they succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. The damage dealt is significant, averaging 44 poison damage for those who fail.

As a formidable creature, the Aboleth can utilize legendary actions to extend its influence during combat. It has the ability to move up to its swim speed without provoking opportunity attacks, and it can use a telepathic summon to charm and direct a creature to move towards it. For powerful mind control, it can target one creature affected by the Sea Change disease with its Baleful Charm, forcing them to obey its commands, while its Soul Drain ability allows it to deal psychic damage to charmed creatures and regain hit points, enhancing its survivability.

In summary, the Aboleth is a dangerous foe with significant combat prowess, spellcasting capabilities, and the potential to disrupt the tactics of adventurers through disease and mind control. Its unique abilities create a demanding challenge for any party, making encounters with it both strategic and perilous.

The Aboleth is a large aberration known for its powerful psionic abilities and manipulative nature. Residing in dark, aquatic environments, it possesses significant strength and resilience, making it a formidable opponent. With a Challenge Rating of 10, it presents a considerable threat, especially due to its capacity to inflict disease and mental manipulation. The Aboleth's strengths lie in its resistance to various conditions, exceptional intelligence, and horrifying psychic attacks. However, its relatively low mobility on land, with a speed of only 10 feet, makes it vulnerable when confronted outside of water. 

The Aboleth has an Armor Class of 17, indicating it has good protection thanks to its natural armor. With 165 hit points, it can endure a substantial amount of damage before being defeated. Its attributes include a Strength of +5 (good), Dexterity of -1 (very bad), Constitution of +6 (very good), Intelligence of +8 (exceptional), Wisdom of +6 (very good), and Charisma of +4 (good). The Aboleth has darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness, and a Perception score of 20, which is exceptional and gives it a high awareness of its surroundings. Additionally, it has a Stealth score of 9, which is bad, meaning it is not adept at moving silently. The creature communicates in Deep Speech and has telepathy that works within 120 feet of it, allowing it to interact mentally with others.

The Aboleth has several special abilities that enhance its threat level. Its Aberrant Resilience grants it resistance to conditions like being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned, while also giving it an advantage on saves against spells that would change its form. Being Amphibious enables it to breathe both air and water, making it capable of navigating between different environments. The Legendary Resistance ability allows the Aboleth to succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail, up to three times per day, which is very good for maintaining its survivability in combat.

Probing Telepathy is a unique ability that lets the Aboleth uncover a creature's greatest desires through telepathic communication. The Slime Pox disease causes infected creatures to suffer from debilitating effects, including the ability to regain hit points only while underwater and taking acid damage if they remain dry. In addition, failing a DC 16 Charisma save over time can turn infected creatures into thralls of the Aboleth if they fail three times, which adds a strong element of control to the Aboleth's repertoire. Finally, the Slimy Skin trait causes creatures that come in contact with the Aboleth to risk infection with Slime Pox, placing further pressure on its enemies.

In combat, the Aboleth can make a Multiattack, which consists of three attacks either with its Tentacles or Psychic Bolt. Its Tentacle attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The Psychic Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +8 to hit, able to target creatures up to 120 feet away, dealing 14 (3d6 + 4) psychic damage. Its Psychic Torrent ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, can affect up to three creatures within 60 feet, forcing them to make a DC 16 Wisdom save or take 49 (14d6) psychic damage while also becoming incapacitated. This move can severely hinder opponents, making it extremely useful in battles against groups.

The Aboleth can also use legendary actions to enhance its versatility. It can automatically detect creatures and traps within 60 feet with the Detect action, swim up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, or unleash its Slime Drain ability to drain life from a creature infected with slime pox, dealing 10 (3d6) acid damage while restoring its own health.

Overall, the Aboleth is a cunning and terrifying foe, capable of manipulating its prey and dealing devastating psychic damage, while also having tactical advantages through its resistance and unique abilities.</detail>

# Aboleth

*Large aberration*

- **Armor Class:** 17 (natural armor)
- **Hit Points:** 165

- **Source:** [Kobold Press Black Flag SRD](https://koboldpress.com/black-flag-roleplaying/)

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| +5 | -1 | +6 | +8 | +6 | +4 |

- **Senses:** darkvision 120 ft.
- **Perception:** 20
- **Stealth:** 9
- **Languages:** Deep Speech, telepathy 120 ft.

### Special Abilities

- **Aberrant Resilience.** The aboleth is resistant to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, and it has advantage on saves against spells or effects that would alter its form.
- **Amphibious.** The aboleth can breathe air and water.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the aboleth fails a save, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Probing Telepathy.** If a creature the aboleth can see communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature’s greatest desires.
- **Slime Pox.** Characterized by the slimy pustules that erupt across the victim’s body, slime pox is a disease that infects creatures attacked by an aboleth or that come into contact with an aboleth’s slime. Until the disease is cured, the infected creature can breathe air and water, can’t regain HP except when underwater, and takes 6 (1d12) acid damage for every 1 hour it remains outside of water or without moisture applied to its skin. Every 24 hours that elapse, the infected creature must make a DC 16 CHA save. Each time a creature fails this save, it views the infecting aboleth more and more favorably, becoming the aboleth’s doting and protective thrall after three failed saves. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive, but once a creature has acquired three of a kind, it no longer has to make this save, resulting in either the creature becoming a thrall of the aboleth or an autonomous—though infected—creature. Slime pox can be cured only by the heal spell or similar magic.
- **Slimy Skin.** The aboleth is coated in an otherworldly mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 CON save or be infected with slime pox (see the Slime Pox trait).

- **Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Psychic Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) psychic damage.
- **Psychic Torrent (Recharge 5–6).** The aboleth floods the minds of up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it with random and horrific memories from its eons-long life. Each target must make a DC 16 WIS save. On a failure, a creature takes 49 (14d6) psychic damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn, as its mind reels from the torrent of images, thoughts, and memories. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t incapacitated.

### Legendary Actions

The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

- **Detect.** The aboleth automatically detects every creature and trap within 60 feet of it, pinpointing the current location of each.
- **Swim.** The aboleth swims up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
