<summary>The Song Angel is a powerful celestial creature embodying lawful good, standing large among its peers. It possesses notable strengths such as a high Charisma, which enhances its spellcasting and ability to support allies, as well as exceptional resistances to nonmagical attacks and certain conditions. With a solid Armor Class of 15 and a generous pool of hit points totaling 76, it can sustain itself in combat while also dealing substantial damage with its magical attacks. Moreover, its ability to cast spells innately and support allies with its special abilities makes it a formidable presence on the battlefield, although it is somewhat reliant on its saving throws and the efficacy of its spells, requiring careful positioning and planning.</summary>

<detail>

The Song Angel has the following attributes: Strength of 12 with a modifier of +1 (average), Dexterity of 16 with a modifier of +3 (good), Constitution of 16 with a modifier of +3 (good), Intelligence of 18 with a modifier of +4 (very good), Wisdom of 18 with a modifier of +4 (very good), and Charisma of 21 with a modifier of +5 (exceptional). It excels in Wisdom saving throws, providing a +7 modifier, and Charisma saving throws, granting an +8 modifier. In skill checks, it has proficiency in Insight (+7) and Performance (+11), making it very effective in social and interpretative roles.

The Song Angel resists radiant damage and takes reduced damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks from nonmagical sources. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, or frightened. It possesses darkvision up to 120 feet and has a passive Perception of 14, offering it considerable awareness of its surroundings. This angelic creature can communicate in all languages and has telepathy up to 120 feet, allowing for silent, direct communication.

One of the Song Angelâ€™s special abilities is Angelic Weapons, which allows its weapon attacks to deal an extra 4d8 radiant damage, ensuring that its attacks are significantly more powerful than typical weapons. Its innate spellcasting relies on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 16. The angel can cast spells like "Alter Self," allowing it to change its physical form; "Calm Emotions," which suppresses strong emotions in a group; "Charm Person," which can turn an enemy into an ally temporarily; "Create Food and Water," providing sustenance; and "Detect Evil and Good," helping to identify malevolent creatures. It can cast "Enthrall," "Silence," and "Zone of Truth" three times a day each, which can greatly influence social encounters and control a battlefield. Once per day, it can invoke "Irresistible Dance," which compels a creature to dance, making it unable to act, and "Mass Cure Wounds," enabling it to heal allies simultaneously.

In combat, the Song Angel can attack with a Scimitar, using a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 10 slashing damage, augmented by an additional 18 radiant damage thanks to its Angelic Weapons trait. The Horn of Blasting ability, which recharges on rolls of 5-6, enables the angel to produce a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone, potentially deafening foes and dealing significant thunder damage while inflicting additional effects on fragile objects. The Horn of Spirits ability allows the angel to summon warrior spirits to aid it in battle, which can provide both tactical advantages and additional strength in numbers. The Change Shape ability grants the Song Angel versatility by allowing it to polymorph into a humanoid form of equal challenge rating, retaining its statistics and the ability to communicate, thus facilitating various social interactions or stealth scenarios.

As a reaction, the Song Angel can use Heavenly Inspiration to assist allies. If it sees a creature fail an ability check, saving throw, or miss an attack, it can sing a divine melody enabling the creature to reroll the check with advantage, enhancing the chances of success and supporting team dynamics effectively. This feature reinforces the Song Angel's role as a protector and supporter in any adventuring party.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Angelic Weapons:** The song angel's weapon attacks are magical. When the song angel hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The angel's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: alter self, calm emotions, charm person, create food and water, detect evil and good
3/day each: enthrall, silence, zone of truth
1/day each: irresistible dance, mass cure wounds

### Actions

- **Scimitar:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.
- **Horn of Blasting (Recharges 5-6):** The song angel blows on its ram's horn, emitting a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 17 (5d6) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage but isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 35 (10d6) thunder damage instead.
- **Horn of Spirits (Recharges after a Long Rest):** The song angel blows on its brass horn, calling forth 10 (3d4 + 3) warrior spirits. These spirits appear within 60 feet of the angel and use tribal warrior statistics. When the spirits are summoned, one of them is always an ancient champion that uses berserker statistics. They disappear after 1 hour or when they are reduced to 0 hp. These spirits follow the angel's commands.
- **Change Shape:** The angel magically polymorphs into a humanoid that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the angel's choice).<br><br>In the new form, the angel retains its game statistics and the ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

### Reactions

- **Heavenly Inspiration:** When a creature the song angel can see fails an ability check or saving throw or misses with a weapon attack, the angel can sing a verse of divine music. If the creature hears this song, it can reroll the failed check, save, or attack roll with advantage.
