<summary>The White Stag is a large celestial creature known for its chaotic good nature. It serves as a beacon of divine will and protection within the natural world. With a balance of agility and strength, it stands out as a formidable opponent in combat while also possessing unique abilities that can influence its interactions with adventurers and the environment around it. Although its armor class is moderate, its mobility and special abilities offer substantial advantages, including avoidance of difficult terrain and the potential to bestow curses on its foes. However, it also has a limited pool of hit points, making it vulnerable if it comes under concentrated attack.</summary>

<detail>

The White Stag has the following attributes: Strength of 17 which gives it a +3 modifier (very good), Dexterity of 15 with a +2 modifier (good), Constitution of 13 providing a +1 modifier (average), Intelligence of 10 resulting in a +0 modifier (average), Wisdom of 14 granting a +2 modifier (good), and Charisma of 15 again with a +2 modifier (good). In terms of skills, it excels in athletics with a +5 modifier, insight with a +4 modifier, and perception also with a +4 modifier, indicating its capabilities in navigating obstacles, understanding situations, and noticing hidden details.

In terms of senses, the White Stag has darkvision up to 60 feet, meaning it can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, but only in shades of gray. Its passive perception is 14, indicating its ability to perceive hidden creatures or objects without actively searching for them. The creature understands the languages of Celestial, Common, Elvish, and Sylvan, allowing it to comprehend dialogues but not articulate responses.

The White Stag has special abilities that enhance its role in a campaign. "Beloved by the Gods" acts as a curse mechanism when the stag is slain, hindering the creature responsible for its death by making nature seem to actively work against them in subtle, troublesome ways. This curse can persist until lifted by a specific spell or a penance is completed. "Forest Runner" allows the White Stag to traverse difficult terrain in forest areas without any penalty, maintaining its pace, which can give it evasive maneuverability during encounters. "Running Leap" allows the creature to make impressive long jumps with a 10-foot running start, reaching distances of up to 25 feet, enabling it to navigate obstacles efficiently.

In combat, the White Stag can utilize multiattacks, allowing it to perform both a gore and a hooves attack in a single turn. Its gore attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage on a hit, while its hooves attack is also a melee weapon attack, dealing more damage with 10 bludgeoning damage on a hit, making it a versatile challenger in battle. Overall, the White Stag's blend of physical prowess, skill advantages, and unique mechanics create diverse opportunities for gameplay, whether in combat scenarios or exploratory adventures.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Beloved by the Gods:** When the white stag dies, the deity that created it curses the creature that dealt the killing blow. The cursed creature finds the natural world working against it: roots randomly rise up to trip the creature when it walks past a tree (5% chance per mile traveled in forested terrain), animals are more reluctant to obey (disadvantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks), and the wind seems to always be blowing in the least favorable direction for the creature (scattering papers, sending the creature's scent in the direction of a creature tracking it, etc.). This curse lasts until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or after the cursed creature completes a task of penance for the deity or its temple.
- **Forest Runner:** Difficult terrain doesn't slow the white stag's travel while in a forest.
- **Running Leap:** With a 10-foot running start, the white stag can long jump up to 25 feet.

- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Hooves:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
