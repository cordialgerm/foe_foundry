### Special Abilities

- **Forest Camouflage:** A moss lurker has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forested terrain.
- **Keen Hearing and Smell:** The moss lurker has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
- **Poisoned Gifts:** A moss lurker can spend 1 minute stirring one of its red claws in a drink or cooked meal, contaminating the food or drink. A creature that eats or drinks the contaminated food or drink must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

### Actions

- **Poisoned Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.
- **Throw Stone:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the target is at least 10 feet below the moss lurker, such as at the base of a cliff where the moss lurker stands, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the rock fell before hitting the target, to a maximum of 10d4.
