<summary>The Moss Lurker is a small humanoid creature characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment. It serves as a stealthy ambusher within forested areas, adept at utilizing natural cover to surprise its enemies. With a relatively high Armor Class of 15, it possesses decent durability but can still be vulnerable to more powerful foes due to its moderate Hit Points of 45. Its challenge rating of 1 indicates that it presents a manageable threat level for lower-level adventurers, providing a balance of skill, mobility, and poison-related abilities. Notably, the Moss Lurker excels in stealth and perception, making it a formidable adversary in wooded environments, although its effectiveness diminishes in open terrains. </summary>

<detail>

The Moss Lurker has the following attributes: Strength of 14 (+2, which is considered good), Dexterity of 14 (+2, also good), Constitution of 12 (+1, average), Intelligence of 12 (+1, average), Wisdom of 10 (+0, average), and Charisma of 10 (+0, average). Its saving throw bonuses include a +4 for both Strength and Dexterity, which is good, allowing it to resist physical threats effectively. In terms of skills, it possesses Perception at +2 (average) and Stealth at +4 (good), enhancing its capabilities to remain hidden and detect threats. The Moss Lurker is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, making it particularly resilient to such attacks. It has blindsight of 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, and a passive Perception of 12, providing it with a baseline ability to notice hidden creatures or traps.

The Moss Lurker features several special abilities that highlight its cunning nature. With Forest Camouflage, it gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in wooded areas, significantly improving its chances to remain undetected. Keen Hearing and Smell grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to those senses, enhancing its ability to track or ambush prey. Its most dangerous capability is Poisoned Gifts, which allows it to poison food or drink after one minute of preparation. A creature consuming the tainted item must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one hour, with severe penalties for those who fail by five or more, rendering them unconscious during this time until damaged or shaken awake.

In combat, the Moss Lurker can execute two distinct actions. Firstly, it may attack with its Poisoned Claw, making a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. On a successful strike, it inflicts 5 slashing damage combined with 7 poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer from the poisoned condition until the end of their next turn, potentially debuffing its effectiveness in combat. Alternatively, the Moss Lurker can throw a stone as a ranged weapon attack, also with a +4 to hit and a range of 20/60 feet. A successful hit deals 7 bludgeoning damage, but if the target is positioned at least 10 feet below the Moss Lurker, they must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw to avoid additional bludgeoning damage based on the height from which the stone fell, adding an unpredictable element to its combat tactics.</detail>
