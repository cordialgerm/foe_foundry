<summary>An Air Elemental is a swirling, translucent mass of wind and vapor, constantly in motion. Its form is difficult to see, often appearing as little more than a gust of wind, though at times it condenses into a vaguely humanoid shape with swirling arms and legs made of pure air. These beings move swiftly and silently through the sky, capable of generating powerful gusts of wind and whirlwinds that can lift creatures off the ground. They can also suffocate foes by surrounding them in a vortex of air. Air Elementals are wild and free-spirited, embodying the chaotic nature of the element they come from.</summary>

<summary>The Air Elemental is a formidable creature known for its speed and versatility in combat. As a Large Elemental, it possesses a strong armor class of 14 and can endure a significant amount of punishment with 90 hit points, reflecting its resilience in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it provides a reasonable challenge for adventurers, boasting exceptional dexterity with a score of 18, which gives it a +4 modifier for high agility and maneuverability. While its strength and intelligence scores are average to low, its unique abilities and resistances make it a significant opponent. Notably, it is immune to poison damage and has resistance to lightning and thunder damage, providing it with substantial survivability against many attacks. It operates well within the battlefield using its flying ability, allowing it to engage or disengage effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The Air Elemental has the following attributes:
- Strength: 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average.
- Dexterity: 18 with a modifier of +4, which is exceptional.
- Constitution: 14 with a modifier of +2, which is good.
- Intelligence: 6 with a modifier of -2, which is very bad.
- Wisdom: 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average.
- Charisma: 6 with a modifier of -2, which is very bad.

In terms of skills, the Air Elemental lacks any specific bonuses. However, it benefits from damage immunities against poison and has damage resistance against lightning, thunder, and damage from nonmagical weapons, making it particularly resilient in the face of many attacks. It is immune to conditions such as fatigue, being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, and unconscious, which means it can effectively ignore many forms of control. The creature has darkvision up to 60 feet allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light and has a passive perception score of 10, indicating its ability to notice hidden foes.

The Air Elemental's special abilities include:
- Air Form: This ability allows the elemental to move through the spaces of other creatures and through openings as narrow as one inch without becoming hindered, making it highly mobile and difficult to trap.
- Elemental Nature: This grants the elemental independence from needing air, food, or sleep, allowing it to engage in prolonged encounters without suffering from exhaustion.

In combat, the Air Elemental can perform the following actions:
- Multiattack: The elemental can make two slam attacks, increasing its offensive capabilities.
- Slam: This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit, allowing it to land strikes against enemies effectively. On a hit, it deals 14 bludgeoning damage on average (3d6 + 4).
- Whirlwind (Recharge 5-6): By transforming into a whirlwind, the elemental can move up to half its fly speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If a creature shares the same space with the whirlwind during this movement, they must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. If they fail, they are carried inside the elemental's space, taking 3 bludgeoning damage for each 10 feet moved before falling prone as the whirlwind dissipates. The whirlwind can carry one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures, making it advantageous for controlling the battlefield.

Overall, the Air Elemental is a highly mobile and encompassing creature that can provide significant challenges, especially when used strategically in combat scenarios.

The Air Elemental is a large elemental creature that embodies the essence of air. With an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial 94 hit points, it presents a noteworthy challenge for adventurers, rated at a Challenge Rating of 5. This creature is capable of flying at a speed of 90 feet and can hover without requiring a surface. The Air Elemental excels in mobility due to its ability to pass through narrow spaces and evade attacks, making it a formidable foe in combat. It possesses a variety of special abilities that enhance its survivability, particularly its resistance to many damage types and immunity to certain conditions. However, it has average physical strength and intelligence, which may affect its interactions outside of combat.

The Air Elemental has the following attributes: Strength is +2, which is average; Dexterity is +5, indicating very good agility; Constitution is +2, average for resilience; Intelligence is -2, very bad for mental challenges; Wisdom is +0, average; and Charisma is -2, also very bad. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, a Perception score of 13, and a Stealth score of 15, allowing it to slip away unnoticed in suitable environments. It communicates in Auran, the language of air elementals.

Special abilities include Air Form, which allows the elemental to move into any hostile creature's space easily and pass through tight spaces up to an inch wide; Cloud Camouflage, which improves its Stealth to 20 in conditions like clouds and fog; and Elemental Nature, which means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep. Elemental Resilience grants it resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, as well as immunity to poison damage and certain debilitating conditions such as paralysis and unconsciousness.

In terms of actions, the Air Elemental can make a Multiattack, allowing it to perform either two Wind Lash attacks or two Lightning Bolt attacks in a single round. The Wind Lash is a melee attack with a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, dealing 18 bludgeoning damage upon a successful strike. The Lightning Bolt is a ranged attack, also with a +8 to hit, that can deal 18 lightning damage at a range of 30 feet to 120 feet. Additionally, it has the Whirlwind ability, which can be used every four to six rounds; it requires targets within its space to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failing this results in 18 bludgeoning damage and being thrown 20 feet away in a random direction, potentially causing additional damage if they crash into an object or another creature.

The Air Elemental also has a defensive reaction called Thunderous Retreat. If it is damaged by a creature it can see, it can make a thunderous noise and move up to 15 feet to a visible, unoccupied space. Creatures in close proximity to its original position must then succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 7 thunder damage. This ability allows the elemental to escape attacks while still dealing damage to nearby foes.</detail>
