<summary>The Crinaea is a Medium-sized fey creature characterized by its aquatic nature and cunning abilities, making it both an intriguing ally and a dangerous adversary. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it is suitable for low-level adventurers looking for a strategic encounter. The Crinaea has a unique connection to water, allowing it to manipulate and poison water sources drawn from its bonded origin. This ability, in combination with its proficient stealth and perceptive senses, grants it a distinct advantage in aquatic environments. Additionally, its capacity to become invisible while submerged enhances its tactical options. On the downside, if separated from its water source for too long, it becomes vulnerable to exhaustion and less effective in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Crinaea's Armor Class is 13, which indicates average defense capabilities against attacks. With a total of 44 hit points, calculated from 8d8 plus an additional 8, it can withstand a moderate amount of damage before being incapacitated. Its swimming speed of 60 feet and walking speed of 30 feet gives it good mobility in both land and water environments. The creature's Strength score is 11, reflecting an average performance in physical confrontations, while its Dexterity is 16, providing a good +3 modifier that enhances its agility in combat situations. The Constitution score of 12 results in a +1 modifier, indicating a slightly above-average resilience, whereas its Intelligence of 14 allows for good strategic thinking. Wisdom and Charisma scores of 12 and 17 grant it average perceptive abilities and exceptional social interaction skills, respectively.

The Crinaea possesses several significant special abilities. Crinaea’s Curse allows it to sense and poison water within 300 feet that originated from its bonded source within the last 24 hours. As a bonus action, the Crinaea can poison up to 1 gallon of this water. If the poisoned water is consumed or comes into contact with a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 18 poison damage, or half that on a success, while also suffering the poisoned condition for 1 hour. The Water-bound Form ability creates a sense of urgency for the Crinaea to remain near water; if it is away from its source for over 24 hours, it gains fatigue in the form of exhaustion. It can restore its vigor by bonding with a new water source and resting in it. Its Watery Form makes it an even more formidable foe when submerged, as it gains invisibility and can pass through tight spaces without restriction, enhancing its tactics during encounters.

The Crinaea also draws on innate spellcasting, using its Charisma as its casting ability with a spell save DC of 13. It can cast poison spray at will, allowing it to deliver a significant amount of damage through this spell. Additionally, it can use create or destroy water three times per day, enabling versatile combat tactics and survival skills, as well as purify food and drink, enhancing its utility. Once per day, it can disguise itself, create fog clouds for concealment, and protect itself from poison, which can dramatically alter encounters, particularly in situations where stealth and evasion are critical.

In combat, the Crinaea can also utilize a dagger in melee attacks, providing a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, delivering standard piercing damage of 5 along with a notable 7 cold damage from extra dice. Overall, the Crinaea exhibits a blend of combat effectiveness, utility, and strategic depth, making it a distinctive creature in any adventurer's zodiac of challenges.</detail>

As a bonus action, the crinaea can poison up to 1 gallon of water within 300 feet of it that was drawn from its bonded source. This can even affect water that has been used to make another nonmagical substance, such as soup or tea, or water that was consumed within the last 30 minutes. The poison can affect a target through contact or ingestion. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

The crinaea can bond with a new water source and remove its levels of exhaustion by finishing a long rest while submerged in the new water source.
