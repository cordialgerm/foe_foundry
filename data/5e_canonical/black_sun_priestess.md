<summary>The Black Sun Priestess is a Medium humanoid of chaotic evil alignment, serving as a formidable opponent in combat situations. With a Challenge Rating of 3, this character poses a moderate threat, featuring strong physical attributes and spellcasting abilities. Her armor class of 13, while not exceptionally high, paired with 67 hit points (which translates to an average of 9d8+27), indicates she can withstand a fair amount of damage before being defeated. Notable strengths include her capability to engage quickly due to her aggressive nature and her potent array of spells, which can influence the battlefield significantly. However, she is vulnerable to bright light, which hampers her effectiveness in combat, making her less intimidating under such conditions.</summary>

<detail>

The Black Sun Priestess has the following attributes: Strength at 16 (+3, considered good), Dexterity at 12 (+1, average), Constitution at 16 (+3, good), Intelligence at 9 (-1, bad), Wisdom at 16 (+3, good), and Charisma at 14 (+2, good). Her skills include a +6 modifier in insight and intimidation, demonstrating her proficiency in reading and influencing others, while her religion skill is less notable with a +1 modifier (average). She possesses darkvision, allowing her to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and has a passive perception of 12, which is considered average in terms of awareness.

The Black Sun Priestess has several special abilities that enhance her combat potential. Her Aggressive ability allows her to quickly close the distance to a hostile creature as a bonus action, which can be strategically advantageous in battle. Additionally, her Black Sun Sight enables her to see through magical darkness, making her a threatening presence in dark environments. The Light Sensitivity drawback, however, poses a significant challenge, as being in bright light gives her disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

As a spellcaster of 6th level, the Black Sun Priestess has a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 modifier on her spell attacks. Her cantrips, which she can cast at will, include guidance (providing a bonus to an ally's ability check), mending (repairing small breaks or tears), resistance (offering a temporary bonus against damage), and sacred flame (dealing radiant damage to enemies). She can cast multiple 1st-level spells per day, including bane (cursing enemies to reduce their effectiveness), command (issuing a single-word order), cure wounds (restoring health), and detect magic (perceiving magical auras). Her 2nd-level spells, such as augury (predicting outcomes of actions) and spiritual weapon (creating a spectral weapon to attack foes), enhance her battlefield control. Finally, her 3rd-level spells include animate dead (raising corpses as undead minions), bestow curse (inflicting debilitating effects on enemies), and spirit guardians (summoning protective spirits to harass foes while providing adjacent allies with additional defenses).

In combat, the Black Sun Priestess can engage with her melee weapon, a greatclub, with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a successful strike. This combines her physical prowess with her magical capabilities, making her a versatile and dangerous opponent in both melee and ranged situations.</detail>
