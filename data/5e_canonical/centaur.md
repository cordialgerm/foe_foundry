<summary>A Centaur is a majestic creature with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a horse. They are known for their pride, strength, and speed, often found in large herds in forests or plains. Centaurs are skilled hunters and archers, wielding longbows with precision while galloping at incredible speeds. Though they are fierce warriors, they are also known to be wise and deeply connected to nature, often serving as protectors of the wilderness. They are proud of their independence and do not easily submit to outside authority.</summary>

<summary>The centaur is a large fey creature known for its powerful physique and agility. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, boasting a solid mix of melee and ranged abilities. Its defensive capabilities are bolstered by an armor class of 13, and it has a respectable pool of 45 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being defeated. The centaur excels in physical combat, leveraging both its hooves and a pike for melee attacks, as well as a deadly shortbow for ranged engagements. However, being a creature reliant on physical prowess, it may not fare as well in situations demanding strong intelligence or charisma, as its mental attributes are average. Overall, the centaur's blend of speed, melee attacks, and ranged capabilities makes it a versatile combatant in the fray.</summary>

The centaur has several key attributes that enhance its effectiveness in combat. It possesses a strength score of 16, which grants it a +3 modifier, making its physical attacks very good. It also has a dexterity score of 16, providing another +3 modifier, contributing to its agility and ranged attack accuracy. The centaur's constitution is at 14, granting it a +2 modifier for added resilience in battle. Its intelligence is average, sitting at 10, with no modifier.

In terms of skills, the centaur is proficient in nature, perception, and survival, each with a +5 modifier, indicating exceptional competency in these areas and showcasing its role as a guardian of the wild. It has a passive perception of 17, enabling it to notice hidden threats and traps efficiently. The centaur can communicate in Common, Elvish, and Sylvan, which allows it to interact with various beings and add depth to its character in role-playing scenarios.

The centaur's main actions include its Multiattack, which allows it to strike twice in one turn with its pike and its hooves. The pike attack offers a +5 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 8 points of piercing damage on a successful hit. The hooves attack also has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 8 points of bludgeoning damage, with a unique benefit: if this attack deals damage, the centaur's movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the target for the rest of its turn, allowing it to maneuver safely.

The centaur can also engage opponents from a distance with its shortbow. This ranged weapon attack has a +5 to hit and a standard range of 80 feet, extending to 320 feet for long-range shots. It deals 10 points of piercing damage on a hit, making it a formidable ranged option. Additionally, the centaur possesses a special ability called Deadeye Shot, which it can use once per day to make a shortbow attack with advantage, significantly increasing its chances of landing a hit. This ability makes the centaur particularly dangerous in ranged combat, especially when employing surprise tactics or in situations where it can take full advantage of its surroundings.

The Centaur is a large monstrosity that serves as a formidable opponent or ally in combat scenarios. With a challenge rating of CR 2, it possesses a good balance of offensive and defensive capabilities, making it a versatile choice in encounters. The creature has a decent armor class of 12 and hit points totaling 63, allowing it to withstand considerable damage. Speed is a key strength, with a movement rate of 50 feet, enabling it to close distances quickly or reposition as necessary. The Centaur has exceptional strength and wisdom, which enhances its combat effectiveness and situational awareness, although its intelligence is relatively low. Notable qualities include resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, which can be particularly advantageous in tougher encounters.

The Centaur's ability scores are as follows: its Strength is +4, indicating very good physical capability for melee attacks; Dexterity is +2, which is average and helps in some evasive maneuvers; Constitution is +2, offering good durability; Intelligence is -1, indicating a lack of knowledge; Wisdom is +3, providing good insight and perception; and Charisma is +0, showing an average presence in social situations. The creature's Perception score is 13, enabling it to be fairly aware of its surroundings, while its Stealth score of 12 is considered average for sneaking.

The Centaur has several special abilities. The Monstrosity Resilience allows it to resist effects that cause exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it tougher in prolonged battles. The Trampling Charge ability lets the Centaur knock a creature prone with a successful Pike attack after charging, and if the target falls, it can follow up with a Hooves attack as a bonus action, which is a powerful combination for dealing damage.

In terms of actions, the Centaur can execute a Multiattack, which allows it to either perform one Hooves attack and one Pike attack, or three Longbow attacks in a single turn. The Hooves attack has a +6 to hit and deals 11 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. The Pike, with the same +6 to hit but a reach of 10 feet, deals 9 piercing damage. Additionally, the Centaur can attack from a distance using a Longbow, which has a +4 to hit and delivers 6 piercing damage at ranges up to 150 feet effectively.

As a reaction, the Centaur can use the Defensive Kick ability. This allows it to retaliate when attacked within a 5-foot range. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or pushed away up to 5 feet, showcasing the Centaur's ability to control space in combat while defending itself.

Overall, the Centaur is a robust and agile creature with a mix of melee and ranged attacks, special abilities, and clever defensive tactics that make it a reliable contender in various gameplay scenarios.</detail>
