<summary>The King Fomor is a gargantuan celestial creature that commands immense power and is a formidable adversary for any adventuring party. With a challenge rating of 22, it boasts impressive statistics, including a high Armor Class of 21 and a staggering 656 hit points, making it exceptionally durable and difficult to defeat.

Overall, the King Fomor is a powerful celestial entity that can dominate the battlefield both through physical prowess and magical abilities.</summary>

The King Fomor is immune to radiant damage and damage from nonmagical weapons, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of many attacks. It has truesight out to 120 feet, allowing it to see through illusions and invisibility, and a passive Perception score of 17, making it quite aware of its surroundings. The creature can communicate in Celestial, Common, and four other languages.

Special abilities include:
- Divine Grace: The King Fomor has a remarkable saving throw ability that allows it to take no damage on a success against effects that deal half damage on success, while taking half damage on failure. When wearing medium armor, it adds its full Dexterity bonus to its Armor Class, further enhancing its defensive capabilities.
- Innate Spellcasting: Utilizing Charisma as its spellcasting ability, the King Fomor can cast spells without material components. It has a Spell Save DC of 23, which makes it very difficult for opponents to resist its spells. The spells it can cast include:
  - At will: charm person (attempt to charm a humanoid), command (issue a one-word command), telekinesis (manipulate objects at a distance).
  - Three times a day: flame strike (deals fire and radiant damage in an area), hold monster (paralyze a creature), lightning bolt (deal lightning damage in a line).
  - Once a day: commune (ask questions to a divine entity), greater restoration (heal and remove conditions), heroes' feast (provide bonuses to allies), and plane shift (teleport self only).

For its actions, the King Fomor can perform the following:
- Maul: This melee weapon attack has a +17 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, it deals 38 (8d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) radiant damage. The target must make a DC 25 Strength saving throw; on failure, it is pushed 30 feet away and knocked prone.
- Lightning Bolt: This spell creates a 5-feet-wide, 100-feet-long bolt of lightning. Affected creatures must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on success.
- Flame Strike: This spell creates a column of divine flame with a 10-foot radius and 40 feet in height at a point within 60 feet. Creatures within must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on failure or half damage on success.
- Hold Monster: Targets a creature within 60 feet, requiring it to make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. A failed save results in paralysis for 1 minute, with the target able to repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn.

The King Fomor also possesses several bonus actions:
- Immortal Form: It can switch its physical size between Gargantuan and Medium. While in Medium form, it has disadvantage on Strength checks, but its other statistics remain unchanged.
- Burning Gaze: A line of fire, 5 feet wide and 60 feet long, emanates from its eye. Creatures in the line must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire and radiant damage on failure, or half on success. If the King Fomor is bloodied, this ability shifts to a 60-foot cone.
- Elite Recovery: While bloodied, it can end one negative effect currently affecting it, even while unconscious or incapacitated, as long as it has at least 1 hit point.

Lastly, the King Fomor can utilize legendary actions, allowing it to perform one action at the end of another creature's turn. It can choose to:
- Attack: Make a weapon attack.
- Cast Spell: Cast one of its spells, although it cannot use this option if it has already cast a spell since the start of its last turn.
- Fly: Move up to half its flying speed.
- Shout (Recharge 5-6): A powerful shout that forces each creature within 120 feet that can hear it to make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 24 (7d6) thunder damage and is stunned until the end of the King Fomor’s next turn; on a success, it takes half damage.</detail>
