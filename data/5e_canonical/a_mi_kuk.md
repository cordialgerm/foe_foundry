<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The A-mi-kuk is a large aberration that presents a significant challenge to adventurers due to its unique abilities and resilience in combat. With a chaotic evil alignment, it thrives on creating fear and chaos among its foes. It possesses notable physical strength with a Strength score of 21, which is exceptional, allowing it to perform powerful melee attacks and grapple effectively. Its constitution score of 20 is also very good, providing it with substantial hit points and durability. However, the creature suffers from poor Dexterity, making it less evasive in combat. The A-mi-kuk's unique abilities, like its icy slime and immunity to cold damage, make it a formidable opponent, while its fear of fire can be exploited by clever adventurers. </summary>

<detail>

The A-mi-kuk has an Armor Class of 14, which is good, and it has 115 hit points, derived from rolling 10d12 and adding 50. This high number reflects its ability to endure significant damage. It has a swimming speed of 40 feet, burrowing speed of 20 feet, and walking speed of 30 feet, providing it with good mobility in various terrains. It is classified as a Challenge Rating 7 creature, indicating that it is suitable for a party facing challenges worth 2,900 experience points.

The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength 21 (+5; exceptional), Dexterity 8 (-1; very bad), Constitution 20 (+5; very good), Intelligence 7 (-2; very bad), Wisdom 14 (+2; average), and Charisma 10 (+0; average). Its skill proficiencies include athletics at +10 (very good), perception at +5 (good), and stealth at +2 (average). The A-mi-kuk is immune to cold damage and resistant to acid and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, giving it good defensive capabilities. It is also immune to the paralyzed and restrained conditions. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and tremorsense up to 30 feet, along with a passive Perception score of 15.

The A-mi-kuk has several notable special abilities. First, it can hold its breath for up to 30 minutes, allowing it to navigate underwater environments without risk. Second, it has a fear of fire, which prevents it from moving toward any flames. If it encounters fire or takes fire damage, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn; this can effectively limit its actions in combat. Additionally, its Icy Slime ability means that any creature that touches it or attacks it with a melee weapon within 5 feet takes 7 (2d6) cold damage due to the freezing slime coating its body. Creatures grappled by the A-mi-kuk also take this cold damage at the start of each of their turns.

In terms of offensive actions, the A-mi-kuk can perform a Multiattack, making two separate attacks: one with its bite and one with its grasping claw. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit and does an average of 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage, targeting one creature within 5 feet. Its Grasping Claw, with the same +8 to hit, can reach targets 10 feet away and inflicts an average of 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage while grappling the target. The escape DC for grappling is 16.

If the A-mi-kuk successfully grapples a target, it can use its Strangle ability. The grappled target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On failure, the target takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage, cannot breathe, speak, or cast spells, and begins to suffocate. A successful save means the target takes half damage and is no longer grappled. The A-mi-kuk can maintain this strangle on two Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature at the same time, dealing 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the strangle targets’ turns until the grapple ends. This makes the A-mi-kuk a deadly foe in close quarters, balancing strength and fear-inducing abilities.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath:** The a-mi-kuk can hold its breath for 30 minutes.
- **Fear of Fire:** The a-mi-kuk is afraid of fire, and it won’t move toward any fiery or burning objects. If presented forcefully with a flame, or if it is dealt fire damage, the a-mi-kuk must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn. After it has been frightened by a specific source of fire (such as the burning hands spell), the a-mi-kuk can’t be frightened by that same source again for 24 hours.
- **Icy Slime:** The a-mi-kuk’s body is covered in a layer of greasy, ice-cold slime that grants it the benefits of freedom of movement. In addition, a creature that touches the a-mi-kuk or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) cold damage from the freezing slime. A creature grappled by the a-mi-kuk takes this damage at the start of each of its turns.

- **Grasping Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). The a-mi-kuk has two grasping claws, each of which can grapple only one target at a time.
- **Strangle:** The a-mi-kuk strangles one creature grappled by it. The target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage, can’t breathe, speak, or cast spells, and begins suffocating. On a success, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and is no longer grappled. Until this strangling grapple ends (escape DC 16), the target takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The a-mi-kuk can strangle up to two Medium or smaller targets or one Large target at a time.
