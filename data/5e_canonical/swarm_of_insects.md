<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Swarm of Insects is a buzzing, crawling mass of small creatures such as beetles, ants, or wasps. These swarms overwhelm their prey with sheer numbers, biting and stinging relentlessly. In jungles, forests, or deserts, such swarms can strip vegetation or flesh in moments, leaving little behind. Swarms of Insects are difficult to combat due to their size and ability to move through small spaces. They can be particularly dangerous when provoked, with some swarms carrying venom or disease, adding to the threat they pose to adventurers or wildlife.</summary>
