<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>A Spirit Naga is a serpentine creature with a humanoid head, known for its mastery of necromancy and dark magic. These Nagas are malevolent beings that crave power and often serve as rulers of ancient ruins or hidden temples. Spirit Nagas have a strong connection to the undead, using their magic to command legions of skeletal and ghostly minions. They are skilled spellcasters, capable of casting powerful enchantments, curses, and death magic. Even if slain, Spirit Nagas can resurrect themselves, making them nearly impossible to defeat permanently.</summary>
