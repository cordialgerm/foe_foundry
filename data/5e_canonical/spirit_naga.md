<summary>A Spirit Naga is a serpentine creature with a humanoid head, known for its mastery of necromancy and dark magic. These Nagas are malevolent beings that crave power and often serve as rulers of ancient ruins or hidden temples. Spirit Nagas have a strong connection to the undead, using their magic to command legions of skeletal and ghostly minions. They are skilled spellcasters, capable of casting powerful enchantments, curses, and death magic. Even if slain, Spirit Nagas can resurrect themselves, making them nearly impossible to defeat permanently.</summary>

<summary>The Spirit Naga is a formidable Large Monstrosity known for its potent magical abilities and resilience in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it poses a serious threat to adventurers, boasting an Armor Class of 16 and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 85, derived from 10d10 plus an additional 30 hit points. Its swimming and walking speed of 40 feet each allows it to maneuver effectively in various environments. As a creature steeped in both charm and cunning, the Spirit Naga has the ability to cast spells and can recover from defeat through its unique rejuvenation ability, making it a persistent adversary. However, despite its strengths, it has vulnerabilities rooted in its dependency on spell components and the limited number of spells it can prepare. </summary>

<detail>

The Spirit Naga has solid ability scores: Strength is at 16 with a modifier of +3, Dexterity is also at 16 (+3), Constitution stands at 16 (+3), Intelligence is at 16 (+3), Wisdom sits at 14 (+2), and Charisma measures 16 (+3). Its saving throws are quite effective, with Dexterity and Constitution both receiving a +6 bonus, Wisdom having a +5, and Charisma also at +6. This indicates that the naga is very good at avoiding certain effects, especially those requiring Dexterity or Charisma savings, while having an average performance with Wisdom. Notably, the Spirit Naga is immune to poison damage and the charmed condition, which enhances its survivability in combat situations. It possesses darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, and communicates in Abyssal, Celestial, and Common languages.

The Spirit Naga's special abilities include being amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, and the ability to rejuvenate. If it is killed, it will regenerate in a new body within 1d6 days, regaining full hit points unless a wish spell is used to prevent this. A critical aspect of the Spirit Naga is its spellcasting; it is a 9th-level spellcaster with an Intelligence-based spellcasting ability that has a spell save DC of 14. The spells it has prepared include various options, from cantrips like mage hand and minor illusion to powerful 5th-level spells like dominate person.

When it comes to actions, the Spirit Naga can execute a melee weapon attack with its bite, which has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 10 piercing damage and forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 28 poison damage, while success halves this damage. 

In terms of special attacks, the Spirit Naga can cast Hypnotic Pattern, which creates a visually entrancing pattern within 120 feet, charming all creatures within 10 feet that can see it, on a failed DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. A charmed creature is incapacitated and cannot move for 1 minute, though this effect dissipates if the creature takes damage or is shaken out of the daze. Additionally, the Lightning Bolt spell allows the Naga to unleash a powerful strike of lightning that can hit multiple targets along a 100-foot line, requiring a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw which results in 28 lightning damage on a failure or half on a success. 

Another offensive capability is the Blight spell, which targets a creature or plant within 30 feet, draining its life force for 36 necrotic damage on a failed DC 14 Constitution saving throw (with plants suffering maximum damage and disadvantage on their saves). 

Lastly, the Spirit Naga can respond to attacks with a Shield reaction. If hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, it gains a +5 bonus to its Armor Class and becomes immune to magic missile until the start of its next turn, significantly enhancing its defense for that duration.

The Spirit Naga is a large monstrosity that serves as a powerful and manipulative foe within its environment. It combines potent spellcasting abilities with formidable physical attacks, making it a versatile threat in combat. With an Armor Class of 15, it boasts a decent defense due to its natural armor, while its impressive Hit Points of 166 allow it to withstand significant punishment in battle. The Spirit Naga has a Challenge Rating of 8, indicating that it should pose a serious challenge to a group of adventurers. Its strengths include various magical abilities, excellent mobility, and enhanced damage through its necrotic weapon attacks. However, its relatively low speed and reliance on spells can make it vulnerable if outmaneuvered or if its spells are disrupted.

The Spirit Naga has the following base attributes: Strength of +4 (good), Dexterity of +6 (very good), Constitution of +5 (very good), Intelligence of +3 (average), Wisdom of +5 (very good), and Charisma of +6 (very good). These attributes collectively make it a robust and agile creature, capable of effectively engaging both physically and magically in combat. In terms of senses, it possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark conditions, and has a Perception score of 15, making it adept at noticing details in its surroundings. Its Stealth score of 16 indicates exceptional ability to hide, thereby increasing its threat level. The Spirit Naga can communicate in Abyssal, Celestial, Common, and Infernal languages, showcasing its connection to various magical and otherworldly realms.

The Spirit Naga possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness and survivability. Guardian Projection enables it to create an illusion of its former guardian naga form, providing a versatile option in tactical situations. Monstrosity Resilience grants it a degree of immunity to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it stable in prolonged engagements. Its Necrotic Strikes make its weapon attacks magical and amplify the damage dealt by an additional 4d8 necrotic damage with each successful hit, creating a devastating effect in combat. Lastly, with the Rejuvenation ability, the Spirit Naga can come back to life within 1d6 days after being defeated, posing a long-term challenge unless a wish spell is cast to prevent this.

In terms of actions, the Spirit Naga can make two attacks through its Multiattack option, either using Bite or Spit Poison. If both of its attacks hit the same target, the target must make a Constitution saving throw with a difficulty of 14 to avoid being poisoned for up to one minute. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 6 piercing damage, in addition to poison and necrotic damage totaling 23 damage on a successful hit. The Spit Poison attack is a ranged option with a +6 to hit, affecting targets within a 20-foot range. It deals 10 poison damage plus 18 necrotic damage.

The Spirit Naga also employs spellcasting as a significant aspect of its combat repertoire. It can cast spells that only require verbal components, using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 14. It can cast the following spells at will: command, mage hand, and minor illusion. It can use augury, charm, and sleep three times a day each, allowing it to manipulate allies and foes effectively. Additionally, it can cast bestow curse and hold spells twice per day, increasing its ability to control the battlefield. Once per day, it can cast dominate, significantly impacting a single targetâ€™s actions.

Furthermore, as a bonus action, the Spirit Naga can use Hidden Step to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space in sight and then take the Hide action, enhancing its mobility and ability to evade attacks or reposition strategically. Overall, the Spirit Naga is an adept combatant that uses a combination of physical attacks, necrotic enhancements, and powerful spells to dominate its enemies in battle.</detail>
