<summary>The Balloon Spider is a Medium beast that serves as an ambush predator, utilizing its unique abilities and mobility to control the battlefield effectively. With an unaligned nature, it does not favor any particular side and attacks based purely on opportunity. This creature has a moderate Armor Class of 13, making it somewhat resilient against attacks, and possesses 36 hit points which can absorb a fair amount of damage. Its hovering ability gives it excellent mobility, allowing it to evade ground-based attacks while flying. The challenge rating of 1 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, providing 200 experience points upon defeat. The Balloon Spider excels in delivering lightning damage, but it has a very low intelligence, which limits its strategic capabilities. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Balloon Spider has the following stats: Strength is 10, which is average; Dexterity is 16, providing a good bonus of +3 that enhances its initiative and ranged attacks; Constitution is 10, remaining average; Intelligence is particularly low at 2, resulting in a very bad modifier of -4, reflecting its lack of cleverness; Wisdom is 12, which grants a slightly above average modifier of +1; and Charisma is 4, a very bad score that limits its interactions. The balloon spider's perception skill is notable with a +3 modifier, making it good at noticing potential threats. It has immunity to lightning damage, ensuring it can absorb this type of attack without any detriment. Its senses include blindsight out to 10 feet and darkvision up to 60 feet, in addition to a passive perception of 13. The creature does not speak any languages.

The Balloon Spider has a unique special ability called Erratic Discharge. Creatures that begin their turn within 10 feet of the spider must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they take 2 lightning damage and can either move or take an action, but not both. On a successful save, creatures benefit from the effects of the haste spell, gaining additional speed and actions until the end of their turn. Notably, once a creature successfully saves, it is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.

The Balloon Spider's actions include a bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 5 piercing damage and 5 lightning damage, while also forcing the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in a limitation on movement or action for that turn, similar to the Erratic Discharge effect. 

Another option is the Charged Web ability, which can be used after recharging on a roll of 4 to 6. This ranged weapon attack also has a +5 to hit and a range of 40 feet, grappling the target and lifting them off the ground. The grappled creature takes 1 lightning damage at the start of each of its turns and can attempt to free itself by making a DC 12 Dexterity check.

Finally, the Draw In ability allows the Balloon Spider to magically pull all creatures it has grappled toward itself, up to a distance of 10 feet. If a creature is brought within 5 feet, the spider can make a bite attack against it as a bonus action. This ability allows the spider to maintain aggressive pressure on its opponents while effectively controlling their positioning in combat.</detail>
