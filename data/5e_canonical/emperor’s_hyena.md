<detail>

The Emperor’s Hyena has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 15 (+2), Intelligence 6 (-2), Wisdom 10 (+0), and Charisma 8 (-1). Its Strength and Constitution scores are good, enhancing its physical prowess and durability, while its Dexterity score is average, providing decent agility. Conversely, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are below average, limiting its ability to perform certain cognitive tasks or social interactions. When it comes to saving throws, it has a good Dexterity saving throw bonus of +4. The creature is proficient in perception with a +2 bonus, which can help in detecting hidden characters or threats. Its damage immunities include poison, while it resists cold, necrotic damage, and nonmagical physical attacks with damage resistances. It is completely immune to being charmed, exhausted, or poisoned. The creature has darkvision with a range of 60 feet, granting it the ability to see in low-light conditions, and it understands Common and Darakhul but cannot verbally communicate.

One of the Emperor's Hyena's most effective capabilities is **Pack Tactics**, which grants it advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of that creature. This ability maximizes its offensive potential when working in tandem with other creatures. Another notable ability is **Stench**, which inflicts a debilitating effect on creatures starting their turn within 5 feet of the hyena. They must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of their next turn; a successful save grants immunity to this Stench for 24 hours. Finally, the Emperor's Hyena has **Turning Resistance**, giving it advantage on saving throws against effects meant to turn undead, enhancing its resilience against certain clerical powers.

In terms of actions, the Emperor’s Hyena can perform a **Multiattack**, allowing it to make two bite attacks during its turn. Each bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit deals 6 piercing damage along with an additional 10 necrotic damage, making its attack quite deadly. Additionally, it can unleash **Black Breath** (which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6), expelling a 15-foot cone of noxious black vapor. Creatures in this area that are not undead or constructs must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer 14 necrotic damage, with half damage on a successful save. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature gains one level of exhaustion, creating a significant disadvantage in combat that can last until they complete a short or long rest. This combination of abilities and actions makes the Emperor’s Hyena a threatening opponent capable of altering the dynamics of battle significantly.</detail>
