<CreatureType/>Giant</CreatureType>

<summary>Stone Giants are massive, gray-skinned humanoids who dwell deep in caves and mountainous regions. They are skilled sculptors and stoneworkers, capable of shaping their environment with remarkable precision. Stone Giants prefer to live in isolation, away from the conflicts of the surface world, and view themselves as guardians of the natural stone beneath the earth. Despite their peaceful nature, they are powerful warriors when provoked, hurling boulders with deadly accuracy or crushing foes with their immense strength. Stone Giants are long-lived and often act as keepers of ancient secrets hidden within the mountains.</summary>
