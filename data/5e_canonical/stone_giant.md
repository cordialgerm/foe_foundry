<summary>Stone Giants are massive, gray-skinned humanoids who dwell deep in caves and mountainous regions. They are skilled sculptors and stoneworkers, capable of shaping their environment with remarkable precision. Stone Giants prefer to live in isolation, away from the conflicts of the surface world, and view themselves as guardians of the natural stone beneath the earth. Despite their peaceful nature, they are powerful warriors when provoked, hurling boulders with deadly accuracy or crushing foes with their immense strength. Stone Giants are long-lived and often act as keepers of ancient secrets hidden within the mountains.</summary>

<summary>The Stone Giant is a formidable and imposing creature within the realm of Dungeons & Dragons. As a Huge giant, it stands as a significant threat on the battlefield, boasting a high Armor Class of 17 and substantial Hit Points totaling 126. This makes the Stone Giant a resilient opponent capable of absorbing considerable damage. Its Challenge Rating of 8 indicates that it is suitable for parties facing mid-level challenges. Noteworthy strengths include its exceptional Strength score of 23, allowing it to deal significant melee damage and manipulate foes with relative ease. However, it possesses average Intelligence and Charisma, indicating it may not excel in social interactions or complex strategies requiring cunning. The Stone Giantâ€™s ability to camouflage itself in rocky terrain enhances its stealth capabilities, and it has resistances to acid damage while being immune to petrification, which adds to its survivability.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Stone Giant are as follows: Strength is 23 with a modifier of +6, which is exceptional; Dexterity is 14 with a +2 modifier, considered good; Constitution is 20 with a +5 modifier, also very good; Intelligence stands at 10, which is average; Wisdom is 12 with a +1 modifier, representing average; and Charisma is 10, also average. The Stone Giant's saving throws benefit from these high attributes, as they receive bonuses of +9 to Strength, +5 to Dexterity, +8 to Constitution, and +4 to Wisdom. It showcases skills such as athletics at +9, perception at +4, and stealth at +5, reinforcing its physical prowess and ability to remain undetected in its natural habitat.

In terms of combat abilities, the Stone Giant has access to multiple actions that enhance its threat level. Its special ability, Camouflage, grants it advantage on Stealth checks made in rocky terrains, making it hard to spot when it chooses to conceal itself. During combat, it can utilize the Multiattack action to strike twice either with its greatclub or by throwing rocks at its enemies. The greatclub attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 19 bludgeoning damage, but if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. 

The Rock attack allows the Stone Giant to hurl projectiles with a range of 60 feet, dealing 20 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Similar to the greatclub, if a Large or smaller creature is struck, it must also make a DC 19 Strength saving throw, risking being pushed back and knocked prone. As a unique feature, the Stone Giant can throw a grappling target up to 30 feet, providing both damage and movement manipulation during combat. 

Additionally, the Giant can use a Bonus Action to perform a Grab, allowing one creature within 5 feet to attempt a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being grappled. If they fail, they are grappled, which impedes their actions and gives the Stone Giant advantage on future attacks with its greatclub against that target, increasing its potential damage output.

As a reaction, the Stone Giant possesses the ability called Rock Catching. If a projectile is thrown at it, the Giant can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If successful, it catches the projectile and suffers no damage from it, showcasing its impressive defensive prowess. 

Overall, the Stone Giant presents a blend of raw physical power, survivability, and tactical options, making it a noteworthy adversary capable of providing substantial challenges to adventurers in a campaign.

The Stone Giant is a formidable foe characterized by its immense size and strength. With a challenge rating of 7, it serves as a powerful opponent in combat encounters. Stone Giants possess a high Armor Class of 17 and a substantial hit point pool of 156, making them difficult to defeat in battle. Their natural armor and impressive physical attributes enable them to deal significant damage, with their unarmed strikes and rock attacks being particularly devastating. However, they exhibit some vulnerabilities, particularly to being knocked prone, which can hinder their combat effectiveness. Their strong ability scores, especially in Constitution and Strength, showcase their resilience and physical prowess, making them tough adversaries to face.

The Stone Giant has the following attributes: Strength +6 (exceptional), Dexterity +5 (very good), Constitution +8 (exceptional), Intelligence +0 (average), Wisdom +4 (good), and Charisma -1 (bad). Their notable stats contribute to effective melee attacks and high hit points, allowing them to endure prolonged battles. They have darkvision with a range of 60 feet, a Perception score of 14 (good), and a Stealth score of 15 (good) while taking advantage of rocky environments.

The Stone Giant possesses special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Giant Attributes provide resistance to the stunned condition, making it difficult to incapacitate, though it is vulnerable to being knocked prone. The Stone Camouflage ability allows it to excel in rocky terrain, increasing its stealth capabilities significantly in such environments.

In combat, the Stone Giant can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two melee attacks either with its Stony Fist or with rocks. The Stony Fist attack has a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 24 damage (4d8 + 6) upon a successful hit. Additionally, if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it can be grappled, posing a significant threat. The Rock attack is a ranged weapon attack with a +9 to hit and a range of 60/240 feet, dealing 28 damage (4d10 + 6). If the rock hits a creature, that target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

The Stone Giant also has a bonus action called Wrestle, which allows it to perform different wrestling maneuvers against a creature it is grappling. Options include Armbar, causing disadvantage on attack and escape rolls; Chinlock, which prevents the target from speaking and casting spells; Takedown, knocking a creature prone and restraining them; and Throw, which can throw the target up to 30 feet, dealing additional damage if they hit a solid surface or another creature.

For defense, the Stone Giant features the Missile Deflection reaction, which lets it add 3 to its Armor Class against ranged attacks. If an attack misses its target, the Giant can catch the missile and retaliate by throwing it back at the attacker, using its normal ranged weapon attack bonus and damage.

Overall, the Stone Giant is a well-rounded melee combatant with the ability to control the battlefield. Its unique abilities and high damage potential make it a threat that players must approach carefully.</detail>
