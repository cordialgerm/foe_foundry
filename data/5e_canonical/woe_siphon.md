<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Woe Siphon is a Medium fey creature characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment. It serves as a cunning adversary and manipulator in combat, using its abilities to sap the strength and resolve of its foes while evading direct confrontation. The creature possesses high strength, dexterity, and constitution, making it formidable in physical combat, while its low intelligence and charisma indicate limited social or mental prowess. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers, potentially draining their resources and vitality over the course of a skirmish.</summary>

<detail>

The Woe Siphon has an Armor Class of 14, utilizing natural armor to provide decent protection against attacks. Its 45 hit points, derived from rolling 6d8 plus an additional 18, give it average durability in combat. The creature moves at a speed of 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively on the battlefield. 

Its attribute scores are as follows: 
- Strength: 18 (+4), which is exceptional, enabling powerful melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 17 (+3), offering a good boost to its agility and armor class.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), contributing to its good resilience.
- Intelligence: 5 (-3), resulting in very bad mental capabilities.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), providing an average perception of the world.
- Charisma: 7 (-2), indicating poor social skills.

The Woe Siphon is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks unless made with silvered weapons. It is also immune to being charmed, frightened, or exhausted, granting it a strong presence in psychological warfare. Additionally, it has darkvision that extends up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness and dim light as if it were bright light, and it possesses a passive perception of 11, which falls under average.

The Woe Siphon can communicate in Common and Sylvan. One of its unique abilities, Detect Sentience, allows it to sense the presence of creatures with an Intelligence of 5 or higher within a mile, giving it a strategic advantage in identifying threats before they are visibly present.

In combat, the Woe Siphon employs a melee attack called Siphoning Fist, where it makes a weapon attack with a +6 modifier, striking a target at a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit deals 7 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 5 psychic damage, which can significantly impact the target’s hit point maximum if they fail a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. The consequences of this ability are severe, as it not only heals the Woe Siphon by the amount of hit point reduction inflicted on the target, but it can also ultimately lead to the target's death if the maximum hit points drop to zero.

The Woe Siphon can also unleash a psychological attack known as Cause Despair. This ability targets a single creature within 60 feet that must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or suffer intense feelings of inadequacy for one minute. While affected, the creature attacks at a disadvantage and struggles with ability checks. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns to shake off the effect, but if they succeed, they become immune to this specific effect for the next 24 hours.

Lastly, the Woe Siphon possesses the ability to turn invisible until it attacks or until its concentration on the effect ends. This power not only allows it to avoid direct confrontations but also makes its attacks more strategic, as any equipment it carries or wears remains invisible alongside it. Overall, the Woe Siphon's combination of strengths, strategic abilities, and inherent resistances makes it a formidable foe in any encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Detect Sentience:** The woe siphon can magically sense the presence of creatures with an Intelligence of 5 or higher up to 1 mile away. It knows the general direction to the creatures but not their exact locations.

### Actions

- **Siphoning Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) psychic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the psychic damage taken. The woe siphon regains hp equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Cause Despair:** The woe siphon can overwhelm a creature with intense feelings of inadequacy. One creature the woe siphon can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. A creature overwhelmed with despair has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this woe siphon’s Cause Despair for the next 24 hours.
- **Invisibility:** The woe siphon magically turns invisible until it attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the woe siphon wears or carries is invisible with it.
