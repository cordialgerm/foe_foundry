### Special Abilities

- **Blood Sense:** The risen reaver can pinpoint the location of creatures that aren’t Constructs or Undead within 60 feet of it and can sense the general direction of such creatures within 1 mile of it.
- **Undead Nature:** The risen reaver doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The risen reaver makes three Bladed Fist attacks.
- **Bladed Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Skitter:** The risen reaver takes the Dash action.

### Reactions

- **Infused Arsenal:** When the risen reaver is hit with a nonmagical melee weapon or when it starts its turn in the same space as a nonmagical melee weapon that isn’t being worn or carried, it absorbs the weapon into its body. If the weapon is being wielded by an attacker, the attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or lose its weapon. For 1 minute, the reaver has resistance to the type of damage dealt by that weapon, and when it hits with its Bladed Fist, the fist deals an extra 2 (1d4) damage of the type dealt by the weapon. The reaver can absorb no more than three weapons in this way every 24 hours.
