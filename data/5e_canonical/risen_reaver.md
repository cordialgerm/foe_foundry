With a high armor class and a significant pool of hit points, it can withstand considerable damage while delivering powerful melee attacks.

The Risen Reaver is not only resilient but also possesses a unique ability to absorb nonmagical melee weapons, enhancing its combat capabilities.

<detail>

The Risen Reaver has an armor class of 15, thanks to its studded leather armor, providing it with good protection against physical attacks. It has hit points totaling 168, which is quite substantial, allowing it to endure a significant amount of damage during encounters. Its movement speed is 40 feet, enabling it to close the gap to its enemies quickly. The creature has a challenge rating of 7, indicating that it is a strong opponent worthy of a reward of 2,900 experience points for defeating it.

In terms of attributes, the Risen Reaver has a strength score of 19, which translates to a +4 modifier, indicating very good physical prowess. Its dexterity of 16 gives it a +3 modifier, making it agile and capable of dodging attacks effectively. With a constitution score of 20 (+5), it showcases exceptional durability. However, its intelligence (-1), wisdom (-2), and charisma (-2) scores are quite low, averaging out to bad; these weaknesses mean it is not adept in social interactions or mental challenges.

The Risen Reaver's saving throw bonuses include a +6 modifier for dexterity, indicating good resilience against effects that target this attribute. In skills, it has proficiency in perception with a +1 bonus, which is average, and possesses darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 120 feet, giving it exceptional sight in low-light conditions. It retains the languages it knew in life, allowing for potential interactions with other undead or creatures aware of its past.

The Risen Reaver's special abilities include Blood Sense, enabling it to detect the presence of living creatures within 60 feet and sense their direction up to 1 mile away, making it a formidable tracker. Another notable ability, Undead Nature, gives it the advantage of not needing air, food, drink, or sleep, granting it a relentless nature in pursuit of its targets.

In combat, the Risen Reaver can engage in a Multiattack, allowing it to make three melee attacks with its Bladed Fist. When it performs a Bladed Fist attack, it rolls a melee attack with a +7 to hit, which is good, and if successful, it deals 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage to a single target. 

As a bonus action, it can utilize Skitter, allowing it to take the Dash action to close distances rapidly. This mobility enhances its threat level in combat scenarios by allowing it to pursue or retreat effectively.

In reaction to being hit with a nonmagical melee weapon, the Risen Reaver can activate Infused Arsenal. When this ability is triggered, it absorbs the weapon into its body, forcing the attacker to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw to prevent losing their weapon. For one minute, the reaver gains resistance to the damage type of the absorbed weapon and can deal an additional 2 (1d4) damage of that type with its Bladed Fist attacks. This ability enables it to adapt to its opponent’s attacks, further solidifying its threat in melee combat, although it can only absorb three weapons in a 24-hour period.</detail>
