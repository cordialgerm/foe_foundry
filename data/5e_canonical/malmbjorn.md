<summary>The Malmbjorn is a huge monstrosity that operates outside of any alignment, making it unpredictable in its behaviors. With an impressive armor class of 18 due to its natural armor and a significant pool of hit points totaling 218, the Malmbjorn is a durable opponent on the battlefield, capable of withstanding substantial damage. It boasts high strength (24) and good constitution (20), making it exceptionally effective in melee combat, while its intelligence is very low (3), limiting its capacity for complex strategies. The creature is noted for its unique abilities, including its keen sense of smell and ability to burrow through solid rock, which contribute to its effectiveness as a predator. However, it has vulnerabilities, particularly to acid damage, and it is immune to cold damage, although it only resists nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. </summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Malmbjorn are primarily focused on physical prowess, with a strength modifier that provides exceptional combat effectiveness, while its dexterity and wisdom modifiers are average and good, respectively. The Malmbjorn has saving throw bonuses of +1 in Constitution and +6 in Wisdom, which are average and good, respectively. Its perception skill is basic, with a score of +1, indicating limited awareness in certain situations. 

The Malmbjorn has several special abilities that enhance its capabilities in encounters. Its Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to smell, helping it detect threats or prey nearby. With its Metal Sense, it can pinpoint the location of ferrous metals within a 100-foot radius and sense their general direction up to one mile away, making it highly aware of metal weapons or armor carried by foes. The Tunneler ability allows it to burrow through rock at half its burrow speed, leaving behind a large tunnel, creating opportunities for ambush or escape.

In combat, the Malmbjorn can utilize powerful attacks through its Multiattack action, which allows it to make one Bite attack and two Adamantine Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +12 to hit and deals significant piercing damage (34 on average, or 5d10+7) while also grappling targets, restricting their actions. The Adamantine Claw attack also has a +12 to hit, deals slashing damage (29 on average, or 5d8+7), and is especially devastating against objects and structures, doing double damage. Additionally, the Malmbjorn can unleash a Metal Volley (Recharge 5-6) that causes slashing damage (45 on average, or 13d6) to all creatures within a 20-foot radius, providing a sweeping area attack.

In terms of bonus actions, the Malmbjorn can use Metal Eater to swallow ferrous metal objects, putting pressure on opponents who rely on metal weapons. If a creature is grappled, it faces a disadvantage on the saving throw required to prevent the Malmbjorn from swallowing their equipment. Nonmagical items are destroyed, while magical items survive for a limited period before being digested. 

Lastly, the Ironhide reaction enhances the Malmbjorn's defenses when hit by metal weapons, temporarily increasing its armor class by 2 and converting critical hits against it into normal hits, making it more resilient during combat.</detail>
