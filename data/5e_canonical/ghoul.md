<summary>A Ghoul is a ravenous, undead creature driven by an insatiable hunger for the flesh of the living. Its gaunt, decayed body moves with unnatural speed, and its long, clawed hands are capable of paralyzing those it strikes. Ghouls are often found in graveyards or crypts, feasting on the bodies of the dead, but they prefer fresh meat when they can find it. Though mindless and savage, ghouls retain a basic cunning, using their speed and numbers to overwhelm their prey. They are often created through dark magic or as a result of a cursed existence, forever trapped in their hunger.</summary>

<summary>The ghoul is a medium-sized undead creature often prowling graveyards and dark places, drawn to the scent of the living. Its primary role in combat is that of a stealthy ambusher capable of incapacitating enemies with its paralyzing claw attack. With a decent agility score, the ghoul is good at dodging attacks but is relatively fragile with an armor class of only 12 and a modest pool of 22 hit points. The ghoul is immune to poison damage and resistant to necrotic damage, making it resilient against certain types of attacks. Its unique abilities include a weakness to radiant damage, which hampers its offensive capabilities, and its undead nature allows it to operate without the need for air or sleep.</summary>

<detail>

The ghoul has the following attributes: Strength of 12 (+1), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 10 (+0), Intelligence of 6 (-2), Wisdom of 10 (+0), and Charisma of 6 (-2). Its physical and mental abilities reflect its nature as an undead predator rather than a sophisticated being. The Dexterity score is good, making it capable of dodging attacks effectively, while the low Intelligence and Charisma scores are very bad, indicating poor mental acuity and the inability to influence through personality. 

Regarding skills, the ghoul has darkvision, allowing it to see in dim light within a 60-foot radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, although it cannot discern color in darkness. It has a passive Perception score of 10, which is average for detecting hidden enemies or objects. Ghouls cannot be charmed or paralyzed, they are immune to fatigue and poison conditions.

The ghoul possesses a special ability known as Radiant Sensitivity. When this creature suffers radiant damage, it suffers from disadvantage on attack rolls and Perception checks that rely on sight until the end of its next turn. This makes it cautious when facing opponents who wield radiant magic or weapons.

In terms of attacks, the ghoul has two primary actions: the Paralyzing Claw and the Bite. The Paralyzing Claw attack has a +4 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 5 slashing damage. If this attack hits a living creature that is not an elf, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in the target becoming paralyzed for one minute, which can be devastating in combat as it renders the target unable to act. While paralyzed, the creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, but success makes it immune to this effect for 24 hours. The Bite attack similarly has a +4 to hit and also has a reach of 5 feet, targeting incapacitated creatures. It deals more damage than the claw, averaging 6 piercing damage. 

Overall, while the ghoul has the potential for stealth and incapacitation, its weaknesses to radiant damage and relatively low survivability mean that it often relies on surprise and ambush tactics to overwhelm its foes.

The ghoul is a Medium undead creature known for its eerie presence and insatiable hunger for raw meat. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to unprepared adventurers. While it has some resilience granted by its undead nature, its combat abilities, particularly its paralyzing claws, make it a serious adversary in melee range. However, its relatively low hit points and lack of advanced intelligence could serve as weaknesses that players may exploit. Ghouls are adept climbers, with the ability to scale difficult surfaces and walk on ceilings, enhancing their tactical position in combat scenarios. 

The ghoul has an Armor Class of 13, which is average for its challenge rating, and it possesses 34 hit points, making it moderately durable. It has a speed of 30 feet and the unique ability to climb at the same speed. Its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are as follows: Strength +0 (average), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence -2 (very bad), Wisdom +2 (good), and Charisma -2 (very bad). With a Dexterity score of +3, the ghoul has an exceptional Stealth modifier of 14, allowing it to effectively hide and ambush unwary foes. Its Perception score of 12 provides an average ability to notice hidden threats, while its darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet.

One notable special ability is "Hungry Dead Nature," which means the ghoul does not require air or sleep but must consume 2 pounds of raw meat daily. Failure to do so leads to exhaustion and the risk of starvation, making it imperative for the creature to feed regularly. "Spider Climb" enables the ghoul to navigate difficult surfaces effortlessly, enhancing its mobility during encounters. The "Undead Resilience" ability grants the ghoul immunity to poison damage and exhaustion, as well as protection from the poisoned condition, making it a resilient opponent.

In combat, the ghoul can perform "Multiattack," allowing it to make one Bite attack and one Claws attack during its turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that yields a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and deals 7 piercing damage. The Claws attack, also a melee weapon attack, applies the same to hit bonus, but it deals 8 slashing damage. If both attacks strike a target that is neither a Construct nor Undead, the victim must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or they will contract "ghoul hunger," which has further implications for the character involved. Additionally, if the target is hit by the Claws attack, they must make the same Constitution save or become paralyzed for 1 minute, an effect that can greatly shift the balance of combat. The target can attempt to resist the paralysis at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on success.

Overall, the ghoul is a formidable foe in ambush situations or challenging terrains, capable of debilitating its enemies through clever use of its abilities and attacks.</detail>
