<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Basilisk is a large, reptilian creature with eight legs and a thick, scaly hide. Its most fearsome ability, however, is its deadly gaze, which can turn creatures to stone with a single look. Basilisks typically live in dark caves or ruins, where they can stalk their prey and ambush unsuspecting victims. Though slow and lumbering, their petrifying gaze makes them incredibly dangerous, and many an adventurer has been turned into a stone statue before even realizing they were being hunted. Basilisks are solitary hunters and tend to hoard treasures left behind by their petrified victims.</summary>

<summary>The Basilisk is a medium-sized monstrosity known for its deadly gaze, which can petrify creatures with a mere look. With decent defenses due to its armor class of 15 and a good allotment of hit points totaling 52, it is capable of withstanding several attacks. As a Challenge Rating 3 creature, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, offering 700 experience points upon defeat. Its primary strengths lie in its unique abilities, particularly its Stone Gaze, which can immobilize enemies, making it an effective ambush predator. However, it has a low Dexterity score, making it vulnerable to ranged attacks. While it possesses a formidable bite attack augmented with poison damage, it is primarily reliant on its gaze to control the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Basilisk has the following ability scores: Strength at 14 (+2), which is good for physical attacks; Dexterity at 8 (-1), which is very bad and reflects its clumsiness; Constitution at 16 (+3), indicating good resilience; Intelligence at 2 (-4), marking it as very bad in terms of mental capabilities; Wisdom at 10 (+0), which is average; and Charisma at 8 (-1), also very bad. Its skills are undeclared, and it has darkvision up to 30 feet along with a passive Perception score of 10, allowing it to perceive its surroundings reasonably, though not exceptionally well.

The actions available to the Basilisk include Stone Gaze and Venomous Bite. The Stone Gaze function allows the basilisk to target a creature within 60 feet, compelling that creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails, it begins to turn to stone and becomes restrained. At the beginning of the basilisk's next turn, the restrained target can attempt to save again. If it fails subsequent checks, it becomes fully petrified, which requires greater restoration or basilisk venom to reverse. This ability can dramatically shift the dynamics of combat, potentially removing characters from the fight entirely.

The Venomous Bite is a melee weapon attack that allows the basilisk to strike at a target within a 5-foot reach. The basilisk rolls a +4 to hit, and on a successful strike, it deals 6 piercing damage along with an additional 10 poison damage, totaling up to 16 damage on a successful hit. This blend of physical and poison damage means that it can threaten both robust and weaker foes alike.

In terms of reactions, the Basilisk has Stone Glance, which triggers when it sees a creature within 60 feet that successfully hits it with an attack. In response, the basilisk can use its Stone Gaze ability against the attacker, emphasizing its defensive strategy of punishing those who dare to strike it. Overall, the Basilisk is a formidable foe that utilizes a combination of petrifying gaze and venomous bite to deter adventurers and control the battlefield effectively.

The Basilisk is a medium-sized monstrosity, known for its terrifying ability to petrify its foes with its gaze. This creature poses a significant threat in combat due to its ability to deal considerable poison damage and its petrifying capabilities, making it a formidable opponent for adventurers. With an Armor Class of 15, it has a decent defensive capacity, while its 68 hit points provide it with a moderate level of durability for a creature of its challenge rating of 3. However, its speed is quite slow at only 20 feet per round, which can limit its mobility in battles. Overall, the Basilisk is a dangerous adversary, particularly when engaged in close quarters where it can utilize its special abilities and attacks effectively.  

In terms of attributes, the Basilisk has a Strength score of 13, granting it a good modifier of +3, which reflects its physical power. Its Dexterity is notably lower at 9, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, meaning it is not particularly agile. The Constitution score of 14 gives it a good modifier of +2, enhancing its ability to withstand damage. However, the creature has very poor scores in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, with modifiers of -4, -1, and -2 respectively, making it ineffective in skill checks that rely on these attributes. The Basilisk has darkvision that allows it to see in low-light conditions up to 60 feet, but its perception and stealth scores are mediocre, both sitting at a modest value of 9.

The Basilisk has special abilities that enhance its survivability in combat. Its Monstrosity Resilience grants it resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it harder to incapacitate. The Petrifying Gaze is its most dangerous ability, allowing it to target creatures within 30 feet. If a creature can see the Basilisk's eyes, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become restrained as it begins to turn to stone. It can attempt to escape this petrification by repeating the saving throw at the end of its turn, but failure results in it becoming fully petrified until released by the spell greater restoration or other magic.

The Basilisk can employ actions during combat, including a Multiattack option, where it can make two Bite or Poison Spit attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and causes 7 piercing damage along with 7 poison damage on a hit. The Poison Spit is a ranged weapon attack with the same +5 to hit, effective at a range of 20 feet normal and 60 feet at disadvantage, and deals 13 poison damage. If both attacks successfully hit a single target, that creature is poisoned until the end of its next turn, adding to the Basilisk's threat level.</detail>

**Petrifying Gaze**. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the *greater restoration* spell or other magic.

A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.
