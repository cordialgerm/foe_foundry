<MonsterName/>Swarm of Poisonous Snakes</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Swarm of Poisonous Snakes is a writhing mass of serpents, each capable of delivering venomous bites that can paralyze or kill their prey. These swarms are often found in jungles, swamps, or dark caves, where they lurk in hiding until disturbed. When they attack, the snakes strike quickly and repeatedly, overwhelming their enemies with venomous fangs. Though small individually, the combined effort of a swarm makes them a deadly threat, particularly when their venom causes pain, paralysis, or death. Their coordinated movements make it difficult to escape once they begin to strike.</summary>

<summary>The Swarm of Poisonous Snakes is a Medium beast that presents a formidable challenge in combat due to its ability to occupy the same space as other creatures and its significant damage output with a combination of piercing and poison damage. With an Armor Class of 14 and 45 hit points, it offers decent durability for its Challenge Rating of 2. However, its low strength and intelligence limit its capabilities outside of combat. The swarm is exceptionally agile, boasting a Dexterity score of 18, which translates to a +4 modifier, making its attack capabilities very good. It is effective in ambush scenarios, thanks to its ability to move through tight spaces and strike unsuspicious targets. Despite its strengths, it is vulnerable to area effects due to its nature as a swarm and lacks any defensive spells or abilities to heal itself.</summary>

<detail>

The Swarm of Poisonous Snakes has the following attributes: Strength 8 (-1, very bad), Dexterity 18 (+4, very good), Constitution 10 (+0, average), Intelligence 1 (-5, very bad), Wisdom 10 (+0, average), and Charisma 4 (-3, very bad). The swarm is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, granting it additional survivability against physical attacks. It is immune to a plethora of conditions including charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, stunned, and unconscious, making it exceptionally difficult to control in combat.

The swarm features a special ability called Swarm, allowing it to occupy another creature's space and move through any opening suitable for a Tiny creature. This ability reinforces its combat strategy, as it can swarm over and attack larger foes without restriction. However, the swarm cannot gain hit points or temporary hit points, meaning it must rely on its initial health pool.

In combat, the Swarm of Poisonous Snakes can use the Bites action. This melee weapon attack rolls at +6 to hit with a reach of 0 feet, indicating it must be right next to its target. When it successfully bites, it inflicts 7 piercing damage (2d6) along with an additional 14 poison damage (4d6), which can incapacitate targets quickly. If the swarm is bloodied (reduced to half or less hit points), it inflicts a lower amount of poison damage, dealing 3 poison damage (1d6) plus the original 7 piercing damage, which shows a slight reduction in its potency but remains a serious threat. 

Overall, the Swarm of Poisonous Snakes can be a dangerous adversary in the right context, especially when it ambushes unsuspecting adventurers. Its unique mechanics as a swarm creature and its poison attacks make it a noteworthy encounter in a variety of situations.</detail>
