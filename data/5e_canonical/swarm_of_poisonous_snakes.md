<MonsterName/>Swarm of Poisonous Snakes</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Swarm of Poisonous Snakes is a writhing mass of serpents, each capable of delivering venomous bites that can paralyze or kill their prey. These swarms are often found in jungles, swamps, or dark caves, where they lurk in hiding until disturbed. When they attack, the snakes strike quickly and repeatedly, overwhelming their enemies with venomous fangs. Though small individually, the combined effort of a swarm makes them a deadly threat, particularly when their venom causes pain, paralysis, or death. Their coordinated movements make it difficult to escape once they begin to strike.</summary>
