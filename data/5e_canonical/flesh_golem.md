<summary>A Flesh Golem is a monstrous construct created from the stitched-together body parts of dead creatures, animated through dark magic. Its appearance is gruesome, with mismatched limbs and a face twisted in a permanent grimace of pain. Flesh Golems are incredibly strong and resilient, able to withstand immense punishment without faltering. However, they are often unpredictable, as the magic that binds them is unstable, and they may go berserk when damaged. Despite their horrific appearance, Flesh Golems are mindless servants, following the commands of their creators without question.</summary>

<summary>The Flesh Golem is a medium-sized construct and a formidable presence in any encounter, characterized by its resilience and physical power. With an Armor Class of 9 and a substantial pool of 129 hit points, it can absorb a considerable amount of damage. Its Challenge Rating of 5 indicates that it poses a moderate to high threat level to adventurers. The golem is particularly strong against nonmagical attacks; it is immune to various conditions including exhaustion, charm, and fear, which allows it to remain a relentless adversary. However, it does have weaknesses, such as a low Armor Class and a vulnerability to fire damage, which can temporarily impair its effectiveness in combat.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Flesh Golem has a Strength score of 18, resulting in a +4 modifier, which indicates very good physical prowess. Its Constitution score of 18 also grants a +4 modifier, providing it exceptional durability. However, its Dexterity is low at 9, giving it a -1 modifier, which is considered bad. Other attributes like Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are not significant in combat, with respective modifiers of -2, 0, and -3 reflecting poor to average utility in non-physical roles.

The Flesh Golem possesses several noteworthy special abilities. Its Aversion of Fire ability causes it to lose immunity to fear and imposes disadvantage on its attack rolls when it receives fire damage, making fire a strategic weakness. The Berserk ability activates when its hit points drop to 55 or fewer, compelling it to lash out violently against all creatures nearby, which can escalate encounters unpredictably. The Golem's Construct Nature means it does not require essential needs like air or sleep, allowing it to remain active indefinitely. Its Flesh Golem Resilience grants it immunity to poison damage and nonmagical physical attacks, while Immutable Form protects it from spells that would change its physical shape. The Lightning Absorption ability allows it to regain health from lightning damage, turning an enemy's attack into a boon. Additionally, its Magic Resistance provides advantage on saving throws against spells, enhancing its defenses further. Notably, all of its weapon attacks are magical, making them effective against creatures that are resistant or immune to nonmagical attacks.

In combat, the Flesh Golem can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Slam attacks. Each Slam has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 17 (3d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. The creator's anguish ability, which can be used once every five to six turns, unleashes a wave of psychic energy that requires creatures within 15 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail take 31 (9d6) psychic damage and become incapacitated, suffering a significant mental blow, while successful saves result in half damage without the incapacity effect, adding a layer of psychological warfare to its tactical approach. 

Overall, the Flesh Golem is a powerful combatant that benefits from its high resilience and unique abilities, making it a challenging foe for adventurers. Its predictable weaknesses can be exploited by strategic play, especially around its vulnerability to fire.</detail>
