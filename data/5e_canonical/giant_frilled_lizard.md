The Giant Frilled Lizard has a unique special ability called "Intimidating Charge."

Additionally, the target it charges at must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. If the target fails, they become frightened for 1d6 rounds. The frightened condition causes the creature to have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to potentially end the fear effect.

In combat, the Giant Frilled Lizard can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make one bite attack and one tail attack in a single turn.
