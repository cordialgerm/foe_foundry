<detail>

The Virtuoso Lich has the following attributes, with abilities reflecting its complex nature: Strength 11 (average), Dexterity 16 (good), Constitution 15 (average), Intelligence 15 (average), Wisdom 12 (average), and Charisma 20 (exceptional). When it comes to saving throws, it excels in Dexterity (+7), Wisdom (+6), and Charisma (+9), indicating very good resilience against specific challenges. In terms of skills, it has high proficiency in Deception (+9), Persuasion (+9), and a moderate proficiency in Perception (+5). The creature has immunities to poison damage, conditions including blinded, charmed, and paralyzed, and advantages against effects that would turn undead. With a notable truesight range of 60 feet and spoken command of several languages, it can easily manipulate and deceive opponents.

The Virtuoso Lich possesses several special abilities that enhance its capabilities in combat and beyond. Legendary Resistance allows it to succeed in saving throws it would otherwise fail, with three uses per day, adding a layer of durability. The Rejuvenation ability specifies that if the lich is destroyed but still has its phylactery intact, it can reconstitute itself within 1d10 days. This makes it exceptionally difficult to permanently defeat the creature without addressing its phylactery. Additionally, the lich has Turn Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, further enhancing its survivability.

A defining trait of the Virtuoso Lich is its Versatile Artist ability. At the end of each long rest, the lich chooses a form of artistic expression—such as song or paint—that grants it immunity to a specific damage type associated with that art. However, this ability cannot grant immunity to force, psychic, or radiant damage, which limits its flexibility to avoid some powerful attacks.

In terms of combat, the Virtuoso Lich is a 12th-level spellcaster whose spellcasting is centered around Charisma, with a spell save DC of 17 and a +9 modifier to hit with spell attacks. It has a wide array of bard spells prepared, including cantrips like Mage Hand and Vicious Mockery, which allow for both utility and damage dealing. Its first-level spells, such as Bane and Thunderwave, can disrupt foes and control the battlefield, while higher-level spells like Dominate Person and Confusion provide additional ways to manipulate or incapacitate enemies.

The Virtuoso Lich can use Multiattack to unleash its Corrupted Art and make two Artistic Flourish melee spell attacks. The Artistic Flourish is a powerful attack that deals 12 damage of a type chosen based on its Versatile Artist trait, with an attack bonus of +9. The Corrupted Art action affects creatures based on their undead status; for non-undead targets, it deals necrotic damage contingent on a failed Constitution saving throw, while for undead creatures, it allows for healing instead, making it a powerful tool for both offense and support. 

The Call Muse ability allows the lich to charm a humanoid or beast near it, incapacitating them as they become enthralled by the lich's artistry. This effect can significantly control the battlefield by neutralizing threats. Moreover, the lich possesses three legendary actions, which include making an additional Artistic Flourish attack, moving without provoking opportunity attacks, or casting a prepared spell. The Unrestrained Art legendary action releases a wave of damage around the lich, forcing nearby creatures to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking damage and becoming prone, which can alter the tide of battle in its favor. Overall, the Virtuoso Lich combines spellcasting with unique abilities to create a complex and dangerous opponent in any encounter.

The Virtuoso Lich is a powerful Medium undead creature that serves as a formidable foe in any campaign. With a Challenge Rating of 12, it presents a significant challenge, showcasing a blend of potent magical abilities and unique artistic powers. The lich's strengths lie in its formidable armor class of 17 and impressive hit points totaling 185, making it difficult to defeat in combat. Its high Dexterity allows it to be quite stealthy, while its Charisma of +9 alongside other ability scores enhances its effectiveness in spellcasting and charm abilities. The Virtuoso Lich's ability to heal others, manipulate foes with its artistic expressions, and its legendary resistances highlight its complexity and danger. However, it is not without weaknesses; while it can regenerate from its phylactery, reliance on this aspect allows for strategic planning to prevent its return.

In terms of attributes, the Virtuoso Lich has the following values: Strength 10 (average), Dexterity 20 (+7, exceptional), Constitution 14 (+2, average), Intelligence 14 (+2, average), Wisdom 20 (+5, very good), and Charisma 24 (+9, exceptional). The creature has a base speed of 30 feet and possesses truesight for 60 feet, enabling it to see through illusions and darkness. The lich's stealth score is 17, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting characters effectively.

The Virtuoso Lich possesses several special abilities that enhance its resilience and offensive capabilities. Legendary Resistance allows it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw three times a day, making it hard to control or incapacitate. Rejuvenation indicates that if its phylactery exists, it will return to life within 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points. Turn Resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause it to turn as an undead. The lich's Undead Nature means it does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, and Undead Resilience provides immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition. Its unique Versatile Artist ability allows it to choose a form of artistic expression each long rest, granting immunity to a specific damage type associated with that art, which gives it strategic defensive options.

In combat, the Virtuoso Lich can perform a Multiattack, which consists of using Corrupted Art followed by making three attacks with Artistic Flourish. The Artistic Flourish can be a melee or ranged spell attack that hits with a +9 bonus and deals 18 (3d8 + 5) damage alongside additional force damage. If the target is non-undead, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, failing which may blind, charm, or deafen it until the end of the next turn. If the target is undead, it regains 18 hit points, which can exceed its maximum and translate into temporary hit points. The Corrupted Art action allows the lich to target a creature within 60 feet, invoking a similar save as the Artistic Flourish.

The lich can also utilize its Call Muse ability to charm a creature within 30 feet, rendering it incapacitated as it becomes entranced by the lich's artistic expression. While under the effect, the target can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to attempt to break free but suffers the consequences if harmed by the lich. Spellcasting capabilities include an arsenal of spells, such as disguise self, mage hand, and prestidigitation for utility, alongside potent spells like charm, fear, and dimension door for tactical advantage in combat.

Additionally, the Virtuoso Lich has legendary actions that it can use to further influence the battlefield. It can repeat its Call Muse ability, move without provoking attacks, cast spells for an immediate surprise, or unleash its Unrestrained Art, which targets creatures around it to possibly knock them prone if they fail a Dexterity saving throw.

In conclusion, the Virtuoso Lich is an undead menace that combines artistic flair with deadly intent. Its diverse abilities and spells enable it to manipulate the battlefield, heal allies, and incapacitate foes, making it a memorable adversary in any adventure.</detail>
