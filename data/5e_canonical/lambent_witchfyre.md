<MonsterName/>Lambent Witchfyre</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Lambent Witchfyre is a large aberration that exists with an unaligned nature. It stands out in combat due to its unique fire-based abilities, making it a formidable opponent against enemies lacking fire resistance or immunity. With a respectable challenge rating of 7, it has significant hit points totaling 110, supported by its high Constitution, which offers good survivability. While it lacks intelligence and charisma, rendering it somewhat socially inept, its Dexterity grants it good agility, allowing for effective attacks. However, its Wisdom is average, indicating it won't easily perceive danger. The Witchfyre's main strengths lie in its immunities to fire and poison, as well as its ability to regain health through fire damage, making it especially difficult to take down if opponents are unprepared for its flame-based mechanics.</summary>

<detail>

The Lambent Witchfyre has an Armor Class of 15, appropriate for its size and nature, and it can move at a speed of 20 feet. Its Strength score is 10, which is average and does not contribute to its combat prowess. The Dexterity score of 16 provides a good +3 modifier, enhancing its ability to evade attacks and perform agile maneuvers. The Constitution score is 17, also yielding a +3 modifier, which contributes significantly to its hit points and resilience in battle. However, its Intelligence score is notably low at 2, resulting in a -4 modifier, indicating poor reasoning and problem-solving skills. The Witchfyre has a Wisdom of 11, giving it an average +0 modifier in perception, and a Charisma score of 1, which is very poor at -5, meaning it has almost no social influence.

The Lambent Witchfyre has several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Fire Absorption allows it to regain hit points when subjected to fire damage, making it immune to such attacks. This gives it an exceptional ability to sustain itself in battle, as opponents who use fire attacks inadvertently heal the creature. Fire Form allows it to squeeze through tight spaces without hindrance and inflicts fire damage to creatures that make contact with it or enter its space. This damage can also cause targets to catch fire, leading to additional ongoing damage until they are extinguished. The Illumination ability allows the Lambent Witchfyre to shed light, which can be advantageous in dark environments.

In combat, the Lambent Witchfyre can utilize its Multiattack feature to make three melee attacks. Each attack is a Blazing Touch that has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit results in 13 fire damage, and if the target is a creature or flammable object, it ignites, dealing extra fire damage each turn until extinguished. If it slays a target with this attack, it heals for the amount of damage done, adding to its sustainability. Once a creature is slain by this attack, it is transformed to ash along with any non-magical items it possessed, making resurrection extremely difficult without powerful magic. 

Overall, the Lambent Witchfyre's combination of immunities, regenerating abilities, and areas of effect damage with fire make it a dangerous adversary that requires strategic planning to overcome.</detail>
