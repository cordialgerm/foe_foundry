The Spymaster has the following attributes: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 16 (+3, very good), Constitution 14 (+2, good), Intelligence 12 (+1, average), Wisdom 12 (+1, average), and Charisma 12 (+1, average). It possesses saving throws in Dexterity (+6, very good), Intelligence (+4, good), and Wisdom (+4, good), showcasing its resilience against physical and mental challenges. Its skills include Acrobatics (+6, very good), Deception (+4, good), Perception (+4, good), and Stealth (+6, very good), emphasizing its stealthy nature and competence in trickery. The Spymaster can see in darkness up to 30 feet thanks to darkvision and has blindsight to detect creatures within a 10-foot range, enhancing its effectiveness in unseen operations. It can communicate in any two languages, enabling effective interaction and deception.

The Spymaster's special abilities enhance its combat techniques significantly. The Assassinate ability grants this creature advantage on attack rolls against any target that has not yet acted in combat, which can lead to devastating surprise attacks. If it successfully hits, it can rattle targets that see the attack, impairing their combat effectiveness until the end of the Spymaster's next turn. Additionally, it can apply a dangerous poison to its weapon, carrying three doses that can incapacitate enemies, each dose able to coat one melee weapon or five pieces of ammunition. Evasion allows the Spymaster to completely avoid damage from certain area effects by succeeding on Dexterity saving throws. Its Sneak Attack ability can deal an extra 21 (6d6) damage under certain conditions, such as when it has advantage on the attack or when its target is near an ally, making it exceptionally damaging during calculated strikes.

In terms of actions, the Spymaster can make a melee weapon attack with its shortsword, which has a +6 to hit and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage on a successful hit. Alternatively, it may use a hand crossbow for ranged attacks with the same +6 to hit and a range of 30/120 feet, also dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. 

For bonus actions, the Spymaster can use Cunning Action to Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object, allowing for high mobility and tactical positioning in combat. Rapid Attack lets it attack again with its shortsword, further increasing its threat level. The Don Disguise ability enables the Spymaster to create an effective disguise with a successful Deception check, making it nearly impossible to identify even if circumstances reveal the disguise's flaws. Lastly, Study Adversary allows the Spymaster to gain insight into a target's defenses, providing advantage on all attacks and contested checks against that creature for 24 hours, drastically improving its combat effectiveness against specific opponents.</detail>
