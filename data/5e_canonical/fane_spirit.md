<summary>The Fane Spirit is a medium undead creature that embodies the essence of those who were once living, now bound to the laws of the afterlife. With a challenge rating of 3, it serves as an intriguing opponent that can engage with players both tactically and thematically. The Fane Spirit has several strengths, including the ability to resist a wide array of damage types and immunity to conditions that often hinder other creatures. However, its low speed and vulnerability to damage from silvered weapons can be seen as significant weaknesses. Notably, the Fane Spirit's unique ability to shift between its incorporeal and living forms adds complexity to encounters, making it a challenging foe in various scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Fane Spirit has a Strength of 7 with a modifier of -2, which is considered very bad, making it physically weak. Its Dexterity is 16 (+3), allowing for good agility and reflexes. With a Constitution score of 16 (+3), it boasts a good resilience to withstand damage. Its Intelligence is average at 10 (+0), while its Wisdom at 18 (+4) is exceptional, giving it a strong insight and ability to resist mental effects. Lastly, its Charisma is decent at 17 (+3), allowing for good persuasion and deception capabilities.

The Fane Spirit has a saving throw modifier of +6 for Wisdom, which is very good, indicating its strong resistance to effects targeting that attribute. It has skills in deception (+5) and religion (+4), which are both useful for social interactions and knowledge checks. The creature is immune to poison and psychic damage, resistant to several damage types such as acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, and thunder, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons. In terms of condition immunities, it cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, or restrained, which greatly enhances its combat survivability. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet and has a passive perception of 14, indicating its ability to notice details in the environment. The Fane Spirit can understand any languages it knew in life.

The Fane Spirit has several special abilities that affect gameplay. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to move through solid objects as if they were difficult terrain, although it incurs damage if it ends its movement inside an object. The Veil of the Living ability lets the spirit appear as it did in life during the day, losing its incorporeal movement and gaining a Strength score of 10. If attacked in this form, it reverts to its incorporeal form upon taking damage, causing potential fear in those witnessing the transformation if they fail a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. 

The creature’s innate spellcasting draws on its Wisdom, with a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 to hit for spell attacks. It can cast the following spells without needing material components: at will it can cast Chill Touch, a necromantic ghostly skeletal hand that delivers damage and prevents healing, and Spare the Dying, which stabilizes a dying creature. It can use Cure Wounds and Inflict Wounds three times a day; Cure Wounds is a healing spell that restores hit points, while Inflict Wounds deals necrotic damage on a successful melee spell attack. The spirit can cast Shield of Faith three times daily as well, granting a target a +2 bonus to Armor Class for up to 10 minutes. Once per day, it can use Augury to gain insight into the results of a course of action, Hold Person to paralyze a humanoid target, and Lesser Restoration to cure one disease or condition affecting a creature.

For actions during combat, the Fane Spirit has the Touch of Forgetfulness, which involves a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, reaching out to a target. If it hits, the attack inflicts 12 psychic damage (2d8 + 3) and forces the target to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the target forgets any or all events that occurred up to five minutes before the attack, similar to the effects of the Modify Memory spell, with the Game Master deciding the specific impacts of this loss of memory on the target's actions and decisions. This blend of abilities makes the Fane Spirit a complex and fascinating foe for adventurers to confront.</detail>
