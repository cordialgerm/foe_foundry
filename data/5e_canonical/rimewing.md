<summary>The Rimewing is a small, unaligned beast resembling a giant moth. Known for its icy beauty and enchanting abilities, the Rimewing serves as a minor yet fascinating creature within the Dungeons & Dragons ecosystem. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it poses a minimal threat to adventurers, with its primary strength lying in its ability to charm opponents and the natural advantage it possesses in stealth. While its combat attributes are decent, with an Armor Class of 12 and 22 hit points, it lacks significant offensive capability, making it more reliant on its special abilities for combat effectiveness. Its cold damage immunity adds to its resilience against certain attacks, providing it some degree of protection in icy environments, but its overall low attributes limit its impact in more challenging encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Rimewing has the following attributes: Strength is 11, which is considered average; Dexterity is 14, providing a good bonus of +2, enhancing its agility; Constitution is 12, resulting in a +1 modifier, indicating average health durability; Intelligence is notably low at 3, leading to a very bad modifier of -4, limiting its cognitive abilities; Wisdom is average at 10, with a +0 modifier; and Charisma is 7, resulting in a bad modifier of -2, making it less charming in social situations. The Rimewing has a passive perception of 12, aided by darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, making it effective in low-light conditions. It is skilled in perception with a +2 modifier and stealth with a +4 modifier, both contributing to its ability to avoid detection.

The Rimewing possesses a unique special ability called Antennae, which grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, allowing it to effectively track scents or detect hidden creatures in its vicinity.

For its actions, the Rimewing can attack with its Proboscis, making a melee weapon attack with a +4 modifier to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2), providing it with a basic offensive option. Additionally, once per day, it can deploy its special ability called Frosted Wings. This action creates a 20-foot radius cloud of colorful ice crystals that forces each creature within the area to make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in being charmed by the Rimewing for 1 minute, during which affected creatures become incapacitated and must move towards the Rimewing, halting just 5 feet away. Each affected creature can attempt to break free from the charm effect by repeating the saving throw at the end of its turns. This action provides the Rimewing with a tactical advantage in managing multiple opponents by incapacitating them, allowing it to maneuver or escape if needed.</detail>
