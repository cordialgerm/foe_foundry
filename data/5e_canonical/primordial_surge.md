- Primordial Form: This allows it to move through narrow spaces without squeezing and inflicts damage (7 points of acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder) on those who contact it or come too close, while also blinding and deafening enemies that start their turn in its space.

The creature’s actions include:
- Multiattack: The Primordial Surge can make three Elemental Strike attacks in a single turn.
- Elemental Strike: With a +11 to hit, this melee or ranged attack can target an enemy up to 60 feet away, dealing 28 (4d10+6) of various elemental damage options based on what the surge chooses.
- Primordial Storm (Recharge 6): This powerful ability can unleash a rain of energies, either healing allies (Restorative Rain) with 27 hit points within a 30-foot radius or dealing substantial acid and fire damage (Ruinous Rain) to enemies in the same area. The targets hit also suffer ongoing damage from being coated in burning acid until they take action to remove it.

Overall, the Primordial Surge is a complex and dangerous foe that serves both as a devastating elemental force in combat and a transformative element in the realm it occupies.</detail>
