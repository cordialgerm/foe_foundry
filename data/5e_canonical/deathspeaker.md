<summary>The Deathspeaker is a medium undead creature with a lawful evil alignment that presents a formidable challenge in combat and social interactions. It possesses a decent Armor Class of 14, providing it with good defense, and a significant pool of 97 hit points, indicating good resilience in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it is an adversary suitable for groups of adventurers looking for a mid-level encounter. The Deathspeaker excels in manipulation and deception, boasting high scores in Intelligence (18) and Charisma (15), making it very good at using skills like deception and persuasion, both having a +8 modifier. However, it is somewhat reliant on language, as its more potent abilities can only affect creatures that share a language with it, which can limit its effectiveness in certain scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Deathspeaker has the following stats: Strength 12 (+1), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 17 (+3), Intelligence 18 (+4), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 15 (+2). Its Dexterity gives it a good initiative in combat, while its Constitution offers solid resilience against effects that demand a high constitution saving throw. The Strength is average, indicating limited physical prowess, whereas the Intelligence score reinforces its affinity for cunning and manipulation.

The Deathspeaker is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and it also avoids exhaustion effects, detailing a creature designed to withstand debilitating conditions. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, and with a passive perception of 11, it has an average chance of noticing hidden threats. The languages it speaks are the same as those it knew in life, which can further enhance its social manipulation in combat.

The Deathspeaker has a unique special ability called Deathspeak. This ability enables the Deathspeaker to engage in conversation for at least a minute, allowing it to perform a prophetic display, such as reading cards or communicating through a crystal ball. Creatures that can see or hear this display must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw to avoid being cursed into believing they will soon die. While cursed, the affected creature suffers a disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, making this a potent tool for weakening foes in battle. The curse remains until lifted by magic or until the Deathspeaker dies, providing a strategic advantage.

In terms of actions, the Deathspeaker can make two attacks through its Multiattack feature. It can choose to either make two Rake attacks or use its Necrotic Ray attack twice. The Rake attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +6 to hit and can deal 12 slashing damage per hit. On the other hand, Necrotic Ray is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit, capable of inflicting 10 necrotic damage on a single target within a 60 feet range, adding versatility to its combat style.

The Deathspeaker also possesses the terrifying ability called Pronounce Death. This ability allows it to target a creature within 30 feet that has been reduced to 0 hit points and forces that creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in immediate death, making this ability exceptionally dangerous, especially if the target is already weakened. Additionally, if the target is under the effect of the Deathspeak curse, it suffers a disadvantage on this saving throw, increasing the effectiveness of the Deathspeaker's abilities considerably.</detail>
