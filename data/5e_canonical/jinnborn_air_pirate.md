It can communicate in Common and Auran.

Among its specialized abilities, the Jinnborn utilizes Elemental Weapons, allowing its weapon attacks to inflict an extra 1d6 of lightning damage in addition to their regular damage. With Knows the Ropes, this creature possesses expertise in navigating airships or sandships, adding its proficiency bonus to relevant checks and saves while aboard these vehicles, making it a formidable opponent while on the move.
