<summary>The Aridni is a small, neutral evil fey creature known for its agility and cunning. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, primarily through its fast movement and spellcasting capabilities. Its high Dexterity allows it to excel in stealth and acrobatics, making it exceptionally agile in combat. The Aridni has both offensive and defensive abilities, including the ability to avoid opportunity attacks when flying and a strong resistance to magical effects. However, its physical strength is quite low, making it vulnerable in close melee situations against stronger foes. </summary>

<detail>

The creature has an Armor Class of 15, providing a good level of defense against attacks. It has 82 hit points, calculated from rolling 15d6 and adding 30, which represents a good but not overwhelming level of endurance. The Aridni's speed is notably high at 60 feet walking and 20 feet flying, granting it excellent maneuverability in battle.

Its ability scores are as follows: Strength at 9 (a very bad modifier, meaning it has difficulty with physical tasks), Dexterity at 21 (exceptional, providing a +5 modifier for attack rolls, Armor Class, and various skills), Constitution at 14 (good, translating to a +2 bonus to hit points and saving throws), Intelligence at 12 (average), Wisdom at 11 (average), and Charisma at 16 (very good, granting a +3 modifier useful in spellcasting). The Aridni has a saving throw bonus of +8 in Dexterity, which is quite effective.

Regarding skills, the Aridni excels in Acrobatics with a +11 modifier, making it very proficient in avoiding falls and navigating difficult terrain. Its Stealth ability also reflects this proficiency with a +11 bonus, making it particularly sneaky in combat. Its passive Perception stands at 13, allowing it to notice hidden enemies reasonably well. Additionally, it can communicate in multiple languages including Common, Gnoll, Sylvan, and Void Speech, enabling various interactions.

The Aridni has special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Flyby ability allows it to move away from any enemy without provoking opportunity attacks, making it challenging to pin down. Magic Resistance grants the creature advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further raising its survivability against spellcasting foes.

In combat, the Aridni can perform a Multiattack, making three attacks with either its Shortsword or Pixie Bow in a single turn. The Shortsword attack has a +8 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 8 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Pixie Bow operates as a ranged weapon with a +8 to hit and ranges of 40 feet and 160 feet for normal and disadvantageous conditions, respectively, dealing 10 piercing damage on a hit.

Additionally, the Aridni possesses spellcasting abilities, using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 14. It can cast several spells at will, such as Dancing Lights, which creates small glowing orbs of light, Detect Magic, which identifies magical auras, and Invisibility, allowing the Aridni to vanish from sight. It can cast Charm Person and Faerie Fire three times a day each. Charm Person can manipulate a humanoid into viewing the Aridni as a friendly acquaintance, while Faerie Fire outlines creatures in light, granting advantage to attacks against them. Once per day, it can cast Spike Growth, creating an area that harms anyone moving through it.

As a bonus action, the Aridni can use Enchanted Arrows to empower its Pixie Bow attacks. The enchanted arrow creates various potential effects on a successful hit, depending on the target's failed Wisdom saving throw (DC 14). Effects include causing Confusion, which impairs the target's actions; Fear, forcing the target to flee; Laughter, rendering the target incapacitated with mirth; or Sleep, knocking the target unconscious until damaged or awakened. These effects can significantly alter the course of combat, making the Aridni a formidable adversary and a strategic challenge for players.</detail>
