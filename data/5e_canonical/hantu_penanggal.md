<detail>

The Hantu Penanggal's attributes include a Strength of 14 (+2, which is average), Dexterity of 16 (+3, which is good), Constitution of 14 (+2, which is average), Intelligence of 11 (+0, which is very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0, which is very bad), and a notable Charisma of 18 (+4, which is exceptional). Its saving throws are +6 in Dexterity and +3 in Wisdom, demonstrating good agility to avoid attacks and moderate resistance to mental effects. It is immune to fire and poison damage, resistant to cold and lightning damage, and also to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks. The Hantu Penanggal has condition immunity against being poisoned and possesses truesight out to 60 feet, allowing it to see things as they truly are. It understands Abyssal, Common, and Infernal languages.

The Hantu Penanggal has a remarkable special ability known as "Detachable Head." This allows it to sacrifice its head as a bonus action, enabling independence of actions from its body. When detached, both the head and the body share hit points equal to half of what they had before detachment. Though the body loses truesight, it gains blindsight of 60 feet. Both forms retain the innate spellcasting trait of the full creature. If the head is destroyed while detached, the body also dies. Conversely, if the body is destroyed, the head suffers disadvantage on attacks and checks until it finds a new body. Additionally, any creature within 30 feet that sees the head must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute, with the opportunity to repeat the saving throw on each of its turns.

In terms of innate spellcasting, the Hantu Penanggal has a spell save DC of 15 and a +7 to hit with spell attacks, allowing it to cast spells without material components. It can cast the following spells at will: darkness, and detect evil and good. It can use protection from evil and good and scorching ray two times per day each, and it can use gaseous form once per day.

During combat, the Hantu Penanggal can perform a Multiattack when detached. The detached head makes one bite attack and one entrails attack, while the body can make two claw attacks. In its whole form, it can make three rapier attacks.

The Rapier attack, applicable only in its whole form, rolls a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit inflicts 7 piercing damage and an additional 7 necrotic damage. 

The Claw attack is exclusive to the body, also hitting at +6 and causing 7 slashing damage along with 3 necrotic damage.

The Bite attack, performed by the head, rolls +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. A successful hit inflicts 12 piercing damage and 7 necrotic damage, also reducing the target's maximum hit points by the amount of necrotic damage dealt, a powerful mechanic that allows the Hantu Penanggal to regain health equal to the reduction.

Finally, the Entrails attack is unique to the head. This attack, rolling +6 to hit at a 10-foot reach, deals 10 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target (escape DC 15), restraining it until the grapple ends. This provides strategic control over key opponents, enhancing the creature's menace in battle.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Detachable Head:** As a bonus action, the hantu penanggal detaches its head. The head trails entrails like flexible tentacles. While detached, the head and body act independently from each other on the same initiative, and each has hp equal to half its hp before detaching its head. Its statistics remain the same in both forms, except the body loses its truesight and gains blindsight out to a range of 60 feet.

The head and body can use the whole form’s innate spellcasting trait, expending daily uses as normal. The two forms can rejoin into the fiend’s whole form as a bonus action if they are within 5 feet of each other. If the head is destroyed while it is detached, the body also perishes. If the body is destroyed while the head is detached, the head has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until it acquires a new body. A creature within 30 feet of the penanggal and that can see the detachment must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The hantu penanggal’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.
At will: darkness, detect evil and good
2/day each: protection from evil and good, scorching ray
1/day each: gaseous form

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** When detached, the hantu penanggal’s head makes one bite attack and one entrails attack, and its body makes two claw attacks. In its whole form, it can make three rapier attacks.
- **Rapier (Whole Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Claw (Body Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.
- **Bite (Head Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the penanggal regains hp equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way becomes the new body for the penanggal, if it is detached and its body died. Otherwise, the humanoid rises 24 hours later as a new hantu penanggal.
- **Entrails (Head Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the penanggal can’t use its entrails on another target.
