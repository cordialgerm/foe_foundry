<summary>The Alkonost is a small monstrosity that embodies the mystique of lightning and the winds. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it is a creature that may seem weak at first glance, but its abilities allow it to manipulate the environment to its advantage. It has good mobility with a flying speed of 40 feet, allowing it to evade danger effectively. Its defenses are average, with an Armor Class of 12 and a modest pool of 17 hit points. The creature's notable feature is its immunity to winds, whether natural or magical, giving it exceptional resilience against effects that could hinder its movement. However, with low intelligence and constitution, it remains vulnerable in situations that exploit its mental or physical weaknesses.</summary>

The Alkonost has the following attributes: Strength at 11 is average, Dexterity is 14, which is good, allowing for decent agility and reflexes, Constitution at 10 is average, Intelligence at 7 is very bad, Wisdom at 14 is good, and Charisma at 13 is average. 

In terms of special abilities, the Alkonost possesses "One with Wind," which grants it immunity to the effects of wind, allowing it to navigate both magical storms and natural phenomena without losing control. Additionally, when fighting near a lightning storm, its weapon attacks deal an extra 2 (1d4) lightning damage, making it a formidable opponent if conditions are right.

The Alkonost can use its claws to make a melee weapon attack, which has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage on a successful hit. It also has a unique action called "Charged Melody" that can be used after a recharge of 6. This action involves the Alkonost singing a captivating melody; any creature within 30 feet that can hear it must make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they will take 7 (2d6) lightning damage the next time they move. This ability not only harms opponents but can also control the pace of battle by punishing movement, making the Alkonost a strategic threat in combat situations.</detail>
