<summary>The Morphoi is a chaotic evil plant creature with an unsettling ability to transform into humanoid shapes. This adaptability makes it a versatile opponent, capable of engaging both in melee and ranged combat effectively. With a well-rounded set of abilities, it demonstrates good dexterity and strength, allowing for nimble movements and solid attacks, but it has average resilience and wisdom. The Morphoi's amphibious nature grants it the ability to navigate both water and land seamlessly, enhancing its tactical options during encounters. However, it is relatively low in Hit Points compared to stronger foes, which can make it susceptible to sustained damage if caught off guard.</summary>

<detail>

The Morphoi has an Armor Class of 13, providing a poor to average defense against attacks, making it moderately difficult to hit but not overly so. Its Hit Points amount to 33, calculated with 6d8 plus an addition of 6, indicating an average toughness but sufficient for a creature rated at Challenge Level 1/2, which can serve as a suitable encounter for low-level adventurers.

In terms of ability scores, the Morphoi boasts a Strength score of 14 (+2), a Dexterity score of 16 (+3), a Constitution score of 13 (+1), an Intelligence score of 14 (+2), a Wisdom score of 10 (+0), and a Charisma score of 15 (+2). The Dexterity score is particularly noteworthy, providing a very good modifier that enhances its initiative and ranged attack capabilities. The Strength score is good, aiding in physical combat, while its Charisma is also good, suggesting a capacity for manipulation or persuasion, particularly when in humanoid form.

Among its capabilities, the Morphoi possesses the special ability Amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water. This ability provides tactical advantages in aquatic environments or during encounters involving bodies of water.

In combat, the Morphoi can use several actions:

1. **Claw:** This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, making it a good offensive option, with a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it delivers 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, establishing it as a poignant threat in close-range encounters.

2. **Trident:** This weapon can be used for both melee and ranged attacks, with a +4 to hit. When deployed in melee, it has a reach of 5 feet and deals 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage when wielded with two hands. The ranged attack option has a range of 20 feet normally and 60 feet at disadvantage, dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. The dual usage enhances its versatility in various combat situations.

3. **Shortbow:** As another ranged option, the Morphoi can make an attack using a shortbow. It has a +5 to hit, and its range extends to 80 feet normally, or 320 feet at disadvantage. This attack delivers 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, allowing for effective long-range engagements.

For bonus actions, the Morphoi has the **Change Shape** ability. This grants it the ability to transform into a Medium humanoid or revert back into its true form as a plant. Its statistics remain unchanged in either form, but any equipment it was wearing or carrying does not transform. This ability adds a layer of strategic depth to the Morphoi, allowing it to infiltrate or deceive its foes, creating opportunities for ambushes or escape tactics. The Morphoi returns to its true form upon death, presenting a final challenge to anyone who believes they have defeated it.</detail>
