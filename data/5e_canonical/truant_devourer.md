<summary>The Truant Devourer is a powerful undead creature that roams the battlefield with dark intent. As a Medium-sized entity, it possesses a high armor class of 16 and significant durability with 156 hit points, obtained from rolling 24d8 plus an additional 48. This makes it a strong adversary, rated with a Challenge Rating of 9, granting 5,000 experience points for overcoming it in combat. Its strengths lie in its magic resistance and ability to detect heretics, which allows it to pinpoint enemies of its creator deity within close range. However, it is susceptible to radiant damage and magic attacks that are more effective than its resistances. With an average speed of 40 feet and the ability to teleport short distances, the Truant Devourer can quickly engage or disengage foes, demonstrating both offensive and tactical prowess.</summary>

<detail>

The creature has the following stats: 
- Strength: 12, which provides a good melee attack but is primarily supported by its higher proficiency with spell attacks.
- Dexterity: 17 grants the Truant Devourer a good initiative and increases its armor class.
- Constitution: 14 gives it good hit points and helps resist physical damage.
- Intelligence: 16 indicates a good capability for spellcasting and tactical planning.
- Wisdom: 18 is exceptional, enhancing its perception and saving throws against spells.
- Charisma: 13 is average, affecting its abilities with spells and effects that rely on this attribute.

The Truant Devourer has several notable special abilities. Its Heretic Sense lets it locate those in opposition to its faith within a 60-foot radius and sense their general direction for up to a mile, making it a dangerous foe in religious contexts. It possesses Magic Resistance, giving it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which offers it strong defensive capabilities. The creature is also resistant to being turned by clerics and has the Undead Nature trait, meaning it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.

In terms of combat actions, the Truant Devourer can utilize a Multiattack action, allowing it to make three melee attacks with its Devourer’s Cleaver or cast its Necrotic Bolt, and it can choose to replace one attack with its Life Drain ability. 

The Devourer’s Cleaver attack is a melee weapon strike with a +7 to hit, delivering 10 slashing damage plus an additional 9 necrotic damage. The Life Drain ability is a melee spell attack with a +8 to hit that inflicts 17 necrotic damage. Importantly, the Life Drain also reduces the target's maximum hit points by the amount of damage dealt unless the target succeeds on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. This effect lasts until the victim finishes a long rest and can be lethal if the reduction drops their maximum hit points to zero.

The Necrotic Bolt allows for ranged combat with a +8 to hit, dealing 17 necrotic damage at a distance of up to 120 feet. This makes it a versatile attacker, capable of engaging foes from afar.

In terms of mobility, the Truant Devourer can become invisible, allowing it to vanish from sight until it attacks or uses its Grasping Claws ability. Grasping Claws has a recharge mechanic, allowing the creature to summon ghostly skeletal claws that erupt from the ground in a designated area within 60 feet. Creatures in a 15-foot radius of this point take 31 necrotic damage on a failed DC 16 Dexterity saving throw and become restrained for one minute. Restrained creatures can attempt to break free at the end of their turns.

Lastly, the Truant Devourer can teleport up to 60 feet as a bonus action using its Dusty Step ability, enabling quick repositioning during combat and enhancing its tactical versatility. In summary, the Truant Devourer is a formidable foe capable of working both in melee and ranged attacks, with abilities that allow for manipulation of the battlefield and control over its enemies.</detail>
