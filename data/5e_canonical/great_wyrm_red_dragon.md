<summary>The Great Wyrm Red Dragon is a gargantuan and fearsome creature known for its devastating fire abilities and unmatched prowess in combat. As one of the most powerful dragons, it serves as a primary antagonist in many campaigns, capable of instilling terror and commanding respect from those who encounter it. With its massive hit points and high armor class, this dragon is extraordinarily tough to defeat. Its combination of innate spellcasting and fierce physical attacks makes it an exceptional foe in both direct confrontations and strategic combat scenarios. However, while its high damage outputs and versatility render it formidable, it also possesses specific vulnerabilities, particularly when it exhausts its legendary resistances, which temporarily reduces its defense.</summary>

<detail>

The Great Wyrm Red Dragon has an Armor Class of 22, making it very difficult to hit. It possesses a staggering 897 hit points, calculated as 46d20+414, allowing it to sustain significant damage in battle. With a walking speed of 40 feet, climbing speed of 40 feet, and flying speed of 80 feet, it can maneuver effectively on the battlefield. It has a Challenge Rating of 26, awarding 90,000 experience points upon defeat.

The dragon's physical attributes are outstanding, with a Strength of 30 (+10), which is exceptional, allowing it to deliver powerful attacks. Its Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), giving it no additional advantage in nimbleness, while its Constitution is very good at 28 (+9), enhancing its durability against physical attacks. The dragon has an Intelligence of 18 (+4), allowing for strategic thinking, a Wisdom of 16 (+3) which aids in perception checks, and a Charisma of 22 (+6) that underscores its powerful presence in interactions and spellcasting.

In saving throws, the dragon boasts very good resistances: +8 for Dexterity, +17 for Constitution, +11 for Wisdom, and +14 for Charisma. It is skilled in Intimidation (+14), Perception (+11), and Stealth (+8), enhancing its effectiveness both in combat and while lurking unseen.

The dragon exhibits several damage immunities and resistances, being completely immune to fire damage, which defines its elemental nature. Its senses include blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision out to 120 feet, and a substantial passive Perception score of 24, allowing it to detect threats without depending on sight alone. It is fluent in Common, Draconic, and has two additional languages.

There are several notable special abilities. The Great Wyrm Red Dragon has Legendary Resistance (3/Day), allowing it the option to succeed on a failed saving throw. If this ability is used, it sheds scales that become charcoal, and after exhausting its uses, its Armor Class drops to 20 until it completes a long rest. With Searing Heat, any creature that makes physical contact, whether by touch or melee attack, receives 14 (4d6) fire damage. The Volcanic Tyrant trait grants it immunity to damaging effects from poisonous gases in volcanic environments and allows it to navigate round terrains without hindrance.

Another ability, Seething Rage, activates when the dragon is bloodied, recharging its breath weapon instantly. Additionally, it inflicts changes to fire resistances upon creatures hit by its Searing Heat ability, affecting their defenses until the beginning of their next turn. The dragon has innate spellcasting with Charisma as its spellcasting ability (save DC 22), enabling it to cast spells such as command, hold person, glyph of warding, and wall of fire three times daily, while it can cast antimagic field, dominate monster, and storm of vengeance once per day.

In combat, the dragon can unleash powerful multiattacks, which include a bite attack and two claw attacks, or choose to Spit Fire instead of a bite. The bite attack boasts a +18 to hit and delivers a staggering 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage, along with an additional 9 (2d8) fire damage. Each claw attack also has a +18 to hit, dealing 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage. Its Tail attack, with the same +18 modifier, results in 23 (3d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage while pushing the target away.

Additionally, the dragon can use its Cruel Tyranny action to command a creature to make an attack with advantage. Its Spit Fire ability requires a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failure and inflicting ongoing fire damage if the target fails the save. The devastating Fire Breath attack, with a recharge mechanic (5-6), affects a 90-foot cone, requiring creatures to make a DC 25 saving throw. A failed save results in 98 (28d6) fire damage and ongoing fire damage, along with fear effects for the afflicted target.

For reactions, the dragon can perform a Tail Attack against any creature that hits it within a specific range and use the Taskmaster ability to aid allies who fail checks or saving throws. Lastly, it has access to Legendary Actions, allowing it to perform actions at the end of another creature's turn. These include utilizing Cruel Tyranny, unleashing a terrifying Roar that frightens targets, or executing a Wing Attack to push foes and fly, demonstrating its dominance on the battlefield.</detail>

- **Volcanic Tyrant:** The dragon is immune to the effects of poisonous gases caused by volcanic environments. It also ignores difficult terrain caused by lava.
- **Seething Rage:** When the dragon is first bloodied, it immediately recharges its breath weapon, if its not already available. Its inner flame erupts, burning brightly in its eyes and mouth. After taking damage from its Searing Heat ability, a creature with resistance to fire damage loses it, and a creature with immunity to fire damage reduces it to resistance. Either effect lasts until the start of the creatures next turn.

- **Cruel Tyranny:** The dragon snarls and threatens its minions  driving them to immediate action. The dragon chooses one creature it can see and that can hear the dragon. The creature uses its reaction to make one weapon attack with advantage. If the dragon is bloodied  it can use this ability on three minions at once.
- **Spit Fire:** The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet  forcing it to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save also takes 11 (2d10) ongoing fire damage. A creature can use an action to end the ongoing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales a blast of fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw  taking 98 (28d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the saving throw also takes 11 (2d10) ongoing fire damage. While affected by this ongoing damage  it is frightened of the dragon. A creature can use an action to end the ongoing damage.

### Reactions

- **Tail Attack:** When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.
- **Taskmaster:** When a creature within 60 feet fails an ability check or saving throw, the dragon roars a command to it. The creature can roll a d10 and add it to the result of the roll, possibly turning the failure into a success.

- **Cruel Tyranny:** The dragon uses its Cruel Tyranny action.
- **Roar:** Each creature of the dragons choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 22 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.
- **Wing Attack:** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.
