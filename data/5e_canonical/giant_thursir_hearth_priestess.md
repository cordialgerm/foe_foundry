In terms of attributes, the Giant, Thursir Hearth Priestess has a Strength of 17, which correlates to a modifier of +3, categorized as good, allowing her to perform physically demanding actions effectively. Her Dexterity is 14 (+2), deemed average, giving her decent agility though not exceptional. The Constitution is also strong at 17 (+3), providing her with a good defense against physical ailments.

Her Wisdom is notably high at 16 (+3), allowing her to excel in perception and insight checks, which are important for awareness in her surroundings. Finally, her Charisma score of 14 (+2) indicates that she can effectively engage allies and enemies alike, although she is not specialized in social interactions.

The special abilities of the Giant, Thursir Hearth Priestess are particularly noteworthy. Her Magic Resistance grants her advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, which can significantly enhance her survivability in battles against spell-casting foes. Additionally, her weapon attacks are considered magical, meaning they can bypass resistance from non-magical creatures. The "Protect the Hearth" ability allows her to enhance the mobility of her allies when she is struck by a weapon attack; up to two friendly creatures can use their reactions to dash toward her, which can reposition the battlefield dramatically in favor of her team.

For her actions, the Hearth Priestess can use a Multiattack, which allows her to leverage her Hearth Blessing ability first and then follow up with two attacks using her Runic Staff. The Runic Staff attacks have a +5 to hit with a melee range of 10 feet, dealing 10 bludgeoning damage (2d6+3) alongside an additional 4 fire damage (1d8). The Hearth Blessing is a powerful supportive action where she can empower one visible ally within 30 feet with one of three options: Hearth's Burn ignites the target's weapon, adding extra fire damage to their attacks; Hearth's Comfort immediately ends any charm or fright effects on the ally while providing them with temporary hit points; and Hearth's Protection increases the target's armor class by 2 and grants their armor immunity to spells that affect it. 

Additionally, she has the ability to cast spells, leveraging her Wisdom with a spell save DC of 13. She can use spells at will, such as Mending, Spare the Dying, and Thaumaturgy, to provide utility and support. Furthermore, she can cast Cure Wounds and Heat Metal three times a day, significantly aiding her allies during combat scenarios, and Haste once per day, which can greatly increase her and her allies' effectiveness in engagements.</detail>
