<HP/>126</HP>
<summary>The Abaasy is a formidable Huge Giant characterized by its neutral evil alignment and the chaos it brings to combat. With an armor class of 18, it is quite durable, augmented by its use of Dual Shields which grant it significant defensive capabilities. Sporting a remarkable 126 hit points, it can withstand substantial damage. The Abaasy is particularly dangerous due to its strong melee capabilities, with high strength and constitution scores, combined with a unique ability to go berserk when in pain. This can turn the tide in battle as it becomes a relentless attacker. However, its poor depth perception gives it a disadvantage against targets that are over 30 feet away, which can be a significant tactical weakness. The Abaasy fills the role of a powerful frontline combatant that can absorb damage and dish it out effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The Abaasy has the following attributes: Strength of 20 (+5), which is exceptional and allows for powerful melee attacks; Dexterity of 10 (+0), reflecting average agility; Constitution of 20 (+5), showcasing exceptional durability; Intelligence of 9 (-1), indicating a below-average intellect; Wisdom of 14 (+2), which is good; and Charisma of 8 (-1), reflecting very bad social influence. 

In terms of skills, the Abaasy possesses a Perception score of +2, indicating average ability to notice details in its environment. It has resistance to cold damage, providing a layer of protection against ice-based attacks. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, though it cannot discern color in darkness. The Abaasy communicates using Common and Giant languages.

The special abilities of the Abaasy include:

- Armored Berserker: When the Abaasy has 60 hit points or fewer at the start of its turn, it rolls a d6. On a roll of 6, it enters a berserk state, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. While berserk, it attacks the nearest creature it can see, or, if no creatures are nearby, it will attack objects, choosing smaller ones if possible. This state persists until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points, making it a dangerous adversary in dire situations.
- Dual Shields: The Abaasy uses two shields to bolster its defense, resulting in an effective armor class that is well above average.
- Poor Depth Perception: This ability imposes disadvantage on attack rolls against any target that is more than 30 feet away, making ranged engagements or fights against mobile enemies challenging.

In terms of actions, the Abaasy can perform the following:

- Multiattack: It allows the Abaasy to make three melee attacks, one of which may be a Shield Shove. If it opts to use both hands for a Spear attack, it cannot make an Iron Axe attack during that turn.
- Iron Axe: This melee weapon attack has a +8 to hit and, when successful, deals 18 (3d8+5) points of slashing damage within a reach of 10 feet.
- Shield Shove: Also a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, it can deal 15 (4d4+5) points of bludgeoning damage. The target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or pushed away up to 15 feet, based on the Abaasy's choice.
- Spear: This weapon, usable for both melee and ranged attacks, can hit targets 15 feet away or at a range of 20/60 feet. The damage dealt is 15 (3d6+5) piercing damage, or 18 (3d8+5) if used with two hands in melee.
- Eyebeam (Recharge 5–6): Once the ability is recharged, the Abaasy can fire a beam of oscillating energy in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half that on a success. This ability can create devastating effects in combat situations, particularly against groups of opponents caught in its path.</detail>
