<detail>

The Venom Maw Hydra has the following attributes: Strength of 19 (+4), Dexterity of 17 (+3), Constitution of 18 (+4), Intelligence of 5 (-3), Wisdom of 10 (+0), and Charisma of 7 (-2). Its physical attributes grant it a good melee and ranged attack capability, while its Constitution ensures it can withstand a good amount of damage due to its high hit points. The creature has an armor class of 15, which means it can be moderately difficult to hit, but not impossible. The hydra is skilled in Perception (+8) and Stealth (+7), benefiting from good awareness of its surroundings and the ability to hide effectively.

The Venom Maw Hydra possesses several special abilities. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, which makes it versatile in combat situations. Its most defining trait is the Multiple Heads ability, providing it with advantage on saving throws against various effects like being blinded or frightened. Additionally, when it takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies, but it can regenerate two heads at the end of its turn unless it receives cold damage. This regeneration ability makes it a persistent threat throughout battle. The Wakeful ability ensures that at least one head remains awake while it sleeps, making it harder to catch the hydra off guard.

In terms of actions, the Venom Maw Hydra can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make as many bite or spit attacks as it has heads. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage plus 5 acid damage upon a successful hit. Its Spit attack is a ranged weapon attack with a +7 to hit, dealing 10 acid damage and potentially inflicting poison on the target if they fail a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. The Venom Spray ability is particularly dangerous; it requires a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw from creatures in a 30-foot cone, dealing 22 acid damage on a failed save or half on a success. 

Additionally, the hydra can utilize a Tail Lash reaction when hit by a melee attack. The attacker must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 7 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. 

The Venom Maw Hydra also has legendary actions, which add to its threat level. It can make a Bite attack, perform a Spit attack at the cost of two actions, or execute a Wallowing Rampage when in water for three actions, dealing 14 acid damage to creatures within a specified area unless they succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.

Overall, the Venom Maw Hydra stands as a powerful creature in combat, requiring clever tactics and teamwork from adventurers to overcome its significance in encounters.</detail>

Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken cold damage since its last turn.
