<MonsterName/>Swarm of Quippers</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Swarm of Quippers is a fast-moving, vicious school of carnivorous fish that can strip flesh from bone in seconds. These small, sharp-toothed predators are found in rivers, lakes, or coastal waters, often lurking in murky depths. Though individually weak, in large numbers they become a serious threat, capable of overwhelming creatures many times their size. Swarms of Quippers are especially dangerous to injured or bleeding creatures, as they are drawn to the scent of blood in the water. Their rapid, frenzied attacks can quickly incapacitate even the strongest of swimmers.</summary>
