<MonsterName/>Swarm of Quippers</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Swarm of Quippers is a fast-moving, vicious school of carnivorous fish that can strip flesh from bone in seconds. These small, sharp-toothed predators are found in rivers, lakes, or coastal waters, often lurking in murky depths. Though individually weak, in large numbers they become a serious threat, capable of overwhelming creatures many times their size. Swarms of Quippers are especially dangerous to injured or bleeding creatures, as they are drawn to the scent of blood in the water. Their rapid, frenzied attacks can quickly incapacitate even the strongest of swimmers.</summary>

<summary>The Swarm of Quippers is a Medium-sized beast known for its aggressive and relentless nature in aquatic environments. This creature has a challenge rating of 1, making it a moderately-sized threat. With a decent armor class of 13 and 28 hit points, it can withstand some attacks but is not particularly durable. Its strengths lie in its swimming speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in water. Given its resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, it can absorb non-magical assaults well. However, it has a weakness in its low Constitution, resulting in a very bad modifier of -1, which impacts its overall damage resilience. The swarm's ability to swarm over enemies and attack en masse makes it a formidable opponent, especially when engaged in melee. </summary>

<detail>

The Swarm of Quippers has the following attributes: Strength is 12, yielding an average modifier of +1; Dexterity is 16, resulting in a good +3 modifier, providing a better chance to hit and dodge; Constitution is very bad with an 8 and -1 modifier; Intelligence is extremely low at 2 with a -4 modifier, making it incapable of complex thought; Wisdom is low at 6, giving it a bad -2 modifier for perception-related tasks; and Charisma is very low at 4, applying a -3 modifier, suggesting it has no significant social capability.

In terms of skills, the Swarm has no specific proficiencies. However, it has several critical immunities: it cannot be charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, stunned, or unconscious, allowing it to act freely in combat scenarios without the risk of these debilitating conditions. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 8, providing it some effectiveness in low-light environments.

The Swarm of Quippers possesses two special abilities. The first is called "Swarm," which allows it to occupy the space of another creature and move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. This ability means that it can effectively surround and overwhelm enemies, although it cannot gain hit points or temporary hit points, limiting its sustainability in prolonged encounters. The second ability, "Water Breathing," indicates that the swarm can survive only in water, emphasizing its aquatic nature.

When it comes to actions, the Swarm of Quippers can perform a melee attack known as "Bites." This attack has a +5 to hit and can target a single creature within reach. On a successful hit, the swarm inflicts 10 piercing damage, calculated as 4d4, or 5 piercing damage, calculated as 2d4, if the swarm is bloodied, meaning it has taken half of its hit points in damage or more. Upon hitting, the swarm can use a bonus action to make a second bite attack, allowing it to deal even more damage in a single round of combat, emphasizing its aggressive feeding behavior. This makes the swarm a dangerous adversary in close quarters, especially when it can leverage multiple attacks.</detail>
