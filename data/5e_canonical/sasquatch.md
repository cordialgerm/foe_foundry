<summary>The Sasquatch is a large, unaligned beast with a significant presence in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 5, this creature poses a moderate threat to adventurers, capable of dealing substantial damage while also exhibiting exceptional durability due to its innate abilities. The Sasquatch has impressive physical attributes, particularly in Strength and Constitution, allowing it to deliver powerful melee attacks and sustain itself in battle. However, it has low Intelligence and Charisma, indicating limited ability to interact socially or outsmart opponents. Its notable abilities like Keen Hearing and Smell enhance its tracking and stealth capabilities, making it a formidable predator in natural environments.</summary>

<detail>

The Sasquatch has an Armor Class of 14, making it moderately difficult to hit, especially with its natural armor. It possesses 119 hit points, providing it with good endurance in combat. The creature's movement allows it to climb and walk at a speed of 40 feet each, granting it versatility in terrain. Its Strength score of 18 results in a +4 modifier, which is very good, enabling it to easily break through defenses. Its Dexterity score of 14 gives a +2 modifier, which is average; this contributes to its stealth ability but doesn't enhance its agility drastically. The Constitution score of 16 (modifier +3, which is good) supports its resilience, while the Intelligence score of 4 is very bad, making it nearly incapable of reasoning or strategic thinking. The Wisdom score of 12 offers a +1 modifier, which is average, allowing for decent perception and awareness, while the Charisma score of 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, is very bad and limits its social interaction.

The Sasquatch's skills include perception at +4 and stealth at +8, giving it a good chance to remain hidden and a decent ability to notice hidden creatures or traps. It has darkvision extending 60 feet, enabling it to see in low-light conditions, and a passive perception of 14, which is above average. The Sasquatch does not possess any language capabilities, indicating its primal nature.

Special abilities enhance the Sasquatch’s effectiveness in various scenarios. With Keen Hearing and Smell, the creature has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on these senses, allowing it to detect nearby creatures more reliably. Plant Camouflage grants the Sasquatch advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in forested or overgrown terrain, making it difficult to spot while hiding. Its Relentless ability allows it to survive potentially fatal blows, reducing damage taken to 1 hit point instead of 0, showcasing its tenacity. The Reckless ability permits the Sasquatch to gain advantage on melee attack rolls for a turn at the cost of incoming attacks gaining advantage against it, representing its bold combat style.

In combat, the Sasquatch can use its Multiattack to perform three separate attacks each turn: one Bite attack and two Fist attacks. The Bite attack has a +7 to hit, dealing 7 piercing damage (1d6 + 4) upon a successful strike. The Fist attacks are similarly accurate, also at +7 to hit, each dealing 11 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 4). In addition to these, the Sasquatch can throw a Rock with a range of 20/60 feet, hitting for 15 bludgeoning damage (2d10 + 4). The signature action of the Sasquatch is the Vanishing Tantrum, which recharges on a roll of 5-6. This ability requires creatures within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, inflicting 14 thunder damage (4d6) on a failed save, with half that damage on success. After using this ability, the Sasquatch can move without provoking opportunity attacks and take a Hide action, allowing it to easily escape or reposition itself in combat.</detail>
