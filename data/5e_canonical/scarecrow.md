<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Scarecrow is a medium-sized construct, designed to resist fear and create terror among the living while being strategically used by its creator. Its strengths lie in its ability to instill fear in opponents and its very good Dexterity that allows it to evade attacks effectively. While it has some inherent defenses like damage immunities and resistances, it is vulnerable to fire, which can cause ongoing damage. The Scarecrow's subpar Intelligence and Constitution suggest that it may not be great in tactics but can function effectively as an unsettling presence on the battlefield with the right abilities and tactics. With a challenge rating of 1, it is suitable for low-level encounters but can create significant challenges if used cunningly.</summary>

<detail>

The Scarecrow has an Armor Class of 12, which indicates that it has an average level of defense against attacks. It possesses 31 hit points, providing it with a decent buffer before being taken down. Its movement speed is 30 feet, allowing it to engage nearby enemies effectively.

In terms of attributes, the Scarecrow has the following values: Strength of 12 with a modifier of +1, Dexterity of 14 with a modifier of +2 (very good), Constitution of 10 with a modifier of +0 (average), Intelligence of 6 with a modifier of -2 (very bad), Wisdom of 10 with a modifier of +0 (average), and Charisma of 14 with a modifier of +2 (very good). 

The Scarecrow has notable skills and resistances. It is immune to poison damage and resistant to bludgeoning and piercing damage, making it durable. It also cannot be charmed, fatigued, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet, and its passive Perception score is 10, indicating it has average awareness of its surroundings. It understands the languages of its creator, although it cannot speak.

The Scarecrow has several special abilities. Its False Appearance allows it to remain undetected when motionless, appearing as a regular scarecrow. The Flammable trait means that after taking fire damage, it will continue to take ongoing fire damage unless extinguished. The Local Spirit ability will destroy it if it moves more than a mile from where it was created, emphasizing its tie to a specific location. Also, the Spell-created feature requires a dispel magic check against a DC of 19 to destroy it, making it hard to eliminate through magical means.

In terms of actions, the Scarecrow can make a Multiattack, where it utilizes its Scare ability and performs two slam attacks. The Slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit. It has a reach of 5 feet and can target one enemy, dealing 5 bludgeoning damage on a hit (1d6 + 2). 

Its Scare ability can target any creature within 30 feet that can see the Scarecrow, requiring a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the target is magically frightened for one minute, repeating the saving throw at the end of its turns. If the creature succeeds or the effect ends, it gains immunity to the Scare ability for 24 hours.

Additionally, the Scarecrow can use its Hat of Illusion ability once per day. This allows it to wear a hat or other head covering and take on the illusory appearance of the last living humanoid who wore that hat. To discern the illusion, an observer must succeed on a DC 12 Insight or Perception check. The illusion ends if the scarecrow is touched, takes damage, makes an attack, uses the Scare ability, or voluntarily ends it as a bonus action. 

Overall, the Scarecrow offers a blend of fear-inducing tactics and physical durability, making it an interesting and challenging opponent in low-level encounters.</detail>
