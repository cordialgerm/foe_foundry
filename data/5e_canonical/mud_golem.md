<summary>The Mud Golem is a small, unaligned construct that serves as a sturdy combatant with notable defenses and capabilities in battle. With an Armor Class of 10 and 27 hit points, it can withstand some attacks but lacks advanced agility. Its Challenge Rating of 1 indicates that it poses a moderate challenge for lower-level adventurers, granting 200 experience points upon defeat. The Mud Golem has a strong physical presence, reflected in its Strength score of 15 (+2), making it good at dealing damage, while its other attributes, particularly Intelligence (3, -4) and Charisma (1, -5), are very poor, indicating it lacks mental abilities and charm. Key strengths of the Mud Golem include its immunity to several conditions, resistance to non-magical physical damage, and inherent magical capabilities, although it is slow-moving with a speed of 20 feet. </summary>

<detail>

The Mud Golem has several defensive capabilities, including damage immunities to poison and psychic attacks and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks, provided those attacks are not made with adamantine weaponry. It is also immune to conditions such as charm, exhaustion, fear, paralysis, petrification, and poison. In terms of senses, the Mud Golem possesses darkvision out to 60 feet, although its passive Perception score is rather low at 9. While it can understand the languages of its creator, it lacks the ability to speak. 

Among its special abilities, the Mud Golem has Immutable Form, which means it cannot be affected by spells or effects that change its shape. This makes it exceptionally durable against transformations or polymorphing effects. Additionally, its Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells or other magical effects, making it exceptionally resilient in magical encounters. 

In combat, the Mud Golem can utilize its Multiattack feature to make two slam attacks, which are melee weapon attacks that operate with a +4 to hit modifier, a good value for hitting opponents. Each successful slam causes 5 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 2), allowing it to inflict significant harm on its foes. Alternatively, the Mud Golem can use its Mud Ball ability for ranged attacks. This attack allows it to make a ranged weapon attack with a +2 to hit modifier, which is considered average for hitting distant targets. The range of the Mud Ball is 30 feet normally, with extended reach up to 120 feet for disadvantage on the attack roll. Upon a hit, it deals 3 bludgeoning damage (1d6) and inflicts the blinded condition on the target until the end of its next turn, providing not only physical damage but also a strategic advantage by hindering the target's ability to fight back effectively. Overall, the Mud Golem is a durable foe that can also disrupt opponents through its Mud Ball ability while remaining resilient against various forms of attack.</detail>
