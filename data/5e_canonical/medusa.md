<summary>A Medusa is a cursed creature with the body of a humanoid and a head full of writhing, venomous snakes in place of hair. Medusas are infamous for their ability to turn living creatures to stone with a single gaze. They are often found in ancient ruins or hidden lairs, where they surround themselves with petrified victims and treasures. Medusas are cunning and manipulative, using both their gaze and their serpent hair in combat. They may also wield weapons or magic, but their most feared ability is their petrifying gaze, which can instantly end a fight if their victim meets their eyes.</summary>

<summary>The Medusa is a formidable Medium Monstrosity known for its ability to petrify foes with its deadly gaze. With a challenge rating of 7, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, thanks to its combination of dexterous movements, poisonous attacks, and the terrifying power of its petrifying gaze. Its moderate armor class of 14 and a robust hit point pool of 120 allows it to withstand considerable punishment in combat. However, it is somewhat reliant on its abilities to control the battlefield and can be vulnerable if caught off guard or overwhelmed by multiple attackers.</summary>

<detail>

The Medusa has a Strength score of 12, which translates to a good modifier of +1, making it capable in melee but not a frontline powerhouse. Its Dexterity is exceptional at 18 (+4), providing it with good agility, which aids in stealth and ranged attacks. With a Constitution of 16 (+3), it can endure damage effectively, enhancing its already decent durability. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are all average, each sitting at 12 (+1) or 14 (+2), allowing it to maintain a moderate level of versatility in skills and saving throws.

The Medusa's notable skills include deception, insight, perception, and stealth, each at good levels of +5 or +7 for stealth, which grants it exceptional capability in ambush scenarios. Possessing darkvision out to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 15 ensures the Medusa can navigate dark environments and notice hidden targets, enhancing its effectiveness in both combat and scouting situations.

One of the Medusa's main strengths lies in its special ability known as Petrifying Gaze. This ability activates when a creature starts its turn within 60 feet of it and can see the Medusa's eyes. The creature has the option to shut its eyes, thus avoiding the gaze and its effects unless it is surprised or incapacitated. If it chooses to look, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; failure results in being restrained and potentially petrified over subsequent turns, while a natural 1 results in instant petrification. The petrification condition can only be ended through powerful magic such as greater restoration.

In combat, the Medusa uses its Multiattack feature to make a combination of two attacks, drawing upon its snake hair and longbow. Its snake hair attack functions as a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage plus an additional 7 poison damage. If the target is surprised or cannot see the Medusa, it takes an extra 3 piercing damage. The longbow allows it to strike from a distance, also with a +7 to hit, dealing 8 piercing damage along with the same 7 poison damage.

In conclusion, the Medusa's combination of agile attacks, petrifying gaze, and stealth capabilities makes it a dangerous adversary that can control the dynamics of encounters effectively, forcing quick decisions from its opponents.

The Medusa is a medium monstrosity known for its potent combination of physical attacks and its exceptional petrifying gaze. This creature is capable of inflicting significant damage and dishing out debilitating effects in combat, making it a formidable opponent at its Challenge Rating of 6. While it possesses notable resilience to exhaustion and fear, it also has decent Armor Class and a substantial pool of hit points, allowing it to withstand a decent amount of punishment. The Medusa's strengths lie in its ability to control the battlefield with its petrifying gaze and deliver powerful poison-infused attacks using its snake-like hair and weapons. However, it may be weaker in terms of mobility compared to faster creatures and relies heavily on its gaze for crowd control.

The Medusa has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good, making it moderately difficult to hit. It possesses 112 hit points, providing it with a very good durability in battle. Its speed is average at 30 feet, which allows it to maneuver effectively within combat zones. The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength of +0 (very bad), Dexterity of +4 (very good), Constitution of +3 (good), Intelligence of +2 (average), Wisdom of +1 (average), and Charisma of +6 (exceptional). The Medusa's high Charisma contributes significantly to its ability to influence and intimidate opponents.

The Medusa has several key special abilities. Firstly, its "Monstrosity Resilience" grants it effective protection against exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it better suited for protracted encounters. The "Petrifying Gaze" ability is a potent feature; any creature that can see the Medusa's eyes and starts its turn within 30 feet must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails this save by 5 or more, it is instantly petrified; otherwise, it becomes restrained and must repeat the saving throw on its next turn. Petrification is a powerful effect that can permanently remove threats from the battlefield, lasting until magical means are used to undo it. Finally, the "Snake Friend" ability allows the Medusa to communicate with snakes and protects them from her own gaze.

In terms of actions, the Medusa can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make one Snake Hair attack and two Shortsword attacks or three Longbow attacks in a turn. The "Snake Hair" attack is a melee weapon attack that uses +7 to hit, has a reach of 10 feet, and targets one creature, dealing 6 piercing damage plus an additional 14 poison damage. Its Shortsword attack also uses +7 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 piercing damage plus 7 poison damage, while its Longbow attacks, which are ranged, also leverage a +7 to hit and can strike at a range of 150 feet with 8 piercing damage alongside 7 poison damage.

The Medusa also has a reaction called "Interruptive Hiss." When targeted by an attack, the Medusa can use its snakes to distract the attacker, requiring them to succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or face a disadvantage on their attack roll.

Overall, the Medusa presents a complex combination of offensive capabilities and crowd control, making her a significant threat in any encounter.</detail>

***Petrifying Gaze***. When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the *greater restoration* spell or other magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

###### Actions

***Multiattack***. The medusa makes either three melee attacks-one with its snake hair and two with its shortsword-or two ranged attacks with its longbow.

***Snake Hair***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.

***Shortsword***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage.
