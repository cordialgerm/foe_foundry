<summary>The Doom Golem is a formidable large construct, unaligned and designed for destruction. It boasts a high Armor Class of 17 and impressive hit points totaling 153, making it a resilient adversary in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 10, the Doom Golem is a significant threat, equipping it with powerful melee attacks and formidable special abilities. Its high Strength score of 24 grants it exceptional melee capabilities, while its Constitution score of 16 provides additional durability. However, its low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores indicate a lack of mental prowess and social interaction ability. The Doom Golem is immune to many forms of damage and conditions, making it a challenging opponent. Its strengths lie in its powerful attacks and fear-inducing aura, while its weaknesses include its inability to converse and a reliance on its creator for direction.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Doom Golem are as follows: it has a Strength of 24 (+7), resulting in exceptional physical attack and damage potential; a Dexterity of 13 (+1), which offers average agility; a Constitution of 16 (+3), providing good resilience; an Intelligence of 3 (-4), indicating very bad mental aptitude; a Wisdom of 10 (+0), reflecting average perception; and a Charisma of 1 (-5), showcasing very bad social ability.

The Doom Golem possesses several remarkable special abilities: 
- Its Fear Aura affects any non-evil creature within a 20-foot radius, forcing them to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in the creature being frightened until the start of its next turn, while success grants immunity to the aura for 24 hours.
- The Luminous Skeleton ability causes the golem to emit dim light in a 10-foot radius, enhancing visibility in dim conditions.
- Immutable Form makes the golem immune to any effect that would change its physical form, reinforcing its stability in combat.
- Magic Resistance provides the golem an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, increasing its survivability against spellcasters.
- All of its weapon attacks are considered magical, allowing it to bypass certain defenses that non-magical attacks cannot penetrate.

When it comes to actions, the Doom Golem can perform the following: 
- With its Multiattack, it can make one Bite attack and one Doom Claw attack in a single turn.
- The Doom Claw attack has a +11 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage and an additional 7 (2d6) cold damage on a hit.
- The Bite attack also has a +11 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing a substantial 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage.
- It can unleash Wind of Boreas, which has a recharge condition (5-6). This ability creates an arctic wind in a 15-foot radius or a 30-foot cone, forcing creatures in the area to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On failure, they take 38 (11d6) cold damage, or half on a successful save.

The Doom Golem also features a notable reaction called Doom Upon You. If it can see a creature within 60 feet that attacks it with a spell or ranged attack requiring a roll, the golem retaliates with a doom bolt. This attack mirrors the original in terms of effects and roll results but inflicts necrotic damage, making it a potent defensive mechanism.

Overall, the Doom Golem is a powerful adversary that combines physical strength, survivability, and a range of fear-inducing abilities to threaten any adventurers who cross its path.</detail>
