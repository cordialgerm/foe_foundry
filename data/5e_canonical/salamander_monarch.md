<detail>

The Salamander Monarch has the following attributes: strength 20 (+5), dexterity 18 (+4), constitution 18 (+4), intelligence 15 (+2), wisdom 14 (+2), and charisma 18 (+4). Its saving throws are particularly robust, with a +9 in Constitution and a +7 in Wisdom, categorizing them as very good. It also shows proficiency in arcana and intimidation skills, with +7 and +9 modifiers, respectively, making its interactions in social or knowledge-based scenarios average to good. This creature has damage vulnerabilities to cold, is immune to fire, and is resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. Its senses include darkvision up to 90 feet and a passive perception of 12, allowing it to remain aware of its surroundings even in darkness.

The Salamander Monarch possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The *Heated Body* ability allows any creature that touches it or strikes it in melee range to suffer 14 (4d6) fire damage, making it dangerous to engage up close. Its *Heated Weapons* ability provides an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage with any metal melee weapon it wields, which is already factored into its attacks. The *Inspiring Sovereign* ability grants advantage on melee attack rolls and saving throws to each salamander within 30 feet that can see the monarch, increasing the effectiveness of its allies significantly. Lastly, its *Innate Spellcasting* utilizes its high charisma modifier, allowing it to cast spells without material components. The spells it can cast three times per day are *flaming sphere* and *heat metal*, which can create significant area damage and inflict ongoing harm, respectively. It can also summon a fire elemental once per day with *conjure elemental*.

In terms of actions, the Salamander Monarch can perform a *Multiattack*, allowing it to strike twice in one turn with its powerful abilities. The *Tail* attack hits with a +9 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet, dealing 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage and an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage. It grapples its target, making escape particularly challenging with an escape DC of 18. The *Trident* attack also utilizes a +9 to hit, capable of being used either at a reach of five feet or at range, dealing 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage or 16 (2d10 + 5) when wielded with two hands, along with 7 (2d6) fire damage. Finally, *Immolating Crest* is a powerful area effect with a recharge of 6, forcing creatures in the vicinity to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in 28 (8d6) fire damage and potentially igniting the target, which leads to additional fire damage each turn until extinguished. This ability can significantly impact the battlefield by creating zones of danger and forcing tactical repositioning from opponents.</detail>

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The salamander monarch makes two attacks: one with its trident and one with its tail.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the salamander monarch can automatically hit the target with its tail, and the salamander monarch can’t make tail attacks against other targets.
- **Trident:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage or 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Immolating Crest (Recharge 6):** The salamander monarch causes its crest to flare with brilliant radiance, illuminating everything within 30 feet of it with a blue or green light. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) fire damage and catches on fire. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t catch on fire. Until a creature on fire takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
