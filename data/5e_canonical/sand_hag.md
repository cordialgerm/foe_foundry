<summary>The Sand Hag is a Medium-sized Fey creature known for its chaotic evil nature. As a formidable opponent, it boasts a combination of high hit points and strong defensive mechanisms, making it a challenging foe for adventurers. The Sand Hag's ability to manipulate the battlefield through spells, its agility in moving through sandy terrain, and its capacity to mimic sounds gives it a deceptive edge in combat. However, while it has strong offensive capabilities, its challenge rating of 6 indicates that it is best suited for mid-level parties, and it can be susceptible to well-coordinated strategies. </summary>

<detail>

The Sand Hag possesses the following attributes: a strength score of 18, granting it a +4 modifier, which is classified as very good for melee attacks. Its dexterity is 15 (+2 modifier), which provides it with good agility, while its constitution stands at 16 (+3 modifier), offering it resilience and moderate durability. The intelligence score is also a solid 16 (+3 modifier), allowing for effective tactical planning. Its wisdom of 14 (+2 modifier) provides average perception capabilities, and its charisma is 16 (+3 modifier), enabling it to effectively influence others and enhance its spellcasting. 

In terms of skills, the Sand Hag excels in Deception with a +6 modifier, making its lies very convincing, and in Stealth and Perception, both equipped with a +5 modifier, providing good effectiveness in sneaky maneuvers as well as situational awareness. It has exceptional darkvision that extends up to 120 feet and a passive perception of 15, making it highly perceptive in dim light.

The Sand Hag has several notable abilities:
- Magic Resistance gives it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very difficult to incapacitate with magical attacks.
- Mimicry allows the creature to imitate animal sounds and humanoid voices, which can be deceptive during encounters; creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check to discern the imitation.
- Scorpion Walk allows the hag to traverse sandy terrain without hindrance, enabling it to leave no tracks and granting tremorsense within a 30-foot radius, allowing it to locate creatures even when they are hidden.

In combat, the Sand Hag can perform the Multiattack action, allowing it to make three Claw attacks. Each Claw attack has a +7 to hit, reaching out to 5 feet, and deals 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage on a hit. If two Claw attacks target the same creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion, though it cannot suffer more than two levels in total from this effect.

Additionally, the Sand Hag can use Illusory Appearance to disguise itself and anything it carries, appearing as another creature of similar size and humanoid shape. This illusion remains in effect until it decides to end it or if it dies.

One of its most powerful actions, Scouring Sirocco, has a recharge mechanic and creates a powerful blast of hot wind and sand in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within this area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) slashing damage and 9 (2d8) fire damage while also being blinded on a failure. Successful saves reduce the damage by half and avoid the blinding effect, and blinded creatures can make a saving throw at the end of their turns to shake off the blindness. Until the start of the Sand Hag's next turn, the area is heavily obscured by the airborne sand.

Finally, the Sand Hag is a spellcaster that can use Charisma as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 14. Its at-will spell, Silent Image, allows it to create illusory images, while it can cast Hallucinatory Terrain and Major Image three times per day each, enhancing its ability to confuse and manipulate the environment to its advantage.</detail>
