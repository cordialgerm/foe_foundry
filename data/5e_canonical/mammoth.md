<summary>A Mammoth is a massive, woolly beast resembling an enormous elephant with long, curved tusks. These creatures once roamed icy tundras and cold forests, using their tusks to dig through snow and ice to reach vegetation. Mammoths are powerful and resilient, able to crush enemies with their weight or gore them with their tusks. Despite their size, they are generally peaceful herbivores, but they will defend their herd or territory with ferocity if threatened. Mammoths are symbols of strength and endurance in many cultures, revered for their size and majesty.</summary>
