<summary>A Mammoth is a massive, woolly beast resembling an enormous elephant with long, curved tusks. These creatures once roamed icy tundras and cold forests, using their tusks to dig through snow and ice to reach vegetation. Mammoths are powerful and resilient, able to crush enemies with their weight or gore them with their tusks. Despite their size, they are generally peaceful herbivores, but they will defend their herd or territory with ferocity if threatened. Mammoths are symbols of strength and endurance in many cultures, revered for their size and majesty.</summary>

<summary>The Mammoth is a massive creature representing a powerful and persistent force on the battlefield. As a Huge Beast with significant hit points and a formidable challenge rating, it excels in melee combat, capable of dealing heavy damage through its physical attacks. With a strong Strength score of 24, it has exceptional modifiers for its attack rolls and damage, making it a reliable frontline fighter. However, its low Dexterity score indicates that it may struggle with agility and evasive maneuvers. Despite its strengths in raw power, the Mammoth's limited intelligence and charisma scores suggest that it may not be particularly adept in social interactions or complex strategies.</summary>

<detail>

The Mammoth has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average; this means it can be hit relatively easily by attackers. It possesses 115 hit points, calculated as 10d12 plus 50, allowing it to endure considerable punishment before falling in battle. The Mammoth's walk speed is 40 feet, enabling it to traverse the battlefield effectively and engage enemies quickly.

In combat, the Mammoth has two primary melee attack options: Gore and Stomp. The Gore attack is a melee weapon attack that allows the Mammoth to hit with a +10 bonus, reaching out to 10 feet to target a foe. This attack deals 23 piercing damage, derived from rolling 3d10 and adding 7, and has an additional effect—if the Mammoth moves at least 20 feet towards the target before the attack, the target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. Failure results in the target falling prone, which can significantly disadvantage them in the ensuing combat. The Stomp attack operates similarly, with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, resulting in the same damage output of 23 bludgeoning damage.

The Mammoth can also utilize its bonus actions to increase its combat effectiveness. The Trample ability allows it to make a Stomp attack against any creature that is already prone, adding to its offensive capability against immobilized foes. Additionally, the Trunk Fling is another melee attack with a +8 bonus that allows the Mammoth to strike at a target within 5 feet. This attack deals 10 bludgeoning damage, derived from a 1d6 roll plus 7, and has the unique effect of pushing a Large or smaller creature 10 feet away from the Mammoth, knocking them prone, which can further control the battlefield dynamics.

Overall, the Mammoth’s combination of high damage output and ability to control opponents makes it a fearsome opponent in any encounter, particularly in environments that allow it to leverage its massive size and strength effectively.

The mammoth is a huge beast characterized by its formidable physical presence and powerful offensive capabilities. With an Armor Class of 13, it has average defensive capability, but its 133 hit points provide it significant durability in combat, allowing it to absorb a considerable amount of damage before being defeated. The mammoth is primarily a melee attacker, boasting a Challenge Rating of 6 which makes it a challenging foe for lower-level adventurers. It has an exceptional Strength value of +6, giving it powerful attacks, but its Dexterity is poor at -1, making it less agile and prone to difficulty with dexterity-based actions or avoiding area effects. Notable abilities include its capacity to trample foes, a powerful multiattack mechanism, and unique grappling capabilities, which provide it with various tactical options in battle.

The mammoth has the following attributes: 
- Strength: +6 (exceptional)
- Dexterity: -1 (bad)
- Constitution: +5 (very good)
- Intelligence: -4 (very bad)
- Wisdom: +0 (average)
- Charisma: -2 (bad)

For senses, the mammoth relies on perception with a score of 13, which is average, and has a stealth score of 9, indicating it is very poor in stealthy situations. The creature does not possess the ability to communicate in any language.

One of the mammoth's special abilities is called Trampling Charge. This ability allows the mammoth to gain a significant advantage in combat. If it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and successfully hits it with a Gore attack in the same turn, the target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 17. Failure results in the target being knocked prone, allowing the mammoth to follow up with a Stomp attack as a bonus action. This ability emphasizes the mammoth's power and can drastically alter the flow of combat by incapacitating opponents.

In terms of actions, the mammoth can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Gore attacks. The Gore attack itself is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. If it successfully hits a target, the attack deals significant damage of 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage. The Stomp attack can only be made against creatures that are prone with a similar +9 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. Both attacks highlight the mammoth’s devastating melee prowess.

For bonus actions, the mammoth can utilize Trunk Grab, enabling it to grab one Large or smaller creature within 10 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against a DC of 17 or become grappled, restraining it. The escape DC for this grapple is also 17. Until the grapple ends, the mammoth cannot grab another creature, which allows it to control the battlefield effectively but limits its versatility in grappling multiple foes at once. 

Overall, the mammoth is a powerful beast that excels in direct confrontations, utilizing its massive size and strength to dominate opponents on the battlefield.</detail>
