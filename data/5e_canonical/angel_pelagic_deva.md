<summary>The Pelagic Deva is a Medium-sized celestial creature that embodies the ideals of neutrality and goodness. As a guardian of the seas, it is known for its unique ability to thrive in both water and air, showcasing an impressive range of mobility with a swimming speed of 90 feet while walking at a modest 20 feet. The Pelagic Deva possesses strong attributes across the board, with exceptional Charisma and Wisdom that enhance its spellcasting and influence. It has a solid collection of special abilities and defenses, including powerful magical weapon attacks, damage resistance to cold and radiant damage, and immunities to common conditions like being charmed or frightened. Its resilience and combat capabilities make it a formidable presence in any encounter, especially in aquatic realms, but it may be outmatched in aerial engagements due to limited mobility on land.</summary>

<detail>

The Pelagic Deva has an Armor Class of 17 due to its Living Coral Armor, which is fairly good, and it has an impressive total of 142 hit points, indicating strong durability in combat. It has a Challenge Rating of 11, which means it is intended for parties of moderate-to-advanced levels, offering up to 7,200 experience points for defeat.

The ability scores are as follows: Strength is 19 (+4) which is very good for melee effectiveness; Dexterity is 18 (+4) making it quite agile; Constitution is 20 (+5) providing exceptional resilience; Intelligence is 17 (+3) reflecting decent cunning; Wisdom is 20 (+5) indicating exceptional perception; and Charisma is 22 (+6), which is exceptional for spellcasting and influencing others.

The Pelagic Deva benefits from saving throws with a Strength bonus of +8, a Wisdom bonus of +9, and a Charisma bonus of +1, which are generally strong, although the latter may be somewhat less effective. It has proficiency in the Perception skill with a total modifier of +5, which is good, while it can see through darkness with 120 feet of darkvision and has a passive Perception score of 19.

Special abilities include:

- Amphibious: The Pelagic Deva can breathe both air and water, allowing it to operate effectively in aquatic environments.
- Angelic Weapons: All weapon attacks made by the deva are magical, adding an additional 4d8 radiant damage to every hit, which significantly increases its offensive output.
- Immortal Nature: The deva does not require food, drink, or sleep, making it a constant presence in its domain.
- Living Coral Armor: This unique armor can self-repair if damaged within a minute, as long as it has not been completely destroyed, contributing to its durability.
- Magic Resistance: The deva has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it particularly difficult to influence with magic.

In combat actions, the Pelagic Deva can make multiple attacks and has the following:

- Multiattack: It can make three attacks with its Trident each turn.
- Trident: This is a melee or ranged weapon attack with a +8 to hit. It deals 7 piercing damage (1d6+4) and an additional 18 radiant damage (4d8). If used in ranged mode, the trident returns to the deva's hand at the start of its next turn.

The Pelagic Deva also has special abilities to manipulate the battlefield:

- Transforming Touch (5/day): This ability allows the deva to polymorph a willing creature into a giant octopus, hunter shark, or plesiosaurus for up to 8 hours. This transformation can be reverted by the transformed creature or if it dies. The target retains its alignment and mental abilities but adopts the physical characteristics of the new form, which provides strategic advantages based on the environment.

As a bonus action, the Pelagic Deva can use:

- Anoxic Aura (1/day): This creates a 20-foot radius effect where the deva can remove oxygen from the surrounding water for one minute. Any creature that requires oxygen and starts its turn within this area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or begin to suffocate, while the deva itself is unaffected. The ability can be especially devastating to air-breathing creatures, forcing them to either find an escape or risk suffocation.

Overall, the Pelagic Deva is an effective guardian of aquatic realms, capable of both offense and support in combat scenarios while being resilient to many types of threats.</detail>
