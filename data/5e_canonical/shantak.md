<summary>The Shantak is a formidable large monstrosity characterized by its lawful evil alignment. It boasts an impressive array of physical and magical capabilities that make it a significant threat in combat. With a strong Armor Class of 16 and a substantial Hit Points pool of 123, the Shantak can withstand considerable damage. Its ability to fly at 60 feet and walk at 10 feet grants it excellent mobility, allowing it to maneuver effectively during encounters. The Shantak's Challenge Rating of 5 suggests that it presents a moderate-to-high level of challenge to adventurers, depending on the party's composition and tactics. Notable strengths include its high Strength and Constitution scores, which enhance its combat effectiveness and durability, as well as a suite of special abilities that provide it with advantages in various situations. However, its lower Intelligence and Charisma scores indicate weaknesses in social and mental contests, making it less versatile outside of combat.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Shantak has the following values: Strength 18 (+4) which is very good, Dexterity 12 (+1) which is average, Constitution 18 (+4) also very good, Intelligence 6 (-2) which is very bad, Wisdom 14 (+2) which is good, and Charisma 8 (-1) which is bad. Its saving throws are notably strong, with Constitution at +7 and Wisdom at +5, making it particularly resilient against poisons and magical effects that target those attributes. The Shantak's skill in perception is enhanced by its +5 modifier, allowing it to notice hidden creatures or traps effectively. It has damage resistance to necrotic damage, giving it a layer of protection against certain spellcasters and similar threats. The creature possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light and granting it a passive perception score of 15.

The Shantak possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Eldritch Sight allows it to see through magical darkness, making it undeterred by such obstacles. Flyby enables the Shantak to move out of an enemy's reach without provoking opportunity attacks, making its hit-and-run tactics more effective. With Keen Sight and Smell, the Shantak has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to those senses, increasing its ability to track down prey. Its Magic Resistance provides an advantage on saving throws against spells, reducing its vulnerability to magical attacks. Pack Tactics allows it to gain advantage on attack rolls if an ally is nearby, reinforcing the effectiveness of coordinated attacks. Lastly, its Unctuous Hide grants a slippery surface for riders, granting both strategic benefits in keeping riders mounted and potential challenges in managing their positions during tumultuous encounters.

In terms of actions, the Shantak can perform a Multiattack, making two attacks per turnâ€”a bite and a pair of talons. The Bite attack has a modifier of +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 11 piercing damage plus an additional 5 necrotic damage. The Talons attack also has a +7 to hit, inflicting 13 slashing damage with an extra 5 necrotic damage, showcasing its capacity to both deal regular damage and inflict additional magical harm. The Shantak can also use its Insane Tittering ability, which recharges on a roll of 4-6. This action releases a terrifying screech that can frighten non-Shantak creatures within 60 feet. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to resist being frightened until the end of the Shantak's next turn, adding a significant layer of crowd control to its combat strategy, while allowing the Shantak to choose whether or not to include its rider in the effect.</detail>
