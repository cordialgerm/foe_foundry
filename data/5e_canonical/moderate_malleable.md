<summary>The Moderate Malleable is a large aberration with chaotic evil tendencies, presenting a significant challenge for adventurers. With a relatively high armor class of 12 provided by its natural armor and 136 hit points, the Moderate Malleable proves to be a resilient foe in combat. Its movement capability allows for climbing and walking at a speed of 30 feet, making it versatile in navigating different terrains. Its challenge rating of 5 indicates a moderate threat level, with players earning 1,800 experience points upon defeat. This creature excels in psychic abilities, boasting immunities against psychic damage and conditions like being blinded or prone, while it is adept at absorbing and merging with minor malleables, enhancing its own health and capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The creature has impressive Strength at 18, giving it a good modifier of +4 for physical attacks, and a strong Constitution of 16 with a +3 modifier, making it tough and hard to take down. However, its Dexterity is low at 8, resulting in a bad -1 modifier, leaving it vulnerable to certain attacks that rely on agility. It has a respectable Intelligence of 17, equipping it with a +3 modifier for intelligence-based tasks, and Wisdom at 15, granting a +2 modifier for wisdom saving throws and perception checks. Its Charisma is average at 10, providing no advantages or disadvantages.

The Moderate Malleable features several notable abilities. "Absorb Malleable" allows it to absorb a nearby minor malleable, gaining health equivalent to that creature's remaining hit points, and inheriting any effects affecting the absorbed creature. With its "Amorphous" trait, it can pass through openings as narrow as one inch, which makes it difficult to corner or evade. Through "Controlled Mutability," it can temporarily alter its shape while retaining its core appearance as an inside-out fleshy creature, though without gaining any abilities from assumed forms. "Psychic Absorption" enhances its resilience to psychic attacks, converting damage into healing. Its "Spider Climb" allows it to maneuver effortlessly on difficult surfaces, making it more unpredictable during battles.

In terms of actions during combat, the Moderate Malleable can perform a multiattack, utilizing two "Flesh Tendril" strikes. Each tendril attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 modifier to hit, capable of inflicting an average of 14 bludgeoning damage. If it grapples a target, escape requires a DC 14 strength check. The "Psychic Drain" action compels a grappled target to make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw, dealing an average of 22 psychic damage on a fail and reducing the target's hit point maximum based on the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target completes a long rest, and if their hit point maximum drops to zero, they transform into a minor malleable. 

The "Join Malleables" action lets multiple Moderate Malleables combine their forms to create a larger entity, sharing health and conditions among them. Each can use it when within 10 feet of the others, allowing for tactical group dynamics. Conversely, "Separate Malleables" permits the Moderate Malleable to divide into four minor malleables, distributing its health and conditions to the new entities while maintaining the same initiative count.

As a reaction, the Moderate Malleable can trigger "Sudden Separation" if it suffers 10 or more damage from a single attack. This allows it to split into minor malleables, with the damage evenly spread among the new entities, which can also lead to strategic repositioning and engagement in combat. Overall, the Moderate Malleable poses a multifaceted threat that can absorb and divide, making it a challenging adversary in combat scenarios.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Absorb Malleable:** As a bonus action, the moderate malleable absorbs one minor malleable within 5 feet of it into its body, regaining a number of hp equal to the minor malleable’s remaining hp. The moderate malleable is affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects that were affecting the absorbed malleable.
- **Amorphous:** The malleable can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Controlled Mutability:** Any spell or effect that would alter the malleable’s form only alters it until the end of the malleable’s next turn. Afterwards, the malleable returns to its amorphous form. In addition, the malleable can use its action to change itself into any shape, but it always looks like an inside-out fleshy creature no matter the shape it takes. If it changes into the shape of a creature, it doesn’t gain any statistics or special abilities of that creature; it only takes on the creature’s basic shape and general appearance.
- **Psychic Absorption:** Whenever the malleable is subjected to psychic damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hp equal to the psychic damage dealt.
- **Spider Climb:** The malleable can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The malleable makes two flesh tendril attacks.
- **Flesh Tendril:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 14).
- **Psychic Drain:** One creature grappled by the malleable must make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies and becomes a minor malleable if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Join Malleables:** As long as the malleable is within 10 feet of at least one other moderate malleable, each moderate malleable in range can use this action option at the same time to join together to create a larger malleable. The new malleable’s hp total is equal to the combined hp total of all the moderate malleables, and it is affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects currently affecting any of the moderate malleables. The new malleable acts on the same initiative count as the malleables that formed it and occupies any unoccupied space that previously contained at least one of the malleables that formed it. <br>* Two moderate malleables can join to create one major malleable. <br>* Four moderate malleables can join to create one massive malleable.
- **Separate Malleables:** The moderate malleable can split into four minor malleables. The new malleables’ hp totals are equal to the moderate malleable’s hp total divided by 4 (rounded down) and are affected by any conditions, spells, and other magical effects that affected the moderate malleable. The new malleables act on the same initiative count as the moderate malleable and occupy any unoccupied space that previously contained the moderate malleable.

### Reactions

- **Sudden Separation:** When the moderate malleable takes 10 damage or more from a single attack, it can choose to immediately use Separate Malleables. If it does so, the damage is divided evenly among the separate malleables it becomes.
