<summary>The Young Wasteland Dragon is a large, chaotic evil creature that poses a significant threat in combat. With its high armor class and substantial hit points, it can withstand considerable damage while still delivering powerful attacks. Its burrowing and climbing abilities, combined with impressive flying speed, make it incredibly mobile in various terrains. The dragon is noted for its potent Warped Energy Breath attack, which can devastate multiple foes at once, showcasing its prowess in area damage. While it lacks powerful dexterity, its strength and constitution are exceptionally high, allowing it to dominate in melee situations. However, it does have weaknesses, particularly its moderate intelligence and wisdom, which can make it susceptible to certain forms of manipulation or strategic play.</summary>

<detail>

The Young Wasteland Dragon has an armor class of 18, representing a good level of protection due to its natural armor. It has a total of 178 hit points, calculated from 17d10 plus 85, which makes it very durable in prolonged fights. The dragon is categorized as a challenge rating 9, equating to 5,000 experience points for defeat. 

In terms of attributes, the Young Wasteland Dragon excels in physical strength and constitution with scores of 21, yielding a modifier of +5, which is very good. Its dexterity is average with a score of 10, resulting in a +0 modifier. Intelligence is 12, giving a +1 modifier, while wisdom is similarly 11, also resulting in a +0 modifier. Charisma, at 12, provides a +1 modifier, which is average in effectiveness.

The dragon's saving throws include a +4 in Dexterity, +9 in Constitution, +4 in Wisdom, and +5 in Charisma. These values indicate that the dragon is exceptionally resilient, particularly against effects that target its constitution.

In terms of skills, it has a +4 in both perception and stealth, which allows the dragon to be stealthy and perceptive when navigating its surroundings.

The Young Wasteland Dragon possesses damage immunity to force damage, indicating it is completely unaffected by attacks of this type. Its senses include blindsight at a range of 30 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet, making it adept in low-light conditions. The dragon also has a passive perception of 14, which allows it to notice hidden creatures effectively. Furthermore, it can communicate in Common and Draconic languages.

The claw attacks also have a +9 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 12 points of slashing damage each, calculated as 2d6 plus 5.

The dragon features a special ability known as Warped Energy Breath, which has a recharge requirement of 6 (meaning it can only be used again after recharging). This ability unleashes a line of warped arcane energy up to 40 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature caught in this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 49 points of force damage, calculated as 11d8. A successful save results in the creature taking half damage. This powerhouse attack can shift the tide of combat, allowing the dragon to target multiple enemies with devastating force damage.</detail>
