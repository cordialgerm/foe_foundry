<summary>An Owl is a nocturnal bird of prey known for its sharp talons, silent flight, and keen eyesight. These creatures are often found in forests, mountains, or other natural settings, where they hunt small rodents, insects, and other animals. Owls are solitary hunters, using their stealth and agility to swoop down on unsuspecting prey in the dead of night. Despite their small size, they are effective predators, and their quiet flight makes them difficult to detect. In magical settings, owls are often used as familiars by spellcasters due to their intelligence and perceptiveness.</summary>
