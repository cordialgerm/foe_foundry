In terms of special abilities, the Empusa has several notable traits. The first is "Ambusher," which grants the Empusa advantage on attack rolls during the first round of combat against any creature it has managed to surprise, making it deadly in ambush situations. "Magical Copper" indicates that its claw and kick attacks are magical in nature, bypassing certain resistances. The "Nimble Fighter" ability allows the Empusa to take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each turn, enhancing its mobility in combat significantly, allowing for both attack and retreat tactics without losing momentum. The "Shapechanger" ability allows the Empusa to polymorph into a Small or Medium beast with a challenge rating no higher than its own. This transformation keeps its statistics consistent aside from size, allowing it to blend into environments or escape from threats effectively, while the transformed form retains a coppery color on at least one limb.

In combat, the Empusa’s primary method of attack is through its Multiattack option, wherein it can perform two claw attacks or one claw and one kick attack each turn. The claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 14 slashing damage on a hit, making it a potent threat. The kick attack, also with a +8 to hit, deals 12 bludgeoning damage and forces the target to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On failure, this kick can push the target back up to 10 feet and knock them prone, giving the Empusa control over the battlefield and potentially setting up further attacks.

Overall, the Empusa is a dangerous foe with a blend of physical prowess, magical attacks, and strategic capabilities that highlight its nature as a chaotic evil creature, making it a memorable adversary for any adventuring party.</detail>
