<detail>

The Black Crier has the following attributes:
- Strength: 14, which provides a good melee attack modifier of +2.
- Dexterity: 19, offering an exceptional modifier of +4, enhancing its agility in combat.
- Constitution: 16 grants a very good +3 modifier contributing to its health pool.
- Intelligence: 11, providing an average modifier of +0, indicating limited cognitive skills.
- Wisdom: 20 supplies an exceptional +5 modifier, reflecting its keen insight and perception.
- Charisma: 12 results in a bad +1 modifier, indicating it lacks persuasive abilities.

In terms of saving throws, the Black Crier is proficient in Dexterity (+8), Wisdom (+9), and Intelligence (+4). Its skill set includes notable proficiencies in history (+4), perception (+9), performance (+9), and religion (+4), emphasizing its depth of knowledge and insight. The creature's darkvision allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, while a passive perception of 15 aids in detecting hidden threats.

The Black Crier possesses the following special abilities:
- Bound by Calamity: This ability ties the Black Crier to a specified region where a calamity is destined to occur. If it strays beyond its bounds for over 24 hours, it loses its Rejuvenation trait and Crier's Lament action, leading to permanent death.
- Rejuvenation: If the Black Crier is slain within its designated area before the catastrophe occurs, it will resurrect in 1d6 days with full hit points. This cycle concludes once the predicted disaster has transpired, and only a wish spell can bypass this trait.

During combat, the Black Crier can perform the following actions:
- Multiattack: This allows the creature to use its Bell Toll ability and then make two melee attacks.
- Bell: This melee weapon attack has a +8 to hit and targets one enemy within a 5-foot reach, dealing 7 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 14 necrotic damage.
- Bell Toll: The Black Crier can target a creature within 60 feet, forcing them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the victim suffers 14 necrotic damage and becomes frightened until the end of their next turn. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also gains one level of exhaustion, making it significantly more vulnerable in future encounters. On a successful save, the target only takes half damage and remains unfrightened.
- Crier’s Lament (1/Day): This potent ability produces a frightful wave in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. A failing creature is immediately reduced to 0 hit points, while a successful one suffers 21 psychic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can attempt to shake off this effect at the end of its turns.

The Black Crier is a strategically complex foe due to its abilities that manipulate both the battlefield and the emotional state of adventurers, making encounters with it a unique and challenging experience for players.</detail>

### Special Abilities

If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target suffers one level of exhaustion.
- **Crier’s Lament (1/Day):** The black crier unleashes a devastating peal of anguish and rage in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature drops to 0 hp. On a success, a creature takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
