<MonsterName/>Dipsa</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Ooze</CreatureType>

<summary>The Dipsa is a small, but cunning ooze, characterized by its unique ability to blend into swampy environments and its stealthy attack methods. As a Tiny creature, it relies on its exceptional Dexterity and stealth capabilities to avoid detection. With a Challenge Rating of 1/4, it poses a minor threat to adventurers, yet its capabilities can become significant when utilized effectively in ambush scenarios. One of its notable strengths is its ability to attach itself to larger creatures, dealing ongoing damage and potentially reducing their maximum hit points. However, its physical strength is very poor, making it vulnerable in direct confrontations. Due to its nature as an ooze, it also has many immunities that allow it to evade various detrimental effects.</summary>

<detail>

The Dipsa has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good for a creature of its size, allowing it to withstand some attacks. It has 27 hit points, represented by rolling 6d4 plus an additional 12, giving it an average resilience for its challenge rating. The Dipsa's movement speed is only 20 feet, which is somewhat limited compared to others, but the creature compensates for this with mobility through tight spaces due to its Amorphous trait.

In terms of attributes, the Dipsa possesses a Strength score of 3, which translates into a modifier of -4, making it exceptionally weak in physical confrontations. Its Dexterity score of 17 results in a +3 modifier, providing it with a significantly good ability to evade detection and attacks. The Constitution score of 14 gives it a +2 modifier, contributing to its durability. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are notably low, with modifiers of -5, -2, and -5 respectively, making it very bad at tasks requiring intelligence or social interaction.

The Dipsa shines with its special abilities. The Amorphous ability allows it to slip through cracks as small as 1 inch wide without hindrance, enhancing its stealthy approach. The Discreet Bite is a particular mechanical highlight, as it makes the Dipsa’s attacks almost undetectable, allowing it to surprise unsuspecting foes. A target struck by its bite must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the Dipsa, with added complications if they've sustained acid damage from it. The ability to not require sleep permits the Dipsa to remain active for lengthy periods, staying vigilant for its next opportunity to ambush. Lastly, its Swamp Camouflage grants an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in swampy terrain, leveraging its environment to remain hidden.

In terms of actions, the Dipsa can attack with its Bite, which has a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. This attack does 1 piercing damage, and critically, it allows the Dipsa to attach itself to the target. While attached, the Dipsa cannot attack directly but inflicts ongoing acid damage at the start of each of its turns. The target takes 3 acid damage and must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to keep its maximum hit points from being reduced. This reduction can be detrimental, as it persists until the target takes a long rest, and it can lead to death if the maximum hit points are reduced to zero.

As a bonus action, the Dipsa can take the Translucent ability to hide, which enables it to become even more difficult to detect, adding to its overall stealthy capabilities.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The dipsa can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Discreet Bite:** The bite of a dipsa is barely perceptible and the wound is quickly anesthetized. When the dipsa hits with a Bite attack, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the dipsa and its attack. Each time the creature takes acid damage from an attached dipsa, it can repeat this check, noticing the dipsa on a success. A creature that takes acid damage from the dipsa while below half its hp maximum automatically succeeds on this check.
- **Ooze Nature:** The dipsa doesn’t require sleep.
- **Swamp Camouflage:** The dipsa has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy terrain.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the dipsa attaches to the target. While attached, the dipsa can’t attack, and at the start of each of the dipsa’s turns, the target takes 3 (1d6) acid damage and must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have its hp maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.

### Bonus Actions

- **Translucent:** The dipsa takes the Hide action.
