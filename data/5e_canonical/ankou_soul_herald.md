<summary>The Ankou Soul Herald is a gargantuan dragon of neutral alignment, known for its powerful presence and unique abilities that revolve around necromancy and manipulation of shadows. With an impressive Armor Class of 18 and an extensive pool of Hit Points at 407, the Ankou is designed to withstand significant damage while delivering devastating attacks.

This creature embodies a blend of draconic strength and celestial powers, making it a complex adversary in combat. It possesses inherent weaknesses to radiant damage, which can be exploited by clever opponents. Particularly notable are its abilities that hinder the use of necromancy and can wreak havoc on undead creatures, rendering it an effective foe on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Ankou demonstrates exceptional physical strength with a Strength score of 25 (+7), a very good Constitution score of 27 (+8) that allows for high resilience, and good scores in Wisdom and Charisma, indicating a strong mental and social presence. It has an average Dexterity of 10 (+0) meaning that it won't excel in reactions or agility. Its saving throw bonuses are notably high; it possesses exceptional bonuses in Constitution (+15) and solid ones in Wisdom (+11) and Charisma (+11), making it difficult to debilitate through magical means. The Ankou has a passive perception score of 28 due to its high Wisdom, showcasing its acute awareness of its environment.

The Ankou Soul Herald boasts several special abilities. Its *Aura of Necromancy’s Bane* prohibits necromancy spells from being cast within 120 feet, while forcing undead creatures that enter a 30-foot radius to make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in significant radiant damage, making the Ankou a deadly foe against such creatures. The *Cloak of Ghostly Shadows* ability allows it to become invisible in dim light or darkness, granting the Ankou several resistances and immunity to various conditions. This not only enhances its survivability but also allows the creature to phase through obstacles, showcasing its ghostly nature. 

In terms of actions, the Ankou can make three attacks as part of its *Multiattack*, including a powerful bite that deals both piercing and cold damage and two claws attacks that inflict slashing damage. Its *Horrifying Presence* ability forces creatures within 120 feet to make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw, potentially frightening them or paralyzing them upon failure. The *Reaper’s Breath* is a devastating line attack with a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, capable of imposing significant cold or radiant damage depending on the creature type, making it incredibly effective against both living and undead foes. Additionally, its *Change Shape* ability allows it to polymorph into various forms, providing versatility in combat and exploration. Lastly, the *Usher of Souls* ability enables the Ankou to transport itself and other creatures to different planes of existence, adding a layer of complexity to encounters.

For its legendary actions, the Ankou can use *Detect* to sense the location of living or undead creatures, a useful strategic advantage in combat. The *Tail Attack* action allows it to inflict damage without using its regular action, maintaining constant pressure on its opponents. Lastly, *Envelope in Shadow* lets the Ankou move stealthily and deal necrotic damage to foes it crosses, supplementing its already fearsome arsenal of tactics and enhancing its threat level in combat scenarios.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Aura of Necromancy's Bane:** Necromancy spells can't be cast within 120 feet of the ankou. When an undead creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the ankou, it must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Cloak of Ghostly Shadows:** As a bonus action while in dim light or darkness, the ankou becomes invisible. While invisible, the ankou has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and gains the following:
Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lighting, thunder; bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
Immunity to the grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, and restrained conditions
The ankou can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
The cloak of ghostly shadows ends when the ankou chooses to end it as a bonus action, when the ankou dies, or if the ankou ends its turn in bright light.
- **Death's Apotheosis:** The ankou has the celestial type in addition to the dragon type and its weapon attacks are magical.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the ankou fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ankou can use its Horrifying Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) cold damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
- **Horrifying Presence:** Each creature of the ankou's choice that is within 120 feet of it must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, its speed is reduced to 0 for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the creature is instead paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the ankou's Horrifying Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Reaper's Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The ankou exhales cold fire in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead creatures automatically fail the saving throw and treat all damage dealt by this breath weapon as radiant instead of cold.
- **Change Shape:** The ankou magically polymorphs into any beast, humanoid, or undead creature it has seen before that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the ankou's choice). Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form and it doesn't gain any class features or legendary actions of the new form.
- **Usher of Souls:** The ankou can transport itself and up to eight creatures in contact with it to another plane of existence. This works like the plane shift spell, except dead or incorporeal creatures can be transported and don't have to be willing. The ankou can't use this ability to banish an unwilling creature.

The ankou can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The ankou regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The ankou learns the location of all living creatures within 120 feet. Alternatively, it can learn the location of all undead creatures or creatures that have been dead no longer than 1 hour within 1 mile.
- **Tail Attack:** The ankou makes a tail attack.
- **Envelope in Shadow (Costs 2 Actions):** The ankou moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Any creature whose space it moves through must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
