<summary>The Cavefish Zombie is a Medium-sized undead creature, characterized as neutral evil in alignment. This macabre entity is a reanimated fish that retains some semblance of its life beneath the water's surface. With an Armor Class of 10, it is relatively easy to hit, making it vulnerable to physical attacks. It possesses 37 hit points, calculated from rolling five eight-sided dice and adding fifteen, which provides it a decent amount of survivability for its challenge rating of 1/2, equating to 100 experience points. The Cavefish Zombie thrives in aquatic environments, swimming with a speed of 40 feet and moving on land at 20 feet. Its strengths lie in its ability to inflict poison through its stench and its remarkable resilience due to its Undead Fortitude ability, allowing it to potentially avoid death. However, it is somewhat limited in its versatility, having a low Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma which severely restrict its interactions and decision-making in gameplay.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Cavefish Zombie include Strength at 15, which provides a good modifier of +2, Dexterity at 10 rendering it average with a modifier of +0, Constitution at 16 granting a very good modifier of +3, Intelligence at 3 with a very bad modifier of -4, Wisdom at 6 leading to a very bad modifier of -2, and Charisma at 3 also resulting in a very bad modifier of -4. This mix of stats makes the creature potent in close combat but incompetent in mental and social encounters. The saving throws provided include only Wisdom at +0, demonstrating a lack of resistance to effects that require mental resilience. 

In terms of abilities, the Cavefish Zombie has Damage Immunities to poison, indicating it cannot be harmed by poison damage, and Condition Immunities to being poisoned, meaning it cannot suffer from the poisoned condition. It has darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, though it has a low passive Perception score of 8, making it fairly inept at noticing hidden things. The creature understands the languages it knew while alive but does not have the capability to speak.

Among its special abilities, the Stench is particularly noteworthy. Any creature that begins its turn within five feet of the Cavefish Zombie must roll a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. A failure results in the creature being poisoned until the start of its next turn, which can be detrimental in combat as it imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. If the creature succeeds, it becomes immune to the Stench effect for 24 hours.

The Cavefish Zombie's Undead Fortitude allows it to potentially evade death. If the zombie takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it makes a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 5 plus the damage taken, unless the source is radiant damage or a critical hit. A successful saving throw means it instead drops to 1 hit point, allowing it to remain in combat longer.

In terms of actions, the Cavefish Zombie can perform a simple Slam attack, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit against a target within five feet. On a successful hit, it deals 5 points of bludgeoning damage, calculated using a six-sided die plus its Strength modifier. This attack is its primary means of engaging in combat, leveraging its Strength to deal damage effectively.</detail>
