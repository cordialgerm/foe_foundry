<summary>The Guardian is a large humanoid creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. It serves as a powerful protector and combatant, making it a formidable foe in encounters. Its defining strengths lie in its excellent physical attributes, with notably high Strength and Constitution, which make it quite capable in melee combat. The Guardian also benefits from immunities to charm and fright effects and possesses a keen sense of perception in darkness, bolstering its effectiveness in stealthy or ambush scenarios. However, it exhibits weaknesses, particularly when exposed to sunlight, where it suffers disadvantages on attacks and sight-based perception checks. With a challenge rating of 4, it presents a significant threat to lower-level adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Guardian has an Armor Class of 15, which provides it with a good level of defense against attacks. It has 110 hit points, translating to a robust durability in encounters. Its movement speed is average at 30 feet per turn. The creature possesses exceptional Strength at 18, yielding a +4 modifier, making its melee attacks particularly dangerous. Its Dexterity of 14 gives it a +2 modifier, allowing for average agility in combat situations. With a Constitution score of 16 and a +3 modifier, it can sustain hefty damage during battles. However, its Intelligence is only 6 (-2 modifier), showcasing it as rather foolish or simple-minded. It has a Wisdom score of 14 (+2), which offers good insight and perception abilities, while its Charisma of 8 (-1) indicates a lack of social influence.

For saving throws, the Guardian has a +6 bonus to Strength and a +5 bonus to Constitution, both considered good, enabling it to resist physical and endurance-related threats effectively. In terms of skills, it has proficiency in Athletics with a +6 bonus and Perception with a +4 bonus, both of which are also good, making it a competent tracker and grappler. The creature is immune to being charmed and frightened, which enhances its stability in combat.

The Guardian possesses several notable special abilities. The Fey Ancestry trait grants it advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and it cannot be put to sleep through magical means. Its ability called Shadow’s Vigil permits it to have advantage on Perception checks, allowing it to remain aware of its surroundings even in magical darkness, which does not affect its darkvision. However, it suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based Wisdom checks when exposed to sunlight. 

In combat, the Guardian can launch multiple attacks, performing a Multiattack where it can make two attacks with either a Pike or a Javelin. With the Pike, it has a +6 to hit and can reach up to 10 feet, dealing 15 piercing damage on a successful hit (2d10 + 4). Alternatively, it can use a Javelin as either a melee or ranged weapon with the same attack bonus, capable of reaching 5 feet or launching at a range of 30 to 120 feet, dealing 11 piercing damage on a hit (2d6 + 4).

The Guardian can also perform a bonus action known as Shadow Traveler, which can be used twice per day. While in shadowy or dark environments, it can vanish and reappear in a space it can see within 30 feet, leaving behind a tendril of ink-like smoke that marks its departure and arrival.

Finally, it can utilize the Protective Interference reaction, which allows it to impose disadvantage on an attack directed at a friendly creature within 5 feet, provided it can see the attacker and wields a melee weapon. This ability enhances its role as a protector in combat situations, making it an ally worth having in a fiercer fight.</detail>
