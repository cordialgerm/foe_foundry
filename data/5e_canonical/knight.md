<summary>A Knight is a heavily armored warrior, typically sworn to a code of chivalry or loyalty to a noble lord. Clad in plate armor and wielding a sword, lance, or shield, Knights are trained from a young age in combat, riding, and leadership. They often serve as commanders in armies or protectors of the realm, upholding justice and honor. Knights are disciplined and skilled in both mounted and foot combat, and they fight with a sense of duty and purpose. Though noble in their ideals, some Knights may be driven by personal ambition or the demands of their lords.</summary>

<summary>The Knight is a Medium humanoid known for their combat prowess and leadership on the battlefield. With a formidable armor class of 18 and a solid pool of hit points totaling 52, the Knight excels in melee combat, capable of delivering significant damage with their greatsword or lance while also offering support to allies. Their challenge rating of 3 makes them a strong opponent for mid-level adventurers. Notably, the Knight possesses the special ability "Brave," allowing them to stand firm against fear effects. However, while their Dexterity is average, they are primarily built to engage directly in combat with strength and tactical thinking, which makes them quite effective in their role as a frontline warrior.</summary>

<detail>

The Knight's abilities are summarized in the following attributes:

- Strength: 16 (+3) - This is an exceptional modifier, allowing for heavy melee damage and effective use of physical skills like athletics.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1) - This is an average modifier, giving a minor boost to ranged attacks and defense but not significantly enhancing their combat capabilities.
- Constitution: 14 (+2) - This is a good modifier, improving their survivability with additional hit points and better saving throws against physical ailments.
- Intelligence: 10 (+0) - This is an average modifier, signifying that the Knight is neither particularly insightful nor lacking in intellect.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0) - This is also an average modifier, indicating a reasonable perception but not exceptional wisdom.
- Charisma: 14 (+2) - This is a good modifier, enabling better interactions and inspiring allies effectively through their Knightly Inspiration ability.

The Knight has the following saving throw bonuses:

- Strength saving throws: +5 (good)
- Constitution saving throws: +4 (good)
- Wisdom saving throws: +2 (average)

Regarding skills, the Knight has:

- Athletics: +5 (good)
- History: +0 (average)
- Perception: +2 (average)

Their passive perception is 12, which is average, allowing them to notice typical threats or hidden enemies.

The Knight can communicate in any two languages of their choice, giving them good versatility in interaction.

Special abilities include:

- Brave: This ability grants the Knight advantage on saving throws against being frightened, making them resilient against fear tactics.

Actions include:

- Multiattack: The Knight can make two attacks with their greatsword during their turn, maximizing their offensive potential.
- Greatsword: This melee attack has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 10 slashing damage on a successful hit, showcasing good damage output.
- Lance (Mounted Only): This attack is also +5 to hit and deals 9 piercing damage with the opportunity for an additional 6 damage and a chance to knock the target prone if certain conditions are met. However, this attack is made at disadvantage when targeting creatures within 5 feet, adding a strategic layer to its use.
- Heavy Crossbow: This ranged attack has a +3 to hit and deals an average of 6 piercing damage, allowing the Knight to engage enemies at range when necessary.

The Knightly Inspiration ability, usable once per day, allows the Knight to inspire allies within a 30-foot radius. Affected creatures gain an expertise die of 1d4 on their attack rolls and saving throws for the next minute, enhancing the party's effectiveness in combat. However, the Knight cannot benefit from this ability themselves or target the same creature more than once at a time.

The Knight is a Medium humanoid creature that epitomizes the ideals of honor and valor in battle. With a Challenge Rating of 3, the Knight is a capable combatant, boasting a strong Armor Class of 18 due to its plate armor and a healthy pool of 68 hit points, making it quite resilient in encounters. The Knight has an average speed of 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver reasonably well on the battlefield. This creature possesses a balanced set of abilities, with a notable strength (STR) modifier of +3, which provides good effectiveness in physical confrontations. However, its Dexterity (DEX) score is average, yielding a +0 modifier. The Knight's combat prowess is complemented by special abilities and actions that enhance its role in battles, providing both offensive capabilities and tactical advantages.

The Knight's attributes are as follows: Strength with a score of 16 (+3), Dexterity with a score of 10 (+0), Constitution with a score of 14 (+2), Intelligence with a score of 12 (+1), Wisdom with a score of 12 (+1), and Charisma with a score of 14 (+2). The Strength modifier is good for melee combat, allowing it to hit hard with melee attacks, while the Constitution contributes to its hit points, providing resilience. The average Dexterity means it won’t excel at initiatives or ranged attacks, while the average Intelligence and Wisdom do not significantly enhance its capabilities in those regards. However, the Charisma modifier of +2 is useful for certain abilities that rely on presence and challenges.

The Knight has a keen Perception score of 13, which translates to an average likelihood of noticing hidden threats or important details in its surroundings. In terms of stealth, the Knight has a score of 5; however, this number increases to 10 when not wearing armor, indicating that it can be reasonably stealthy when stripped of heavy gear. The Knight speaks Common and one other language, reflecting its diverse background.

One of the unique abilities of the Knight is "Chivalrous Presence," which allows it to choose a type of presence at the start of its turn that lasts until the start of its next turn. This may provide various tactical advantages during combat, although the text does not specify what effects these presences have on gameplay.

In terms of combat actions, the Knight can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three attacks with its Greatsword or four attacks with Javelins in a single turn. When utilizing the Greatsword, the Knight makes a melee attack roll with a +5 to hit, targeting a creature within 5 feet. When successful, this attack deals 10 slashing damage, calculated as 2d6 + 3. The Javelin serves as both a melee and ranged weapon, also with a +5 to hit, allowing engagement with targets within 5 feet or at a range of 30/120 feet. A successful hit with a Javelin deals 6 piercing damage, calculated as 1d6 + 3.

Additionally, the Knight can use a bonus action to activate the "Champion’s Challenge" ability. This ability targets one creature within 30 feet, requiring the target to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. Failure results in the creature having disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than the Knight until the end of its next turn, making the Knight a formidable opponent capable of drawing attention in combat and protecting allies.

Overall, the Knight is a well-rounded combatant capable of delivering significant damage while also controlling the battlefield through its abilities and presence.</detail>
