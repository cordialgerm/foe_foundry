<summary>A Knight is a heavily armored warrior, typically sworn to a code of chivalry or loyalty to a noble lord. Clad in plate armor and wielding a sword, lance, or shield, Knights are trained from a young age in combat, riding, and leadership. They often serve as commanders in armies or protectors of the realm, upholding justice and honor. Knights are disciplined and skilled in both mounted and foot combat, and they fight with a sense of duty and purpose. Though noble in their ideals, some Knights may be driven by personal ambition or the demands of their lords.</summary>
