<detail>

The Whisperer in Darkness has the following attributes: Strength 15 (+2), Dexterity 19 (+4), Constitution 21 (+5), Intelligence 25 (+7), Wisdom 18 (+4), and Charisma 16 (+3). The Constitution modifier of +10 signifies a good capability at resisting damage and effects, while a very high Intelligence modifier of +7 denotes exceptional ability in arcane knowledge and spellcasting. The Dexterity score of 19 contributes to the creatureâ€™s agility and stealth, being quite good at avoiding attacks or sneaking when necessary. 

In terms of saving throws, it excels in Constitution (+10), Wisdom (+9), and Charisma (+8), making it resilient against many spells and effects. The Whisperer in Darkness possesses exceptional skills, most prominently in arcana (+17), allowing it to understand complex magical phenomena, and deception (+13), showcasing its ability to manipulate perceptions. Additionally, it performs well in medicine and perception (+9 each) and is very good at stealth (+9), ensuring it can move unseen when it wishes.

The creature is immune to psychic and poison damage, providing it with an excellent defense against casters who rely on such damage types. Additionally, it resists cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks unless made with silver. Its condition immunities include being frightened, charmed, and poisoned, preserving its ability to function independently of mental manipulation.

Notably, the Whisperer has truesight out to a range of 120 feet, allowing it to see through illusions and invisibility, while its passive Perception of 19 indicates a sharp awareness of its surroundings. The creature can communicate in all languages and can telepathically connect with entities within 60 feet.

The Whisperer in Darkness has several special abilities. Its Disquieting Technology indicates that it carries advanced magical implements, enhancing its mystique and combat capabilities. Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells, making it highly resilient to magical attacks. Its innate spellcasting ability is based on its Intelligence, with a spell save DC of 20, enabling the creature to effectively cast spells without needing material components.

The spells at the Whisperer's disposal allow it to manipulate situations to its advantage. It can cast spells at will such as alter self, detect magic, detect thoughts, disguise self, fear, identify, invisibility (self only), misty step, sleep, and suggestion. These spells provide it with versatility for both combat and social interactions. Three times per day, it can cast confusion, dimension door, disintegrate, dream, modify memory, plane shift, and teleport, allowing for powerful battlefield control, escape, or movement. Once per day, it can unleash catastrophic effects with spells like feeblemind, meteor swarm, mind blank, and weird, which can severely impede or devastate its foes.

In combat, the Whisperer employs a multiattack strategy, making two Grasp of the Void attacks. Each Grasp of the Void is a melee spell attack that has a +12 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, this attack inflicts 21 (6d6) force damage and forces the target to succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the stun on a success. This ability makes its melee engagements particularly threatening, as it can incapacitate opponents while dealing significant damage.</detail>
