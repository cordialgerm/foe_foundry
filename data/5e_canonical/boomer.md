<summary>The Boomer is a unique Medium Plant creature that embodies the role of a deceptive and damaging presence on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 7, it lacks physical defense but compensates with abilities that can incapacitate and damage foes through its sonic attacks. While it has a modest 22 hit points, its challenge rating of 1/2 indicates it can be a surprising opponent for lower-level adventurers, dealing significant thunder damage with its special abilities. The Boomer’s strengths lie in its area control and ability to inflict status effects like deafening and incapacitation. However, its low Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma scores leave it vulnerable to direct attacks, as it is essentially immobile with a walking speed of 0 feet.</summary>

<detail>

The Boomer has the following attributes: Strength 1 (very bad), Dexterity 1 (very bad), Constitution 12 (+1, average), Intelligence 1 (very bad), Wisdom 3 (bad), and Charisma 1 (very bad). Its low Dexterity and Strength make it exceptionally weak in physical combat, and it cannot engage effectively or evade attacks. However, it is immune to thunder damage and resistant to several conditions, such as being blinded, deafened, or frightened, which helps it endure certain combats.

Regarding its skills and abilities, the Boomer has blindsight for up to 30 feet, allowing it to detect creatures without relying on vision, though it cannot see beyond this range. It lacks any language proficiency, rendering it unable to communicate verbally.

The Boomer possesses several notable special abilities:

1. Deafening Boom: When a creature successfully strikes the Boomer with a melee attack, it triggers a blast of sound. Any creature within 10 feet that can hear the Boomer must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in 5 thunder damage and incapacitation until the creature's next turn. A successful save halves the damage and avoids incapacitation. This ability can control the flow of battle, potentially rendering multiple foes unable to act.

2. Death Burst: Upon the Boomer's death, it will explode in a loud cacophony. Any creature within 30 feet that can hear it must also make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they take 7 thunder damage and are deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, creatures take half the damage and are not deafened. This destructive ability acts as a final act of vengeance, significantly punishing those near it when it is defeated.

3. False Appearance: While motionless, the Boomer mimics the appearance of an ordinary fungus, making it difficult for characters to detect it until it attacks or is disturbed. This ability allows it to hide effectively, awaiting the opportune moment to unleash its powerful sound-based attacks.

Additionally, the Boomer has a reaction known as Shriek. If bright light is introduced to its vicinity or a creature comes within 30 feet, it emits a loud shriek that can be heard up to 300 feet away. This reaction continues until the triggering element moves out of range and lasts for an additional 1d4 turns afterward. This can serve as an area alarm, alerting nearby creatures to its presence, thereby preventing stealthy approaches.

Overall, the Boomer leverages its sound-based abilities to create chaos and confusion, establishing control over areas and potentially tipping the scales of battle in favor of its allies or itself. Its unique blend of special abilities emphasizes strategic play and careful positioning when involved in combat scenarios.</detail>
