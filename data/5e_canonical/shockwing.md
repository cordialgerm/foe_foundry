<summary>The Shockwing is a small, unaligned beast, resembling a giant moth with notable electrical qualities. With an Armor Class of 12 and 27 hit points, it possesses average defensive capabilities but can deal a surprising amount of damage for its Challenge Rating of 1, making it a moderate threat for low-level adventurers. Its flying speed of 30 feet allows it to maneuver effectively in combat, while its walking speed of 25 feet ensures it can navigate varied terrain. The creature's strengths lie in its lightning damage immunity and the ability to unleash powerful area-of-effect attacks, which can stun opponents. However, it has very low intelligence and charisma, making it ineffective in social or cunning tactics. The Shockwing's reliance on physical attacks and saving throws means it can be vulnerable when it runs into sources of resistance or damage reduction in combat.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Shockwing has the following scores: Strength at 11 (+0), Dexterity at 15 (+2, which is good for evasion), Constitution at 14 (+2, which is good for durability), Intelligence at 3 (-4, very bad), Wisdom at 10 (+0, average for perception), and Charisma at 7 (-2, bad for social interactions). It excels in its Dexterity and Constitution, allowing it to be somewhat evasive and hardy in battle.

The creature possesses some useful skills: its Perception skill is at +2, which is average, and its Stealth skill is impressive at +4, allowing it to be somewhat stealthy during encounters. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, which aids its ability to see in low-light conditions, and a passive perception score of 12, which is essential for noticing hidden creatures or traps. The Shockwing is immune to lightning damage, giving it a significant edge when facing lightning-based attacks.

Shockwings exhibit special abilities that enhance their combat effectiveness. Their Antennae ability gives them advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, making them particularly adept at detecting creatures nearby. At the start of each of the Shockwing's turns, it utilizes its Charged ability, causing each creature within a 5-foot radius to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in taking 2 (1d4) lightning damage, which can be significant if multiple opponents are nearby, but it is ineffective if the Shockwing has used its Fulminating Wings ability within the past 24 hours.

In combat, the Shockwing can make two attacks due to its Multiattack feature, both of which are its proboscis attacks. The proboscis attack has a +4 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage along with an additional 2 (1d4) lightning damage, making it a versatile attacker. Once per day, the Shockwing can unleash its Fulminating Wings ability, creating a 20-foot radius burst of electricity. All creatures within this area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of their next turn, providing a powerful crowd control option that can shift the tide of battle by incapacitating multiple enemies.</detail>
