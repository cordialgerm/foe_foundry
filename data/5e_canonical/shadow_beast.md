<summary>The Shadow Beast is a formidable and dangerous foe hailing from the fey realms, characterized by its chaotic evil nature. It presents a significant threat in combat due to its high agility and magic resistance, which allows it to evade many spell effects. With an armor class of 15 and a total of 112 hit points, this creature can withstand a decent amount of damage before being taken down. Its challenge rating of 7 indicates that it is a suitable encounter for a party of mid-level adventurers, offering a mix of physical and magical attacks. However, it suffers from sunlight sensitivity, which can hinder its effectiveness when exposed to direct sunlight.</summary>

<detail>

The Shadow Beast possesses the following attributes: a Strength score of 6, which is very bad, a Dexterity of 20 which is exceptional, a Constitution of 17 which is good, an Intelligence of 14 which is average, a Wisdom of 14 which is average, and a Charisma of 19 which is very good. In terms of saving throws, it has a +6 modifier in Constitution and a +5 modifier in Wisdom, reflecting good resilience against physical and mental attacks. This creature is also skilled in Stealth with a +8 modifier, making it very good at hiding and ambushing unsuspecting adventurers. It is resistant to several types of damage—acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder—as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, giving it strong defensive capabilities. The Shadow Beast is immune to conditions like exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and restrained, making it particularly challenging to incapacitate.

The Shadow Beast has several noteworthy special abilities. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, although it will take force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. With Magic Resistance, the Shadow Beast has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which significantly enhances its survivability against spellcasters. The Shadow Weapons ability ensures that all of its weapon attacks are considered magical, and any successful hit deals an additional 2d6 necrotic damage, which can quickly add to its overall damage output. However, it does exhibit Sunlight Sensitivity; while exposed to sunlight, its attack rolls and certain perception checks become less effective, giving it a notable weakness that adversaries can exploit.

In combat, the Shadow Beast can use the Multiattack action to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and on a successful hit, it deals 9 piercing damage along with an additional 7 necrotic damage, totaling 16 damage. Similarly, each Claw attack also has a +8 to hit and can inflict 8 slashing damage plus 7 necrotic damage, making it dangerous in close-quarters situations.

The creature further possesses the Frightful Shadows ability, which can be a game-changer in combat. By unleashing the shadows into a 30-foot cone, it induces fear in those caught within it. Creatures must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in taking 42 necrotic damage and becoming frightened for 1 minute, while success results in half damage with no fear effect. A frightened creature must dash away from the Shadow Beast whenever possible and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to potentially end the frightened condition.

Overall, the Shadow Beast is a powerful creature that thrives in darkness and excels at disrupting the plans of its foes while delivering deadly attacks through its magical claws and fear-inducing abilities. Its unique movement and magical resistance make it a unique challenge for adventurers brave enough to confront it.</detail>
