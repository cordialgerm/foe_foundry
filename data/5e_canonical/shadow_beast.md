### Special Abilities

- **Incorporeal Movement:** The shadow beast can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Magic Resistance:** The shadow beast has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Shadow Weapons:** The shadow beast’s weapon attacks are magical. When the shadow beast hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage (included in the attack).
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the shadow beast has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The shadow beast makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Frightful Shadows (Recharge 5–6):** The shadow beast releases a wave of shadows filled with frightening images of eyes, fangs, and other barely seen and terrifying beasts in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 42 (12d6) necrotic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. A frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from the shadow beast by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
