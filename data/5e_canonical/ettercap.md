<summary>An Ettercap is a twisted, humanoid spider-like creature that lurks in dark forests and caves. It has a hunched, hair-covered body, long claws, and a grotesque face with mandibles capable of spinning webs. Ettercaps are skilled trappers, weaving intricate webs to capture their prey, which often includes unsuspecting adventurers or animals. They also possess the ability to communicate with and command giant spiders and other arachnids. Ettercaps are solitary predators, and their lairs are filled with the remains of past victims, cocooned in silk. They are cunning and dangerous, using stealth and traps to hunt.</summary>

<summary>The Ettercap is a Medium Monstrosity that embodies a terrifying combination of spider-like features and predatory instincts. Its role in combat is primarily as a physical attacker with control capabilities, thanks to its various abilities and attacks. With an Armor Class of 13, it has moderate defenses and a total of 44 hit points, translating to an average resilience in encounters. The Ettercap excels at stealth and survival, bolstered by a Dexterity score of 16 (+3), making it good at avoiding detection and enabling it to ambush foes. However, its low Intelligence score of 8 (-1) limits its strategic options and problem-solving capabilities. Overall, the Ettercap's strengths lie in its maneuverability, stealthy approach, and ability to restrain enemies, while its weaknesses include its average defensive capabilities and limited cognitive resourcefulness in combat situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Ettercap has the following attributes: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 13 (+1), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 8 (-1). The Dexterity saving throw is particularly potent at +5, classifying it as good in defensive actions against effects that target this attribute. Skills such as Perception (+3), Stealth (+5), and Survival (+3) further enhance its effectiveness when navigating its environment or engaging in tactical combat scenarios.

In terms of senses, the Ettercap has darkvision that allows it to see in darkness up to 60 feet, and it possesses a passive Perception of 13, which is average for detecting hidden foes. It can communicate through its special ability, Speak with Spiders, facilitating interaction with spiders in the vicinity. Furthermore, its Spider Climb ability grants it exceptional climbing capabilities, allowing it to traverse difficult or vertical surfaces effortlessly. The Web Sense ability enhances its situational awareness, as it can pinpoint any creatures in contact with webs directly. Lastly, Web Walker negates any movement limitations posed by webs, ensuring it can operate freely in environments with webs present.

For actions, the Ettercap can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make both a bite attack and a claw attack in one turn. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 5 piercing damage along with an additional 3 poison damage on a hit, making it a solid offensive choice. Its Claws attack also has a +5 to hit, deals 8 slashing damage, and is effective against foes in close proximity. The Strangle ability is particularly dangerous, as it provides the Ettercap with a grappling option against Medium or smaller creatures, dealing 7 bludgeoning damage and restricting the target's ability to breathe.

As a bonus action, the Ettercap has access to the Web ability, which requires a recharge of 5-6. This ranged weapon attack targets one Large or smaller creature, and upon hitting, it restrains the target in webs. Creatures caught can attempt to break free by making a DC 11 Strength check as an action. The webs themselves have an Armor Class of 10, 1 hit point, and are immune to all damage except for slashing, fire, and force, allowing for strategic interplay in combat situations involving terrain manipulation.

The Ettercap is a medium-sized monstrosity notable for its spider-like abilities and affinity for ambushing prey. With a challenge rating of 2, it serves as a moderate threat to adventurers, utilizing its resilience and climbing prowess to navigate and control environments where webs are present. Key strengths include decent offensive capabilities, particularly through its poisonous attacks and ability to restrain foes with webbing. However, it suffers from poor intelligence, limiting its tactical options. Overall, the Ettercap is a dangerous enemy in familiar territory, but less effective if caught in open combat without webs.

The Ettercap has an Armor Class of 13, providing it with average protection in combat scenarios. It possesses 54 hit points, allowing it to endure a moderate amount of damage before being defeated. With a speed of 30 feet and the ability to climb at the same speed, it can maneuver effectively in its environment. The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength at +2 (average effectiveness), Dexterity at +3 (good effectiveness), Constitution at +1 (average effectiveness), Intelligence at -3 (very bad effectiveness), Wisdom at +3 (good effectiveness), and Charisma at -1 (bad effectiveness). It has darkvision up to 60 feet, giving it an advantage in low-light conditions. The Ettercap also has a Perception modifier of +3 (good effectiveness) and a Stealth modifier of +3 (good effectiveness), enhancing its capacity for ambush tactics.

The Ettercap has several special abilities that enhance its survivability and effectiveness in combat. Its Monstrosity Resilience provides it with resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, making it tougher to deal with over time and immune to certain debilitating effects. The Spider Climb ability allows it to traverse difficult surfaces and even ceilings without difficulty, granting it a tactical edge in environments rich with verticality. With Web Sense, the Ettercap is aware of the precise location of any creature touching a web it is also in contact with, facilitating ambush strategies. Additionally, the Web Walker ability allows it to move freely through webbing without impediment, further supporting its ambush tactics and escape options.

In combat, the Ettercap can utilize Multiattack, enabling it to make one Bite attack and one Claws attack or to use two Spit Poison attacks during its turn. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 7 piercing damage along with an additional 4 poison damage. If the target fails a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, it becomes poisoned for 1 minute, with the possibility to repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect. The Claws attack also carries a +5 to hit and deals 10 slashing damage on a successful strike. 

The Spit Poison provides a ranged option, allowing the Ettercap to hit a target within 20 feet (60 feet maximum range) with a +5 to hit, dealing 11 poison damage on a successful attack. This versatility allows the Ettercap to engage both at close range and from a distance.

As a bonus action, the Ettercap can use the Web ability, which recharges on a roll of 4-6. This ability allows the Ettercap to launch a web at a creature within 30 feet. If the target fails a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, it becomes restrained. A creature can spend its action to free a restrained target by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check. The webbing can be destroyed, with an Armor Class of 10 and 5 hit points, but it is vulnerable to fire damage while immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. This ability can significantly alter the dynamics of combat, enabling the Ettercap to control the battlefield and hinder enemies effectively.</detail>
