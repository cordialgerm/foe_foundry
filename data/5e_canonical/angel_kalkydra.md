<summary>The Kalkydra is a formidable Huge Celestial creature characterized by its lawful good alignment. Known for its immense power, it serves a celestial purpose, wielding both physical and magical abilities in combat. With exceptional hit points, high armor class, and a range of devastating attacks, the Kalkydra can easily dominate the battlefield. This creature excels at both close and ranged combat, using its radiant energy to deal significant damage while simultaneously providing supportive magical effects to allies. However, despite its strengths, it is not invulnerable, and careful tactics are required to exploit its weaknesses in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Kalkydra has the following attributes: Strength is 22 with a modifier of +6, indicating very good physical prowess; Dexterity is 14 with a modifier of +2, which is average; Constitution is 24 with a modifier of +7, indicating exceptional resilience; Intelligence is 17 with a modifier of +3, showing good cognitive ability; Wisdom is 21 with a +5 modifier indicating very good insight, and Charisma is 23 with a +6 modifier, also very good. In terms of saving throws, it has bonuses of +1 in Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma, which are considered very bad given its high Constitution and Wisdom scores. The Kalkydra has a perception skill of +5, considered good, and it is immune to fire and radiant damage while being resistant to poison and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. It cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, poisoned, or made prone. The creature has truesight out to 120 feet, with a passive Perception score of 20. It can communicate in all languages and has telepathy with a range of 120 feet.

The Kalkydra possesses several remarkable special abilities. Its Angelic Weapons ability enhances its weapon strikes with magical energy, dealing an additional 4d8 radiant damage on successful hits. Immortal Nature allows it to function without food, drink, or sleep, granting it greater versatility during long encounters. The creature also has Magic Resistance, which provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it exceptionally hard to disable through magical means.

In combat, the Kalkydra can perform a Multiattack action, which allows it to make two attacks using either Bites or Sunrays, with the option to replace one of these attacks with a Constrict. A Bite attack has a +11 to hit and reaches up to 10 feet with damage totaling 15 piercing (2d8+6) plus 18 radiant (4d8) damage. The Constrict attack also has a +11 to hit but only requires a range of 5 feet; it deals 17 bludgeoning damage (2d10+6) along with 18 radiant damage and grapples the target. The escape DC for this grapple is 18, meaning targets have to succeed on a roll to escape. 

The Sunray ability allows the Kalkydra to make a ranged spell attack with a +11 to hit, striking a target from up to 120 feet away for a total of 24 radiant damage (4d8+6) plus 9 fire damage (2d8). Once per day, it can use Song of Sunrise, filling a 120-foot radius around it with sunlight for 1 minute, potentially affecting creatures that are vulnerable to light or using illusions.

The Kalkydra's spellcasting abilities are also worth noting. It casts spells using its Charisma with a spell save DC of 19, meaning it presents a strong challenge for creatures trying to resist its spells. It can cast spells like Detect Evil and Good at will, while using Daylight and Dispel Evil and Good three times a day each, and commune and Greater Restoration once per day each. 

As a reaction to being hit by an attack, the Kalkydra can activate its Solar Nimbus ability. This creates a fiery nimbus around itself that deals damage to the attacker: 9 fire damage (2d8) and 9 radiant damage (2d8). Additionally, this nimbus sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Until the start of its next turn, any creature within 5 feet that hits the Kalkydra with a melee attack also takes 9 fire and 9 radiant damage, adding a layer of risk for attacking it up close. 

Overall, the Kalkydra's blend of strength, resilience, magical prowess, and tactical abilities make it a daunting opponent and a valuable ally in any celestial-themed campaign.</detail>
