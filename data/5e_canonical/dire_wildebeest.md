<summary>The Dire Wildebeest is a large, powerful beast that operates independently and exhibits no alignment tendencies. With an impressive Armor Class of 14 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of 150 hit points, it can withstand significant damage in combat. This creature has a high movement speed of 50 feet, enabling it to traverse the battlefield quickly, often using that advantage to charge at opponents. With a Challenge Rating of 7, it is considered a formidable threat, capable of inflicting considerable damage while also being able to cause fear in its enemies. However, it is notable that the Dire Wildebeest has lower mental stats, making it vulnerable to effects that target intelligence, wisdom, or charisma. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Dire Wildebeest possesses a strength score of 19, with a modifier of +4, which is classified as very good. Its dexterity score of 16 (+3 modifier) is also good, allowing it to be nimble despite its size. The constitution score of 14 (+2 modifier) offers above-average resilience. However, its intelligence is extremely low with a score of 2 (-4 modifier), which is very bad, indicating its lack of cognitive abilities. The wisdom score is average at 10 (+0 modifier), and the charisma score is similarly low with 5 (-3 modifier), being classified as bad.

The Dire Wildebeest has a few key special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. One such ability is Trampling Charge, which allows it to move 20 feet straight toward a creature and, if it hits with its Gore attack on that turn, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the wildebeest can then make a bonus action Hooves attack against the creature, making it especially dangerous in close combat situations.

When it comes to its actions, the Dire Wildebeest can execute a Multiattack, which consists of using its Intimidating Glare first, followed by one Gore attack and one Hooves attack. The Gore attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, dealing an average of 22 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Hooves attack also has a +7 to hit and deals an average of 18 bludgeoning damage. 

The Intimidating Glare is a fear-inducing ability that affects one creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute. The frightened creature can attempt to save again at the end of each of its turns. If it succeeds at any point, it becomes immune to this effect from the Dire Wildebeest for the next 24 hours.

Additionally, the Dire Wildebeest can unleash a powerful Noxious Breath attack, which has a recharge mechanic allowing it to be used only on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability creates a 15-foot cone of poisonous gas, dealing an average of 21 poison damage to creatures caught within (with a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw for half damage). 

Lastly, its Incite Stampede ability can be used once per day and allows the wildebeest to move up to 30 feet in a straight line while passing through the space of medium creatures. Each friendly creature within 120 feet can use its reaction to also partake in the stampede and move, ignoring opportunity attacks. When a creature enters another creature's space during this stampede, that creature takes bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. For each additional creature that joins the stampede after the first, the saving throw difficulty and damage increase, making it exponentially more dangerous. 

In summary, the Dire Wildebeest is a creature that combines physical prowess with the ability to instill fear and facilitate a chaotic stampede, posing a unique tactical challenge for adventurers. Its strengths in physical damage and mobility are balanced by its lack of mental capabilities, making it a captivating addition to any encounter.</detail>
