The Ostinato’s ability scores reflect its nature, possessing a dexterity of 20, granting it a very good modifier of +5, allowing for agile movement and effective avoidance of attacks. It has a constitution of 15, resulting in a good +2 modifier that contributes to its durability. However, its strength is exceptionally low at 1, with a very bad -5 modifier, meaning it cannot engage in physical combat effectively. Its intelligence is very low at 5, resulting in a bad -3 modifier, signaling minimal cognitive prowess. Its wisdom is average at 12, with a +1 modifier, while its charisma is strong at 17, providing a +3 modifier which enhances its ability to influence others. The Ostinato excels in perception with a passive score of 13, augmented by its skills in perception at +3. 

The creature exhibits vulnerabilities to thunder damage, making it susceptible to attacks utilizing this element. It is immune to poison damage and has resistances to acid, cold, fire, and lightning, along with a range of physical damage types from nonmagical sources. Condition immunities provide it with significant advantages, protecting it from a variety of debilitating effects such as being charmed, exhausted, or paralyzed. With darkvision at 60 feet, it can operate effectively in low-light conditions and possesses telepathy that extends 120 feet, allowing it to communicate with others mentally, even though it cannot speak.

One of the Ostinato's special abilities is Incorporeal Movement, which allows it to pass through creatures and objects as though they are difficult terrain. However, if it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 (1d10) force damage. Its Invisibility ability enables it to remain undetected in combat, granting it a significant tactical advantage. The creature also possesses Magic Resistance, which gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability against magic users.

In terms of actions, the Ostinato can utilize a Multiattack, allowing it to make two separate Cacophony Burst attacks during its turn. Each Cacophony Burst is a spell attack that delivers 16 (3d8 + 3) thunder damage and has a +7 to hit, with a range of up to 60 feet. Additionally, the Ostinato can use its Aural Symbiosis ability, which can merge with a humanoid target within 5 feet. This ability requires the target to succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, the Ostinato becomes an alluring tune in the victim's mind, granting them its Magic Resistance but also imposing disadvantages on their Wisdom saving throws and the inability to concentrate on spells. After a long rest, the host has a chance to recognize the external entity through a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check.

Finally, the Ostinato can unleash Contagious Tune once per day while merged with a humanoid. This ability affects all creatures within a 30-foot radius of its host, requiring them to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, which leads to 21 (6d6) psychic damage on a failure or reduced damage on a success. Following this, the Ostinato gains temporary hit points equal to the highest psychic damage dealt, enhancing its resilience in combat. Notably, a deafened creature is immune to this ability, offering a strategic countermeasure against the Ostinato's sound-based attacks.</detail>

- **Multiattack:** The ostinato makes two Cacophony Burst attacks.
- **Cacophony Burst:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d8 + 3) thunder damage.
- **Aural Symbiosis (Recharge 6):** One Humanoid that the ostinato can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or the ostinato merges with the target, becoming an enjoyable, repetitive tune in its host’s mind. The ostinato can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it can’t attack. The host retains control of its body and is aware of the ostinato’s presence only as a melody, not as a living entity. The host no longer needs to eat or drink, gains the ostinato’s Magic Resistance trait, and has advantage on Charisma checks. In addition, the host has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws, and it can’t maintain concentration on spells or other effects. At the end of each long rest, the host can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check, realizing that the music it hears comes from an external entity on a success.
- **Contagious Tune (1/Day):** While merged with a Humanoid host, the ostinato fills the minds of nearby creatures with the same catchy tune playing in its host’s mind. Each creature within 30 feet of the ostinato’s host must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The ostinato then gains temporary hp equal to the single highest amount of psychic damage dealt. A deafened creature is immune to Contagious Tune.
