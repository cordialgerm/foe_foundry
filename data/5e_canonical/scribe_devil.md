<summary>The Scribe Devil is a Medium Fiend characterized by its lawful evil nature. This malevolent creature excels in cunning tactics and manipulation, making it a formidable opponent in combat and a master of deceit in interactions. With a solid Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 82, the Scribe Devil is capable of enduring significant damage. The creature's challenge rating of 5 indicates that it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers, providing a rewarding experience if defeated. Notably, the Scribe Devil possesses both flight and a range of spells, allowing it to navigate combat situations and manipulate the battlefield effectively. However, it has vulnerabilities; it is susceptible to silvered weapons and magical attacks that exploit its low defenses against certain effects.</summary>

<detail>

The Scribe Devil has the following ability scores: Strength is 14 (+2), Dexterity is 16 (+3, which indicates good agility), Constitution is 16 (+3, showing very good resilience), Intelligence is 18 (+4, indicating exceptional mental acuity), Wisdom is 14 (+2), and Charisma is 17 (+3, demonstrating good personal magnetism). The Scribe Devil has notable saving throws, including a +6 for Constitution, +7 for Intelligence, +5 for Wisdom, and +6 for Charisma, which enhance its resilience against various effects.

The Scribe Devil has effective skills in deception (+6), insight (+5), and perception (+4), making it adept at reading and manipulating others. It is immune to fire and poison damage, resistant to cold, and also possesses condition immunity to being poisoned. Its darkvision extends to 120 feet, and it has a passive perception of 14, allowing it to see in darkness and detect hidden threats. The creature can communicate through Common, Infernal, and telepathy within 120 feet.

Among its special abilities, the Scribe Devil possesses Devil’s Sight, meaning that magical darkness does not affect its darkvision, allowing it to see clearly in dark environments. It benefits from Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its durability in magical confrontations. Its innate spellcasting ability allows it to utilize spells with a spell save DC of 15, casting spells without needing material components. The Scribe Devil can cast "detect magic" and "illusory script" at will, using them to uncover magical auras and create false writings. It can cast "dispel magic" and "zone of truth" three times each day, allowing it to nullify magical effects or enforce honesty among characters. Once per day, it can use "glyph of warding," setting traps, or "modify memory," altering the recollections of a creature.

In combat, the Scribe Devil can utilize its Multiattack feature to strike twice—once with its claws and once with its tail. Its claw attack has a +6 to hit and can inflict 10 slashing damage (2d6 + 3). The tail attack, also with a +6 to hit, inflicts 8 piercing damage (2d4 + 3) and can cause blindness. A target hit by the tail must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in blindness due to infernal ink filling its eyes, which requires specific magical or medical intervention to remove. If an attempt to drain the ink fails significantly, the would-be healer may inflict serious harm instead, symbolizing the dangerous nature of facing a Scribe Devil in both combat and recovery situations.</detail>

1/day each: glyph of warding, modify memory

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The scribe devil makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its tail.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become blinded as its eyes turn black and fill with infernal ink. The condition can be removed with a greater restoration spell or similar magic. Alternatively, a creature with a healer’s kit can drain the ink from a blinded creature’s eyes with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If this check fails by 5 or more, the attempt to drain the ink instead removes the blinded creature’s eyes and the creature takes 21 (6d6) piercing damage.
