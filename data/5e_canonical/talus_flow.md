<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>The Talus Flow is a large elemental creature characterized by its neutral evil alignment. This being has a unique role in combat, acting as both a potential ambush predator due to its ability to conceal itself as a pile of rocks and a formidable opponent with its ability to control the battlefield through terrain manipulation. It possesses significant defensive capabilities, with a natural armor class of 13 and a total of 102 hit points, making it reasonably difficult to take down for characters of lower levels. Notably, the Talus Flow has vulnerabilities to thunder damage, meaning it takes extra damage from such attacks. Its strengths lie in its various special abilities which provide tactical advantages in combat, while its relatively low Dexterity score can be classified as average, making it less agile in terms of dodging attacks.</summary>

The Talus Flow's attributes reflect its strengths: a Strength score of 17 (+3) highlights its physical prowess, making its attacks impactful. Its Constitution score of 16 (+3) also contributes to its durability. Intelligence and Charisma scores are very low, both at 5 (-3), indicating it lacks in mental faculties and social influence. While its Wisdom score is average at 12 (+1), this provides it with some capacity for perception checks despite its overall low intellectual and social capabilities. The creature also has exceptional condition immunities, being immune to a variety of conditions such as exhaustion, paralyzed, or poisoned, making it particularly resilient against a wide range of debilitating effects in combat.

Among its special abilities, "False Appearance" allows the Talus Flow to remain motionless and appear as a normal pile of rocks, thus enabling it to surprise unsuspecting creatures. "Landslide" is an action that lets the Talus Flow knock creatures prone if it moves at least 15 feet before entering their space, forcing them to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall. If a creature is knocked prone, the Talus Flow can follow up with a "Slam" attack as a bonus action. The "Scree Form" ability permits the Talus Flow to move into the space of another creature, becoming difficult terrain for them. When a creature starts its turn in its space, they must make another DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. This can disrupt opponents and strategically control space on the battlefield. Lastly, "Stone Camouflage" gives the Talus Flow an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in rocky terrain, enhancing its capacity for ambushes.

In terms of actions, the Talus Flow can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two slam attacks in one turn. Each "Slam" attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit and deals 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. Notably, if both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, that target is grappled with an escape DC of 13. Furthermore, the "Grind" action enables the Talus Flow to inflict 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage on a creature in its space, or one it has grappled, allowing it to regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt if the target is not a Construct or Undead. This means the Talus Flow can sustain itself during prolonged battles by damaging opponents in close combat, making it a relentless adversary.</detail>
