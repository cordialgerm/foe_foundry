<summary>The Emerald Order Cult Leader is a powerful humanoid figure, embodying a mix of martial prowess and divine magic. This medium creature is known for its Lawful Neutral or Lawful Evil alignment, suggesting a strict adherence to its own beliefs and the authority of its deity. With a formidable Armor Class of 15 and a significant pool of 156 hit points, the cult leader can withstand considerable damage in combat. Its strengths lie in both melee and spellcasting capabilities, making it a versatile opponent on the battlefield. One of its notable features is the ability to enhance its allies' effectiveness in combat, providing tactical advantages. However, it is crucial to recognize its vulnerabilities; although its defensive options are robust, it lacks mobility compared to other fast-moving creatures. </summary>

The attributes for the Emerald Order Cult Leader are as follows: Strength is 14, giving it a good modifier of +2; Dexterity is average at 10, with a +0 modifier; Constitution stands at 14, also with a good +2 modifier; Intelligence is 15, providing a good +2 modifier; Wisdom is 20, featuring an exceptional +5 modifier; and Charisma measures 15, resulting in a good +2 modifier. For saving throws, it excels in Wisdom with +8 (very good) and has average bonuses in Intelligence and Charisma at +5 each. Skills include Arcana, Deception, History, and Religion, all at +5, showcasing solid proficiency across various knowledge areas. Its sensory capabilities offer darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 15, allowing it to notice things in low light conditions effectively. The cult leader can speak any three languages, making it fluent in multiple forms of communication.

The cult leader's special abilities greatly enhance its combat effectiveness. "Blessed Weapons" means that all weapon attacks it makes are magical and deal an additional 3d8 radiant damage on a hit, demonstrating its exceptional capability for inflicting powerful damage. "Divine Blessing" allows it to add its impressive Wisdom modifier to its Armor Class when unarmored, significantly enhancing its defensive capabilities, and it gains advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, making it difficult to manipulate. With "Prophetic Tactics," it gains an advantage on initiative rolls which improves its chances of acting first in combat. Additionally, it can grant one ally within 30 feet advantage on their first attack roll, further emphasizing its role as a supportive leader.

In terms of actions, the cult leader has a melee attack option with a mace, which delivers a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, and on a successful hit, it inflicts 5 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 13 radiant damage from its weapons' bless. For ranged attacks, it can use "Radiant Bolt," which requires a ranged spell attack roll with a +8 to hit at a range of 60 feet, dealing 18 radiant damage on a hit.

The cult leader is a spellcaster that uses its Wisdom for spellcasting, with a spell save DC of 16. It can cast several spells at will, including "Command" to issue orders, "Light" to create illumination, and "Thaumaturgy" to create minor magical effects. It has three uses per day for "Detect Thoughts" to read surface thoughts; "Dimension Door" to teleport itself and an ally; "Silence" to create an area where no sound can be made; and "Slow" to hinder opponents' actions. Once per day, it can cast "Divination" to seek guidance from its deity or "Freedom of Movement" to ensure it isn’t hindered in movement.

Finally, it possesses the reactive ability "Esoteric Vengeance," which activates when it is attacked. If a creature within 30 feet successfully hits the cult leader, it can retaliate with a psychic attack that inflicts 7 psychic damage, potentially causing distractions or mental strain on its attackers. This adds an extra layer of strategy to its combat style, compelling enemies to think twice before engaging directly.</detail>
