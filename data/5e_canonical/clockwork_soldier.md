<summary>The Clockwork Soldier is a medium-sized construct that serves as a formidable combatant on the battlefield. With a solid armor class of 12 and 45 hit points, it possesses decent defensive capabilities, making it a resilient opponent. It is considered weak in terms of intelligence and charisma, showcased by its low scores in those attributes, but excels in Constitution with a score of 16, providing it with strong vitality. The Clockwork Soldier's challenge rating of 1 suggests it is suitable for low-level adventurers, providing a balance of threat without overwhelming their capabilities. Its primary strengths lie in damage immunities, special abilities such as Magic Resistance, and a unique Intimidation mechanic that scales with the presence of its allies, making it particularly effective in groups.</summary>

<detail>

The Clockwork Soldier has a Strength of 13, which results in a good modifier of +1, allowing it to perform tasks related to physical prowess adequately. Its Dexterity is also 13, contributing to an average modifier of +1, which provides a basic level of agility. The Constitution score of 16 translates into a very good +3 modifier, granting it significant health and resilience. Intelligence is very low at 5, leading to a bad -3 modifier, indicating it is not capable of complex thought or problem-solving. Wisdom is average at 10 with a +0 modifier, while the Charisma score is exceptionally low at 1, leading to a very bad -5 modifier, making it ineffective in social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Clockwork Soldier has a +5 modifier to Athletics due to its Strength, which allows it to perform physical activities well, and a -3 modifier to Intimidation because of its poor Charisma, which indicates it will struggle in attempts to intimidate others without the help of its special abilities.

The creature enjoys several benefits from its damage immunities, as it cannot be affected by poison or psychic damage. It is also immune to a variety of conditions, including charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it a robust combatant against many forms of magical control. The Clockwork Soldier has darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim or dark environments, and a passive perception score of 10 signals average sensory ability. It understands Common but cannot speak it.

Among its special abilities, Immutable Form grants the Clockwork Soldier immunity to any spell or effect that seeks to change its form, ensuring it maintains its construct state. Its Intimidating Legions ability allows it to intimidate more effectively as it stands alongside other Clockwork Soldiers, gaining bonuses to Charisma (Intimidation) checks that correspond to how many allies are in view or audible to the target, greatly enhancing its fear factor in numbers. Additionally, it boasts Magic Resistance, which provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further strengthening its defenses.

In terms of combat, the Clockwork Soldier wields a halberd, making melee attacks with a +3 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. When it successfully strikes a target, it deals 7 points of slashing damage using a 1d10 roll plus a +2 modifier. It also possesses a special action called Overdrive Flurry, which allows it to make four halberd attacks in one action; however, once it uses this ability, it becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, which can potentially leave it vulnerable if not timed properly in combat scenarios. Overall, the Clockwork Soldier is a versatile and resilient adversary, especially when operating as part of a group.</detail>
