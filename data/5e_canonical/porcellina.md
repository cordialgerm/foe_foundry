<summary>The Porcellina is a tiny beast known for its agility and cunning, often exhibiting surprising resilience in combat despite its small size. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it poses an intriguing challenge for low-level adventurers. The Porcellina possesses a moderate armor class of 13, making it somewhat difficult to hit, and it has a total of 28 hit points, providing it with a good chance to withstand several encounters. Its primary strengths lie in its dexterity and unique abilities, which allow it to effectively coordinate with allies and create tactical advantages through its pack tactics. However, its low strength and intelligence result in poor melee and cognitive performance, making it reliant on its companions for success in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Porcellina has the following attributes: Strength is 8 with a modifier of -1, which is considered very bad; Dexterity is 16 with a modifier of +3, regarded as very good; Constitution is 12 with a modifier of +1, which is average; Intelligence is 3 with a modifier of -4, deemed very bad; Wisdom is 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average; and Charisma is 6 with a modifier of -2, seen as bad. The Porcellina has saving throws in Dexterity with a +5 modifier, indicating a good resilience against effects that require dexterity saves. 

The creature has several notable special abilities. Its Keen Hearing and Smell gives it an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to these senses, enhancing its ability to detect danger or prey. With Pack Tactics, the Porcellina gains advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one unincapacitated ally is within 5 feet of the target, making it a formidable partner in battle. Additionally, its Poisonous Flesh ability means that any creature that touches it or consumes its meat must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one hour, creating a risk for any foe engaging with it physically.

In terms of actions, the Porcellina can execute a Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit, a range of 5 feet, and deals 8 (2d4+3) piercing damage. Furthermore, the target must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. The difficulty class for this saving throw increases by 1 for each additional Porcellina that has hit the same target since the end of this Porcellina's last turn, capping at a DC of 15, which can quickly escalate its effectiveness when in a group.

The Porcellina also has a reaction called Squeal, which it can use when it is hit by an attack. This reaction allows it to emit a blood-curdling scream, forcing each creature within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail the save become frightened until the end of their next turn. This ability can disrupt enemy strategies and create openings for the Porcellina and its allies to counterattack effectively.</detail>
