<summary>The Elder Ghost Boar is a formidable Huge monstrosity that strikes fear into the hearts of adventurers. Unaligned, this spectral creature has enhanced strengths such as exceptional Strength and good Constitution, enabling it to deal and withstand significant damage. However, it has very bad Dexterity, making it less agile and easy to hit with ranged attacks. With a Challenge Rating of 6, it presents a challenging foe, capable of wreaking havoc with its powerful attacks and unique abilities. Notably, it has the ability to phase through objects and creatures, allowing for clever maneuvering in combat situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Elder Ghost Boar has an Armor Class of 15, which provides decent protection against attacks. With 104 hit points, this creature has good survivability in battle, generally requiring multiple hits to bring down. Its attributes show a Strength score of 22 (+6), which is exceptional, allowing for devastating melee attacks, while its Dexterity at 9 (-1) places it in the very bad tier, limiting its agility. Its Constitution score of 17 (+3) is good, adding to its hit points and damage resistance. The Intelligence score of 7 (-2) is very bad, indicating a lack of intellect. Wisdom is average at 12 (+1), and Charisma is very bad at 7 (-2), pointing towards a lack of personal charm or presence, although it can understand Common.

The Elder Ghost Boar possesses several notable abilities. The **Charge** ability allows the boar to add an extra 14 (4d6) slashing damage to its tusk attack if it moves at least 20 feet straight towards a target before attacking. Additionally, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, emphasizing the boar's brute force. Its **Incorporeal Jaunt** ability allows it to become temporarily incorporeal while moving, allowing it to ignore obstacles but resulting in 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. This ability helps with maneuverability during combat.

The Elder Ghost Boar also has a **Relentless** trait that allows it to survive even the most devastating strikes. If it takes 20 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it drops to 1 hit point instead, which can prolong a fight and surprise attackers. Its **Spirit Conduit** ability allows it to possess a spirit from a dead creature nearby, using the speak with dead spell through its mouth. While incapacitated for up to one minute, it acts as a conduit for communication from the deceased, which might introduce unique roleplay opportunities or valuable information for characters.

In combat, the Elder Ghost Boar can engage with its **Multiattack**, making two tusk attacks. Each tusk attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit against a target and reaches 5 feet. When it connects, it deals 16 (3d6 + 6) slashing damage, adding to its terrifying presence on the battlefield.

As a reaction, the boar can use **Ghostly Slip** when targeted by an attack, spell, or when grappled or restrained. By becoming momentarily incorporeal, it gains resistance to non-force damage and escapes from grapples. This reaction enhances its survivability by evading damage and control effects.

Overall, the Elder Ghost Boar is a powerful and unique opponent that utilizes both brute force and ephemeral abilities to challenge adventurers through direct combat and strategic maneuvering.</detail>
