<summary>A Giant Goat is a large, horned herbivore that roams mountainous terrain and hilly regions. It has thick, coarse fur and impressive, curved horns that it uses to defend itself or challenge other animals. Giant Goats are strong and resilient, able to climb steep slopes and navigate rocky landscapes with ease. Despite their size, they are usually peaceful creatures, grazing on grasses and shrubs. However, when threatened, a Giant Goat can deliver powerful headbutts, knocking enemies off their feet or sending them tumbling down slopes.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Goat is a large beast known for its impressive physical strength and robust frame, making it a formidable creature despite its relatively low intelligence. With an Armor Class of 11, it has a decent chance of withstanding attacks, and the 22 hit points give it modest durability in battle. As a creature with a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it presents a manageable encounter for lower-level adventurers, primarily acting as an obstacle on journeys through hilly or mountainous terrain. Notably, its primary strength lies in its Ram attack, which can deal substantial damage and potentially knock opponents prone, allowing it to disrupt the flow of battle. However, its weaknesses include poor Dexterity and minimal magical abilities, indicating it relies on brute force rather than cunning or speed.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Giant Goat has a Strength score of 16, which translates to a modifier of +3, categorizing its physical power as very good. It has a Dexterity score of 10 with a modifier of +0, marking this as average, which means it is neither particularly nimble nor clumsy. The Constitution score of 14 gives it a +2 modifier, which is good, contributing positively to its hit points and overall durability. The intelligence score is notably low at 3, resulting in a -4 modifier, reflecting its very bad capability for complex thought or reasoning. Wisdom sits at 12, granting a +1 modifier, which is average for perception and awareness. Finally, the Charisma score of 6 results in a -2 modifier, indicating very bad social or magical interaction capabilities.

The Giant Goat has notable combat skills, particularly a saving throw bonus of +5 to Strength saves, making it exceptional in trying to resist grapples or similar effects. Its Athletics skill, with a +5 modifier, is also very good, allowing for impressive performance in physical activities such as climbing or jumping.

For its actions, the Giant Goat primarily utilizes the Ram ability. This is considered a melee weapon attack that adds +5 to hit, showcasing its very good offensive capability. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and can hit one target, delivering 8 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit, derived from rolling 2d4+3. If the Goat has moved at least 20 feet straight toward a target before launching this attack, it can inflict an additional 5 bludgeoning damage, bringing the total potential damage to 13. Additionally, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw; failure results in the creature falling prone, which can significantly alter the dynamics of the battle by giving the Giant Goat and its allies tactical advantage. 

Overall, the Giant Goat serves as an engaging and straightforward creature for adventurers to encounter, capable of physical dominance but lacking in other strategic dimensions.

The Giant Goat is a Large beast notable for its physical strength and aggressive behavior. It serves as a lower-tier encounter for adventurers, being particularly effective in charging at foes and causing extra damage. With its ability to frighten enemies with its Terrifying Scream, the Giant Goat can create opportunities for its allies or itself to gain the upper hand in combat. While its defensive capabilities are average with an Armor Class of 11 and modest hit points, its offensive potential is bolstered by its Charge ability and Ram attack, making it a threatening foe for low-level characters.

The Giant Goat has the following attributes: Strength of +3 (good), Dexterity of +0 (average), Constitution of +1 (average), Intelligence of -4 (very bad), Wisdom of +1 (average), and Charisma of -2 (bad). It lacks senses beyond a basic perception score of 11 and has a stealth score of 10, implying it is not particularly sneaky. It does not communicate with language.

The Giant Goat has a special ability called Charge. When the goat moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and hits with a Ram attack on the same turn, the target suffers an additional 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is another creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, making this ability quite effective in disrupting opponents' positions.

For its main action, the Giant Goat performs a Ram attack. This is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If it successfully hits, it deals 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, demonstrating its strong physical capability.

In terms of reactions, the Giant Goat can emit a Terrifying Scream when it takes damage. This high-pitched scream frightens creatures within a 10-foot radius. Each creature that can hear it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn. A creature affected by this ability cannot be frightened by the same Giant Goat's scream again for the next 24 hours, providing a tactical advantage in managing threats in close proximity.</detail>
