<summary>The Serpopard is a formidable large monstrosity known for its unique appearance and stealthy abilities. Unaligned in nature, this creature is adept at ambushing its foes in coastal or swampy environments, utilizing its camouflage and quick reflexes. With an Armor Class of 15 owing to its natural armor and a solid pool of 85 hit points, the Serpopard can endure significant damage in combat. It presents a Challenge Rating of 4, which makes it a mid-tier threat to adventurers, capable of dealing substantial damage with its multiattack feature, combining both bite and claw attacks. While it showcases strong Dexterity and Strength, it suffers from poor Intelligence and Charisma, indicating that it may lack in strategic interaction and social situations. Overall, the Serpopard is a dangerous predator that excels in ambush tactics but can be outmatched by clever opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Serpopard are as follows: 
- Strength 17 (+3): This is a good score that makes the Serpopard a powerful melee combatant.
- Dexterity 16 (+3): With this good score, it can evade many attacks and excel in stealth.
- Constitution 16 (+3): This is also a good score, providing it with extra resilience and health.
- Intelligence 2 (-4): This is very bad, reflecting its lack of reasoning or strategic thought.
- Wisdom 12 (+1): This is average, allowing for decent perception and insight.
- Charisma 6 (-2): This is very bad, limiting its ability to influence or scare other creatures.

The Serpopard has notable skills, including Perception at +3, which is an average score that enables it to notice details in its environment, and Stealth at +5, showcasing a very good ability to hide and remain undetected. It has damage resistance to poison and immunity to the poisoned condition, making it durable in battles where such effects are employed. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 13, which allows it to see in darkness and detect nearby creatures.

The Serpopard has two special abilities:
- Coastal Camouflage grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made when hiding in sandy, muddy, or swampy terrain, highlighting its exceptional skill in such environments.
- Sinuous Strikeback allows the Serpopard to make two additional reactions solely for opportunity attacks, enhancing its capacity to strike back against foes attempting to flee.

In combat, the Serpopard can perform several actions:
- Its Multiattack action enables it to make one Bite and two Claw attacks in a single turn, increasing its damage output significantly.
- The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing an average of 12 piercing damage on a successful hit.
- The Claw attack, with the same +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicts an average of 10 slashing damage.
- The Musk ability, which recharges after a short or long rest, allows the Serpopard to release a noxious musk in a 15-foot cone. Enemies within this area must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take an average of 21 (6d6) poison damage and become poisoned for one hour or until they clean off the musk. Successfully avoiding this attack results in half damage with no poisoning. Creatures poisoned by the musk impose a saving throw on nearby allies who must avoid being poisoned themselves, adding crowd control to the Serpopard's arsenal.</detail>
