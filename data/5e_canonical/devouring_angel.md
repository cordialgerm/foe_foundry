<summary>The Devouring Angel is a formidable aberration with a challenge rating of 12, making it a significant opponent for adventurers. With a large size and an impressive suite of abilities, it boasts a considerable armor class of 15, high hit points totaling 220, and various movement options that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its primary attributes are remarkably strong, especially its Strength at 20 and Constitution at 21, indicating exceptional durability and offensive potential. However, it possesses a low Intelligence score, which may limit its strategic capabilities in certain circumstances. This creature has a range of immunities to conditions such as being blinded, charmed, or frightened, enabling it to maintain its effectiveness in battle. While it can understand Common and Celestial, it lacks the ability to speak, relying instead on telepathic communication to convey simple messages. </summary>

<detail>

The Devouring Angel's attributes include a Strength score of 20, providing a very good modifier of +5; a Dexterity score of 15, yielding a good modifier of +2; a Constitution score of 21, offering an exceptional +5 modifier; an Intelligence score of 7, resulting in a very bad modifier of -2; a Wisdom score of 17, accounting for a good +3 modifier; and a Charisma score of 14, which gives it a good +2 modifier. It has a passive Perception of 17 thanks to its keen sense of smell, which grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks involving smell.

One of its notable special abilities is Assisted Leaping, allowing it to fly up to 30 feet using its quasi-wings, although it must start and end its movements on solid surfaces to avoid falling damage. The Flexible Form ability enables it to contort its body to pass through openings depending on their size, facilitating movement in tight situations. Limited Telepathy allows it to communicate telepathically with creatures that understand a language within a 100-foot range, conveying simple concepts and emotions.

In combat, the Devouring Angel can perform a Multiattack, which consists of one Bite and four Claw attacks, or it may replace one Claw with a Spiked Tongue attack. The Bite attack is executed with a melee weapon attack roll of +9 to hit, dealing 16 piercing damage plus an additional 10 acid damage on a successful hit. Similarly, the Claw attack also uses a +9 to hit modifier, inflicting 12 slashing damage. The Spiked Tongue attack, which has the same +9 to hit modifier, not only does 12 bludgeoning damage but also grapples its target on a hit, restraining them and dealing ongoing damage until the grapple ends.

Additionally, the Devouring Angel can unleash Shed Spines as a recharge action that takes effect on rolls of 5–6. By shaking its body, it projects acid-coated spines in a 10-foot radius, causing 18 piercing damage and 24 acid damage to each creature caught within the area. An affected target must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to halve the damage, showcasing the monster's potential for area-effect damage that can significantly impact the battlefield. Overall, the Devouring Angel presents a dangerous combination of physical prowess, mobility, and powerful ranged attacks that can challenge even experienced adventurers.</detail>
