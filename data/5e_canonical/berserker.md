<summary>A Berserker is a savage warrior who fights with unbridled fury, often driven into a battle frenzy that makes them nearly unstoppable. Clad in furs or piecemeal armor, Berserkers wield massive weapons such as great axes or clubs, and they attack with reckless abandon. Their rage fuels their strength, allowing them to shrug off wounds that would fell lesser warriors. Berserkers often come from wild or tribal societies, and they have little regard for tactics or strategy, relying solely on their raw power and bloodlust to carry them through battle.</summary>

<summary>The Berserker is a medium humanoid creature characterized by its aggressive combat style and ability to unleash powerful attacks when wounded. With a challenge rating of 2, it is intended for encounters that provide a moderate challenge to adventurers. The Berserker boasts a strong combination of physical attributes, particularly in strength and constitution, which enhance its combat effectiveness. However, its relatively low armor class suggests that it is more vulnerable to attacks when compared to more heavily armored foes. The Berserker shines in offensive capabilities but risks being easily overwhelmed if not supported by allies.</summary>

Its skills include athletics (+4), intimidation (+3), perception (+2), and survival (+2), showcasing its capability in physical confrontations and social intimidation.

The Berserker possesses special abilities that enhance its combat prowess. The first, Bloodied Frenzy, grants the Berserker advantage on all attacks and imposes advantage on attacks against it while it is bloodied, making it a formidable opponent when injured. The second ability, Unarmored Defense, allows its armor class to be calculated as 10 plus its Dexterity modifier (0) and Constitution modifier (+3), which contributes to an effective AC of 13.

In combat, the Berserker's Multiattack action allows it to make two melee attacks during its turn, increasing its overall damage output significantly. Its primary weapon is a Greataxe, which allows it to make melee weapon attacks with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 (1d12 + 2) slashing damage on a successful hit.

The Handaxe inflicts 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage on a successful hit.

Berserkers are known as lightly-armored and heavily-armed shock troops who prefer aggressive tactics such as charging at opponents and engaging in singular combat, rather than employing coordinated group formations. This fighting style makes them unpredictable and fierce adversaries on the battlefield.

The Berserker is a formidable medium humanoid creature known for its brutal fighting style and aggressive tactics in battle. With a challenge rating of 2, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who encounter it. The Berserker boasts impressive physical attributes, particularly in Strength, which allows it to deliver powerful attacks with its greataxe, inflicting substantial damage. Its resilience is enhanced by its decent Constitution score, giving it a moderate pool of hit points. However, its weaknesses lie in its lower Dexterity and intelligence, which could affect its defenses and ability to engage in strategic thinking during encounters.

Each attack has a hit modifier of +6, which is very good, and with a reach of 5 feet, it can engage enemies effectively.
