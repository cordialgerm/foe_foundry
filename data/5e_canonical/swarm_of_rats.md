<MonsterName/>Swarm of Rats</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>A Swarm of Rats is a seething mass of small rodents that move together in search of food. These swarms are commonly found in urban areas, sewers, or abandoned buildings, where they feed on anything they can find. While a single rat poses little danger, a swarm can quickly overwhelm an enemy with bites and scratches. Swarms of Rats are particularly dangerous in enclosed spaces, where their sheer numbers can make it difficult to escape. In addition to physical damage, they can spread disease, making them a hazard in both combat and in areas they infest.</summary>
