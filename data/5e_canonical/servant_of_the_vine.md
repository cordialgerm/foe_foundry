<summary>The Servant of the Vine is a medium-sized humanoid creature aligned with chaotic neutral instincts. It possesses a well-balanced set of physical and magical capabilities, making it a versatile addition to any encounter. With an Armor Class of 16 and a significant pool of Hit Points totaling 72, it can withstand a fair amount of damage before being incapacitated. The challenge rating of 6 indicates that parties of adventurers should prepare adequately to face this creature, which combines decent physical strength with potent spellcasting abilities. One of its notable strengths lies in its capability to inspire allies, increasing their performance in skills, while its spellcasting allows for a mix of healing, crowd control, and offensive spells. However, its strengths are balanced by some weaknesses, particularly in its lack of high Constitution and Strength scores, which may leave it open to certain physical attacks and effects. </summary>

<detail>

The Servant has the following attributes: Strength at 10 allows for average physical capabilities, Dexterity at 15 grants a good bonus of +2, Constitution at 11 is average, Intelligence at 13 is also average, while Wisdom at 16 provides a very good +3 modifier, and Charisma at 14 offers a good +2. The Servant excels in saving throws related to Wisdom (+6) and Charisma (+5), giving it the ability to resist mental effects and charms competently. Additionally, it is skilled in medicine (+6), perception (+6), and persuasion (+5), allowing it to effectively contribute both in and out of battle. 

Notable senses include darkvision allowing visibility in darkness up to 60 feet, and a passive perception score of 16, enabling it to notice hidden creatures or traps more easily. The Servant can communicate in Common, Elvish, and Sylvan, enhancing its interaction capabilities.

Among its special abilities, Fey Ancestry gives the Servant an exceptional advantage on saving throws against being charmed and makes it immune to magical sleep effects. The ability to Inspire Artistry allows the Servant to choose up to six creatures within a 50-foot range and grant them advantage on specific checks such as Dexterity (Acrobatics), Dexterity (Sleight of Hand), or Charisma (Performance) three times per day, enhancing their effectiveness in various challenges.

As an 11th-level spellcaster, the Servant has a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 bonus for spell attack rolls. Its cantrips include guidance, light, sacred flame, and thaumaturgy, which help in various situations, providing versatility and utility. Prepared spells include:

- 1st-level: blessings to enhance allies, create or destroy water (which can create wine), cure wounds for healing, and sanctuary for protection.
- 2nd-level: spells like hold person for incapacitating foes, lesser restoration for healing conditions, and protection from poison.
- 3rd-level: bestow curse to impose disadvantages, and dispel magic to nullify magical effects.
- 4th-level: guardian of faith as a protective spirit, and freedom of movement to enhance mobility.
- 5th-level: contagion can inflict debilitating effects on adversaries.
- 6th-level: both harm, which damages and weakens foes, and heal to restore a significant amount of hit points to allies.

In terms of combat actions, the Servant can perform a Multiattack, making three melee attacks called Drunken Slash, which carry a +5 to hit. Upon a successful hit, each slash inflicts slashing damage of 5 (1d6 + 2) and requires the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid being poisoned for one minute. The target has a chance to escape this effect by repeating the saving throw at the end of its turns. 

The Servant also possesses a powerful action called Stuporous Breath, which can be used every 5-6 turns. This ability releases poisonous fumes in a cone, dealing 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed DC 14 Constitution saving throw and causing affected creatures to fall asleep for one minute. A successful save results in half damage with no sleep effect. Unconscious targets can only awaken under specific circumstances, such as taking damage or being woken by another creature. Additionally, waking targets are left poisoned until they finish a short or long rest. Itâ€™s important to note that constructs and undead are not affected by this ability.</detail>
