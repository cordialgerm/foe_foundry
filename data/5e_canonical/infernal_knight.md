<detail>

The Infernal Knight possesses high ability scores: Strength is 24 (+7, very good), Dexterity is 14 (+2, average), Constitution is 20 (+5, very good), Intelligence is 17 (+3, good), Wisdom is 21 (+5, very good), and Charisma is 20 (+5, very good). It has advantageous saving throws in Dexterity (+7), Constitution (+10), and Wisdom (+10). Additionally, the Infernal Knight is skilled in Athletics (+12), Insight (+10), and Perception (+10). It is immune to fire, necrotic damage, and poison damage while being resistant to cold and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered. Its condition immunities include being charmed, exhausted, frightened, and poisoned. With truesight up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 20, it has keen senses and can communicate in Infernal and through telepathy within 120 feet. 

The Infernal Knight's special abilities enhance its effectiveness in both pursuit and combat. The Faultless Tracker ability allows it to know the direction and distance to its quarry when designated by its lord, provided both are on the same plane. Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells, making it more resilient to magical effects. Its attacks are categorized as magical, enhancing their damage potential. The Regeneration ability lets the Infernal Knight recover 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hp, prolonging its presence in the fight.

In combat encounters, the Infernal Knight utilizes several powerful actions. With the Multiattack action, it can make two melee attacks or use its Hellfire Bolt ability twice in a single turn. The Greatsword attack offers a +12 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 14 slashing damage and an additional 17 necrotic damage on a successful hit. Moreover, any creature struck must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw to avoid suffering disadvantage on attacks and ability checks tied to Strength or Dexterity until their next turn. 

The Hellfire Bolt is a ranged spell attack with a +10 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing 10 fire damage in addition to 17 necrotic damage. A target hit must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, lasting until the target finishes a long rest. This can effectively weaken enemies, potentially leading to their death if their maximum hit points reach zero.

The Reave Soul action can be used once the ability recharges on a roll of 5-6. This allows the Infernal Knight to target a creature with 0 hit points within 60 feet. If the creature is alive, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or die, with its soul drawn into the knight's greatsword. If the creature is dead for less than one minute, its soul is automatically captured. Capturing a soul grants the Infernal Knight 30 hit points and recharges Reave Soul, while trapped souls cannot be returned to life without a wish spell. A banishment spell aimed at the greatsword requires the knight to make a Charisma saving throw against the spell's effect; a fail releases any trapped souls instead of the spell working normally. Additionally, the Planar Rift ability allows it to create a portal to a chosen plane, remaining open for an hour, with a DC 18 spellcasting ability check needed to dispel it. 

This combination of abilities makes the Infernal Knight a challenging foe, capable of strategic manipulation in combat and immense damage potential. Its capacity to capture souls and regenerate hit points ensures that it poses a constant threat to any adversary, marking it as a significant entity in any encounter.</detail>
