<summary>The Stormboar is a formidable large monstrosity characterized by its combination of physical prowess and electrical abilities. With a robust Armor Class of 15 and a substantial hit point pool of 95, the Stormboar can withstand a fair amount of damage while dishing out punishing attacks. Its Challenge Rating of 6 indicates that it poses a significant threat to mid-level adventurers. The creature is particularly notorious for its electrical immunities and its ability to deal both slashing and lightning damage, making it a versatile opponent. However, its low intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores suggest limited capabilities in terms of spellcasting and tactical ingenuity, while its reliance on physical attacks means it may struggle against ranged or spellcasting opponents. </summary>

<detail>

The Stormboar possesses impressive physical attributes with a Strength score of 19, offering a +4 modifier which is classified as very good for melee attacks, and a Constitution score of 18, signifying strong durability. Its Dexterity is average at 12, which results in a +1 modifier, while its mental stats are notably poor, making it ineffective in intellectual or social engagements. 

The Stormboar has several notable special abilities:
- Iron Scent allows the creature to detect ferrous metals within a 60-foot radius by scent, which can be useful for locating weapons or armor.
- Lightning Hide deals lightning damage to enemies who touch it or make melee attacks against it within close proximity, specifically 5 feet, dealing an average of 5 damage.
- Relentless is particularly formidable; it prevents the Stormboar from being easily defeated, allowing it to remain at 1 hit point if it would otherwise be reduced to 0, assuming it takes 15 damage or less.
- Thunder Charge enhances its tusk attack by adding an extra 11 thunder damage if the Stormboar moves at least 20 feet towards a target before the hit, while also potentially knocking that target prone with a successful Strength saving throw.

In terms of actions, the Stormboar employs:
- The Tusk attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, capable of delivering 11 slashing damage along with 11 lightning damage. This attack also poses a threat to nonmagical metal armor, which can suffer a permanent -2 penalty to AC, damaging the armor's effectiveness significantly if this penalty reduces its AC to 10 or below.
- Lightning Run is a powerful movement ability that allows the Stormboar to move through creatures and objects, dealing substantial lightning damage to any creatures in its path. This action can disrupt enemy formations and create opportunities while avoiding opportunity attacks.
- Thunder Leap enables the Stormboar to jump up to 20 feet while dealing thunder damage to creatures nearby during the leap and upon landing, pushing back those affected. This can shift the battlefield and create space between the Stormboar and its foes.

The Stormboar is a challenging adversary, combining high durability, substantial damage output, and unique abilities that leverage both close-quarters combat and mobility, making it a dangerous encounter for adventurers.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Iron Scent:** The boar can pinpoint, by scent, the location of ferrous metal within 60 feet of it.
- **Lightning Hide:** A creature that touches the boar or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (2d4) lightning damage.
- **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** If the boar takes 15 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hp, it is reduced to 1 hp instead.
- **Thunder Charge:** If the boar moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 11 (2d10) thunder damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Actions

- **Tusk:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage and 11 (2d10) lightning damage. In addition, nonmagical metal armor worn by the target is partly devoured by the boar and takes a permanent and cumulative -2 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.
- **Lightning Run (Recharge 6):** The boar becomes a bolt of living lightning and moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. It can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage and is pushed to the closest unoccupied space if it ends its turn inside an object. Each creature in the boar’s path must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Thunder Leap (Recharge 6):** The boar moves up to 20 feet, jumping over obstacles in its way. Difficult terrain doesn’t cost it extra movement when it leaps. Each creature within 10 feet of the boar when it leaps and each creature within 10 feet of where it lands must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 16 (3d10) thunder damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the boar. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed.
