<summary>The Hoard Drake is a large, neutral evil dragon known for its greed and affinity for treasure. As a creature of significant power, it embodies both physical prowess and the unique ability to manipulate its surroundings through its knowledge of valuable items. With a strong Constitution of 20 and an excellent Armor Class of 16, the Hoard Drake is resilient in battle, able to withstand a considerable amount of damage. However, its Dexterity is notably low, making it less agile in combat. The creature is particularly dangerous when facing opponents who possess items of value to it, as it gains advantages against such targets. Its unique abilities, like detecting treasures within proximity and the special attack known as Midas Breath, make it a formidable foe in both combat and strategic encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Hoard Drake has an Armor Class of 16, which provides a good defense, making it somewhat challenging for attackers to land hits. It has 147 hit points, calculated from rolling 14 ten-sided dice and adding 70, providing it with a very good level of durability. Its movement speed is average, allowing it to walk 40 feet per turn. The creature is rated with a Challenge Rating of 8, indicating it is suitable for a party of moderate experience.

When examining its attributes, the Hoard Drake has the following scores: Strength at 18 (+4) is exceptional, making it powerful in melee attacks; Dexterity at 7 (-2) is very bad, leading to poor performance in agile maneuvers; Constitution at 20 (+5) is exceptional, ensuring it can endure a lot of damage; Intelligence at 16 (+3) is good, providing strategic thinking; Wisdom at 10 (+0) is average, indicating no particular strengths or weaknesses in perception; and Charisma at 12 (+1) is also average, signifying a fair presence in interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Hoard Drake has a Strength modifier of +7, which is good, and a Constitution modifier of +8, also good, helping it resist physical and magical effects. It boasts skills in Arcana, History, and Nature, each at +6, which is good and reflects its extensive knowledge regarding lore and the natural world. Its Perception skill is at +3, which is average, allowing it to notice common details in its environment.

This dragon is immune to fire damage, which makes it particularly resistant to attacks from fiery spells or creatures, showcasing its resilience. Its darkvision extends 120 feet, allowing it to see in the dark effectively, and it has a passive Perception score of 13. The Hoard Drake can communicate in both Common and Draconic languages.

The Hoard Drake possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in both combat and treasure hunting. "Miser’s Fury" allows it to have advantage on Wisdom (Perception and Survival) checks related to its hoard, ensuring it can always track its treasures efficiently. Additionally, it gains advantage on attack rolls against creatures that possess any part of its hoard, dramatically increasing its chances of success when confronting thieves or adventurers who have taken its treasures. Another ability, "Treasure Sense," enables the drake to uniquely sense and locate precious metals and magical items within a 60-foot radius, marking it as a formidable guardian of wealth.

In battle, the Hoard Drake can take multiple actions. With its "Multiattack" ability, it can make three attacks during one turn: one with its bite and two with its claws. The bite attack has a +7 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 17 piercing damage on a hit, which is quite damaging. The claw attacks also have a +7 to hit and deal 14 slashing damage each, contributing to the drake's overall offensive capabilities.

One of its most powerful features is "Midas Breath," which it can use after a recharge period. This ability allows the drake to exhale molten gold in a 30-foot cone, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take 36 fire damage and have gold cling to them, hampering their movement until they can take an action to remove it. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw take half damage and avoid the cling effect. The gold produced can cool down and be collected, providing treasure worth approximately 50 gold pieces, adding an extra layer of temptation and risk to facing a Hoard Drake.</detail>
