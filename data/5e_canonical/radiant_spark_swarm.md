<summary>The Radiant Spark Swarm is a Medium elemental creature known for its swift movements and affinity for magic. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a moderate challenge for adventurers, boasting a combination of resilience and damage potential. The swarm is immune to fire, poison, and radiant damage, making it particularly difficult to harm with typical attacks. It can fly and hover freely, avoiding the limitations of ground movement while being incapable of walking. The swarm's ability to target magic items makes it a dangerous adversary, especially in environments rich with magic. However, its relatively low hit points and poor Strength score render it vulnerable to crowd control and area-of-effect tactics.</summary>

<detail>

The Radiant Spark Swarm has an Armor Class of 16, which is considered good for its Challenge Rating, and total Hit Points of 38, calculated from rolling 7d8 and adding a Constitution modifier of +1. The swarm possesses the following ability scores: Strength of 8 (-1, very bad), Dexterity of 17 (+3, good), Constitution of 12 (+1, average), Intelligence of 2 (-4, very bad), Wisdom of 13 (+1, average), and Charisma of 15 (+2, good).

In terms of resistances and immunities, the swarm is immune to many common conditions such as being charmed, frightened, and unconscious while also being resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It has the ability to see in the dark up to 60 feet and has a passive Perception of 11, allowing it to detect threats in its vicinity.

The Radiant Spark Swarm possesses the following special abilities:

- **Drawn to Magic:** This ability allows the swarm to detect magical items within 60 feet of its location. If the swarm begins its turn near a magic item, it is compelled to move toward that item, hovering around it. If a creature is using the item, the swarm will attack that creature. In situations with multiple magical items nearby, it prioritizes attacking the most rare item. This ability forces adventurers to be cautious, as it can redirect the swarm's attention effectively.

- **Burning Radiance:** This ability deals damage to any creature that comes into direct contact with the swarm, starts its turn in the swarm's space, or attacks it with a melee attack while close by. The damage is 2 radiant and 2 fire (totaling 4, rolled as 1d4 each). 

- **Illumination:** The swarm continuously emits bright light in a 10-foot radius, with dim light extending for an additional 10 feet. This ability can compromise the stealth of characters operating in low-light conditions.

- **Swarm:** As a swarm, it can occupy the space of other creatures, allowing it to maneuver effectively during encounters. The swarm can pass through openings suitable for Tiny-sized creatures and cannot regain or gain temporary hit points at any point.

The swarm can take the action **Radiant Sparks**, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, although it has no reach, as it occurs within the space it occupies. On a hit, the swarm inflicts a significant 9 radiant and 9 fire damage (totalling 18, rolled as 2d8 each). If it has half or fewer hit points, the damage is halved to 4 radiant and 4 fire (totalling 8, rolled as 1d8 each). This attack is potent enough to be a primary threat in close-range combat.

Overall, the Radiant Spark Swarm is a dynamic foe that can disrupt adventurers who possess magical items while dealing notable damage if approached carelessly. Its blend of mobility, damage immunity, and attacking capabilities overall make it a formidable opponent of its level.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Drawn to Magic:** The radiant spark swarm can pinpoint the location of magical items within 60 feet of it. If the swarm starts its turn within 60 feet of a magic item, it moves to that magic item and hovers around it. If the item is being worn or carried by a creature, the swarm attacks that creature. If multiple magic items are within 60 feet of the swarm, it moves to the item that is most rare. If more than one item is most rare, choose randomly among them.

- **Illumination:** The radiant spark swarm sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny elemental. The swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.
