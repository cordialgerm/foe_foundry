The Wereowl has darkvision out to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions effectively, and a passive Perception score of 17, which is very good.

The Wereowl has several notable special abilities:

- **Keen Hearing and Sight:** The Wereowl gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight, greatly enhancing its ability to detect threats.
- **Shapechanger:** This ability allows the Wereowl to switch between its three forms (humanoid, hybrid, giant owl) at will, maintaining its statistics except for size. Equipment remains unchanged during transformation. If the Wereowl dies, it returns to its true human form.
- **Silent Flight (Hybrid or Owl Form Only):** When flying in either the hybrid or owl form, it gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, making it exceptionally stealthy.

For actions, the Wereowl can perform the following:

- **Multiattack:** In owl form, it makes two talon attacks. In humanoid form, it can make three shortbow or shortsword attacks. In hybrid form, it can choose to attack as either its owl or humanoid form.
- **Shortsword (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only):** This melee attack has a +6 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and deals 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Talon (Hybrid or Owl Form Only):** This attack has a +5 to hit, reaching 5 feet, with a damage output of 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become cursed with wereowl lycanthropy, introducing a significant threat.
- **Shortbow (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only):** This ranged attack has a +6 to hit with a range of 80/320 feet, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

Overall, the Wereowl is a dangerous and versatile adversary with the potential to inflict lasting effects on characters who encounter it, especially due to its shapechanging ability and potential lycanthropy curse.</detail>
