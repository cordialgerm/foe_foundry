<summary>The Hippocampus is a large beast that can adapt to both aquatic and aerial environments, making it a versatile creature in its home habitats. With an Armor Class of 11 and 42 hit points, its defenses are relatively low, making it vulnerable to attacks if caught unaware. However, its ability to swim at 60 feet gives it exceptional mobility in water, allowing it to evade threats effectively. With a challenge rating of 1, it represents a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, particularly in aquatic settings where it can utilize its speed and special abilities to their fullest extent. The Hippocampus possesses the unique ability to provide fresh air to riders through its special gills, offering utility beyond just combat scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The Hippocampus has the following attributes: Strength +4 (good), Dexterity +1 (average), Constitution +1 (average), Intelligence -4 (very bad), Wisdom +1 (average), and Charisma -1 (bad). It has a perception score of 13, which indicates a good awareness level of its surroundings. Its stealth score of 11 is average, enabling it to remain unnoticed in certain situations, though it's not exceptional.

Special abilities of the Hippocampus include Amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, and Shared Breath, which enables it to help air-breathing companions by providing fresh air when they are riding it, as long as the Hippocampus isn't engaged in combat or moving rapidly.

In terms of actions, the Hippocampus can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make both a Bite attack and a Tail Slap attack in one turn. The Bite attack has a +6 to hit and can deal 7 piercing damage upon a successful hit, while the Tail Slap attack also has a +6 to hit and deals 8 bludgeoning damage. This makes its attacks effective, particularly in water where it can assert dominance.

As a bonus action, the Hippocampus can perform a Rearing Kick, targeting a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or pushed up to 10 feet away, whichever the Hippocampus prefers. This ability can effectively control the battlefield, pushing enemies away or disrupting their positions. Overall, the Hippocampus is a formidable creature in aquatic confrontations, utilizing both its strengths and special abilities to assist itself and its riders.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious.** The hippocampus can breathe air and water.
- **Shared Breath.** The hippocampus’s gills pull more air from the water than the hippocampus needs, expelling the excess as bubbles down its neck and across its back. If an air-breathing creature is riding the hippocampus, these bubbles can provide that creature a supply of fresh air when the hippocampus isn’t in combat or traveling at a fast pace.

- **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Tail Slap.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Rearing Kick.** The hippocampus rears up and kicks its forelegs at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be knocked prone or pushed up to 10 feet away from the hippocampus (the hippocampus’s choice).
