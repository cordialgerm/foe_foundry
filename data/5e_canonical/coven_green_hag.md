<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Coven Green Hag is a cunning and dangerous creature hailing from the fey realms. As a Medium fey, it possesses a strong combination of magical abilities and physical prowess, making it a formidable opponent in combat and a master of deception. With an Armor Class of 14, the hag is somewhat difficult to hit, and its 97 hit points indicate that it can endure a fair amount of damage before falling. It boasts a Challenge Rating of 5, indicating that it poses a significant threat to adventurers. The hag's most notable strengths lie in its spellcasting ability, access to harmful hexes, and transformation powers, allowing it to shift between forms to gain tactical advantages. However, its reliance on spells and abilities means that it can be less effective when those resources are depleted or interrupted.</summary>

<detail>

The hag has the following ability scores: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 14 (+2), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma 16 (+3). Its Strength is good, allowing it to make effective melee attacks, while its Dexterity grants it good reflexes, enhancing its defense. The hag's moderate Constitution provides average durability, and its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, each rating average to good, support its spellcasting and skills. The hag is also proficient in Constitution saving throws with a modifier of +4, and Wisdom saving throws, also with a modifier of +4. This makes it reasonably resilient to spells and effects targeting those attributes.

The Coven Green Hag has several special abilities. Its Amphibious trait allows it to breathe both air and water, providing versatility in combat situations that take place in aquatic environments. Its Innate Spellcasting is based on Charisma with a spell save DC of 13, enabling it to cast spells without needing material components. The spells it can cast at will include Dancing Lights, which creates multiple lights that the hag can manipulate, Disguise Self, allowing it to change its appearance, Invisibility, which renders it unseen for a duration or until it attacks or casts a spell, and Minor Illusion, a spell used to create misleading sounds or images. Once per day, the hag can cast Geasâ€”a powerful spell that compels a target to perform a task, establishing a magical bond that can influence a character's actions.

In terms of actions, the Coven Green Hag can make a Multiattack, striking twice with its claws, which have a +5 to hit modifier. On a successful attack, the claws deal an average of 12 slashing damage. The hag can also use its Hex ability, targeting a creature within 60 feet that isn't already hexed. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted by one of four different curses lasting 30 days. The Hex options include: Charm Hex, which causes the target to become charmed by the hag; Fear Hex, which instills fear in the target; Ill Fortune Hex, which allows the hag to hinder the target's long-duration tasks; and Sleep Hex, which puts the target to sleep, ending if it takes damage or is awakened by another creature. Additionally, the Hag can use its Beast Form ability to transform into a Large or smaller beast, which increases its speed and grants it additional movement capabilities, while preventing it from casting spells or using its Hex until it reverts back to its true form. 

Overall, the Coven Green Hag is a master of manipulation and surprise in combat, its combination of spellcasting, hexing, and transformation make it a multi-faceted threat on the battlefield.</detail>
