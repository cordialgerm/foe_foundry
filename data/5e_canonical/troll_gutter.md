<detail>

The Gutter Troll has the following attributes: 
- Strength is 18, giving it a +4 modifier, which is classified as very good, enhancing its melee attack potency.
- Dexterity is 16, providing a +3 modifier, which is considered good, aiding in both defense and initiative.
- Constitution is also 16, corresponding to a +3 modifier, classified as good, allowing for significant Hit Points and durability.
- Intelligence is low at 7, resulting in a -2 modifier, which is very bad, limiting its cognitive abilities and skill checks.
- Wisdom is average at 11, with no modifier, describing it as average and having minimal impact on perception or insight.
- Charisma is very low at 7, leading to a -2 modifier, which is very bad, indicating its inability to influence others.

The Gutter Troll possesses several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in combat:
- Amphibious capability allows it to breathe both air and water, enabling it to navigate in aquatic environments.
- Keen Smell grants it an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, making it adept at detecting hidden or approaching creatures.
- Psychoactive Sweat forces any creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of the troll to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw; failure means the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn, negatively affecting its performance.
- Regeneration allows the troll to regain 10 Hit Points at the start of its turn, except when it has taken damage from acid or fire. It can only die if it starts its turn at 0 Hit Points and does not regenerate, making it extremely resilient.

In terms of actions, the Gutter Troll can perform the following:
- Multiattack enables it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks on its turn, or it can replace its Bite attack with a Sticky Tongue attack.
- The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, providing a decent chance to strike. It deals 8 piercing damage (1d8+4).
- Claw attacks also have a +6 to hit and can deal 9 slashing damage (2d4+4) per attack.
- The Sticky Tongue attack is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, and it has a reach of 20 feet. It deals 7 bludgeoning damage (1d6+4) and can potentially pull the target up to 15 feet closer to the troll if the target fails a DC 14 Strength saving throw.

The Gutter Troll's combination of regenerative abilities, melee prowess, and toxic presence make it a dangerous foe that can pose significant challenges to adventurers.</detail>
