<summary>A Bugbear is a hulking, goblinoid creature with long arms, shaggy fur, and a brutish appearance. Known for their strength and stealth, Bugbears excel at ambush tactics, often attacking from the shadows or using their surprising agility to strike swiftly. They live in caves or abandoned ruins, forming small bands that raid and pillage weaker settlements. Bugbears are violent and cruel, reveling in the fear they inspire in their enemies. They are typically armed with large clubs, axes, or spiked weapons, and their physical power allows them to overpower most opponents in close combat.</summary>

<summary>The Bugbear is a Medium humanoid creature typically characterized by its brutish strength and stealthy abilities. With an Armor Class of 12, the Bugbear is not particularly difficult to hit, but it compensates for this with significant hit points totaling 30, derived from 5d8 + 8. This creature has a Challenge Rating of 1, making it a moderate threat in combat scenarios. It possesses a balance of physical and stealth-related skills, including proficiency in athletics and stealth, both of which allow it to engage in effective ambush tactics. Bugbears are clever hunters who can grapple their foes, making them formidable without being overwhelming. Their weaknesses lie in their average intelligence and charisma, which limits their social interactions and spellcasting capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Bugbear has the following attribute values: Strength at 14, Dexterity at 14, Constitution at 14, Intelligence at 10, Wisdom at 12, and Charisma at 10. These scores translate to modifiers of +2 for Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, 0 for Intelligence and Charisma, and +1 for Wisdom. The strength and dexterity scores are good, enabling it to deal significant melee damage and perform stealth actions effectively. The Constitution score is also good, providing a decent pool of hit points, while the low intelligence and charisma are average at best, limiting the Bugbear's versatility outside of combat.

The Bugbear has notable skills that enhance its effectiveness: athletics at +4, stealth at +4, perception at +3, and survival at +3. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, up to 60 feet, making it adept in low-light conditions. With a passive perception of 15, it can detect hidden enemies and threats, giving it an edge in ambush scenarios. The Bugbear is able to communicate in Common and Goblin.

In terms of actions, the Bugbear possesses several attacks:

- Strangle: This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. The Strangle action can only target a Medium or smaller creature that is surprised, grappled, or unable to see the Bugbear. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 9 bludgeoning damage and pulls the target 5 feet closer, establishing a grapple. The target must succeed on an escape check against a DC of 12 to free itself. While grappled, the victim cannot breathe and the Bugbear automatically hits with this attack until the grapple is broken.

- Maul: This is another melee weapon attack, with a reach of 5 feet and also requiring a +4 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 9 bludgeoning damage, making it quite effective in close combat.

- Javelin: The Bugbear can employ a Javelin as a melee or ranged attack, again with a +4 to hit. The Javelin has a reach of 5 feet for melee attacks or a range of 30 feet up to 120 feet for ranged attacks. A successful hit deals 5 piercing damage or 12 piercing damage if the target is surprised or cannot see the Bugbear. This ability allows the Bugbear to engage enemies from a distance if necessary.

- Stealthy Sneak: This special ability allows the Bugbear to move up to half its speed without triggering opportunity attacks from creatures, thus enabling it to position itself strategically. After moving, it can attempt to hide, making it a master of ambush tactics.

Overall, the Bugbear is a cunning and dangerous opponent whose ability to strike from the shadows and grapple its prey makes it a notable adversary in any combat scenario.

The Bugbear is a medium humanoid creature known for its brutish strength and cunning nature. With a challenge rating of 1, it serves as a formidable opponent for low to mid-level adventurers. The Bugbear excels in melee combat, thanks to its high Strength score of +5, which grants it exceptional damage potential when it strikes with its weapons. However, it is somewhat vulnerable to ranged attacks due to its moderate Dexterity and Constitution scores. The Bugbear specializes in stealth, making it an effective ambusher, and it has a significant advantage when attacking surprised foes, allowing it to inflict additional damage and potentially stun them in the process.

The Bugbear has the following attributes:
- Strength: +5 (exceptional), which enhances its melee attack rolls and damage output.
- Dexterity: +2 (good), improving its ability to avoid attacks and its effectiveness with ranged weapons.
- Constitution: +1 (average), offering a small bonus to its hit points and resilience against damage.
- Intelligence: -1 (bad), indicating a limited capacity for complex thought and strategy.
- Wisdom: +0 (average), providing a baseline for perception and insight checks.
- Charisma: -1 (bad), indicating social and interactional weaknesses.

The Bugbear has darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light and darkness as if they were bright light. Its passive perception is 10, which is quite basic, indicating it may notice threats rather well if alert, but not extraordinarily so. The Bugbear is stealthy, with a Stealth score of 16 (very good), making it adept at sneaking and ambushing unsuspecting targets. It can communicate in Common and Goblin, allowing it to interact with a variety of creatures.

Among its special abilities, the Bugbear has a notable feature called Brutal. This ability allows its melee weapons to deal one extra die of damage upon hitting a target, enhancing its already high damage output effectively.

When it comes to actions, the Bugbear wields a Spiked Club as a melee weapon and has an attack bonus of +5 to hit. The club has a reach of 5 feet and can inflict 12 piercing damage (2d8 + 3) on a successful hit. Notably, if the target is caught by surprise, it receives an additional 4 piercing damage (1d8) and must pass a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 13 or be stunned until the end of its next turn. This can significantly alter the course of combat, as a stunned target cannot take actions, potentially leaving it vulnerable to follow-up attacks.

Additionally, the Bugbear can throw a Javelin, which can either be a melee or ranged attack. It shares the same attack bonus of +5 to hit and can be used in melee range (5 feet) or at a distance with a range of 30/120 feet. When thrown, the Javelin deals 10 piercing damage (2d6 + 3) in melee, or 5 piercing damage (1d6 + 2) at range, giving the Bugbear versatility in combat situations.

Overall, the Bugbear combines brute strength with stealth, making it a dangerous adversary when encountered, especially under the right conditions.</detail>
