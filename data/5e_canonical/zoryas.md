<summary>Zoryas are medium celestial beings with a lawful good alignment, embodying the principles of light and order. They act as protectors and guides, often intervening in mortal matters to uphold justice and assist those in need. With a solid hit point pool and decent armor class, the Zoryas can endure in combat, leveraging their magical abilities to gain an edge. Their ability to regenerate provides them with longevity in battle, although they are vulnerable to necrotic damage. With proficiency in charisma saving throws and impressive wisdom stats, Zoryas are especially potent against magical effects and possess remarkable insight and perception skills. Their unique abilities allow them to deal significant radiant or fire damage, manipulate light and darkness, and open celestial gateways, making them formidable and versatile opponents.</summary>

<detail>

The Zoryas has the following attributes: Strength of 16 (+3, which is good), Dexterity of 10 (+0, average), Constitution of 14 (+2, average), Intelligence of 10 (+0, average), Wisdom of 18 (+4, exceptional), and Charisma of 18 (+4, exceptional). It has proficiency in saving throws related to Charisma, granting it a bonus of +7, which is exceptional compared to typical saving throws. Zoryas are skilled in insight and perception, with a +7 modifier in each case, which is also exceptional. They resist fire and radiant damage as well as damage from non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, providing them with good defensive capabilities. Furthermore, they are immune to conditions such as blindness, charm, deafness, exhaustion, and fear, enhancing their survivability in adverse circumstances. With truesight extending 60 feet and a passive perception of 17, they can detect hidden individuals and see through illusions effectively. The Zoryas can communicate in all languages and possess telepathy that operates at a range of 120 feet.

The Zoryas' special abilities include "Fire and Light," which means their weapon attacks are treated as magical and deal an additional 3d8 damage as either radiant or fire damage, chosen before the attack roll. This provides substantial offensive capability. "Open Celestial Gate" allows them to create a shimmering portal to the celestial plane, shedding bright light and lasting for 1 hour, but they are rendered unconscious for six days after closing the gate. Their "Regeneration" ability grants them the recovery of 10 hit points at the beginning of their turn, though it does not function if they have taken necrotic damage prior. "Sun's Guidance," usable three times a day, grants the Zoryas advantage on melee attack rolls until the end of their next turn, significantly enhancing their offensive potential.

For their actions, the Zoryas can perform a "Multiattack," allowing them to make two melee attacks with their morningstar. The morningstar itself has a +6 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 7 piercing damage alongside an extra 13 radiant or fire damage, showcasing their offensive strength. "Light of Dawn," which recharges after a long rest, creates intense light affecting all creatures within a 30-foot radius, compelling them to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become blinded for 1d4 rounds. Undead creatures that fail the save sustain additional damage. This ability can disrupt enemy tactics and provides support for allies. "Dusk's Arrival," which also recharges after a long rest, creates an area of darkness and requires creatures nearby to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer 18 cold damage, halved on success. This ability can control the battlefield effectively by restricting visibility, giving the Zoryas a strategic advantage.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Fire and Light:** The zoryas' weapon attacks are magical. When the zoryas hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 radiant or fire damage (included in the attack). The zoryas chooses whether its attack does radiant or fire damage before making the attack roll.
- **Open Celestial Gate:** As an action, the zoryas opens a gateway to the celestial plane. The gate appears as a shimmering circle that sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet and is framed by twisting, golden strands. The gate lasts 1 hour; though, the zoryas can choose to close it at any time as a bonus action. Once the gate closes, the zoryas is reduced to 0 hp and remains unconscious for six days, awakening, fully restored, at sunrise on the seventh day. The zoryas can't pass through its own gate.
- **Regeneration:** The zoryas regains 10 hp at the start of its turn. If the zoryas takes necrotic damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the zoryas' next turn. The zoryas' body is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn't regenerate.
- **Sun's Guidance (3/Day):** The zoryas has advantage on melee attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

Each creature within 30 feet of the zoryas must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. An undead creature who fails this save also takes 13 (3d8) fire damage. The light dispels up to three spells or other magical effects of 3rd level or lower like the dispel magic spell within the area.
- **Dusk's Arrival (Recharges after a Long Rest):** The zoryas' lantern darkens, snuffing out nearby natural and magical sources of light. Each creature within 30 feet of the zoryas must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area is bathed in darkness like the darkness spell until the end of the zoryas' next turn.
