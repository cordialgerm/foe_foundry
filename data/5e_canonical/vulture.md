<summary>A Vulture is a large, carrion-eating bird with a bald head and sharp beak, known for scavenging the remains of dead creatures. Vultures play a vital role in their ecosystems, cleaning up decaying remains that other animals leave behind. Though not typically aggressive, Vultures are drawn to death and will circle above dying or dead creatures, waiting for the opportunity to feed. In battle, their sharp talons and beaks can be dangerous to smaller creatures, but they prefer to avoid conflict, relying on their keen senses to locate food from miles away.</summary>
