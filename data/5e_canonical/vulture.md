<summary>A Vulture is a large, carrion-eating bird with a bald head and sharp beak, known for scavenging the remains of dead creatures. Vultures play a vital role in their ecosystems, cleaning up decaying remains that other animals leave behind. Though not typically aggressive, Vultures are drawn to death and will circle above dying or dead creatures, waiting for the opportunity to feed. In battle, their sharp talons and beaks can be dangerous to smaller creatures, but they prefer to avoid conflict, relying on their keen senses to locate food from miles away.</summary>

<summary>The vulture is a medium beast characterized by its scavenging attributes and keen sensory abilities. With an armor class of 10, it offers minimal protection, and it possesses just 4 hit points, indicating that it is rather frail and can be easily taken down in combat. The vulture has a flying speed of 50 feet, allowing it to escape threats quickly, but its walking speed of only 10 feet limits its mobility on the ground. It operates in a challenge rating of 0, indicating that it presents very little threat to adventurers, earning only 25 experience points upon defeat. Notably, the vulture can take advantage of its keen sight and smell, providing it with the ability to notice threats or opportunities effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The vulture's attributes include a strength score of 6, which gives it a strength modifier of -2, making it exceptionally weak in physical confrontations. Its dexterity is average at 10 with a +0 modifier, indicating basic agility but no remarkable speed or evasiveness, while its constitution is also average at 10 with a +0 modifier, denoting that it can withstand typical physical strains. The intelligence score is very low at 2, giving it an intelligence modifier of -4, which suggests the vulture lacks the capacity for complex thought and reasoning. It has a wisdom score of 12, resulting in a +1 modifier, making it reasonably aware of its surroundings, complemented by a perception skill of +3. Finally, its charisma is low with a score of 6 and a -2 modifier, indicating it possesses little ability to influence others or interact socially.

One of the vulture's notable special abilities is "Keen Sight and Smell," which grants it advantage on perception checks relying on sight and smell. This ability is advantageous in detecting predators or other creatures in its vicinity, making it a proficient scavenger.

In terms of actions, the vulture can perform a melee weapon attack using its beak. This attack has a +2 to hit, allowing for a modest chance of success against foes. The beak deals 2 piercing damage on a hit, which is not substantial but can contribute to its role as a nuisance in combat.

The vulture also possesses a reaction called "Retreat." When targeted by a melee attack, it can move 5 feet away from the attacker. If this movement takes it out of the predator's reach, the attacker suffers disadvantage on their attack roll. This ability enhances the vulture's survivability, making it more difficult to strike when it senses danger. Overall, while the vulture is not a formidable foe, its abilities focus on evading threats and scavenging effectively in its environment.

The Vulture is a medium-sized beast known for its role as a scavenger in the ecosystem. With a low overall challenge rating of 0, it poses little threat to adventurers in direct combat. The Vulture has an average armor class of 10 and only 8 hit points, making it quite fragile. Its strengths include heightened perception abilities that enable it to detect carrion and enhance its sight and smell. Moreover, it benefits from pack tactics, gaining an advantage on attacks when in proximity to allies. However, its weaknesses include low strength and charisma ratings, rendering it ineffective in melee combat and social interactions. Notably, the Vulture can incapacitate attackers with its defensive bile, adding an unexpected level of utility in a fight.

The Vulture has the following attributes: strength is rated at -2, which is very bad, dexterity is +0 (average), constitution is +1 (average), intelligence is -4 (very bad), wisdom is +1 (average), and charisma is -3 (very bad). The creature's stealth score is a modest 10, while its perception score is 13, translating to an effective perception of 18 when detecting via sight or smell due to its heightened senses.

The Vulture possesses special abilities that enhance its scavenging capability and combat performance. The Carrion Sense allows the Vulture to locate carrion, dead creatures, and undead creatures within 60 feet by scent alone. Heightened Sight and Smell further bolster its perceptive capabilities, making it adept at locating potential food sources from afar. The Pack Tactics ability grants the Vulture an advantage on attack rolls against a foe if at least one ally is within 5 feet, which can significantly increase its chances of hitting a target.

In terms of actions, the Vulture can make a melee weapon attack with its beak. This attack has a +2 to hit and reaches 5 feet, dealing 2 piercing damage on a successful hit, which is minimal and not very threatening. As a reaction, the Vulture can use Defensive Bile, which activates when it is hit by a melee attack while within 5 feet. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the end of its next turn, providing a tricky countermeasure for foes in close combat. This ability gives the Vulture a way to defend itself effectively despite its low overall combat capability.</detail>
