<summary>The Hverhuldra is a small fey creature that embodies a neutral good alignment, known for its enchanting presence and magical abilities. It possesses a bountiful amount of hit points, making it resilient in battles, and it is capable of both swimming and walking at a moderate speed. With a challenge rating of 6, the Hverhuldra presents a suitable challenge for parties of adventurers. Its strengths lie in its damage immunities to fire and poison, resistance to cold damage, and a range of abilities that allow it to manipulate water and protect allies. Weaknesses include vulnerability to cold damage, as its protective traits diminish when affected by it. Notably, the Hverhuldra can execute powerful spells and changes the battlefield with its abilities, making it an intriguing opponent or ally.</summary>

<detail>

The Hverhuldra has the following attributes: Strength at 13, which provides a minor advantage with a modifier of +1, Dexterity at 16 with a good modifier of +3, Constitution at 18 granting a very good modifier of +4, Intelligence at 11 for an average modifier of +0, Wisdom at 15 with a good modifier of +2, and Charisma at 18, giving it an exceptional modifier of +4. Its saving throws highlight its strong Dexterity and Charisma, with values of +6 and +7, respectively, indicating a good ability to avoid effects and influence situations.

In terms of skills, the Hverhuldra excels in athletics with a +4 modifier, intimidation with a +7 modifier, nature with a +3 modifier, and survival with a +5 modifier. The creature is immune to poison effects, resistant to cold damage, and cannot be poisoned, while it possesses darkvision to perceive its surroundings even in low-light conditions.

The Hverhuldra's special abilities include Amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water, and Purify Water, which enables the creature to cleanse water it inhabits of any poison or disease after spending sufficient time in it. Its Quick Rescue ability allows it to grant any willing creature nearby the power to breathe underwater for a brief period, enhancing versatility in aquatic environments. When submerged, the Hverhuldra enjoys advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and gains resistance against certain physical damage types, although it becomes vulnerable to damage from cold. Its innate spellcasting potential enables it to cast a variety of spells without any material components, including Create or Destroy Water, Detect Poison and Disease, and Purify Food and Drink at will. Once per day, it can cast Blindness/Deafness and Protection from Poison.

In combat, the Hverhuldra employs a Multiattack action allowing it to make two Steaming Fist attacks, which feature a +6 to hit modifier, a reach of 5 feet, and deal substantial damage. Each hit inflicts 12 bludgeoning damage as well as an additional 7 fire damage, making its direct melee attacks formidable. It can also utilize its Scalding Stream attack, a powerful ranged ability that deals 21 fire damage and can blind targets if they fail a Dexterity saving throw. Finally, the Hverhuldra has a reaction ability called Steam Cloud; when it receives cold damage, it can create a cloud resembling the fog cloud spell, which can obscure vision and assist in tactical maneuvers, thus providing it with advantageous positioning during encounters.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The hverhuldra can breathe air and water.
- **Purify Water:** If the hverhuldra sits in a body of slow-flowing or standing water, such as a hot spring or a small creek, for at least 1 hour, the water becomes purified and rendered free of poison and disease. In slow-flowing water, this purification fades 1 hour after the hverhuldra leaves the water. In standing water, this purification lasts until a contaminant enters the water while the hverhuldra isn’t in it.
- **Quick Rescue:** As a bonus action, the hverhuldra gives one willing creature within 60 feet of it the ability to breathe water for 1 minute.
- **Water Protection:** While the hverhuldra submerged in water, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. If it takes cold damage, this trait doesn’t function until the end of its next turn.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The hverhuldra’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
At will: create or destroy water, detect poison and disease, purify food and drink
1/day each: blindness/deafness, protection from poison

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hverhuldra makes two steaming fist attacks.
- **Steaming Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Scalding Stream (Recharge 5-6):** The hverhuldra spits scalding water in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 21 (6d6) fire damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. A blinded creature can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

- **Steam Cloud:** When the hverhuldra takes cold damage, it uses the steam from the impact of the cold on its body to magically create a cloud of steam centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it. This cloud works like the fog cloud spell, except the hverhuldra can dismiss it as a bonus action.
