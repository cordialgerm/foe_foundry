<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Coven Night Hag boasts a strong Strength score of 18, giving it a modifier of +4, allowing it to be effective in melee combat. Its Dexterity of 14 provides a +2 modifier that contributes to its ability to avoid attacks and maintain stealth. The Constitution of 16 grants a +3 modifier, resulting in good resilience and hit points. The Intelligence and Charisma scores both sit at 16, reflecting a +3 modifier which underlines its effectiveness in spellcasting and social interactions. Wisdom is slightly lower at 14, providing a +2 modifier that aids in perception and insight checks, though the hag's overall wisdom can still be deemed as average.

The Coven Night Hag has saving throw advantages with a +6 modifier for Constitution and a +5 for Wisdom, which are considered to be good, allowing it to resist many effects that would incapacitate or harm it. It possesses skills that include a +6 bonus to arcana and deception, and +5 to insight, perception, and stealth, showcasing its proficiency in magical knowledge and manipulation. The hag has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 15, making it adept at detecting hidden threats in dim light or darkness.

The Coven Night Hag's special abilities define its haunting nature. The "Curse" ability can inflict a target with a magical curse upon being touched by the hag's claws, resulting in disadvantage on attack rolls against her for 30 days. Additionally, it radiates an Evil aura, marking its inherently malevolent presence. Its "Magic Resistance" provides an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it particularly resilient to magical threats.

For actions, the Night Hag can use "Claws," making a melee weapon attack with a +5 modifier to hit, dealing an average of 12 slashing damage on a hit while also afflicting the target with its Curse trait. The "Sleep Touch" ability is a melee spell attack dealing the effect of inducing sleep on a target for up to 4 hours; however, it cannot use this ability again until it finishes a long rest after a successful hit. The "Shapeshift" action allows the hag to transform into a Small or Medium humanoid form, retaining its claws across all forms, while it has no true physical identity and remains in its current form upon death. 

The "Planar Travel" ability permits the hag to shift between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane, or even to travel to realms like Hell or the Abyss, facilitating strategic repositioning. The "Nightmare Haunting" ability allows the Night Hag to torment a sleeping creature under its curse on the Ethereal Plane, reducing their hit point maximum if the nightmares persist, leading to devastating consequences if the targetâ€™s maximum reaches zero.

As a bonus action, the Night Hag can utilize "Fragmentary Dream," where it conjures a terrifying illusion for a specific creature. This requires the target to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, causing psychic damage on a failure and instilling fear until the end of the creature's next turn. 

Additionally, once per day, the "Steal Magic" reaction provides a tactical option against spellcasters, allowing the hag to attempt to absorb the power of spells being cast within her view, impeding the enemy's spellcasting while granting herself temporary hit points.

Overall, the Coven Night Hag serves as a diabolical and strategic opponent, capable of inducing chaos and fear on the battlefield while maintaining a strong self-preservation ability through her arcane skills and resilience.</detail>
