<summary>The Trollking Grunt is a Medium-sized humanoid creature that operates under a neutral alignment. This monster stands out with its robust physical capabilities and notable regenerative abilities, making it a formidable opponent in battle. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers, primarily relying on its high strength and constitution to deal and endure damage effectively. The Trollking Grunt has a good level of armor class and hit points, making it relatively resilient, but it is somewhat limited in intelligence and charisma. It possesses useful combat abilities and an exceptional regeneration trait, allowing it to stay in the fight longer unless faced with fire or acid damage, which temporarily suppresses its regenerative capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Trollking Grunt has an armor class of 14, which is considered good, indicating that it can avoid many attacks in combat. It has a total of 45 hit points, derived from rolling six eight-sided dice plus an additional 18; this value represents an average health pool that allows it to sustain damage during encounters. The creature has a walking speed of 30 feet, which is standard for humanoids.

The creature's ability scores include a strength of 18, granting it a +4 modifier, which is exceptionally effective for dealing damage in melee combat. Its dexterity score of 13 gives it a +1 modifier, enabling average performance in ranged attacks. The constitution score of 16 grants a +3 modifier, which contributes to its resilience and ability to withstand damage. The intelligence is low at 9, resulting in a -1 modifier, which is considered bad; this indicates limited capability in intelligence-based skills. With wisdom at 11, it has an average modifier of +0, and charisma also scores at 10, which reflects its average presence in social interactions.

The Trollking Grunt has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark conditions, with passive perception at a score of 10, indicating it is neither particularly aware nor oblivious to its surroundings. It can communicate in Common and the Trollkin language.

Among its special abilities, the most notable is its Regeneration. This ability allows the Trollking Grunt to regain 3 hit points at the start of its turn, which can greatly increase its chances of surviving battle. However, if it takes acid or fire damage, it will not regenerate on its next turn; this vulnerability to specific elements can be leveraged by clever adventurers. Its Thick Hide provides an additional +1 bonus to its armor class, which is already included in the overall AC calculation.

In terms of actions, the Trollking Grunt can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two separate attacks using either a spear or a longbow. The melee attack with the spear has a +6 to hit and deals 7 piercing damage with a regular attack or can deal 8 piercing damage if wielded with two hands. When attacking at range with the longbow, it has a +3 to hit and can inflict 5 piercing damage on a successful hit.

Overall, the Trollking Grunt is an agile and robust combatant that can pose a serious threat in encounters, particularly if left unchecked due to its regenerative abilities. Players must consider tactical approaches, especially using fire or acid to limit its capabilities.</detail>
