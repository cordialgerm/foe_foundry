<detail>

The Wharfling has the following attributes: 
- Strength (STR) is 4, resulting in a very bad modifier of -3.
- Dexterity (DEX) is 14, yielding a good modifier of +2, which enhances its ability to evade attacks and perform agile maneuvers.
- Constitution (CON) is 10, providing no modifier.
- Intelligence (INT) is very low at 2, giving a poor modifier of -4, indicating limited cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom (WIS) stands at 12, yielding an average modifier of +1, reflecting decent perception and insight into surroundings.
- Charisma (CHA) is also low at 8, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, signifying limited social influence.

In terms of skills, the Wharfling is particularly adept at Perception, with a +3 modifier that allows it to notice hidden threats and opportunities effectively, making it a minor surveillance expert. It also has a sleight of hand skill with a good +4 modifier, enhancing its ability to stealthily steal items from others. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and it has a passive Perception score of 13, indicative of its heightened awareness.

One special ability of the Wharfling is Amphibious, which allows it to breathe both air and water, giving it an edge in aquatic environments as well as on land.

As for its actions, the Wharfling can utilize its Pilfering Bite in combat. This is a melee weapon attack that has a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. When it successfully hits a target, it deals 4 piercing damage on a roll of 1d4 + 2; however, instead of dealing damage, the Wharfling can opt to steal one item that the target is wearing or carrying, provided the item meets specific criteria: it must weigh no more than 10 pounds, cannot be a weapon, and cannot be firmly attached to the target, such as clothing or armor. This ability makes the Wharfling a clever little thief in combat, presenting unique tactical options for both players and Dungeon Masters.</detail>
