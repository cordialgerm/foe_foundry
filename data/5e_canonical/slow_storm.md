<summary>The Slow Storm is a medium-sized elemental creature characterized by its chaotic nature and formidable power, often serving as a chaotic force of nature in battle. It possesses a high Armor Class of 19, significantly increasing its durability in combat, and boasts a substantial pool of 220 hit points. With exceptional Strength and Constitution scores, it can deal and withstand considerable damage, while its impressive Dexterity enhances its ability to dodge attacks. The Slow Storm's unique abilities, such as an area-effect wind storm and powerful lightning attacks, make it a challenging adversary for adventurers. However, it is vulnerable to magical attacks that bypass its resistance to nonmagical damage, and its reliance on direct confrontation can expose it to clever ranged tactics.</summary>

<detail>

The Slow Storm's Strength score is 20, granting a +5 modifier, which is very good for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is 19, giving it a +4 modifier, good for agility and reflex saving throws. With a Constitution of 22 (+6), it is exceptionally tough, allowing it to absorb damage well. Intelligence is average at 11 (+0), while Wisdom is 18 (+4), also very good, enhancing its perception and saving throws against effects that rely on perception. The Charisma score of 11 (+0) is average, indicating a lack of social prowess.

The creature's saving throws are Dexterity at +9, which is good, and Constitution at +11, reflecting its exceptional durability. It has immunity to lightning damage, resistance to acid, cold, and fire, as well as to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. The condition immunities include exhaustion, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious, making it difficult to control in combat. The Slow Storm has blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision out to 120 feet, with a passive Perception of 14, allowing it to see in darkness and sense its surroundings without relying on sight. It understands Auran and Common languages.

One of the Slow Storm's special abilities, Elemental Nature, means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, setting it apart from most creatures. Its Eye of the Storm ability features a 15-foot radius wind storm that imposes disadvantages on ranged attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks based on sight or hearing. The winds can extinguish flames and create difficult terrain for all except the Slow Storm. Creatures that start their turn in the storm must pass a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) lightning damage, showcasing its dangerous area control.

In terms of actions, the Slow Storm can perform a Multiattack, which consists of either three Slam attacks or four Lightning Bolt attacks. When it makes two Slam attacks against a single target, that target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or suffer wracking pain that deals 4 (1d8) lightning damage every 5 feet it moves for a minute. The Slam itself is a melee weapon attack that hits at +10, dealing 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage along with 9 (2d8) lightning damage. Alternatively, it can make a ranged Lightning Bolt attack, rolling at +9 to hit within a range of 120 feet, dealing 22 (4d8 + 4) lightning damage.

Finally, the Slow Storm has a special ability called Static Shock, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability unleashes built-up electricity in a 60-foot cone, requiring creatures in the area to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 54 (12d8) lightning damage, or half damage on a success. Furthermore, any creature failing by 5 or more becomes stunned for 1 minute, giving the Slow Storm a significant tactical advantage in combat. A stunned creature can attempt to end the effect at the end of its turns.</detail>

Each creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) lightning damage. The storm’s area is difficult terrain for any creature other than the slow storm.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The slow storm makes three Slam attacks or four Lightning Bolt attacks. If two Slam attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be wracked with pain for 1 minute. While the target is wracked with pain, minute bits of electricity dance within its body, and the target takes 4 (1d8) lightning damage for every 5 feet it moves.

- **Static Shock (Recharge 5–6):** The slow storm releases built-up electricity in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is also stunned for 1 minute. A stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
