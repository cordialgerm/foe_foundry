<summary>A Satyr is a fey creature with the upper body of a man and the lower body of a goat, complete with horns and hooves. Satyrs are known for their playful, hedonistic nature, often indulging in wine, music, and mischief. They are curious and love to cause harmless trouble for travelers, leading them astray with enchanting pipes or confusing them with illusions. Satyrs are highly charismatic and often use their charm to avoid conflict. However, when threatened, they are quick and nimble fighters, using their horns to ram enemies or fleeing into the safety of the forest.</summary>
