If the target can hear this uplifting melody, it gains an Embolden die, which is a six-sided die, to use within the next 10 minutes. The target can roll this die and add the result to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes during that time, significantly boosting its chances of success in critical moments.</detail>
