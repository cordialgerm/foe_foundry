<summary>The Giant Shark is an enormous predator of the deep, feared for its immense size and insatiable hunger. With razor-sharp teeth and powerful jaws, a Giant Shark can tear apart almost anything it encounters, from ships to sea creatures. These sharks are found in deep ocean waters, where they patrol for prey, but they have been known to come close to the surface or attack vessels. In combat, a Giant Shark relies on its brute strength and powerful bite, and it can smell blood from miles away, making it relentless in its pursuit of wounded prey.</summary>

<summary>The Giant Shark is a formidable beast in the aquatic realms, known for its size and power as a predator. This creature plays the role of a relentless hunter in underwater environments, threatening adventurers and sea creatures alike with its fierce attacks and agile movements. With an Armor Class of 13, it is reasonably resilient, supported by a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 105. The Giant Shark boasts exceptional physical attributes, particularly a Strength of 20, which allows it to deal significant damage. However, its Dexterity is average, which might limit its agility compared to its other traits. Its reliance on water for survival, combined with limited intelligence and charisma, makes it a straightforward predator rather than a cunning adversary.</summary>

<detail>

The Giant Shark has a Strength score of 20, granting it a +5 modifier, which is exceptional for physical attacks and grappling. It has a stable Constitution of 18 (+4), contributing to its good durability in combat. However, its Intelligence (2) and Charisma (4) are very low, denoting that it is not capable of complex thought or social interaction. The Dexterity of 10 (+0) means it has average reflexes and doesn’t benefit from any additional bonuses to its Initiative rolls or dexterous maneuvers.

In terms of skills, the Giant Shark has a +3 modifier for Perception, making it good at noticing threats and prey within its vicinity. With blindsight extending 60 feet, it can detect objects and creatures even without light, making it a lethal ambush predator in murky waters. Its passive Perception score of 13 further helps it stay aware of its surroundings.

The Giant Shark has the unique special ability of Water Breathing, allowing it to thrive in aquatic environments as it can only breathe underwater. This ability underlines its elemental nature and aquatic dominance, making it a challenging foe for those adventuring in or near water.

In combat, the Giant Shark utilizes its primary action, the Bite, which is a melee weapon attack. It has a +8 to hit and can reach targets within 5 feet. On a successful strike, it deals 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage. Remarkably, if it hits a target, the Giant Shark can follow up with a bonus action, allowing it to make a second bite attack, enhancing its damage output significantly during a turn.

Another potent option in its arsenal is the Tail attack, which also has a +8 to hit and offers a reach of 10 feet. This attack inflicts 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. Importantly, after making a successful Tail attack, the Giant Shark can swim 20 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, allowing it to reposition itself effectively during a fight.

Overall, the Giant Shark presents a significant threat in its domain, leveraging its physical might and aquatic adaptations to overpower its enemies. Adventurers venturing into its waters should be well-prepared for a fierce encounter.</detail>
