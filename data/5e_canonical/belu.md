<CreatureType/>Giant</CreatureType>

<summary>Belu is a Huge Giant of chaotic good alignment, embodying both strength and versatility. With a robust armor class of 16 due to its natural armor and a significant pool of hit points totaling 184, Belu excels in tanking damage while providing support through its unique abilities and spells. Its challenge rating of 10 indicates that it can present a formidable challenge to a group of adventurers, granting experience points of 5,900 upon defeat. Despite its power, Belu holds a deeply benevolent nature, using its abilities not only for combat but for healing and assisting fellow creatures. Notably, it can change its shape into a Small or Medium humanoid, enhancing its adaptability in different scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

Belu possesses the following attributes: Strength 22 (+6, exceptional modifier), Dexterity 12 (+1, average modifier), Constitution 20 (+5, very good modifier), Intelligence 12 (+1, average modifier), Wisdom 10 (+0, average modifier), and Charisma 18 (+4, good modifier). For saving throws, it shows proficiency in Dexterity (+5) and Constitution (+9), making it resilient against certain effects. It has skills in perception (+0), but lacks notable proficiency in sensing its surroundings. It is resistant to poison damage and immune to being poisoned. Belu can see in the dark up to 60 feet and speaks both Common and Giant.

Belu's special abilities include "Healing Lotuscraft," which can be used once per day. This ability allows Belu to spend one minute crafting a poultice. The poultice lasts for 24 hours and can be applied by any creature to heal another for 18 hit points (using the roll of 4d8), as well as curing any diseases or conditions affecting the target.

In terms of combat actions, Belu can execute a multiattack, which allows it to make three Slam attacks. Each Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +10 to hit, targeting a range of 10 feet. On a hit, it deals 20 bludgeoning damage (rolling 4d6+6) and forces the target to make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or get pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.

Belu can also use "Shatterstone," a powerful ranged attack that can be used after it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability enables Belu to hurl an enchanted rock at a point of its choosing within 60 feet, which upon impact shatters and deals 44 slashing damage (8d10) to any creature within a 10-foot radius, allowing a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16) for half damage.

As a spellcaster, Belu has a Charisma saving throw difficulty class of 14 and requires no material components for its spells. At will, Belu can use spells such as "Entangle," which restrains foes in an area; "Speak with Plants," allowing it to communicate with plant life; and "Stone Shape," which enables it to reshape stone and earth. It can cast "Plant Growth" two times a day, enhancing the growth of plants in an area for various effects.

Finally, as a bonus action, Belu has the ability to "Change Shape." This ability allows it to magically transform into a Small or Medium humanoid or revert to its true form. Its statistics, except for size, remain unchanged in either form. Any equipment worn or carried transforms with it, and upon death, it automatically returns to its true form.</detail>
