<summary>The Adult Sapphire Dragon is an imposing and formidable creature in the world of Dungeons & Dragons. As a Huge dragon with a Challenge Rating of 19, it poses significant threats to adventurers with its high armor class, formidable hit points, and diverse abilities. With exceptional strength, dexterity, intelligence, and wisdom, this dragon excels in both physical combat and mental prowess, making it a versatile foe. It is particularly deadly due to its psionic abilities, allowing it to manipulate reality and attack the minds of its enemies. While it is immune to psychic damage and can avoid fatigue, its reliance on mental attacks might be countered by opponents who can resist psychic influence. </summary>

<detail>

The Adult Sapphire Dragon has the following attributes: Strength 22 (+6), Dexterity 22 (+6), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 22 (+6), Wisdom 20 (+5), and Charisma 16 (+3). These attributes contribute to its combat effectiveness, with a good hit chance and damage output. Its armor class of 19 is quite good, providing it with solid protection. With 304 hit points, drawn from 29d12+116, it has a high survivability rate in battle, making it a tough opponent to defeat. The dragon’s saving throws are notably strong, receiving +10 for Constitution, +12 for Intelligence, +11 for Wisdom, and +10 for Charisma. Its skills are also impressive, particularly in arcana and history at +12 and insight and perception at +11, which reflects its keen intellect and awareness.

One of its notable special abilities is Legendary Resistance, which allows it to choose to succeed on failed saving throws three times a day. When it uses this ability, it loses access to other predictive abilities until the end of its next turn. The Predictive Harmonics trait enables the dragon to be aware of its immediate future, making it impossible to surprise and allowing it to roll normally instead of at disadvantage when required. Additionally, its Psionic Powers are considered both magical and psionic.

Another of its striking powers is Far Thoughts; the dragon can sense any creature using psionics or communicating telepathically within a vast radius of 100 miles, allowing it to psionically observe subjects indefinitely. This can potentially provide strategic advantages during encounters, as it gains deep insights into enemy movements and actions. 

The dragon’s spellcasting ability employs Charisma with a spell save DC of 18. It can cast spells like comprehend languages, detect thoughts, telekinesis, and wall of force up to three times each day without the need for material components, giving it broad utility and control over battlefield dynamics.

For its actions, the Adult Sapphire Dragon can perform a multiattack, striking once with its bite and twice with its claws, or it can substitute its bite with the Psionic Wave attack, which unleashes a wave of psychic damage in an area. Specifically, its Bite attack can hit with a +12 modifier dealing 22 piercing damage and an additional 4 psychic damage. Meanwhile, the Claw attacks also hit at a +12 modifier, dealing 19 slashing damage.

Regarding its Psionic Wave move, it targets creatures within a 20-foot radius, dealing psychic damage based on a Wisdom saving throw. If failed, a creature takes 16 psychic damage; if they succeed, they take half damage. The dragon’s Discognitive Breath, a powerful attack that recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, affects all creatures in a 60-foot cone, dealing significant psychic damage with ongoing effects if failed saving throws occur.

In terms of its legendary actions, the Adult Sapphire Dragon can utilize three legendary actions per turn, but only one at a time. It can use Foretell to manipulate the outcome of a roll, allowing it to predetermine a roll result for one of its own or another creature's rolls within 120 feet. The Psionic Wave and Shatter Mind actions incorporate additional strategic advantages by dealing psychic damage or ongoing effects, further cementing the dragon's role as a powerful psionic entity in combat.</detail>

- **Far Thoughts:** The dragon is aware of any creature that uses a psionic ability or communicates telepathically within 100 miles of it. As an action, the dragon can psionically observe a creature, object, or location it is familiar with within 100 miles. While observing a subject in this way, the dragon can see, hear, and communicate telepathically, but it is blind and deaf in regard to its physical senses and does not require food or water. The dragon can psionically observe a subject indefinitely and can end this effect and return to its own senses as an action.

- **Psionic Wave:** The dragon psionically emits a wave of crushing mental pressure.

Creatures suffering ongoing psychic damage make this saving throw with disadvantage.
- **Discognitive Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon unleashes psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw  taking 60 (11d10) psychic damage and 11 (2d10) ongoing psychic damage on a failed save or half as much psychic damage and no ongoing psychic damage on a success. The ongoing damage ends if a creature falls unconscious. A creature can also use an action to ground itself in reality  ending the ongoing damage.
- **Prognosticate (3/Day):** The dragon psionically makes a prediction of an event up to 100 years in the future. This prediction has a 67 percent chance of being perfectly accurate and a 33 percent chance of being partially or wholly wrong. Alternatively  the dragon can choose to gain truesight to a range of 90 feet for 1 minute.
