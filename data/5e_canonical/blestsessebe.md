<summary>The Blestsessebe is a large celestial creature known for its neutrality and goodness. It serves as a guardian or protector in various narratives, utilizing its strengths in agility and magic resistance to fend off threats. With a robust hit point pool and solid armor class, it can endure combat effectively. The Blestsessebe's powers shine in its mobility and ability to disrupt enemy actions, along with its advantage against magical effects. However, its average intelligence may limit its tactical versatility in complex encounters.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Blestsessebe has a Strength score of 21, allowing it to deliver powerful physical attacks with an exceptional modifier of +5. Its Dexterity score of 18 grants it good agility, reflected in its +4 modifier, enhancing its ability to avoid attacks due to its movement abilities. The Constitution score of 16 results in a good +3 modifier, contributing to its health pool of 144 hit points, which are derived from rolling 17d10 plus 51. Intelligence is average at 11, providing a +0 modifier that indicates limited problem-solving capabilities. The creature has a Wisdom score of 17 and a Charisma score of 18, both giving it solid bonuses of +3 and +4, respectively. These scores enhance its saving throws in Wisdom and Charisma, which are +6 and +7, making it resilient against effects targeting these stats.

The Blestsessebe has several notable special abilities. **Blur of Motion** grants it a significant advantage in evading ranged attacks; when it moves at least 30 feet during its turn, ranged attack rolls against it have disadvantage until the start of its next turn. **Freedom of Movement** allows it to navigate through difficult terrain seamlessly and escape from nonmagical restraints with a small movement cost. **Magic Resistance** offers it an exceptional advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, greatly improving its survivability against magical attacks. **Trampling Charge** enables it to make a powerful attack by charging straight at a creature, allowing it to knock its target prone and capitalize on that advantage with a bonus action hooves attack if successful.

For its actions, the Blestsessebe utilizes **Multiattack**, making one Gore attack and two Hooves attacks in the same turn. The **Gore** attack is quite formidable, with a +8 to hit, dealing 18 piercing damage plus 13 radiant damage, showcasing its celestial nature. The **Hooves** attack also has a +8 to hit and deals 12 bludgeoning damage, effectively allowing the Blestsessebe to deal significant damage in melee combat. Additionally, the **Distracting Glow** special attack can incapacitate multiple enemies; when activated (recharging on a 6), it requires a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to avoid entrancement, leaving affected creatures at a disadvantage against anything other than the Blestsessebe until the start of its next turn. The **Hastening Stomp** serves a supportive role (recharging on a 5-6), enhancing the speed of all friendly creatures within 60 feet for one minute, allowing them to take advantage of added mobility during combat via a bonus action called **Free Runner**, which lets them Dash without using their regular action.

Overall, the Blestsessebe epitomizes a powerful celestial guardian, capable of both dealing considerable damage and supporting allies effectively while resisting various forms of magical attack.</detail>
