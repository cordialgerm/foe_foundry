<summary>The Corpse Mound is a fearsome creature, classified as a Huge Undead with a neutral evil alignment. It serves as a potent adversary in combat, leveraging its high hit points and formidable attacks to overwhelm its foes. With an Armor Class of 16, derived from its natural armor, it possesses durability that allows it to withstand significant damage. The Corpse Mound has remarkable strength, with a Strength score of 24, which gives it a good +7 modifier, allowing it to inflict substantial melee damage. Its Constitution score is also high at 21, resulting in a good +5 modifier that enhances its vitality and saving throws against various effects. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are much lower, marking it as average or bad in terms of mental capabilities, which hinders its strategic options in combat and negotiations. The creature is resistant to necrotic damage, immune to poison damage, and does not suffer from conditions like charm or fear. Its abilities allow it to reclaim health by absorbing fallen creatures, project a noxious aura, and create zombies from corpses nearby.</summary>

<detail>

The Corpse Mound has a hit point total of 207, which translates into a robust endurance during combat, allowing it to absorb damage before falling. Its movement speed of 30 feet is standard for a creature of its size but allows for effective positioning in battle. The challenge rating of 11 signifies that it is a significant threat within mid-tier adventuring parties.

The saving throws of the Corpse Mound are good, with a Constitution save of +9, an Intelligence save of +2, and a Wisdom save of +4. This makes it adept at surviving attempts to debilitate it through poison or mental attacks.

The Corpse Mound possesses several special abilities:
- **Absorb the Dead:** This ability allows the Corpse Mound to regain hit points equal to twice the challenge rating or level of any Large or smaller creature that dies within 10 feet of it. This makes killing creatures near it perilous, as their bodies will bolster the Corpse Mound's health and prevent resurrection attempts unless the mound is bypassed.
- **Noxious Aura:** At the end of its turn, the Corpse Mound releases a toxic aura. Each creature within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for their next turn. Successful saving throws grant immunity to this effect for the following 24 hours.
- **Undead Nature:** This ability renders the mound immune to the need for sustenance, air, and sleep, allowing it to maintain its relentless pursuit of prey.
- **Zombie Drop:** The mound can create a zombie from a corpse it controls at the beginning of its turn, summoning up to ten zombies to fight on its behalf, creating a swarm of additional threats in combat.

The Corpse Mound can attack using the following actions:
- **Multiattack:** It can make two Slam or Bone Shard attacks in a single turn, increasing its total damage output.
- **Slam:** This melee attack has a +11 to hit and can deal 18 bludgeoning damage as well as 10 necrotic damage on a successful hit, alongside grappling the target with an escape DC of 17, which restrains the victim until they can escape.
- **Bone Shard:** This ranged attack also has a +11 to hit, dealing 14 piercing damage plus 10 necrotic damage. If the target fails a DC 17 Strength saving throw, it is knocked prone and restrained.
- **Envelop:** This action allows the Corpse Mound to envelop a creature that is already restrained or grappled, rendering the target blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe. It also takes continuous damage unless it escapes, limiting the options of the creature and potentially incapacitating it if the mound chooses to hold onto it during movement.

Overall, the Corpse Mound presents a powerful and tactical challenge that can shift the momentum of battle using its unique abilities and resilience. It thrives in environments with ample bodies to absorb, and adventurers must approach it with both caution and strategy to counter its fearsome capabilities.</detail>

The absorbed creature can’t be returned to life by any spell or effect that requires a body, unless the body is retrieved from the corpse mound.
- **Noxious Aura:** At the end of each of the corpse mound’s turns, each creature within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the mound’s Noxious Aura for 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.
- **Bone Shard:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and restrained as it is pinned to the ground by the shard. A creature, including the restrained target, can take its action to free the target by succeeding on a DC 17 Strength check.
- **Envelop:** The corpse mound envelops a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of it that is restrained by its Bone Shard or a Large or smaller creature grappled by it. The enveloped target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw at the start of each of the mound’s turns or take 18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the enveloped target moves with it. The mound can have no more than four creatures enveloped at a time.
