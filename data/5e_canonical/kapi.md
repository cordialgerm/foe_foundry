<summary>The Kapi is a medium humanoid creature aligned with chaotic good tendencies, making it a nimble and agile character on the battlefield. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it offers 100 experience points when defeated. This creature is characterized by its impressive Dexterity, which is valued at 18 with a modifier of +4, allowing it to excel in acrobatic maneuvers and stealth. The Kapi's ability to climb and traverse both vertically and horizontally at a speed of 30 feet each gives it considerable mobility advantages in various terrains. However, it has relatively low hit points, totaling only 13, making it vulnerable if caught in prolonged combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Kapi's primary attributes are as follows: Strength is at 14 with a +2 modifier, which is considered good; Dexterity is exceptional at +4; Constitution is average at a +0 modifier; Intelligence is also average with a +0 modifier; Wisdom is good at +1; and Charisma is below average at -1. This mix of attributes means the Kapi is formidable in physical confrontations, particularly with its high Dexterity for attack rolls and evasiveness, but less effective in social interactions and casting spells due to its low Charisma.

In terms of skills, the Kapi possesses a +6 modifier in both Acrobatics and Stealth, indicating very good competence in moving gracefully and avoiding detection. It has darkvision that allows it to see in dim light up to 60 feet and has a passive Perception score of 11, which is considered average. The Kapi can speak Common and Simian, providing it with basic communication tools.

The Kapi has several notable special abilities. Its "Nimble Feet" ability enables it to take the Disengage action as a bonus action on each of its turns, allowing it to escape from close combat without incurring attacks of opportunity, making its mobility even more pronounced. The "Prehensile Tail" allows the Kapi to grasp small objects with its tail, freeing its hands for other tasks like wielding weapons or carrying larger items. Although it cannot use its tail to wield a weapon, it can instead use this tail to trip opponents.

When attacking, the Kapi can make a multiattack, allowing it to strike twice during its turn. The first attack is with its quarterstaff, which has a +4 to hit and reaches up to 5 feet. A successful hit delivers either 5 bludgeoning damage with one hand or 6 bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands. The second attack is the "Tail Trip," which has a +6 to hit. If it connects, the target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in being knocked prone. Lastly, the Kapi can also attack at range using a sling, also with a +6 to hit. This ranged attack has a reach of 30 feet normally and 120 feet at disadvantage, dealing 6 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

Overall, the Kapi's skills and abilities emphasize maneuverability and tactical play, allowing it to engage effectively in both melee and ranged combat while maintaining the ability to reposition itself rapidly.</detail>
