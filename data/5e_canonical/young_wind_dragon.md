<detail>

The Young Wind Dragon has the following attributes: Strength at 20 (+5, exceptional), Dexterity at 16 (+3, good), Constitution at 18 (+4, very good), Intelligence at 14 (+2, average), Wisdom at 13 (+1, average), and Charisma at 16 (+3, good). Its saving throws reflect its robust constitution and dexterity, with bonuses of +6 in Dexterity, +7 in Constitution, +4 in Wisdom, and +6 in Charisma, indicating good resilience against various effects. Among its skills, it excels in Acrobatics (+9, exceptional), Intimidation (+6, good), Perception (+7, very good), and Stealth (+6, good). The dragon has blindsight out to 30 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive perception of 17, giving it excellent sensory capabilities in various environments. It can communicate in Common, Draconic, and Primordial, allowing it to interact with multiple beings effectively.

The Young Wind Dragon possesses two notable special abilities: Elusive and Storm Sight. Elusive grants the dragon advantage on all ability checks and saving throws made to avoid or escape effects that would reduce its speed, grapple, or restrain it, making it a very difficult target to control. Storm Sight allows the dragon to perceive its surroundings through fog, mist, clouds, or precipitation, ensuring it remains aware of threats even in obscured conditions.

In combat, the Young Wind Dragon takes multiple actions due to its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make one Bite and two Claw attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack has a +8 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage on a hit. Its Claw attack, also with a +8 to hit but a shorter reach of 5 feet, inflicts 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage per hit. The dragon's most impactful ability is Tempest Breath, which requires a 5-6 recharge. This powerful breath attack exhales a blast of stormy wind across a 30-foot cone, forcing all creatures within that area to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage, is pushed 15 feet away from the dragon, and is knocked prone, while successful save results in taking half damage without any additional effects. The breath weapon can also extinguish unprotected flames in the area, adding strategic control to the dragon's combat style.</detail>
