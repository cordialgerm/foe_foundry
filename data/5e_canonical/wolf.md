<summary>A Wolf is a medium-sized predator found in forests, mountains, and tundras. Known for their pack mentality, wolves are skilled hunters that rely on teamwork to take down larger prey. Wolves are swift and agile, using their sharp teeth and claws to tear into their victims. While they prefer to avoid humans, they will defend their territory or hunt when food is scarce. Wolves are intelligent and highly social animals, communicating through howls and other vocalizations. In the wild, they are apex predators, respected and feared by all creatures within their range.</summary>
