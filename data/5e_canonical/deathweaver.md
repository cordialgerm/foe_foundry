Overall, the Deathweaver excels in ambush tactics and can alter the battlefield in its favor by creating webbed zones that hinder players.</summary>

<detail>

The Deathweaver has an Armor Class of 16, which is considered good; this, combined with its Hit Points of 95, provides it with a strong level of durability in combat. Its speed is 40 feet for walking and 40 feet for climbing, allowing it to maneuver effectively both on the ground and on vertical surfaces. The creature's Strength is 16 (+3), indicating it has good physical power, while its Dexterity of 14 (+2) provides it with average agility. The Constitution score of 17 (+3) translates to very good stamina, supporting its resilience in prolonged battles. Its Intelligence is low at 7 (-2), which is very bad in terms of mental capacity. However, its Wisdom of 12 (+1) is average, and its Charisma of 15 (+2) grants it good spellcasting prowess.

In terms of skills, the Deathweaver has a perception modifier of +4, which is very good, and a stealth modifier of +5, also very good, making it adept at ambush tactics and surprise attacks. It possesses damage resistance to necrotic damage and has blindsight that functions up to 20 feet, as well as darkvision that extends to 60 feet, enhancing its capabilities in low-light environments. It communicates using Deep Speech, relevant in interactions with other creatures that understand this language.

The Deathweaver's special abilities enhance its versatility and threat level. Spider Climb allows it to navigate complex surfaces without any movement penalties. Web Sense grants it the ability to know the precise location of any creature in contact with its webs, making it a dangerous foe in webbed areas. The Web Walker ability means the Deathweaver can traverse web obstacles without hindrance, contributing to its threat during combat situations.

The Deathweaver possesses innate spellcasting, related to its Charisma score. The spell save DC is 13, and it has a +5 modifier for spell attack rolls. At will, it can cast Chill Touch, which creates a ghostly skeletal hand that deals necrotic damage and prevents healing. The creature can cast Darkness three times per day, enveloping an area in magical darkness that hinders visibility, potentially disorienting opponents. Additionally, it can use Ray of Enfeeblement three times a day, resulting in reduced damage dealt by the target for a duration. Once per day, it can cast Vampiric Touch, a spell allowing it to siphon life from its enemies, healing itself for half the necrotic damage dealt.

In terms of actions during combat, the Deathweaver can execute a Multiattack, performing two bite attack actions. Each bite attack has a +6 to hit, demonstrating good accuracy, and reaches a distance of 5 feet, targeting a single creature. On a successful hit, the bite delivers 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. The target must also make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; failure results in an additional 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. If this necrotic damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the creature remains stable but becomes poisoned for one hour, paralyzed while poisoned, even if healed.

Additionally, the Deathweaver can launch a Web attack, which recharges on a roll of 5-6. This ranged attack requires a +5 to hit and has a range of 40 feet, allowing it to restrain a target in webbing, causing them to take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage at the start of their turns. A restrained creature can attempt a DC 14 Strength check to escape, and the webs can be destroyed with an AC of 10 and 5 hit points, having vulnerability to fire damage. Notably, a humanoid killed by the webbing rises as a web zombie under the Deathweaver's control within 24 hours, provided the body has not been restored to life. The creature is limited to controlling a maximum of twelve web zombies at once, creating potential for a large undead minion army in extended encounters.</detail>
