<summary>The Adult Sea Dragon is a formidable opponent known for its immense power and mastery of both land and sea. As a Huge dragon with a Neutral Evil alignment, it embodies a blend of lethal combat abilities and strategic cunning. With an impressive hit point total of 275, this creature boasts a high armor class of 19, allowing it to withstand substantial damage during encounters. The Sea Dragon's strength lies in its devastating multiattack capabilities and its special abilities, such as Tidal Breath and Frightful Presence, which can severely hinder foes while enabling it to unleash massive damage. However, despite its might, it has a lower Dexterity score and must carefully manage position to avoid being overwhelmed by speedier adversaries. Overall, the Adult Sea Dragon is a significant threat, particularly in aquatic environments, and commands respect on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Sea Dragon has the following attributes: Strength is 25, which translates to a very good modifier of +7, while Dexterity is average at 10 with a +0 modifier. Constitution is also high at 23, giving it a very good +6 modifier. Intelligence sits at a respectable 17 (+3), Wisdom at 15 (+2), and Charisma at 19 (+4), indicating its ability to manipulate and intimidate effectively. For saving throws, it excels in Constitution (+12), Wisdom (+8), and Charisma (+10), marking them as very good; it has an average Dexterity saving throw of +6.

Its skill set features Perception at +14 (exceptional) and Stealth at +6 (average), allowing it to perceive its surroundings acutely, while maintaining a decent stealth capability. The dragon enjoys damage immunity to cold, is capable of blindsight for 60 feet, and possesses darkvision up to 120 feet, with a commendable passive Perception of 24. It is fluent in Common, Draconic, and Primordial, allowing for communication with various creatures.

The Adult Sea Dragon's special abilities include Amphibious, allowing it to breathe in both air and water. It has Legendary Resistance, which gives it the unique ability to succeed on saving throws it would otherwise fail, three times per day, making it exceptionally hard to deal with. Its Siege Monster trait allows it to deal double damage to objects and structures, enhancing its threat level against fortifications.

In terms of actions, the Sea Dragon can execute a Multiattack, which includes its Frightful Presence followed by one Bite and two Fin attacks. The Bite attack has a +13 to hit and deals 18 piercing damage plus an additional 10 cold damage. Its Fin attacks also have a +13 to hit and deal 14 slashing damage each. The Tail attack, similarly having a +13 to hit, inflicts 16 bludgeoning damage. 

Frightful Presence targets creatures within 120 feet, compelling them to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or face being frightened for one minute. Those who succeed on the saving throw are immune to this effect for the next 24 hours, making it a tactical control mechanism during combat. Tidal Breath, which has a recharge requirement of 5-6, unleashes a wave of frigid seawater in a 60-foot cone, demanding a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw from affected creatures. Failing this results in 66 (or 33 on a success) bludgeoning and cold damage, along with being pushed 30 feet away and knocked prone, making it highly effective for area control.

Finally, the Adult Sea Dragon can also perform three legendary actions each round, picking options such as Detect (a Perception check), Tail Attack (a melee Tail attack), or Wing Attack (costs 2 actions) to affect creatures within a 10-foot radius. The Wing Attack requires a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, dealing 14 bludgeoning damage while potentially knocking creatures prone and allowing the dragon to reposition itself, further enhancing its combat abilities.</detail>
