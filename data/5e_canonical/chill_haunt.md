<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Chill Haunt is a medium-sized undead creature embodying a neutral evil alignment. It wields significant power through its unique abilities and damage immunities, making it a formidable foe in combat. The Chill Haunt excels in avoidance, primarily through its incorporeal movement, allowing it to bypass physical barriers, but it has weaknesses as it cannot withstand nonmagical attacks effectively. With a challenge rating of 3, it poses a significant threat, particularly due to its cold damage abilities and life-draining abilities that can hinder its opponents in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Chill Haunt possesses an armor class of 13, which represents a good level of defense for a creature of its challenge rating. Its hit points total 39, calculated from rolling six eight-sided dice and adding twelve, giving it a decent buffer before falling in combat. Despite its low strength score of 7, which is considered very bad and affects its ability to engage in physical attacks, its dexterity score of 16, which is good, enhances its agility and ability to evade attacks. The constitution score of 14 is above average, contributing to its overall resilience. Additionally, a wisdom score of 16 and a charisma score of 13 grant it good perception and presence, which can influence interactions.

The Chill Haunt is skilled in acrobatics with a modifier of +5, showcasing its agility in movement. It is immune to damage types including cold, fire, necrotic, and poison, while it has resistances to acid, lightning, thunder, and physical damage from nonmagical attacks, making it notably challenging to harm. The creature is also immune to various conditions such as charming and paralyzing effects, which enhances its survivability in combat. Its darkvision allows it to see 60 feet in darkness, and with a passive perception of 13, it is capable of noticing hidden or stealthy foes.

The special abilities of the Chill Haunt further define its combat style. Under its Cryophobia ability, when subjected to cold damage, the creature takes no damage but must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. A failure results in it being frightened of the damage source for one minute, which overrides its immunity to fright effects. This makes it unique among undead, as it can be temporarily reliant on its foes' actions. Through Fire Absorption, the Chill Haunt also heals for an amount equal to fire damage dealt to it, enabling it to sustain itself should it be attacked with fire-based attacks. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to move through creatures and objects seamlessly, although it incurs 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object, encouraging careful positioning.

In melee combat, it uses the Shivering Touch, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit at a 5-foot reach. On a successful hit, it deals 10 (2d6 + 3) cold damage and an additional 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. The target must then succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw; failure results in taking an additional 3 (1d6) cold damage at the start of each turn until they can repeat the saving throw to end the effect. This pressure can greatly reduce the target's hit points over time, especially with the possibility of ending the effect through fire damage, creating strategic elements for both the Chill Haunt and its opponents during an encounter.</detail>
