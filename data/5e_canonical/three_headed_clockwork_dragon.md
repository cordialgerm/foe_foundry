<summary>The Three-Headed Clockwork Dragon is a formidable construct, classified as a Huge size creature with a Challenge Rating of 14, which means it poses a significant threat to adventurers. It boasts an impressive Armor Class of 18, backed by 275 hit points, offering resilience in combat. This dragon is not just durable; it is also capable of flight, reaching speeds of 60 feet and walking at 40 feet. Its attributes highlight its strengths: a Strength score of 25 grants it a +12 bonus to Strength saving throws and the ability to excel in athletic contests, while a Constitution score of 23 gives it a +11 bonus to Constitution saving throws. However, it has a very low Charisma score of 1, resulting in a -5 modifier, making it ineffective in social interactions that require charm or persuasion. The dragon is immune to several types of damage, including poison and psychic, and it's also conditioned to resist being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned. </summary>

The Three-Headed Clockwork Dragon possesses several unique special abilities. The first, **Bound**, allows it to be connected to three circlets worn by individuals within one mile. This connection enables telepathic communication between the dragon and the circlet-wearers, effectively allowing them to see and hear through the dragon's senses, although at a cost. If there are not enough circlet-wearers within range, it can lead to exhaustion for those wearing them, or it may even turn hostile against any creatures it perceives. It also has **Immutable Form**, making it immune to spell effects that alter its form, and **Magic Resistance**, giving it advantage on saving throws against spells, enhancing its durability against magical attacks. Furthermore, as a **Siege Monster**, it deals double damage to objects and structures, showcasing its devastating potential in combat.

In terms of actions, the dragon employs a **Multiattack**, which allows it to take several offensive actions in one turn. It can attack with its powerful **Bite**, making a melee weapon attack with a +12 to hit and dealing 18 piercing damage plus an additional 3 fire damage on a hit. It also has a **Fist** attack, which deals 14 bludgeoning damage, also with a +12 to hit. The dragon is capable of unleashing a devastating **Fire Breath** attack, available after recharging on a roll of 6. This attack encompasses three 60-foot cones of fire, dealing up to 45 fire damage to creatures caught in the area unless they succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. 

Moreover, the **Oil Spray** ability allows the dragon to spray oil in a 30-foot cone that makes creatures vulnerable to fire damage until the end of the dragon's next turn if they fail a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Lastly, with its **Tail Sweep**, the dragon can swing its bladed tail in a 15-foot radius, forcing creatures to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, dealing slashing damage and potentially knocking them prone. 

Overall, the Three-Headed Clockwork Dragon presents a blend of physical might and strategic abilities, making it a challenging opponent that requires careful planning and coordination to overcome in a D&D encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Bound:** The dragon is magically bound to three circlets. As long as the dragon is within 1 mile of a circlet wearer on the same plane of existence, the wearer can communicate telepathically with the dragon. While the dragon is active, the wearers see through its eyes and hear what it hears. During this time, the wearers are deaf and blind with regard to their own senses. 

If only two circlet wearers are within 1 mile of the active dragon each hour spent wearing the circlets imposes one level of exhaustion on those wearers. If only a single wearer is within 1 mile of the active dragon, each minute spent wearing the circlet gives that wearer one level of exhaustion. If no circlet wearers are within 1 mile of the dragon, it views all creatures it can see as enemies and tries to destroy them until a circlet wearer communicates with the dragon or the dragon is destroyed. A circlet wearer can use its action to put the dragon in an inactive state where it becomes incapacitated until a wearer uses an action to switch the dragon to active. 

Each circlet is a magic item that must be attuned.
- **Immutable Form:** The dragon is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Siege Monster:** The dragon deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon can use its Oil Spray. It then makes five attacks: three with its bite and two with its fists.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 6):** The dragon exhales fire in three separate 60-foot cones. Each creature in one of these cones must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (13d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in overlapping cones has disadvantage on the saving throw, but it takes damage from only one breath.
- **Oil Spray:** The dragon sprays oil in a 30-foot-cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or become vulnerable to fire damage until the end of the dragon's next turn.
- **Tail Sweep:** The dragon swings its bladed tail. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage but isn't knocked prone.
