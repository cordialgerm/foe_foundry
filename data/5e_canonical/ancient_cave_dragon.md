<summary>The Ancient Cave Dragon is a formidable and dangerous creature that embodies a sinister presence with its neutral evil alignment. This gargantuan dragon boasts exceptional attributes that make it a prime obstacle for any adventurer. With a robust defense featuring an Armor Class of 20 due to its natural armor, and a staggering pool of 507 hit points, it can withstand a great deal of punishment. Its challenge rating of 25 signifies that it is a significant threat in any campaign, offering 75,000 experience points upon defeat. In combat, the dragon’s strengths lie in its high strength (30), impressive constitution (29), and decent charisma (18). However, it does possess weaknesses, such as its below-average dexterity (12), which means it is not as agile as other entities. Its suite of special abilities grants it significant control over the battlefield, while its multiple powerful attacks make it a devastating opponent.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient Cave Dragon's attributes are as follows: it has a strength of 30, providing a very good melee attack power; dexterity of 12, which reflects a bad agility; constitution of 29, resulting in an exceptional durability overall; intelligence of 14, which offers average cognitive capabilities; wisdom of 16 for a good perception of the world; and charisma of 18 that indicates it has a very good ability to affect others.

For its saving throws, the dragon excels in constitution (+17) and charisma (+12), both providing exceptional resilience against effects that require saving throws. Its wisdom saving throw of +11 is also good, while its dexterity saving throw of +9 is average.

In terms of skills, the cave dragon has an outstanding perception skill with a +19 bonus, making it very good at noticing hidden creatures or traps, and it has a stealth skill at +9 that is good for remaining hidden.

The Ancient Cave Dragon has immunity to poison damage and is also immune to being blinded or poisoned, allowing it to be exceptionally resilient against particular types of attacks. Additionally, it possesses senses like blindsight within 60 feet and tremorsense up to 120 feet, enabling it to detect threats without needing sight. It communicates in Common, Darakhul, and Draconic languages.

The dragon has several special abilities. Its **Darkness Aura** creates a magical darkness in a 30-foot radius around it, obstructing vision for creatures without darkvision and dispelling weaker light spells, which can drastically alter the battlefield's visibility dynamics. It can choose whether this aura is active at the start of its turn, and it can be suppressed temporarily with a successful **dispell magic** cast on it. The **Legendary Resistance** allows the dragon to automatically succeed on failed saving throws up to three times per day, significantly enhancing its survivability during combat. The **Magical Tunneler** ability enables it to burrow through earth and stone, either leaving the area undisturbed or creating a tunnel, providing incredible mobility and tactical options underground. Its **Spiked Climb** ability allows it to navigate difficult surfaces effortlessly, making it capable of towering over its foes.

In terms of actions, the Ancient Cave Dragon can perform a **Multiattack**, using its *Frightful Presence* to instill fear before executing three physical attacks: one with its **Bite** (with a +18 to hit, delivering substantial damage of 21 piercing and 14 poison damage on a hit), two with its **Claws** (also with a +18 to hit, inflicting 17 slashing damage), and one with its **Tail** (similar accuracy, causing 19 bludgeoning damage).

The **Frightful Presence** ability forces creatures aware of the dragon within 120 feet to make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened, impacting their ability to act effectively in combat for up to a minute, unless they pass their saving throw. The **Poison Breath** attack allows it to exhale a devastating cone of poisonous gas, requiring targets to make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw to avoid or take massive damage and become poisoned, highlighting its capacity to inflict both immediate and ongoing harm to multiple foes.

The dragon also has a reactive ability known as **Ruff Spikes**, which activates when an enemy approaches. It can deal piercing damage to intruders unless they succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, further showcasing its defensive capabilities in close quarters.

Finally, it can use legendary actions to ensure it remains a dominant force on the battlefield. It can **Detect** to enhance its perception, make a **Tail Attack**, or perform a **Limb Sweep** (which costs two legendary actions) to push away and knock prone nearby foes, thereby controlling the flow of combat with its powerful presence.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Darkness Aura:** The cave dragon emits magical darkness in a 30-foot radius around it. The darkness moves with the dragon and spreads around corners. Darkvision can’t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 4th level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled. At the start of each of its turns, the dragon chooses whether this aura is active. A successful dispel magic (DC 15) cast on the dragon suppresses this aura for 1 minute.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Magical Tunneler:** The cave dragon can burrow through any unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dragon can choose whether to leave the material it moves through undisturbed or leave a 15-foot diameter tunnel in its wake.
- **Spiked Climb:** The dragon uses its spikes to hold itself in place while climbing, allowing it to climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. If it climbs upside down on a ceiling or suspends itself on a vertical surface while leaving its claws free, it can’t use the Ruff Spikes reaction.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its Bite and two with its Claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Poison Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales a cone of black, poisonous gas in a 90-foot cone. Each target in that area must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 91 (26d6) poison damage and is poisoned until cured by the greater restoration spell or similar magic. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned.

### Reactions

- **Ruff Spikes:** When a creature moves to a space within 10 feet of the cave dragon, the dragon flares its many feelers and spikes. The creature must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) piercing damage and be prevented from entering that space.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a Tail attack.
- **Limb Sweep (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon sweeps its wingless limbs outward. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone.
