<summary>The Necrotech Thunderer is a massive, undead creature characterized by its formidable presence on the battlefield. With a neutral evil alignment, it utilizes its size and necromantic powers to create havoc, serving as a resilient frontline combatant due to its high hit points and defensive capabilities. The Necrotech Thunderer excels in destroying structures and dealing significant damage in combat, although its speed is limited. It has very high strength, making its melee attacks particularly devastating, but it is very slow and vulnerable to ranged and magical attacks, especially those that can bypass its resistances. Overall, it poses a serious threat to adventurers who are not adequately prepared to handle its powerful attacks and resilient undead nature.</summary>

<detail>

The creature has an Armor Class of 14, which is considered average, and it possesses 126 hit points, calculated from 11d12+55, making it a tough foe to defeat. With a Challenge Rating of 8, it represents a significant challenge that can provide 3,900 XP upon defeat. Its strength score is exceptionally high at 20 (+5), giving it a good modifier for melee attacks, while its dexterity is very low at 5 (-3), which results in a bad modifier for any dexterity-related checks or saving throws. The constitution score of 21 (+5) also provides strong resilience, particularly in health-related saving throws. The intelligence score is very low at 5 (-3), indicating it is not capable of complex thought or strategy, while the wisdom score is average at 14 (+2) and the charisma score is poor at 9 (-1).

In terms of saving throws, the Necrotech Thunderer has a Dexterity saving throw modifier of +0, which is very bad, and a Wisdom saving throw modifier of +5, which is good. It possesses a perception skill modifier of +2, also considered average. This creature is immune to necrotic and poison damage, providing it with significant resilience to many attack types, and it is resistant to nonmagic bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, adding another layer of durability. It is immune to being blinded and poisoned, which can be advantageous in various encounters. The creature has blindsight up to 120 feet, allowing it to accurately perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, and it has a passive perception score of 15, indicating its adeptness at detecting hidden foes. The Necrotech Thunderer understands the Common and Darakhul languages but is unable to speak.

The special abilities of the Necrotech Thunderer enhance its combat capabilities significantly. The "Siege Monster" ability allows it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it especially effective in sieges or when battling constructs. "Turn Resistance" grants the creature advantage on saving throws against effects that would turn undead, making it difficult to control. Its "Undead Nature" ability means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, making it tireless and relentless in pursuit of its objectives.

In terms of actions, the Necrotech Thunderer can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to use two "Trample" attacks in a turn. The Trample attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +8 to hit and deals 21 (3d10+5) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit, posing a significant threat. The "Ballista Shot" action enables it to target up to two points it can see within 120 feet, affecting creatures in a 5-foot radius around those points. Affected creatures must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, with half damage if they succeed. If a creature is near both points, it must roll with disadvantage, although it only takes damage from one effect, not both. Additionally, the "Concentrated Shot," which recharges on a roll of 5–6, allows it to pick a point within 120 feet. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) necrotic damage and suffering a level of exhaustion on a failure, or half damage with no exhaustion on a success. This makes the "Concentrated Shot" a very powerful area-effect attack that can severely weaken multiple opponents at once.</detail>
