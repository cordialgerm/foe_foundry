<summary>The Killer Whale, also known as an orca, is a massive, intelligent predator that dominates the oceans. Its sleek, black-and-white body allows it to move through the water with incredible speed and agility. Killer Whales are social creatures, often hunting in pods and using coordinated strategies to take down large prey, such as seals, fish, or even other sea creatures. Their powerful jaws and sharp teeth make them deadly hunters. While they primarily hunt marine animals, they are known to be highly intelligent and can be trained or directed by seafaring cultures.</summary>
