<summary>The Mountain Nymph is a Medium-sized fey creature with a chaotic neutral alignment. Known for her agility and cunning, she embodies the clever and elusive qualities often attributed to fey beings. With an Armor Class of 15, she is reasonably protected, aided by her leather armor. She has a substantial pool of Hit Points at 112, making her resilient in battle, and poses a Challenge Rating of 6, equating to 2,300 experience points for those who defeat her. The Mountain Nymph excels at stealth and ranged attacks, with skilled proficiency in Dexterity and Wisdom, allowing her to evade detection and react quickly to threats. However, her lack of exceptional physical strength and moderate Intelligence presents some limitations in direct confrontation.</summary>

<detail>

Her attributes score as follows: Strength is 12, which provides a slight physical capability with a +1 modifier, indicating average effectiveness. Dexterity stands at 18, giving her an impressive +4 modifier, resulting in very good agility and finesse. Constitution is 16, yielding a +3 modifier, which is good for maintaining her health. Intelligence is a mere 10, meaning she has an average intellect with no bonuses. Wisdom is 18, allowing her a +4 modifier, enabling very good perception and insight. Finally, her Charisma is 14, granting a +2 modifier, which is above average.

The Mountain Nymph possesses a series of special abilities that accentuate her combat prowess. With Hunter's Foresight, she can foresee the immediate future of a creature marked by her Hunter's Mark spell, granting her advantage on both attack rolls and saving throws against that creature's spells and abilities. Her Mountain Walk ability allows her to traverse rocky surfaces effortlessly, negating the need for ability checks and allowing her to ignore extra movement costs when navigating difficult terrain. The Point Blank Hunter trait enables her to make ranged attacks without disadvantage when within 5 feet of an enemy, enhancing her effectiveness in tight quarters.

As for her spellcasting, the Mountain Nymph utilizes her Wisdom as her spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 15. She can cast Hunter's Mark at will, enhancing her attack capabilities. She has access to three uses per day of both Misty Step, which allows her to teleport a short distance, and Spike Growth, a spell that creates an area of difficult terrain filled with sharp thorns that can damage those moving through it. Additionally, she can cast Pass Without Trace once per day, providing herself and her allies with a significant bonus to stealth, making it easier for them to avoid detection.

In combat, she can use a Multiattack to make three longbow attacks, leveraging her high Dexterity bonus for a +7 to hit. With a formidable range of 150/600 feet on her Longbow, she can strike from a distance, dealing 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage with each successful shot. This ability to engage opponents from afar while maintaining her elusiveness makes the Mountain Nymph a formidable adversary in any encounter.</detail>
