<summary>The Floe Hag is a formidable Medium Fey creature with a neutral evil alignment, known for its cunning and manipulative nature. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, boasting a considerable 135 hit points and protective capabilities in combat. The hag's natural armor grants it an Armor Class of 15, making it relatively challenging to hit. Its dual nature allows it to traverse across land and aquatic environments effortlessly, reinforcing its adaptability in various terrains. The Floe Hag excels with its cold damage immunities and unique abilities that can turn the tide of combat, providing both offensive and defensive options. However, while its attributes are strong, including a high Strength score of 18 and decent Dexterity and Constitution, its character is best defined by its social manipulation and magical prowess, which can be equally dangerous.</summary>

<detail>

The Floe Hag possesses the following attributes: Strength of 18 (+4), Dexterity of 15 (+2), Constitution of 16 (+3), Intelligence of 12 (+1), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 14 (+2). These scores support an effective combat style, with the Strength modifier contributing to its melee attacks being very good, while the Dexterity and Constitution add average effectiveness to its defenses. The hag also has a passive Perception of 11, making it average in its ability to detect hidden threats. It has damage immunity to cold, allowing it to withstand many attacks that deal this type of damage.

The Floe Hag has a couple of notable special abilities: 

- **Amphibious**: This ability allows the hag to breathe both air and water, granting it exceptional versatility in aquatic settings.
- **Ice Walk**: The hag can move effortlessly across icy surfaces without penalties, allowing it to navigate difficult terrain that would hinder others.

In combat, the Floe Hag utilizes several actions:

- **Multiattack**: On its turn, it can make two Claw attacks or three Ice Bolt attacks, giving it strategic options during encounters.
- **Claw**: This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit and deals 8 slashing damage plus an additional 10 cold damage. If the target is hit, they become grappled, requiring a DC 15 escape check to free themselves.
- **Ice Bolt**: As a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit, this attack has a range of 60 feet and inflicts 12 cold damage.
- **Stash**: The Floe Hag can store a grappled or incapacitated creature in an extradimensional pocket within her parka. The trapped creature is blinded and restrained, with total cover from external attacks. They can attempt to escape with a DC 15 Strength check. If the hag dies, the trapped creature is freed in an unoccupied space nearby.
- **Distracting Knock (Recharge 5–6)**: This ability involves the hag creating a magical sound that deals 21 psychic damage to each creature within 30 feet. Targets are incapacitated for 1 minute unless they succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, allowing for a strategic advantage that forces incapacitated creatures to move towards the hag.
- **Spellcasting**: The hag can cast spells using its Charisma as its spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 13. Its available spells include at-will options like minor illusion and prestidigitation, three times a day fog cloud and sleep, and once a day sleet storm—all of which add significant versatility to its tactics.

Overall, the Floe Hag is a unique blend of physical prowess and magical capability, making it an engaging adversary in Dungeons & Dragons encounters, particularly in colder environments where its strengths can shine.</detail>
