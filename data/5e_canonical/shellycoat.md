<summary>The Shellycoat is a Medium-sized fey creature that embodies the essence of neutrality mingled with a tinge of evil. It possesses the unique ability to thrive both in water and on land, making it versatile in various environments. With an Armor Class of 14, it has decent defenses, bolstered by its natural armor. The Shellycoat has a solid 52 hit points, derived from 7d8 rolled alongside a constitution bonus of +3, allowing it to withstand a moderate amount of damage. As a Challenge Rating 2 creature, it is relatively balanced for encounters, particularly against adventurers of low to mid-level. Among its notable features are its regeneration ability, which allows it to recover hit points over time, and its susceptibility to sunlight, which can petrify it if it remains in nonmagical sunlight for an extended period. Its combat abilities, combined with powerful special traits, make it a formidable opponent in water-heavy confrontations, while its weaknesses to fire and acid damage can be exploited by savvy players.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Shellycoat has the following statistics:
- Strength: 17 (+3, considered good)
- Dexterity: 15 (+2, good)
- Constitution: 16 (+3, good)
- Intelligence: 13 (+1, average)
- Wisdom: 9 (-1, bad)
- Charisma: 7 (-2, very bad)

The creature is skilled in Perception with a +1 modifier and Stealth with a +4 modifier, making it quite capable of remaining undetected in suitable environments. It is immune to becoming charmed, poisoned, or unconscious, allowing it to maintain its advantages in combat and resist control effects. With darkvision extending to 60 feet, it can operate effectively in low-light conditions. Communicating in both Giant and Sylvan, it has the means to converse with other fey and large creatures.

The Shellycoat has several special abilities:
- **Amphibious:** This allows the Shellycoat to breathe both air and water, making it adaptable to aquatic settings.
- **Keen Hearing:** The Shellycoat gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks involving hearing, enhancing its awareness of its surroundings.
- **Hazesight:** This ability permits the creature to see without penalty through fog, smoke, and steam, giving it a tactical edge in obscured conditions.
- **Regeneration:** At the start of its turn, the Shellycoat regains 3 hit points unless it has recently taken acid or fire damage. It can only die if it starts its turn at 0 hit points and cannot regenerate.
- **Water Camouflage:** When partially submerged in water, the Shellycoat has an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, allowing it to hide effectively.
- **Sunlight Petrification:** This is a significant weakness; if exposed to nonmagical sunlight for one minute, the Shellycoat becomes petrified, incapacitating it.

In combat, the Shellycoat can perform multiple attacks by utilizing its **Multiattack** feature, allowing it to make one Bite and one Claw attack. For the Bite attack, it has a +5 to hit and causes 6 piercing damage on a successful hit. The Claw attack has the same to-hit bonus but reaches 15 feet for a possible hit, dealing 12 slashing damage while grappling the target. The grappled creature must succeed on a DC 13 escape check or remain restrained, limiting its mobility.

Lastly, the Shellycoat can use its **Shellycoat’s Fog** ability once per day while in contact with water. It generates a 20-foot-radius sphere of heavily obscured fog for one minute, which can affect creatures entering or starting their turn in the fog. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned and unable to breathe unless they can breathe water. This effect can be renewed at the end of each turn, offering a strategic option in encounters, especially in water-based settings.</detail>

Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained. The shellycoat has two claws, each of which can grapple only one creature.
- **Shellycoat’s Fog (1/Day):** While in contact with water, the shellycoat can create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it for 1 minute. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A creature that enters the fog for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned and unable to breathe, unless it can breathe water, for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
