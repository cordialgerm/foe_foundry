<detail>

The attributes of the Young Void Dragon are impressive, with a Strength score of 20 (+5), allowing it to deliver powerful physical attacks. Its Constitution of 21 (+5) not only enhances its resilience but also bolsters its saving throws, which are very good in Dexterity (+4), Constitution (+9), Wisdom (+4), and Charisma (+8) as it excels in mental and physical fortitude. The dragon has an Intelligence score of 14 (+2) allowing for clever tactics and the capability of communicating in Common, Draconic, and Void Speech. With a Dexterity of 10 (+0), its agility is average, which balances its otherwise overwhelming strength and resilience. Skills such as Arcana (+10) and History (+10) showcase its extensive knowledge of the universe, while Perception (+8) aids in detecting threats. 

The Young Void Dragon is immune to cold damage and cannot be charmed or frightened, making it exceptionally hard to control or subdue. It has blindsight up to 30 feet and darkvision reaching 120 feet, allowing it to see in darkness and perceive foes in obscured environments. Its passive Perception score of 18 highlights its keen awareness.

Among its special abilities, "Chill of the Void" negates resistances to its cold damage for creatures that are usually resistant, although those with complete immunity remain unaffected. "Expert Void Traveler" underscores the dragon’s alien nature, allowing it to exist without air, food, or sleep, and traverse great distances effortlessly in the Void.

In terms of attacks, the Young Void Dragon unleashes a "Multiattack," enabling it to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks per turn. The "Bite" attack has a +9 to hit and delivers 16 piercing damage plus an additional 7 cold damage on a hit. With the "Claw" attack, it also has a +9 to hit, dealing 12 slashing damage. 

This dragon possesses two powerful breath weapons that recharge on a roll of 5–6. "Gravitic Breath" creates a 30-foot cube that imposes damaging bludgeoning effects on falling creatures and restrains those within unless they can make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. This ability can significantly control the battlefield by immobilizing foes and inflicting damage based on their movements. Alternatively, "Stellar Breath" releases a devastating cone of star fire, inflicting both fire and radiant damage (21 damage each on a failed DC 17 Dexterity saving throw) to all creatures caught within its area of effect.

Lastly, the Young Void Dragon can augment its defenses with the "Void Twist" reaction, which temporarily increases its AC by 4 against an incoming attack, allowing it to twist reality and avoid harm, provided it can see the attacker. This defensive maneuver reinforces the dragon's adaptability in combat, making it a challenging adversary that players would need to approach with caution.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Chill of the Void:** Creatures with resistance to cold damage don’t have resistance to the cold damage dealt by the Void dragon. A creature with immunity to cold damage is still immune to the dragon’s cold damage.
- **Expert Void Traveler:** The Void dragon doesn’t require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure. While traveling in the Void, the dragon magically glides on solar winds, covering immense distances in short times.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.
- **Gravitic Breath:** The dragon exhales localized gravity in a 30-foot cube, originating from the dragon. When a creature ends a fall in the cube, it takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d10. A creature that enters the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained. On a success, the creature’s speed is halved as long as it remains in the cube. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The cube lasts until the dragon’s breath weapon recharges.
- **Stellar Breath:** The dragon exhales star fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage and 21 (6d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Void Twist:** The dragon adds 4 to its AC against one attack that would hit it, as it twists reality to open a small rift in space to protect itself. To do so, the dragon must be able to see the attacker.
