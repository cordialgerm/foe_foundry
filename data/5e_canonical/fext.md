<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Fext is a formidable Medium undead creature characterized by its powerful magic-infused weaponry and unsettling presence. With a challenge rating of 6, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, boasting high armor class and hit points, making it quite resilient in battle. The Fext’s key strengths lie in its exceptional Charisma, which enhances its defense and offensive capabilities, empowering its magical attacks to deal substantial damage. While it is immune to several conditions and resistant to nonmagical physical damage, its reliance on spell-based attacks over melee combat is noteworthy and opens potential vulnerabilities to specific forms of combat or strategic defenses.</summary>

<detail>

The Fext has an Armor Class of 17, boosted by its Patron’s Blessing ability, which adds its Charisma modifier of +4 to its defense when it is conscious and not wearing armor or wielding a shield. It has a total of 77 hit points, translating to 14d8 + 14, making its resilience good. In terms of abilities, the Fext possesses a Strength score of 14 (+2, which is average), Dexterity of 16 (+3, which is good), Constitution of 12 (+1, which is average), Intelligence of 14 (+2, which is average), Wisdom of 12 (+1, which is average), and an exceptional Charisma of 18 (+4).

For saving throws, the Fext has +6 in Dexterity and +4 in Wisdom, indicating a good level of avoidance against attacks and abilities targeting these attributes. It also has notable skills in Perception at +4. The Fext is immune to poison damage and resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, enhancing its durability in physical confrontations. It is immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned, making it exceptionally hard to debilitate. Its sense of darkvision up to 60 feet and truesight of 20 feet grants it a significant advantage in combat situations, allowing it to pierce illusions and perceive creatures even in darkness.

The Fext has several powerful special abilities. Eldritch Weapons make its attacks magical, dealing an additional 2d8 force damage with each weapon hit, significantly increasing its damage output. Magic Resistance gives the Fext an advantage on saving throws against spells, making it more difficult for spellcasters to incapacitate it. The Patron’s Blessing allows it to add its Charisma modifier to its AC, further reinforcing its already high defense. Lastly, Undead Nature means the Fext does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate without limitations that affect living creatures.

In combat, the Fext can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make two attacks with either its Eldritch Blade or Eldritch Fury. The Eldritch Blade is a melee weapon attack with a +6 to hit, having a reach of 5 feet and dealing 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage alongside 9 (2d8) force damage, making it quite effective in close range. The Eldritch Fury is a ranged spell attack with a +7 to hit, boasting a range of 120 feet and dealing 17 (3d8 + 4) force damage on a hit, providing versatility in attacking from a distance.

Its most intimidating ability, Patron’s Might (recharge 5–6), allows the Fext to evoke a sense of terror. Each creature within a 10-foot radius must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they suffer 35 (10d6) psychic damage while being frightened for one minute, potentially causing chaos within enemy ranks. On a successful save, the damage is halved, and the creature does not become frightened. Frightened creatures can attempt to save again at the end of each of their turns. This ability not only causes substantial damage but also disrupts the battlefield dynamics, potentially turning the tide of combat in favor of the Fext.</detail>
