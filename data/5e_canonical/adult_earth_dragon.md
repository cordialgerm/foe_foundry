<summary>The Adult Earth Dragon is a formidable Huge Dragon known for its power as a guardian of the earth and stone. With high armor class and substantial hit points, it presents a significant threat to adventurers. Its abilities allow it to manipulate the battlefield through terrain alterations, while its innate spellcasting affords tactical advantages. The dragon benefits from substantial physical attributes, particularly in strength and constitution, making it a powerful melee combatant. However, its reliance on its linked essence means that when separated from its territory, it becomes less effective. Players must strategize when engaging this creature, considering its strengths in combat alongside its unique terrain-based abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Earth Dragon has an Armor Class of 19, indicating a good level of defense that makes it challenging to hit. It possesses 287 hit points, calculated as 23d12 plus 138, affording it great durability, signifying it can endure considerable damage before being defeated. Its ground speed is 40 feet, and it can fly at 40 feet, with an exceptional burrow speed of 60 feet, allowing it to traverse different terrains effectively. The dragon has a Challenge Rating of 18, which translates to a potential experience point reward of 20,000 XP, marking it as a high-tier adversary.

The dragon's abilities are reflected in its strong physical and mental characteristics, with a Strength score of 22 (+6 modifier), which is exceptional, leading to a +12 bonus on Strength saving throws and athletics checks. Its Constitution is also 22 (+6), contributing to the same strong modifier for saving throws and giving it high resilience. The dragonâ€™s Intelligence is 22 (+6), allowing for effective use of nature-based skills and spells, with an +8 modifier for related checks. Dexterity is at 14 (+2), yielding an average modifier that impacts its initiative and certain saving throws. Wisdom and Charisma are both at 14 (+2) and 20 (+5), respectively, enabling it to engage well in insight and other Charisma-based interactions.

The dragon is resistant to damage from nonmagical weapons, which makes it less vulnerable to most mundane physical attacks. It is immune to conditions that cause petrification. The creature has superior sensory capabilities, including darkvision with a range of 120 feet and tremorsense of 90 feet, allowing it to perceive its environment exceptionally well. It also possesses a passive perception of 21. The dragon can communicate in Common, Draconic, and Terran languages.

The dragon's special abilities enhance its role in combat and interaction significantly. "Earth Glide" allows it to burrow seamlessly through nonmagical earth and stone, avoiding detection. Its "False Appearance" ability allows the dragon to camouflage itself as a rock formation when unmoving, making it hard for players to notice its true nature until they are close. With "Legendary Resistance," the dragon can opt to succeed on a failed saving throw three times a day, but doing so halves its movement until the end of its next turn, showing a tactical drawback to its powerful resilience. The "Essence Link" connects the dragon spiritually to its territory, limiting its effectiveness in combat when away from that area and affecting creatures that venture into the region that loses its essence.

In terms of spellcasting, the Adult Earth Dragon can cast "locate animals or plants," "spike growth," "stone shape," and "wall of stone," each three times per day without requiring materials. The spells allow the dragon to manipulate terrain, hinder foes, and scout effectively, contributing to its tactical nature during engagements.

For actions, the dragon can perform a "Multiattack," which consists of one bite attack and two slam attacks or a bite followed by "Rock Spire." Its "Bite" attack has a +12 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 28 piercing damage or the option to grapple and restrain a target. The "Slam" attack also boasts a +12 to hit and can deal 19 bludgeoning damage. The "Scouring Breath" allows the dragon to unleash a cone of sandy debris, forcing targeted creatures to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or suffer significant slashing damage and possible blindness. Lastly, "Rock Spire" lets the dragon create a towering spire of rock that can damage and potentially incapacitate enemies if they fail their saving throw against it.

The dragon can also perform legendary actions. "Shake the Foundation" creates difficult terrain and could knock creatures prone if the dragon is bloodied. The "Slam Attack" allows for another assault action, while "Entomb" forces a creature within 60 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw, potentially burying them and rendering them helpless. In all, the Adult Earth Dragon is a multi-faceted threat with the ability to control the battlefield, withstand damage, and assert significant pressure on adventurers who challenge it.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Earth Glide:** The dragon can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing it.

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, it becomes more like rock. Its movement is halved until the end of its next turn.
- **Essence Link:** The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
- **Scouring Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales scouring sand and stones in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw  taking 56 (16d6) slashing damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is also blinded until the end of its next turn.
- **Rock Spire:** A permanent  25-foot-tall  5-foot-radius spire of rock magically rises from a point on the ground within 60 feet. A creature in the spires area when it appears makes a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw  taking 13 (3d8) piercing damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature that fails this saving throw by 10 or more is impaled at the top of the spire. A creature can use an action to make a DC 12 Strength check  freeing the implaced creature on a success. The impaled creature is also freed if the spire is destroyed. The spire is an object with AC 16  30 hit points and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

- **The dragon can take 3 legendary actions:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Shake the Foundation:** The dragon causes the ground to roil, creating a permanent, 40-foot-radius area of difficult terrain centered on a point the dragon can see. If the dragon is bloodied, creatures in the area make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failure.
