<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>An Ice Mephit is a small, impish creature made of ice and frost, with jagged wings and sharp claws. These creatures are mischievous and cruel, often found in cold environments such as glaciers, snow-covered mountains, or icy caves. Ice Mephits can breathe a freezing blast of cold air that chills their enemies to the bone, and they can create small snowstorms or ice slicks to hinder their foes. They are also capable of summoning other mephits to aid them in battle. Though small and weak on their own, Ice Mephits are dangerous when encountered in groups.</summary>

<summary>The Ice Mephit is a small elemental creature that embodies the essence of cold and ice, making it both a nuisance and a potential hazard to adventurers. With a challenge rating of 1/2, this creature is relatively weak in terms of raw power, but it compensates with unique abilities such as its explosive death burst and the capacity to create areas of obscured visibility. Its speed allows it to maneuver both on foot and in the air, making it a versatile opponent that can strike from above before retreating into the fog. Ice Mephits have weaknesses to bludgeoning and fire damage, which makes them vulnerable to certain types of attacks. However, they possess strengths in their immunities to cold and poison damage, rendering them resilient against many forms of harm.</summary>

<detail>

The Ice Mephit has the following attributes: Strength of 8 with a modifier of -1, which is considered very bad for physical attacks; Dexterity of 14 with a modifier of +2, indicating a good ability for dodging and stealth; Constitution of 10 with no modifier, representing average hardiness; Intelligence of 8 with a modifier of -1, deemed very bad for intelligence-based tasks; Wisdom of 10 with no modifier, which is again average; and Charisma of 10, also average. Its skills include perception at +2, making it somewhat effective at noticing hidden creatures, and stealth at +4, which is good for remaining unnoticed.

In terms of vulnerabilities and immunities, the Ice Mephit takes double damage from bludgeoning and fire attacks, making it an easy target for those types of damage. It is immune to cold and poison damage and is also unaffected by the poisoned condition, enhancing its survivability in certain combat scenarios. It possesses darkvision to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dark environments, and a passive perception score of 12, which allows it to spot unnoticed threats effectively. The Mephit communicates in the languages Aquan and Auran, allowing it to interact with other elemental beings.

The Ice Mephit features several special abilities. The Death Burst ability triggers upon its death, causing it to explode into ice shards. Any creature within 5 feet must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) slashing damage on a failed save or halving the damage on a successful one. This can be an effective area deterrent against melee attackers. The False Appearance ability allows the Mephit to remain motionless and indistinguishable from a shard of ice, serving as a clever ambush tactic. Its Elemental Nature means the Ice Mephit does not require air, sustenance, or sleep, making it a low-maintenance creature in prolonged engagements.

The Ice Mephit's actions include a melee attack with its claws, which has a +4 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage plus an additional 2 (1d4) cold damage on a successful hit. It can also use its Fog ability once per day to exhale a 20-foot-radius cloud of fog, heavily obscuring the area for those who are not mephits, which can hinder opponents’ visibility and movement for 10 minutes or until a strong wind disperses the fog. Lastly, it can unleash a Freezing Breath attack once per day, which is a 15-foot cone of ice. Creatures caught in this area must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) cold damage on a failed save or half damage on a success, allowing the mephit to inflict significant cold damage while potentially controlling the battlefield.

The Ice Mephit is a small elemental creature that embodies the cold and frost of its icy domain. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it poses a minor threat to adventurers, particularly due to its ability to inflict cold damage and restrain foes with ice. Its overall durability is moderate, with 27 hit points and an armor class of 12, making it somewhat easier to hit, especially against stronger characters. The Ice Mephit excels in agility, reflected in its dexterity score of +2, leading to good opportunities for evasion and stealth. However, it suffers from weaknesses in strength and intelligence, limiting its effectiveness in direct physical confrontations and strategic planning. One of its notable features is its ability to blend in as an ordinary shard of ice, which can be a strategic advantage in surprise encounters.

The Ice Mephit has the following attributes: Strength at -3 (very bad), Dexterity at +2 (good), Constitution at +0 (average), Intelligence at -2 (bad), Wisdom at +0 (average), and Charisma at +1 (average). It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, enabling it to see in low-light conditions, and has a perception score of 12, providing it with average awareness. The creature can communicate in Aquan and Auran, making it capable of conversing with other elemental beings or characters familiar with these languages.

The Ice Mephit’s special abilities enhance its combat capabilities. The "Death Burst" ability causes it to explode in a burst of icy material when it dies, forcing nearby creatures to make a DC 11 dexterity saving throw. Failure results in being restrained by ice for one minute, potentially hindering movement and actions. Allies can help free those restrained by making a DC 11 strength check. Furthermore, the ice will melt if the restrained creature suffers fire damage, providing a possible escape route from the condition. The "False Appearance" ability allows the Ice Mephit to remain motionless and appear as an ordinary shard of ice, giving it an exceptional opportunity for ambushes and surprise attacks.

In combat, the Ice Mephit can use its "Claws" attack as a melee weapon with a +4 to hit. On a successful hit, it deals 4 slashing damage along with an additional 3 cold damage. It also has the option to attack from a distance using "Ice Shard," which has the same attack bonus and damage output as the claws but is a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 feet. 

Additionally, the Ice Mephit has a powerful area attack called "Frost Breath," which can be used after a recharge of six rounds. It can exhale a freezing fog in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures within the area to make a DC 11 constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 cold damage and is restrained by ice until the end of its next turn. If they succeed, they take half damage and are not restrained, making this ability a strong area control tactic.

As a bonus action, the Ice Mephit can use "Cloud of Snow" once per day to cast the fog cloud spell without material components. This spell creates a heavily obscured area, which can be used strategically to conceal its movements or escape from dangerous situations. 

Overall, the Ice Mephit is a cunning and versatile adversary, utilizing its elemental powers and ability to disguise itself to create chaos on the battlefield, proving to be a formidable foe for unprepared adventurers.</detail>
