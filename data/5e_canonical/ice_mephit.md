<CreatureType/>Elemental</CreatureType>

<summary>An Ice Mephit is a small, impish creature made of ice and frost, with jagged wings and sharp claws. These creatures are mischievous and cruel, often found in cold environments such as glaciers, snow-covered mountains, or icy caves. Ice Mephits can breathe a freezing blast of cold air that chills their enemies to the bone, and they can create small snowstorms or ice slicks to hinder their foes. They are also capable of summoning other mephits to aid them in battle. Though small and weak on their own, Ice Mephits are dangerous when encountered in groups.</summary>
