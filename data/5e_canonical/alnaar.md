<summary>The Alnaar is a large fiend characterized by its chaotic evil nature. It possesses a strong combination of speed, durability, and devastating attacks, making it a formidable opponent on the battlefield. With an impressive Armor Class of 17 and a whopping 212 hit points, the Alnaar can endure significant damage. However, it does have weaknesses, particularly against cold damage, and can be affected by the starvation mechanic which temporarily reduces its defenses. Its abilities, such as the fiery aura and devastating multiattack, allow it to deal severe damage while also potentially crippling its enemies. Despite its high damage output and resilience, the Alnaar must be careful to avoid the effects of starvation, which can hinder its effectiveness in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Alnaar's stats include a Strength of 20 (+5), Dexterity of 22 (+6), Constitution of 17 (+3), Intelligence of 9 (-1), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 10 (+0). With an exceptional Dexterity modifier, the Alnaar excels in acrobatics, receiving a bonus of +10 in that skill. Additionally, it has a good Constitution saving throw modifier of +7 and a Dex saving throw bonus of +10, making it quite resilient against physical effects. The Alnaar is vulnerable to cold damage, immune to fire and poison, and resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It cannot be frightened or poisoned, thanks to its immunity to those conditions. It has darkvision extending 120 feet, giving it an advantage in low-light conditions, and a passive perception of 15. The creature can communicate in Abyssal.

The Alnaar possesses several special abilities. One notable ability is "Skin of the Forge," which causes any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in taking 14 (4d6) fire damage, while a successful save halves the damage. Any creature that touches it or strikes it with a melee attack while within 5 feet also suffers 7 (2d6) fire damage. Additionally, nonmagical weapons with an Armor Class of 15 or lower are destroyed upon contact. This ability is suppressed if the Alnaar is starving. 

Its "Starving Wrath" ability indicates that if the Alnaar has not fed on a Medium-sized or larger creature within 12 hours, it becomes starving. While in this state, its Armor Class is reduced by 2, and it gains advantage on melee attack rolls against creatures not at full health. However, it will aggressively target a single foe regardless of tactical positioning until it feeds, which can be strategically negative.

In terms of actions, the Alnaar can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three attacks with its "Fiery Fangs." The Fiery Fangs attack has a +9 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage along with an additional 3 (1d6) fire damage. 

The Alnaar also has a powerful "Flare" action, which it can use after recharging. This ability creates a fiery explosion in a 20-foot radius, forcing all creatures within it to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Failure results in taking 44 (8d10) total damage (22 fire and 22 force) and being knocked prone, while success halves the damage. The explosion also ignites flammable objects. After using Flare, the Alnaar becomes starving and cannot use the ability until it is no longer in that state.

Finally, the Alnaar exhibits a reaction called "On the Hunt." When an enemy it can see moves, the Alnaar can move up to 20 feet toward that creature and make one Fiery Fangs attack if it comes within 10 feet. This ability enhances its offensive options and allows it to respond dynamically to enemy movements.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Skin of the Forge:** A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the alnaar must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that touches the alnaar or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) fire damage. Nonmagical weapons and objects with Armor Class 15 or lower are immediately destroyed after coming into contact with the alnaar's skin. Weapons that hit the alnaar deal their damage before being destroyed. This trait is suppressed if the alnaar is starving.
- **Starving Wrath:** If an alnaar hasn't fed on a Medium-sized or larger creature within the last 12 hours, it is starving. While starving, the alnaar's Armor Class is reduced by 2, it has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all of its hp, and will direct its attacks at a single foe regardless of tactical consequences. Once it feeds on a Medium-sized or larger corpse or brings a Medium-sized or larger creature to 0 hp, it is no longer starving.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The alnaar makes three fiery fangs attacks.
- **Fiery Fangs:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage and 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Flare (Recharge Special):** The alnaar becomes super-heated, expelling momentous energy outwards in a 20-foot radius blast around it. Each creature caught in the blast must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) fire damage and 22 (4d10) force damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the fire and force damage but isn't knocked prone. The fire ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried. After using Flare, the alnaar is starving. It can't use Flare if it is starving.

### Reactions

- **On the Hunt:** When a creature the alnaar can see moves, the alnaar can move up to 20 feet toward the moving creature. If the alnaar moves within 10 feet of that creature, it can make one fiery fangs attack against the creature.
