<summary>The Bukavac is a large and formidable monstrosity characterized by its Neutral Evil alignment. It boasts impressive physical capabilities, including high strength and constitution, making it a resilient creature that can withstand significant damage. With a challenge rating of 9, it is considered a serious threat, particularly due to its capacity for dealing substantial damage in melee combat and its ability to create devastating area effects with its special abilities. However, its intelligence is notably low, which may limit its strategic thinking in combat situations. Its reliance on physical prowess and its moderate speed give it certain strengths, but its relatively low armor class could be seen as a weakness.</summary>

<detail>

The Bukavac has a natural armor class of 16, which is considered good for a creature of its size but is not exceptional, making it somewhat vulnerable to skilled attackers. It has a total of 199 hit points, which translates to a very good level of durability, allowing it to endure prolonged engagements. Movement is fairly limited with a walking speed of 20 feet, which can be a disadvantage when trying to close the distance to its targets. The Bukavac's strength, sitting at 20 (+5 modifier), is exceptional, allowing it to deliver devastating blows in combat. Its dexterity of 17 (+3 modifier) is good, contributing to its agility and effectiveness in avoiding some attacks, while its constitution of 18 (+4 modifier) supports its overall resilience. Intelligence sits at 7 (-2 modifier), which is very bad, indicating a lack of mental acuity, while wisdom at 15 (+2 modifier) is average, providing decent perceptual capabilities. Charisma is 12 (+1 modifier), indicating average social abilities.

The Bukavac has specific saving throws with a dexterity modifier of +7 and a constitution modifier of +8, both of which are good, enhancing its survivability against various effects. It also showcases commendable skills in perception (+10) and stealth (+11), both considered very good, allowing it to ambush unsuspecting foes and effectively use its environment.

In terms of special abilities, the Bukavac can hold its breath for up to 20 minutes, making it quite versatile in aquatic environments. Its standing leap is impressive, allowing it to long jump up to 20 feet and high jump up to 10 feet, which gives it good mobility options in combat scenarios.

The Bukavac's main actions include a multiattack option, which allows it to perform one Bite attack, one Gore attack, and two Claw attacks within a single turn. The Bite is a melee weapon attack that hits on a roll of +9 and has a reach of 10 feet, inflicting an average of 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage. The Claw attack, also hitting at +9 with a reach of 5 feet, deals an average of 11 (1d12 + 5) slashing damage and has the added effect of grappling a Medium or smaller creature, imposing a grappled condition with an escape difficulty of 16. The Bukavac can maintain grapples on a maximum of two creatures at once. The Gore attack similarly functions as a melee weapon attack at +9, reaching 10 feet and dealing an average of 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage, enhancing its melee threat.

Additionally, the Bukavac has a special ability called Croaking Blast that can be used after a recharge on rolls of 5 to 6. This ability unleashes a howling thunderclap in a 15-foot radius, forcing all affected creatures to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in taking 36 (8d8) thunder damage and being deafened, while a successful save halves the damage and avoids the deafened condition. This ability can significantly turn the tide of battle, providing both damage and a debilitating effect that can impact multiple targets simultaneously.</detail>
