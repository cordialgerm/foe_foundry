<summary>The Altar Flame Golem is a large construct characterized by its neutral alignment. It serves primarily as a formidable guardian, likely of sacred sites or important locations, drawing its power from the flames it embodies. The golem boasts a robust defense with an Armor Class of 16, along with a considerable pool of Hit Points totaling 152, making it a durable opponent. Its strengths lie in its fire-related abilities, immunity to many conditions, and its capacity to regain health from fire damage. However, it is notably weak against cold damage, causing it to become less effective in combat, and it has low Dexterity, making it less mobile. Despite its limitations, the altar flame golem presents a significant challenge, particularly in areas where it can leverage its fire abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Altar Flame Golem has the following ability scores: Strength: 19 (+4), Dexterity: 9 (-1), Constitution: 18 (+4), Intelligence: 3 (-4), Wisdom: 10 (+0), and Charisma: 1 (-5). Its high Constitution indicates a strong capacity to endure damage, while its low Dexterity results in very bad agility. 

In terms of skill proficiency, the golem does not have any specific skills listed. It possesses immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage and is impervious to nonmagical attacks that are not made with adamantine, further enhancing its resilience. The creature is also immune to various conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, ensuring it remains unaffected by many debilitating effects. Its senses include darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive Perception of 10. Although it understands the languages of its creator, it cannot communicate verbally.

The altar flame golem has several noteworthy special abilities. Its "Aversion to Water" ability makes it vulnerable to cold damage or being doused with water, applying disadvantage on its attack rolls and ability checks for the duration of its next turn. The "Death Burst" ability triggers when the golem is reduced to zero hit points, causing it to explode and deal up to 28 (8d6) fire damage in an area around it, factoring in a Dexterity saving throw for any nearby creatures. Interestingly, fire damage from another altar flame golem's death burst is not absorbed, allowing for strategic play when multiple golems are involved. The "False Appearance" ability allows the golem to disguise itself as an altar, making it difficult to detect if it remains motionless. Its "Fire Absorption" ability lets it regain hit points equal to any fire damage it would take. The "Immutable Form" ability means it cannot be altered by spells that would change its shape, and "Magic Resistance" provides it with advantage on saves against magical effects. Lastly, its weapon attacks are classified as magical, enhancing its effectiveness in combat.

In terms of actions, the altar flame golem can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two slam attacks. The "Slam" attack is a melee weapon attack with a +8 modifier to hit, having a reach of 5 feet and dealing 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage alongside an additional 11 (2d10) fire damage upon a successful hit. The "Flame Breath" action, which requires a recharge of 5-6, allows it to unleash a 30-foot cone of fire. Any creature within that cone must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 36 (8d8) fire damage, with half damage on a successful save. This ability can significantly impact battles, especially if multiple opponents are caught within the area of effect.</detail>
