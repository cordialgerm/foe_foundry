<summary>The Edimmu is a medium undead creature with a chaotic evil alignment, presenting a significant threat on the battlefield due to its ability to sap the life force from opponents. It possesses a good Armor Class of 15, making it adept at avoiding attacks, and has a substantial pool of hit points totaling 75, which provides it with significant durability in combat situations. With a speed of 60 feet, it can maneuver well during encounters. The Edimmu is rated as a Challenge Rating of 4, which indicates that it is a moderate threat to parties of adventurers. It excels in combat with its high Dexterity, granting it a +4 modifier that results in good effectiveness for initiatives and ranged attacks. However, it has very poor Strength at -5, rendering it ineffective in melee combat, along with average Intelligence and Charisma scores, indicating it is not reliant on social interactions or intellectual challenges. The Edimmu has factors that make it resilient, such as immunities to necrotic and poison damage, and resistances to several elemental damages and nonmagical physical attacks. Overall, while it has weaknesses, its regenerative capabilities and unique movement make it a formidable adversary.</summary>

<detail>

The Edimmu's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength 1 (-5, very bad) 
- Dexterity 19 (+4, good) 
- Constitution 16 (+3, good) 
- Intelligence 12 (+1, average) 
- Wisdom 18 (+4, good) 
- Charisma 13 (+1, average)

The creature possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat prowess and survivability. The Edimmu has Incorporeal Movement, allowing it to pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 force damage as a consequence of its movement. Another notable ability is Rejuvenation, which permits the Edimmu to resurrect itself after being destroyed in just a few days, regaining full hit points and returning near its remains. The only way to permanently destroy the Edimmu is to bury its remains in consecrated ground. Additionally, its Undead Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to act continuously without the need for rest. The Water Siphon ability grants it an advantage against creatures associated with magical water, while also imposing disadvantages on their saving throws against its attacks, making it particularly dangerous in such scenarios.

In terms of actions, the Edimmu can perform a Multiattack, making two Draining Touch attacks. If both attacks hit the same target that is not a Construct or Undead, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid gaining one level of exhaustion. Should the creature fail this check by 5 or more, it is also stunned until the end of its next turn, which can significantly hinder the target's effectiveness in combat. The Draining Touch attack itself is a melee spell attack that is resolved with a +6 to hit, allowing it to strike effectively. On a successful hit, it inflicts 13 necrotic damage. The target must then make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer a reduction in its maximum hit points equal to the damage taken, lasting until the creature finishes a long rest after consuming water. If this adjustment reduces the maximum hit points to zero, the target dies, making this ability particularly lethal against unwary adventurers.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Incorporeal Movement:** The edimmu can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Rejuvenation:** If destroyed, an edimmu rises again in 2d4 days, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. When the edimmu rises, it appears within 5 feet of its remains. Only burying its mortal remains in consecrated or hallowed ground prevents this trait from functioning.
- **Undead Nature:** The edimmu doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Water Siphon:** The edimmu has advantage on attack rolls against creatures made of or gaining power from magical water, such as water elementals, water jinnborn, water genies, and sorcerers with water-based origins. In addition, such creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw against the edimmu’s Draining Touch and Multiattack.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The edimmu makes two Draining Touch attacks. If both attacks hit one creature that isn’t a Construct or Undead, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is also stunned until the end of its next turn.
- **Draining Touch:** Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after drinking 1 pint of water. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
