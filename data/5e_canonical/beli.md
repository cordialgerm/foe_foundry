<summary>The Beli is a small, neutral evil fey creature known for its cunning and agility. With a robust defensive capability, reflected in its Armor Class of 15 and 45 hit points, it poses a notable challenge for adventurers rated at a challenge level of 2. The Beli excels with its flying ability, allowing it to maneuver swiftly in combat, and its special abilities that enhance its survivability in cold environments significantly contribute to its role as a cunning predator. However, despite its strengths, it is vulnerable to fire, which can negate its regenerative abilities. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of ability scores, the Beli has a Strength of 11, which is average, a Dexterity of 16 that is considered very good, and a Constitution of 12, which is also average. Its Intelligence score of 8 is below average, while its Wisdom is neutral at 11, and its Charisma is good at 14. The Beli is particularly skilled in Dexterity saving throws, with a modifier of +5, and it possesses additional skills in Perception at +4 and Stealth at +5, making it adept at both avoiding detection and observing its surroundings. Its damage vulnerabilities include fire, which means it takes extra damage from those types of attacks, and it is immune to cold damage. It also has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 14, enabling it to see in the dark and be aware of its surroundings even without direct observation. The Beli can communicate in Common, Dwarvish, and Giant.

The Beli has several special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in various environments. The Arctic Hunter ability grants it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks for hiding in snowy terrain and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve sight in the same terrain, making it exceptionally efficient in icy conditions. Its Cold Regeneration allows it to regain 3 hit points at the beginning of its turn while in subfreezing temperatures, but it becomes inactive if the Beli takes fire damage. This ability also establishes a unique condition for its death; it will only die if it starts a turn with 0 hp in an area where it cannot regenerate. The Flyby feature allows the Beli to move without provoking opportunity attacks, providing an advantage in positioning and avoiding counterattacks.

In terms of actions, the Beli can make an Ice Dagger melee attack with a +5 to hit, dealing 5 piercing damage alongside an additional 5 cold damage on a hit. For ranged combat, its Icy Shortbow attack also has a +5 to hit. It has a range of 80 feet, with a maximum range of 320 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage plus 5 cold damage. Notably, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion from the chilling effect of the arrow. Successful saves grant temporary immunity from further exhaustion effects from this source for 24 hours. A critical effect occurs if a creature reaches the sixth level of exhaustion as a result of this attack, which will reduce its hit points to 0 instead, forcing it to make death saving throws. Lastly, the Beli can utilize the Invisibility spell, enabling it to vanish from sight until it attacks or loses its concentration, thus allowing it to escape or reposition stealthily.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Arctic Hunter:** The beli has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain. In addition, it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight in snowy terrain.
- **Cold Regeneration:** If it starts its turn in an area with below freezing temperature, the beli regains 3 hp. If the beli takes fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the beli’s next turn. The beli dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and it doesn’t regenerate.

### Actions

- **Ice Dagger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) cold damage.
- **Icy Shortbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion from the arrow’s icy chill. On a success, the target can’t suffer further levels of exhaustion from any beli’s Icy Shortbow for 24 hours. If a creature would suffer a sixth level of exhaustion from this attack, it is reduced to 0 hp instead and must make death saving throws as normal. A creature reduced to 0 hp in this way can’t suffer further levels of exhaustion from any beli’s Icy Shortbow for 24 hours.
- **Invisibility:** The beli magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the beli wears or carries is invisible with it.
