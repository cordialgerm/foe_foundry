<summary>The Muraenid is a large, neutral evil monstrosity that thrives in aquatic environments. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat, totaling 450 experience points for its slayers. This creature has a robust defensive capability due to its natural Armor Class of 14 and a decent pool of Hit Points totaling 45, equating to an average of 7d10+7. Its strengths lie primarily in its physical power and control over both battle and aquatic environments, utilizing Pack Tactics to gain an advantage in combat when allies are nearby. However, it has weaknesses in its low Charisma score, which can hinder social interactions. Notably, the Muraenid's abilities allow for unique interactions with aquatic creatures, making it a proficient controller of its underwater realm.</summary>

<detail>

The Muraenid's attributes include 16 Strength (+3), which denotes exceptional physical power and effectiveness in melee combat, and 14 Dexterity (+2), indicating good agility. Its Constitution score of 12 (+1) provides average resilience to damage. With an Intelligence and Wisdom both at 12 (+1), it possesses average insight and reasoning capabilities, while its low Charisma of 7 (-2) reflects very bad social influence or charm. The Muraenid has a saving throw bonus of +4 to Dexterity checks, indicating good effectiveness at dodging effects that require nimbleness. It has perceptive skills with a +1 bonus, allowing for average awareness of its surroundings.

Among its special abilities, Pack Tactics grants the Muraenid advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one unincapacitated ally is within 5 feet of the target, making it dangerous when it hunts in groups. It can Speak with Aquatic Creatures, enabling it to communicate effectively with aquatic monstrosities and beasts, enhancing its dominance in water. The Water Breathing ability allows it to exist underwater seamlessly, functioning as a natural predator of its domain.

In combat, the Muraenid can take several actions. Its primary attack, Bite, allows it to make a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, targeting a creature within 5 feet. On a successful strike, it deals 14 (2d10+3) piercing damage and grapples the target with an escape DC of 13. While grappling, the Muraenid can only bite the restrained creature and gains advantage on attack rolls against it, making the grappling mechanic essential for its offensive strategy. 

Additionally, the Muraenid can use Telekinetic Grip, targeting one creature within 60 feet, requiring the target to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. If the target fails, it can be moved up to 30 feet in any direction of the Muraenid's choice and becomes restrained until the Muraenid's next turn. This ability can also manipulate inanimate objects up to 300 pounds, making it versatile in both combat and problem-solving scenarios.

Moreover, the Muraenid has the powerful ability Lord of the Fishes, usable once per day. It can attempt to charm a beast with a swimming speed within 30 feet by forcing it to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the beast obeys commands from the Muraenid for up to a day or until it leaves a mile radius, creating an excellent tool for enchanting allies and enhancing the Muraenid’s influence over aquatic domains. If the charmed beast takes damage, it can make a new saving throw to break free from the charm effect.</detail>
