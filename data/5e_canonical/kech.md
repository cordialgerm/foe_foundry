<summary>The Kech is a Medium humanoid creature known for its stealth and grappling capabilities. With a challenge rating of 1, it can provide a decent threat level for low-level adventurers. The Kech's strengths include a good mix of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, all sitting at a +2 modifier, which indicates a solid physical presence and agility. It has access to effective skills such as athletics and stealth, allowing for ambush tactics. Its weaknesses include average intelligence with no bonuses, along with low armor class and health compared to stronger variants, making it vulnerable to concentrated attacks. Notably, the Kech thrives in surprise situations, leveraging its abilities to grapple opponents and deal sustained damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Kech possesses the following ability scores: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 14 (+2), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 10 (+0). These attributes paint a picture of a physically capable opponent lacking in mental prowess. Its Armor Class is 12, which is average and can be overcome by most attackers. With 30 hit points, derived from rolling five eight-sided dice plus eight, it has a fair amount of durability in combat but is not exceptionally resilient.

The Kech is skilled in various areas, with relevant skill modifiers being athletics +4, stealth +4, perception +3, and survival +3. Its darkvision, providing sight in dim conditions up to 60 feet, is an asset during nighttime encounters or in low-light environments. Its passive perception of 15 indicates a good awareness of its surroundings, making it proficient at noticing hidden creatures or disturbances. The languages it understands, Common and Goblin, allow it to communicate effectively with key factions.

In terms of actions, the Kech has several offensive capabilities. 

- **Strangle:** This melee weapon attack has a +4 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. It targets a Medium or smaller creature that is surprised, grappled by the Kech, or unable to see the Kech, inflicting 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. Once grappled, the target is pulled 5 feet closer to the Kech and cannot breathe until the grapple ends, making it a formidable move to incapacitate enemies. The escape DC is 12, which is an average challenge for many creatures to break free.

- **Claw:** The claw attack also grants a +4 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage on a successful hit, providing a straightforward way to inflict damage in close combat.

- **Stealthy Sneak:** This ability allows the Kech to use up to half of its movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks, followed by an attempt to hide. This tactical option enhances its stealth capabilities, allowing for surprise attacks in crucial moments.

In summary, the Kech excels in ambush tactics with its stealth and grappling abilities while being reasonably strong in physical encounters.</detail>
