<summary>A Spy is a highly skilled operative trained in stealth, deception, and infiltration. Often employed by kingdoms, guilds, or secret organizations, Spies gather information, steal secrets, or assassinate key targets without drawing attention to themselves. They are experts at disguises, false identities, and navigating the shadows. In combat, Spies rely on precision strikes with daggers or crossbows, preferring to avoid direct confrontations. Their ability to blend in and escape unnoticed makes them invaluable for covert operations and dangerous opponents when caught off guard.</summary>
