<summary>The Keyhole Dragonette is a tiny, neutral dragon known for its agility and unique abilities. With an Armor Class of 14 and 27 Hit Points, it is a nimble creature that can evade some attacks while delivering its own. Ideal for a low-level encounter, this creature holds a Challenge Rating of 1/2, offering 100 XP upon defeat. Notable for its ability to navigate through tight spaces and require minimal space to move, the dragonette can serve various roles in a party or during combat situations, particularly as a scout due to its good dexterity and stealth skills. However, its intelligence is relatively low, making it less effective in roles that require problem-solving or strategy.</summary>

<detail>

The Keyhole Dragonette has the following attributes. Its Strength is 12 with a modifier of +1, which is considered average for physical attacks, allowing for moderate effectiveness in melee combat. Its Dexterity is 15 with a +2 modifier, which is good, enhancing its ability to avoid attacks and act quickly. The Constitution score is 14 with a +2 modifier, indicating a good resilience to damage. Intelligence is notably low at 7, yielding a -2 modifier, which is very bad for intelligence-based skill checks. Wisdom is average at 10 with no modifier, while Charisma is 13, providing a +1 modifier, which is average but useful in social interactions.

The dragonette possesses a range of skills that further define its capabilities. It has a +2 modifier in Perception, which allows it to notice environmental cues with average efficiency, and a +4 in Stealth, giving it very good sneaking abilities that could be pivotal in ambushes or evasive maneuvers. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and tremorsense to 30 feet, allowing it to detect creatures around it even in dim light or through solid surfaces, contributing to its scouting aptitude. It understands and can communicate in Common and Draconic languages.

The dragonette's special abilities enhance its versatility. The ability "Compress" allows it to squeeze through spaces as narrow as 1 inch, making it exceptionally good at infiltrating tight locations. "Leaping Withdraw" enables the dragonette to jump distances of up to 20 feet long and 10 feet high without provoking opportunity attacks, making it highly mobile during combat. The "Tongue Pick" ability empowers the dragonette to pick locks and disarm traps, utilizing its tongue effectively as a set of thieves' tools, which adds considerable utility outside of combat. The "Vermin Hunter" ability indicates that its attacks are effective against swarms, ignoring their usual resistance to piercing and slashing damage. Additionally, it can use the "Scale Slash" ability against swarms as a bonus action while occupying the same space.

In terms of actions, the Keyhole Dragonette can perform a melee attack with its bite, which has a +4 to hit and deals an average of 5 piercing damage on a successful hit. It also has the "Scale Slash" attack, similarly with a +4 to hit, delivering 4 slashing damage. Its "Soporific Breath" ability allows the dragonette to exhale a cloud of sleep gas in a 15-foot cone, with affected creatures needing to succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw to avoid falling unconscious for up to one minute. This can significantly alter combat dynamics, incapacitating enemies but also requiring careful positioning to avoid affecting allies. Overall, the Keyhole Dragonette offers a mix of combat and utility showcasing its distinctive characteristics in various scenarios.</detail>
