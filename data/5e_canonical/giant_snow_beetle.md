<summary>The Giant Snow Beetle is a large, unaligned beast that serves as a formidable opponent in cold environments. Its notable characteristics include good mobility and the ability to utilize its environment effectively through its special abilities. With an armor class of 12, it has decent defense due to its natural armor, while its 45 hit points provide it with enough durability for sustained combat. The creature is particularly strong in strength, possessing a strength score of 17 which results in a +3 modifier, categorizing this modifier as good. However, its intelligence and charisma scores are exceptionally low, reflecting its nature as a beast. The Giant Snow Beetle's challenge rating of 1 suggests it is an appropriate encounter for lower-level adventurers, providing 200 experience points upon defeat.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Giant Snow Beetle has the following values: Strength (17, +3), Dexterity (10, +0), Constitution (14, +2), Intelligence (1, -5), Wisdom (10, +0), and Charisma (4, -3). The modifiers for these attributes can be evaluated as follows: Strength (+3 - good), Dexterity (+0 - average), Constitution (+2 - average), Intelligence (-5 - very bad), Wisdom (+0 - average), and Charisma (-3 - bad). This distribution makes the beetle a strong physical opponent but very weak mentally and socially.

The Giant Snow Beetle has several important special abilities. Its *Snowball Concealment* allows it to have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide if it is within 10 feet of a Large or larger snowball. This means it can effectively evade detection, even when clearly visible. Additionally, its *Snowball Roll* ability allows the creature to spend 1 minute rolling up a snowball the size of itself, which can be utilized for its other actions.

When it comes to actions, the Giant Snow Beetle has a melee attack: *Pincer*. This attack has a +5 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and deals 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. Its other two actions utilize the snowballs it can create. The *Rotten Snowball Shove* (which recharges on a roll of 6) allows the beetle to throw a snowball filled with carrion at a point 20 feet away. Creatures within a 5-foot radius must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and the poisoned condition for 1 minute. Success grants half damage and no poisoning. A poisoned creature can attempt to end the effect on their own at the end of their turns by succeeding on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The other snowball ability, *Snowball Shove*, allows the Giant Snow Beetle to toss a standard snowball at a point within 20 feet, requiring the same DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. In this case, failure results in 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone, while success results in half damage and no prone condition. 

Overall, the Giant Snow Beetle's combination of strength, environmental camouflage, snowball attacks, and poison abilities makes it a versatile threat within its habitat.</detail>
