It has skills that include Perception at +2, which is average, and Stealth at +2, also average.

This ability can be used once every six rounds and allows the Wyrmling to unleash a blast of warped arcane energy in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature within that line must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 11. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 force damage (rolled as 5d8), or half as much on a successful save. This ability adds a strong area-of-effect damage capability, making the Wasteland Dragon Wyrmling a dangerous opponent capable of affecting multiple characters at once.
