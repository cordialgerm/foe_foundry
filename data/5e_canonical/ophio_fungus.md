<summary>The Ophio Fungus is a large and powerful plant creature that poses a unique threat to adventurers in its vicinity. As a plant unaligned in nature, it does not follow moral guidance, making it unpredictable in its actions. With an Armor Class of 14 and 119 hit points, it is reasonably durable in combat, although its movement speed is limited to just 10 feet. The fungus is particularly effective at charming foes and releasing spores to inflict damage, making its strategy revolve around control and debilitation rather than direct confrontation. Its damage vulnerabilities to fire and resistance to common physical attacks make it a tricky opponent to engage in melee. Characters engaging with this creature should be wary of its potent special abilities and the effects of its spores.</summary>

<detail>

The Ophio Fungus has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 10 (+0), which is average and indicates it has no notable physical prowess.
- Dexterity: 6 (-2), which is bad, suggesting it lacks agility and will likely suffer in situations requiring dexterous movement.
- Constitution: 14 (+2), which is good, providing it a fair amount of resilience against physical damage.
- Intelligence: 20 (+5), which is exceptional, indicating it possesses a high level of awareness and ability to strategize.
- Wisdom: 17 (+3), which is good, reflecting its perceptive nature and ability to sense its surroundings.
- Charisma: 17 (+3), also good, showing its capability to influence and charm other creatures.

The Ophio Fungus has several special abilities. The first is called Hypnotic Secretion. When a creature begins its turn within 30 feet of the fungus, it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become charmed for one hour. While charmed, the creature views the fungus as a friendly ally. If the fungus or its allies harm the charmed creature, the charm effect ends immediately. Additionally, if the charm lasts the full hour, the creature becomes infected with ophio spores. Alternatively, if the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it gains immunity against the Hypnotic Secretion for the next 24 hours. Creatures that do not require breathing cannot be affected by this ability, though others can be charmed even while holding their breath.

In terms of actions, the Ophio Fungus can release spores, targeting up to three creatures within 30 feet. Each affected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in taking 14 (4d6) poison damage and, if the creature is a humanoid, it becomes infected with ophio spores. A successful saving throw reduces the damage by half and prevents the additional spore infection. Creatures that do not need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw, while those that do can still fall prey to the attack even if holding their breath. 

Overall, the Ophio Fungus is a complex adversary that leverages its abilities to control and damage opponents effectively. Adventurers should prepare accordingly to avoid being charmed and poisoned by its potent spores.</detail>

If a creature stays charmed for the full hour, it becomes infected with ophio spores. If the creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the ophio fungus’ Hypnotic Secretion for the next 24 hours. A creature that doesn’t need to breathe is immune to the fungus’ Hypnotic Secretion. A creature that does need to breathe can still be affected, even if it holds its breath.

### Actions

- **Release Spores:** The ophio fungus focuses its spores on up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and, if it is a humanoid, it becomes infected with ophio spores. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t infected with spores. A creature that doesn’t need to breathe automatically succeeds on this saving throw. A creature that does need to breathe can still be affected, even if it holds its breath.
