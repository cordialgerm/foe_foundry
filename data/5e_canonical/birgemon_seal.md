<summary>The Birgemon Seal is a medium aberration that operates independently, presenting both a physical challenge and a unique environmental advantage in snow or ice. With an armor class of 12, it has average durability, complemented by a solid pool of 60 hit points, making it fairly resilient for its challenge rating of 2. The creature excels in underwater navigation with a swim speed of 60 feet, while its land speed is limited to 20 feet. Notably, the Birgemon Seal has moderate ability scores, particularly strong in Constitution and Dexterity, which bolster its survivability and agility in combat. Its primary weaknesses lie in its low Intelligence and Charisma, rendering it less effective in roles that rely on mental acuity or social interaction.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Birgemon Seal are as follows: it has a Strength score of 12 with a modifier of +1, which is considered average, a Dexterity score of 15 with a +2 modifier, classified as good, a Constitution of 16 with a +3 modifier, rated as very good, a low Intelligence of 4 with a -3 modifier, noted as very bad, a Wisdom of 12 granting a +1 modifier, regarded as average, and a Charisma of 9 with a -1 modifier, labeled as bad. The creature possesses a perception skill at +1, indicative of average awareness, and it has damage resistances against acid and cold, providing notable durability against specific elemental attacks. The Birgemon Seal can also see in the dark up to 60 feet and has a passive perception score of 13.

The special abilities of the Birgemon Seal include "Frozen to the Spot" which allows it to remain immobile on snow or ice against its will, creating tactical advantages in frigid environments. Additionally, it has the ability to "Hold Breath," which enables it to stay submerged for up to 90 minutes, a significant advantage during aquatic encounters.

In combat, the Birgemon Seal can utilize multiattack, allowing it to make one bite attack, one attack with its Toothy Maw, and up to three Tendril attacks. The Bite attack has a +4 to hit and deals an average of 7 piercing damage, while the Toothy Maw attack also has a +4 to hit but inflicts more, averaging 9 damage. The Tendril attack allows it to grapple medium or smaller creatures on a successful hit, making it relatively dangerous by immobilizing opponents, especially when leveraging the effects of multiple Tendril attacks to restrain foes. The "Reel" ability permits the Birgemon Seal to pull grappled creatures up to 10 feet closer to it, allowing for positioning and control during battles.

As a bonus action, the Birgemon Seal can execute an "Ice Slide," allowing it to glide up to 40 feet after moving at least 10 feet in a straight line on snow or ice. This ability not only enhances its mobility but can also be used strategically to position itself effectively in combat.</detail>
