<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Holler Spider is a tiny beast known for its chaotic neutral alignment, making it unpredictable and capable of surprising encounters. With an Armor Class of 12, it can withstand some minor attacks, and its 14 hit points (calculated as 4d4 plus 4) allow it to endure a few rounds of combat. Its climbing speed of 25 feet and walking speed of 25 feet provide versatility in movement, allowing it to navigate various terrains effectively. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/4, representing its relatively low threat level, granting 50 experience points for defeated foes. Despite its low Strength score of 7, which gives it a very bad modifier of -2 for physical attacks, the Holler Spider excels in Dexterity with a score of 15 and a good +2 modifier, enhancing its agility and stealth abilities. It also possesses above-average Wisdom (14) and exceptional perception skills, allowing it to be an effective ambush predator.</summary>

The Holler Spider has advantageous abilities that complement its stealthy nature. Its Spider Climb ability allows it to move seamlessly across difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without any checks, making it a formidable climber in its environment. The Vigilant trait enables the spider to capitalize on stillness; after remaining motionless for a minute, the spider gains advantage on both Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks, enhancing its observational and sneaking capabilities.

In combat scenarios, the Holler Spider employs its Bite action, which is a melee attack that has a +4 to hit. When it successfully lands a hit, it inflicts 4 piercing damage (1d4 plus 2). Its Hoot action allows it to perform a ranged attack targeting a single creature within a 20 to 60-foot range. This attack also has a +4 to hit and deals 5 thunder damage (1d6 plus 2). If the Holler Spider lands a critical hit with this ability, the target is pushed back 5 feet, making positioning on the battlefield crucial.

One of its notable special abilities, Distressed Discharge, recharges on a 5 or 6. When activated, the spider emits a cacophony in a 15-foot cone, forcing creatures in the area to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 5 thunder damage (2d4), while success results in taking half that damage. The Holler Spider is then pushed 15 feet in the opposite direction of the cone, which can influence its positioning during combat.

Finally, the Holler Spider has a reaction ability called Sound Alarm. This ability allows the spider to detect creatures within a 60-foot radius and emit a loud hoot that can be heard up to 300 feet away. This alarm continues until the creature moves out of range, it is soothed by its handler, or the spider chooses to end it, providing a valuable warning system for allies.</detail>
