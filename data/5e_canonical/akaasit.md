<summary>The Akaasit is a formidable medium-sized construct that operates independently and lacks alignment, making it an unpredictable opponent in combat. With a solid armor class of 15 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 91, the Akaasit can endure considerable damage. It possesses a challenge rating of 6, making it suitable for mid-level adventurers seeking a challenging encounter. The creature's primary strengths lie in its agility—boasting a dexterity score of 18 for very good agility—along with its innate defenses, which grant it resistance to several damage types and immunities to various conditions. However, it has a dismal intelligence and charisma score, which translates to average understanding and social interaction capabilities. The Akaasit excels in combat with its swift movements and powerful blade attacks, but its weaknesses lie primarily in its low hit point recovery and vulnerability to mental effects if it fails to succeed on saving throws.</summary>

<detail>

The Akaasit has the following attributes and abilities:
- Strength: 13, which provides it an average ability to engage in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity: 18, giving it a very good modifier of +4 which enhances its initiative and makes it a highly evasive target.
- Constitution: 14, resulting in a good +2 modifier that aids in maintaining its hit points.
- Intelligence: 3, leading to a very bad -4 modifier, demonstrating its poor ability to understand or engage in complex reasoning.
- Wisdom: 10, with an average modifier of +0, indicating basic awareness but no exceptional insight.
- Charisma: 5, yielding a very bad -3 modifier, highlighting its lack of social skills or influence.

The Akaasit has the following special abilities:
- Immutable Form: This ability provides the Akaasit with immunity to any spell or effect that would alter its form, keeping it in its original construct shape throughout encounters.
- Unfixed in Time: The Akaasit can flicker in and out of time, granting attackers disadvantage on their attack rolls against it. However, this ability ceases if it is hit by an attack until the start of its next turn.
- Magic Resistance: It possesses advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, increasing its chances of resisting harmful magic.

In terms of combat actions, the Akaasit can perform the following:
- Multiattack: The Akaasit is capable of making two melee weapon attacks using its arm blades in a single turn, enhancing its damage output significantly.
- Arm Blade: The Akaasit can make a melee attack with its blade, rolling +7 to hit and reaching a target up to 5 feet away. Each successful hit inflicts 13 slashing damage plus an additional 3 force damage, combining to deal substantial harm.

Additionally, the Akaasit has a reaction known as:
- Time-Assisted Counterattack: This ability allows the Akaasit to anticipate incoming attacks from creatures within 5 feet, enabling it to make a single arm blade attack before the attacking creature’s action resolves. If this attack reduces the opponent to 0 hit points, the creature's attack is nullified, further demonstrating the Akaasit’s tactical advantage in combat.

With its potent combination of speed, resistance to magic, and offensive capabilities, the Akaasit serves as a dangerous adversary for adventurers who draw near.</detail>
