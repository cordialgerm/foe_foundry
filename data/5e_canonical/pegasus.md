<summary>A Pegasus is a magnificent, winged horse known for its grace and beauty. These celestial creatures are often associated with good-aligned deities and are seen as symbols of freedom and purity. Pegasi are incredibly fast fliers, capable of soaring through the skies with incredible speed and agility. They are intelligent and noble beings, sometimes allowing virtuous mortals to ride them in battle or on quests. Pegasi are highly sought after as mounts due to their ability to travel great distances quickly and their loyalty to those they trust.</summary>

<summary>The Pegasus is a celestial creature known for its majestic appearance, characterized by its large, horse-like frame and magnificent wings. As a creature of good alignment, the Pegasus serves as both a noble mount and a protector of the realms. With a respectable challenge rating of 2, it presents a moderate threat in combat while also offering significant utility to those fortunate enough to bond with it. The creature's strengths lie in its high mobility, both on the ground and in the air, due to its walking speed of 60 feet and flying speed of 80 feet. Additionally, it boasts strong physical attributes with high Strength and Constitution scores, making it durable and effective in melee combat. However, it has a relatively average intelligence score, limiting its tactical abilities. The Pegasus excels in providing support to its rider, reflecting its nature as a divine being.</summary>

<detail>

The Pegasus has an Armor Class of 13, which is average, and a total of 57 hit points, derived from rolling six ten-sided dice plus a Constitution modifier of 24, indicating good durability in battle. Its Strength score is 18, providing a modifier of +4, making its attacks quite powerful. The Dexterity score is 16, resulting in a +3 modifier which contributes to its excellent flying capabilities. The Constitution score reinforces its resilience with a +4 modifier, while its Intelligence at 10 offers a very bad modifier of +0, limiting its use of problem-solving strategies. The Wisdom score of 14 provides a good +2 modifier for perception checks and other wisdom-related abilities. Lastly, a Charisma score of 12 gives it an average +1 modifier, enhancing its presence in interactions.

In terms of saving throws, the Pegasus has a +5 modifier in Dexterity, a +4 in Wisdom, and a +3 in Charisma. These modifiers indicate that it will perform well in avoiding magical effects or traps, as well as resisting charms or mental effects. With a passive perception of 17, thanks to its +4 proficiency in perception, it can reliably detect hidden foes or ambushes.

The Pegasus has two notable special abilities. The first is its "Good" aura, which signifies its alignment and may have effects on other creatures' behavior towards it. The second ability, "Divine Mount," allows a willing Pegasus to bond with a rider during a short rest. This bond is advantageous as it nullifies penalties typically associated with riding without a saddle. Moreover, if both the Pegasus and its rider are forced to make saving throws, the Pegasus automatically succeeds if the rider's roll is successful, reflecting the synergy of their partnership. If the Pegasus forms a new bond with a different rider, the previous one will no longer benefit from this ability.

In terms of actions, the Pegasus can perform a melee attack using its "Hooves." This attack has a +6 to hit, making it effective against most foes. The reach of this attack is 5 feet, and on a hit, it deals an impressive 11 bludgeoning damage, calculated as 2d6 plus its Strength modifier of +4. Additionally, if the Pegasus moves at least 20 feet toward a target before the attack and successfully strikes a Large or smaller creature, that creature must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. Failure results in the target falling prone, potentially giving the Pegasus and its allies a tactical advantage in combat.

The Pegasus is a majestic and powerful celestial creature that plays the role of both a steed and a guardian. With an impressive flying speed and the ability to deal notable bludgeoning damage with its hooves, the Pegasus serves as an excellent means of transportation as well as a formidable combatant. It possesses several strengths, including resistance to radiant damage, advantage on saving throws against spells, and magical attacks that can bypass typical defenses. While its Armor Class is relatively low, making it somewhat vulnerable to attacks, its abilities allow it to excel in mobility and support, particularly in situations where its rider needs protection.

In terms of attributes, the Pegasus has the following scores: Strength is +4 (good), Dexterity is +2 (average), Constitution is +3 (good), Intelligence is +0 (very bad), Wisdom is +2 (average), and Charisma is +1 (bad). This combination makes the Pegasus a strong physical combatant with good durability, while its mental attributes lag behind.

The special abilities of the Pegasus enhance its combat effectiveness and survivability. "Celestial Resilience" grants the Pegasus resistance to radiant damage, meaning any damage it takes from radiant sources is halved. "Diving Pounce" allows the Pegasus to execute a powerful attack after flying down toward a target, requiring that target to succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone. If the target does fall prone, the Pegasus can then make an additional attack as a bonus action, significantly increasing its offensive potential. With "Magic Resistance," the Pegasus has advantage on saving throws against spells, making it highly resilient against magical attacks. Finally, "Magic Weapons" ensures that its weapon attacks are treated as magical, effectively overcoming resistance properties enemies might possess.

When it comes to actions, the Pegasus can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two melee attacks with its hooves during its turn. Each of these "Hooves" attacks has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit, which is quite substantial for a creature of its Challenge Rating.

The Pegasus also has an interesting reaction called "Catch Rider." If its rider fails a check or saving throw to stay mounted, or is subjected to a dismounting effect, the Pegasus can use this reaction to shift and catch the falling rider, effectively preventing them from being dismounted. This ability showcases the Pegasus's loyalty and protective nature toward its rider.

Overall, the Pegasus embodies both grace and power, providing valuable support and combat prowess while also offering unique protective capabilities for its rider in various scenarios.</detail>
