<summary>The Witchlight is a tiny construct that serves as a unique and enchanting creature within the D&D world. With a challenge rating of 1/4, it is considered a minor threat, but its abilities can present interesting challenges for unprepared adventurers. It boasts a moderate Armor Class of 12, ensuring it has decent protection against attacks, but with only 20 hit points, it remains quite fragile. Its speed of 40 feet allows for agile movement on the battlefield. One notable aspect of the Witchlight is its immunity to various damage types, including poison, psychic, and radiant, along with its resilience to many conditions that can hinder other creatures. However, it is susceptible to antimagic effects, which can incapacitate it readily.</summary>

<detail>

The Witchlight has the following ability scores: Strength of 1 (-5 modifier, very bad), Dexterity of 14 (+2 modifier, good), Constitution of 10 (+0 modifier, average), Intelligence of 10 (+0 modifier, average), Wisdom of 15 (+2 modifier, good), and Charisma of 7 (-2 modifier, bad). It has a +4 bonus to Perception checks, allowing it to be quite perceptive in various situations. 

In terms of damage immunities, the Witchlight is immune to poison, psychic, and radiant damage, making it difficult to affect with certain types of attacks. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as being blinded, charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, or prone, which makes it a resilient adversary in many scenarios. Its senses include darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive perception of 14, assisting it in detecting threats even in low-light conditions. The Witchlight understands languages spoken by its creator but is unable to communicate verbally.

The Witchlight has several special abilities that define its role in gameplay. Its "Antimagic Susceptibility" means that while in an antimagic field, it becomes incapacitated. Furthermore, if hit by the spell "dispel magic," it must make a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC; failure results in unconsciousness for one minute. The "Construct Nature" ability allows the Witchlight to exist without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep, emphasizing its artificial nature. The "Variable Illumination" ability allows the Witchlight to shed bright light within a specific radius between 5 and 20 feet, and it can adjust this radius as a bonus action, adding a strategic layer to its gameplay.

In terms of actions, the Witchlight has a "Light Blast" attack that can be executed either as a melee or a ranged spell attack. With a +4 to hit and a range of 30 feet, it can deal 5 (1d6 + 2) radiant damage to a single target. Additionally, it has the "Flash" ability, which can be used three times per day. This ability allows the Witchlight to emit a bright burst of light, forcing each creature within 20 feet to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they become blinded for one minute, although they can attempt a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect on themselves if successful. This ability can greatly affect combat dynamics, especially in encounters involving multiple opponents.</detail>
