The Vila has the following ability scores: Strength of 12 (+1) indicates average physical power; Dexterity of 20 (+5) is exceptional, giving it superior agility; Constitution of 13 (+1) is average, providing decent resilience; Intelligence of 11 (+0) is average and contributes minimally to its combat strategy; Wisdom of 14 (+2) is good, which enhances its perceptive abilities; and Charisma of 16 (+3) is very good, indicating its strong presence. For saving throws, it possesses a Constitution modifier of +4, a Wisdom modifier of +5, and a Charisma modifier of +6, all of which indicate very good resilience against various effects.

In terms of skills, the Vila has a remarkable proficiency in Animal Handling (+8), Insight (+5), Intimidation (+6), Perception (+8), and Stealth (+8), allowing it to excel in interactions with animals and its surroundings. Furthermore, it has damage resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, which enhances its survivability in combat. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception score of 18, making it particularly aware of its environment. The Vila can communicate in Common and Sylvan languages and possesses unique special abilities that bolster its effectiveness.

The Vila's special abilities include Forest’s Defender, which allows it to traverse nonmagical plants without restriction and grants it advantage on initiative rolls while in forested terrain. Its Poisoned Weapons ability means that whenever it strikes with its weapon, it deals an additional 2d6 poison damage, greatly increasing its damage output. The Speak with Beasts ability enables it to communicate directly with creatures of the animal kingdom, giving it a unique role in managing wildlife interactions.

When engaging in combat, the Vila can use Multiattack, which involves deploying its Song of the Forest and then making two attacks using either its Shortsword or Shortbow. The Shortsword has an attack bonus of +8 and can deal 8 piercing damage plus an additional 7 poison damage, while the Shortbow also benefits from the same attack bonus and damage output at a range of 80/320 feet. The Song of the Forest can affect up to three creatures within 30 feet, requiring them to pass a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or suffer negative effects determined by the song. Additionally, the Vila can use Denizens of the Wilds once per day to magically summon 1d4 wolves or 1 wampus cat to fight alongside it, with these summoned beasts staying for up to an hour. This combination of abilities allows the Vila to manipulate both the environment and any potential allies to gain an advantage in combat.</detail>
