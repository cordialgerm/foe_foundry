Its Intelligence score is 13, yielding a +1 modifier, which is average in terms of tactical thinking.

The claw attacks also have a +8 to hit but a smaller reach of 5 feet, applying 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage upon hitting. Its signature ability, Cinder Breath, can be unleashed every 5 to 6 rounds. The dragon exhales a 30-foot cone of superheated air filled with white-hot embers, requiring creatures in the area to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A failure results in 33 (6d10) fire damage, while a successful save reduces the damage to half. This ability can significantly affect the battlefield, allowing the dragon to deal high damage to multiple enemies simultaneously, thus demonstrating its power as a combatant.</detail>
