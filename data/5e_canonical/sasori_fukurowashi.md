Notably, the creature’s abilities include high Dexterity and Wisdom scores, providing it with exceptional stealth and perception capabilities, making it difficult to detect and formidable in both combat and exploration scenarios.

<detail>

The attributes of the Sasori Fukurowashi are as follows: for Strength, it has a score of 17 with a modifier of +3, which is good for physical tasks; Dexterity is at 19 with a modifier of +4, representing very good agility; Constitution is 15 with a +2 modifier, which is average; Intelligence is 11, yielding a modifier of +0, meaning it has average mental acuity; Wisdom is impressive at 21 with a +5 modifier, which is exceptional for insight and perception; and Charisma is 19 with a +4 modifier, also considered very good for social interactions.

In terms of game mechanics, the Sasori Fukurowashi has advantageous saving throws, gaining +8 on Dexterity checks and +9 on Wisdom checks. The creature is skilled in perception, receiving a +9 modifier, which is very good, and +8 in stealth, also very good. It has complete immunity to poison damage, making it resistant against any similar attacks. Additionally, it resists damage from acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. The condition immunities to exhaustion and being poisoned further enhance its survival capabilities. With truesight up to 60 feet and passive Perception of 19, it can detect invisible creatures and objects, providing a tactical edge.

The Sasori Fukurowashi employs several special abilities in combat: Ethereal Jaunt allows it to shift between the Material and Ethereal Planes using a bonus action, granting it excellent mobility; Flyby enables it to leave a threatened area without provoking opportunity attacks, enhancing its ability to maneuver around enemies; Magic Resistance gives it advantage on saving throws against spells, making it harder to incapacitate with magical effects; and Keen Hearing and Sight grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks based on hearing or sight, ensuring it is always aware of its surroundings.

In combat, the Sasori Fukurowashi can engage in a Multiattack, performing three strikes in a single turn: one with its claws, one with its sting, and one with its talons. The Claw attack is a melee attack with a +8 to hit that allows it to deal 13 points of bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 4) upon a successful hit and grapple the target, which sets an escape DC of 14. It can grapple one target with each claw. The Sting attack is also a melee attack with a +8 to hit, dealing 9 piercing damage (1d10 + 4) and forcing the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw; failure results in an additional 22 poison damage (4d10), while a successful save reduces the damage to half. Lastly, the Talons attack once again features a +8 to hit, dealing 7 slashing damage (1d6 + 4). Each of these attacks demonstrates the Sasori Fukurowashi's versatility in both damage output and control over the battlefield.</detail>
