Its "Fiery Charge" allows the Wanyudo to deal an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage if it charges at least 20 feet in a straight line before biting its target.

Each bite attack is made with a +8 to hit, reaching a target within 5 feet to deal 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage. Its "Flaming Breath," which can be used once it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, enables it to expel fire in a 20-foot cone. Each creature within this area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, resulting in 24 (7d6) fire damage on a failed save or half that amount on a successful one. This area effect can significantly impact multiple targets, showcasing the Wanyudo's lethal presence in combat.</detail>
