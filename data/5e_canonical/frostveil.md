<summary>The Frostveil is a Medium-sized, unaligned plant creature that thrives in cold environments. With an Armor Class of 16, it has decent defenses bolstered by natural armor, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage. The Frostveil possesses 67 hit points, which gives it good durability during encounters. This creature has notably high Strength and Dexterity scores of 20, granting it very good capabilities in physical attacks and agility, making it a dangerous opponent in close quarters. However, it has very low Intelligence and Charisma, making it weak in terms of social interaction and mental-based challenges. One of its greatest strengths is its ability to absorb damage through its "Damage Transfer" ability, allowing it to mitigate harm when engulfing opponents. The Frostveil is particularly vulnerable to fire damage and boasts immunity to cold, making it a prime target for fire-based attacks. It can navigate both on land and in the air, with the flexibility provided by its speed varying depending on environmental conditions.</summary>

<detail>

The Frostveil possesses several notable special abilities. Its "Chilling Acidic Body" punishes creatures that come into contact with it, dealing acid damage to attackers at close range. In addition, while it engulfs a creature, it only receives half of the damage dealt to it, showcasing its resilience during confrontations as it does substantial damage to the engulfed target. Its "False Appearance" ability allows it to camouflage among frost and ice, making it difficult for enemies to detect until it moves or attacks. Furthermore, the Frostveil can increase its flying speed in windy conditions, reaching up to 60 feet in strong winds, enhancing its mobility in combat.

In terms of combat actions, the Frostveil can perform a "Multiattack," making two melee Frozen Tendril attacks capable of grappling Medium or smaller creatures. The Frozen Tendril attack itself has a +7 to hit and delivers bludgeoning and cold damage on a successful hit. If it grapples a target, it can utilize its "Snowy Engulf" ability, causing severe penalties, including blinding and restraining the engulfed creature while inflicting damage over time. Finally, the Frostveil can activate its "Spirit Spores" ability, releasing a cloud of spores that can incapacitate nearby foes with cold damage. Victims must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or risk becoming incapacitated and losing control of their movements, increasing their vulnerability during battle. This combination of defensive and offensive capabilities makes the Frostveil a formidable adversary in a variety of combat scenarios.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Chilling Acidic Body:** A creature that touches the frostveil or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage.

- **Windborne:** In windy conditions, the frostveil’s flying speed increases to 30 feet. In a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour), its flying speed increases to 60 feet.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The frostveil makes two Frozen Tendril attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 15), and the frostveil uses Snowy Engulf on it.
- **Frozen Tendril:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.
- **Snowy Engulf:** The frostveil engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded and restrained, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the frostveil’s turns or take 4 (1d8) acid damage and 3 (1d6) cold damage. If the frostveil moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The frostveil can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
- **Spirit Spores (Recharge 6):** The frostveil releases a puff of psychotropic spores around itself. Each creature within 10 feet of the frostveil must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) cold damage and is incapacitated for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t incapacitated. When an incapacitated creature moves, it moves in a random direction. An incapacitated creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
