<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Caustic Charger is a huge monstrosity that serves as a formidable opponent in combat, boasting high hit points and effective damage output. With a challenge rating of 7, it poses a significant threat to adventurers who are unprepared for its abilities. The creature has a strong physical presence, with a Strength score of 19, granting it a good melee attack modifier of +7 to hit. However, its Dexterity and Charisma scores are average to bad, indicating a lack of finesse and social prowess. The Caustic Charger is immune to acid damage, making it resistant to any attacks of that nature, while its burrowing speed allows it to maneuver effectively through terrain. It possesses unique abilities that enhance its role in combat, particularly in disrupting enemy positioning and inflicting debilitating effects through its Tentacles attack.</summary>

<detail>

The Caustic Charger has an Armor Class of 15, which is average for its challenge rating, and it has 133 hit points, derived from rolling 14d12, with an additional 42 added. This makes it relatively durable during encounters. It can walk 10 feet normally and burrow up to 30 feet, allowing for flexible mobility options on the battlefield.

The creature's attributes include a Strength of 19 (+4 modifier, which is good), Dexterity of 11 (+0, average), Constitution of 16 (+3, good), Intelligence of 4 (-3, very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0, average), and Charisma of 6 (-2, very bad). Its skills are not specified, but it has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 10, enabling basic sensory awareness in low-light conditions. It does not speak any languages.

The Caustic Charger has two special abilities: 

1. **Straddler:** This allows the Charger to occupy the space of a prone creature, thereby affecting movement dynamics when enemies attempt to stand up. If a creature stands from prone within the same space, it can only move 5 feet as part of that action, potentially limiting its options.

2. **Wastes Walk:** This ability grants the Charger normal movement through difficult terrain made of rocks or sand, meaning it does not have to expend extra movement points to traverse such areas. This is a good benefit that enhances its strategic positioning ability.

In combat, the Caustic Charger can perform a **Multiattack**, making two Ram attacks and optionally replacing one with a Tentacles attack. 

- **Ram:** This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit, reaches 5 feet, and deals an average of 22 bludgeoning damage (4d8 + 4). If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw to avoid being knocked prone; if the Charger moved at least 10 feet toward it beforehand, the target rolls with disadvantage on this saving throw.

- **Tentacles:** Also a melee attack with a +7 to hit and reaching 5 feet, it inflicts 7 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 4) combined with 14 acid damage (4d6). Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute, with the possibility to end this condition through repeated saving throws at the end of their turns. If the target is outside the Charger’s space when attacked, it takes half the acid damage and gains an advantage on its saving throw.

Additionally, the Caustic Charger has a **Bonus Action** called **Slurp.** This action allows it to feed on a creature that is paralyzed from the Tentacles attack. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by half the acid damage dealt, and the Charger regains hit points equal to that amount. This reduction in hit point maximum lasts until the target completes a long rest. If the effect reduces the target's hp maximum to 0, it dies. 

These attributes and abilities create a complex and dangerous creature capable of dominating the battlefield with its unique mechanics, making it a noteworthy adversary for any adventuring party.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Straddler:** The caustic charger can end its move in the space of a prone Large or smaller creature. A creature standing up from prone in the same space as the charger can move to a space within 5 feet of the charger as part of standing up.
- **Wastes Walk:** Difficult terrain composed of rocks or sand doesn’t cost the caustic charger extra movement.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The caustic charger makes two Ram attacks. It can replace one Ram attack with a Tentacles attack.
- **Ram:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the charger moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.
- **Tentacles:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) acid damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the caustic charger attacks a target that is not in the charger’s space, the target takes half the acid damage and has advantage on the saving throw.

### Bonus Actions

- **Slurp:** The caustic charger feeds on a creature paralyzed by its Tentacles attack. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by half the amount of acid damage dealt by the Tentacles attack that caused the paralysis, and the charger regains hp equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
