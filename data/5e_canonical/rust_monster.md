<summary>A Rust Monster is a strange, insect-like creature that feeds on metal. Its antennae can detect and rust metal objects, which it consumes as its primary food source. Rust Monsters are often found in caverns, ruins, or near forges, where they search for discarded weapons, armor, or other metal objects. Though not aggressive towards living creatures, they are highly dangerous to adventurers due to their ability to destroy metal equipment. Their appetite for metal makes them a bane to anyone carrying armor or weapons made of iron or steel.</summary>
