<summary>The Titanoboa is a gargantuan beast that serves as a formidable predator in the wilds, boasting significant physical strength and impressive defenses. With an armor class of 14 due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 232, it can withstand considerable damage before being defeated. Its challenge rating of 12 indicates it presents a considerable challenge for a party of adventurers, and its ability to attack multiple times each round elevates its threat level. Notable strengths include its powerful bite, capable of inflicting piercing damage, as well as its constricting attack that can restrain and incapacitate foes. However, its weaknesses come from its low Dexterity, which hinders its maneuverability and responsiveness in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Titanoboa possesses the following attributes: 
- Strength: 26, offering a +8 modifier, which is exceptional and highlights its brute power.
- Dexterity: 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, which is average and limits its agility.
- Constitution: 20, yielding a +5 modifier, which is very good and contributes to its resilience.
- Intelligence: 3, bringing a -4 modifier, categorized as very bad, denoting its low cognitive capabilities.
- Wisdom: 10, with a +0 modifier, considered average, relating to its perception and senses.
- Charisma: 3, also resulting in a -4 modifier, marked as very bad, indicating its lack of social skills.

For saving throws, it has a +4 modifier in both Dexterity and Wisdom, which is average. It can effectively resist effects that require these attributes but is not exceptionally good at it. Its perception skills grant a +4 modifier, indicating a fair ability to notice details and perceive its surroundings; this translates to a passive perception of 14.

The Titanoboa excels with its special abilities:
- Slither: This ability allows it to maneuver easily through spaces normally restricted to its size unless it has recently consumed a huge creature. This is particularly advantageous for ambushing or escaping tight situations.
- Sparkling Scales: Each turn, if a creature can see the Titanoboa and is within 30 feet, it may be forced to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the creature becomes stunned until the start of its next turn, providing the Titanoboa with opportunities to strike without retaliation.

In combat, the Titanoboa can utilize the following actions:
- Multiattack: It can deliver two Bite attacks or exchange one Bite attack for a Constrict attack, providing it flexibility in dealing damage or controlling opponents.
- Bite: It makes a melee weapon attack with a +12 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 30 piercing damage on a successful hit. This is a strong attack capable of inflicting substantial damage.
- Constrict: As another melee weapon attack, it also uses a +12 to hit with a 15-foot reach. On a hit, it deals 30 bludgeoning damage and grapples the target (with an escape DC of 18), restraining them until the grapple ends. This becomes particularly dangerous against Huge or smaller foes.
- Swallow: If the Titanoboa is grappling a Huge or smaller target, it can use its Bite attack. If successful, the target is swallowed, becoming blinded and restrained, while taking 21 acid damage at the start of each of the Titanoboa's turns. If it takes a large amount of damage from the swallowed creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures.

The Titanoboa embodies the essence of a colossal snake, fusing raw strength with constricting power and a shocking ability to stun foes, making it a true apex predator in its environment.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Slither:** If the titanoboa hasn’t eaten a Huge creature in the last 24 hours, it can easily move through any open large enough for a Large creature, and it can squeeze through any opening large enough for a Medium creature. The titanoboa’s destination must still have suitable room to accommodate its volume.
- **Sparkling Scales:** When a creature that can see the titanoboa starts its turn within 30 feet of the titanoboa and the titanoboa is in bright light, isn’t incapacitated, and can see the creature, the titanoboa can force the creature to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is stunned until the start of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The titanoboa makes two Bite attacks or one Bite attack and one Constrict attack. It can replace one Bite attack with a use of Swallow.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (5d8 + 8) piercing damage.
- **Constrict:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18) if it is a Huge or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the titanoboa can’t Constrict another target.
- **Swallow:** The titanoboa makes one Bite attack against a Huge or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the titanoboa, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the titanoboa’s turns. If the titanoboa takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the titanoboa must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the titanoboa. If the titanoboa dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.
