<summary>The Emerald Dragon Wyrmling is a medium-sized dragon known for its cunning and psionic abilities. In combat, it poses a reasonable challenge with a Challenge Rating of 2, offering 450 XP to those who succeed in defeating it. This dragon has a good Armor Class of 16 and can absorb a total of 45 hit points, making it tough to take down. Its speed allows for versatile movement, with a walking speed of 30 feet, burrowing capabilities at 15 feet, and a flying speed of 50 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in various environments. With moderate physical attributes—strength and dexterity both at a value of 14 (+2)—it exhibits more than average capability in physical confrontations. However, its constitution is slightly lower at 12 (+1), rendering its resilience in prolonged battles only average. The Emerald Dragon Wyrmling excels in deception and stealth, with bonuses of +4 in these skills, and it is resistant to psychic and thunder damage, making it effective against certain damage types. Additionally, it has immunity to being fatigued, granting it an advantage in sustained engagements. </summary>

In the attributes, its intelligence is also rated at 14 (+2), allowing it to utilize strong tactics and strategies in encounters, complemented by a wisdom score of 10 (+0), indicating an average capacity for perception and insight. Charisma is slightly above average at 12 (+1), enhancing its ability to manipulate others through deception.

The dragon's special ability, "Far Thoughts," allows it to be acutely aware of any creature using psionic abilities or communicating telepathically within a vast distance of 100 miles. As an action, it can psionically observe creatures, objects, or locations it knows within that range. While engaged in this observation, it can see, hear, and communicate telepathically but is totally blind and deaf to its physical surroundings. This ability can be maintained indefinitely and can be terminated by the dragon as an action. 

For actions, the Emerald Dragon Wyrmling has a standard melee attack called "Bite," utilizing a +4 modifier to hit, making it a good (average effectiveness) choice in hand-to-hand combat. Upon a successful attack, it deals 13 piercing damage (2d10 + 2) to the target. 

Furthermore, it possesses a formidable area attack known as "Maddening Breath," which can be used every time it rolls a 5 or 6 on a recharge period. It unleashes a powerful scream that creates a 15-foot cone of thunder damage, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in taking 16 thunder damage (3d10), while successful saves yield half damage. This ability adds a strategic layer to combat, allowing the wyrmling to impact multiple foes at once, creating chaos and potentially hindering enemy forces with its formidable sound-based attack.</detail>
