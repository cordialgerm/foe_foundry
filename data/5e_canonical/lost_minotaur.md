<summary>The Lost Minotaur is a large undead creature with a neutral evil alignment, designed to be a formidable opponent in combat. With an armor class of 16 and a notable 114 hit points, it possesses significant durability. Its challenge rating of 8 indicates that it poses a moderate to high threat level, capable of earning 3,900 experience points upon defeat. The creature excels in physical combat, most notably due to its high strength score of 20, which provides it with a +5 modifier that leads to very good attack rolls. However, its low intelligence and charisma scores imply a lack of versatility in social interactions or complex problem-solving, making it reliant on brute strength and its special abilities to dominate in encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Lost Minotaur has the following attributes: Strength is exceptionally strong at 20 (+5), Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), Constitution is good at 18 (+4), Intelligence is very bad at 5 (-3), Wisdom is average at 12 (+1), and Charisma is very bad at 8 (-1). It has saving throw bonuses of +3 to Dexterity and +4 to Wisdom, reflecting good resistance to physical and some mental effects. The minotaur possesses skills in athletics (+8), perception (+4), and survival (+4), with a passive perception score of 14. It is vulnerable to radiant damage but immune to cold and poison damage, and it has resistance to necrotic damage. The minotaur also enjoys a range of condition immunities, making it difficult to control or incapacitate in battle.

The Lost Minotaur has several notable abilities. Its Charge ability allows it to deal an extra 13 (3d8) piercing damage if it moves at least 10 feet straight towards a target before hitting it with a gore attack. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. This ability enhances the creature's offensive potential and increases its chances of controlling the battlefield. The Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that depend on smell, allowing it to detect enemies through scent easily. Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells, ensuring that it can better withstand magical attacks. Finally, Sense Life enables the Lost Minotaur to detect the presence of living creatures within a one-mile radius, giving it an advantage in tracking prey.

In combat, the Lost Minotaur can make a Multiattack, allowing it to strike with two attacks using its Twilight Greataxe or its Gore. The Twilight Greataxe attack has a +8 to hit and deals significant damage, inflicting 18 (2d12 + 5) slashing damage and an additional 9 (2d8) necrotic damage on a hit. The Gore attack, which also has a +8 to hit, deals 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. These powerful attacks, combined with its abilities and resistances, make the Lost Minotaur a challenging adversary for any adventuring party.</detail>
