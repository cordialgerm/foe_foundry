The Uridimmu has several notable special abilities. Its Chaos Mace deals additional damage on a hit, adding an extra 4d8 from either fire, lightning, or radiant sources, which gives it the flexibility to adapt its attack to exploit enemy weaknesses. The Heroic Aura creates a beneficial zone around it, allowing allies to be immune to being charmed or frightened and adding a d4 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws made by friendly creatures within 20 feet of it, thus significantly boosting allies' effectiveness.

In combat, its Multiattack feature enables the Uridimmu to make three attacks in a single turn: one bite and two attacks with its mace. The bite attack has a +11 to hit and deals 19 piercing damage, which is decent damage for a melee attack. The mace attack also has a +11 to hit and deals 13 bludgeoning damage plus 18 additional fire, lightning, or radiant damage based on the Uridimmu's choice during that attack. The Uridimmu can unleash a powerful ability called Heavenly Roar, which can be used after recharging on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability requires targets in a 30-foot cone to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, potentially resulting in 45 thunder damage on a failed save or half that on success. If the target fails by 5 or more, they are frightened for 1 minute. This adds a significant crowd control element to its combat capabilities, especially given that fiends suffer disadvantage on this saving throw. 

Overall, the Uridimmu is an exceptional creature that plays a powerful role in battles, both as a protector of allies and a formidable opponent to enemies.</detail>
