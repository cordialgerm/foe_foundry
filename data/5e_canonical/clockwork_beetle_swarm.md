<summary>The Clockwork Beetle Swarm is a large and unaligned creature formed of numerous mechanical beetles that move and attack as a collective unit. This swarm is notably agile, able to fly and walk effectively, posing a significant threat to its foes with its high damage potential and impressive defenses. With a challenge rating of 3, it can challenge moderately experienced adventurers. It possesses remarkable resistances and immunities that make it hardy in battle, able to bypass many common forms of attack. However, its intelligence and charisma scores are very low, which limits its ability to interact with others and perform intelligent maneuvers outside of combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Clockwork Beetle Swarm has an Armor Class of 14, reflecting its natural armor, making it somewhat difficult to hit but far from impenetrable. It has 52 hit points, calculated using 8d10 plus an additional 8, which overall suggests it can absorb moderate damage before succumbing in combat. The creature's speed is notable, able to walk at 50 feet per round and fly at 30 feet per round, giving it considerable mobility to reposition in battle.

The swarm's attributes reflect its capabilities: it has a Strength score of 8, which is categorized as very bad; a Dexterity score of 16, yielding a good modifier of +3; a Constitution score of 12, which is average; and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 1, 12, and 7 respectively, with the latter two falling into the very bad and bad categories. 

In terms of resistances and immunities, the swarm is immune to poison and psychic damage, making it highly resilient against typical attacks that rely on these types. It also has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, further enhancing its durability in combat. The swarm is immune to a wide range of conditions, including being charmed, paralyzed, or stunned, which are common hindrances in battle. Its senses allow it to see in the dark up to 60 feet, while its passive perception stands at 11, indicating it can detect ambushes and threats reasonably well.

The special abilities of the Clockwork Beetle Swarm enhance its capabilities significantly. Its Construct Nature ability means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to function continuously without the need for sustenance. Magic Resistance provides it an advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it quite resilient against magical attacks. The Swarm ability permits it to occupy the same space as another creature, making it difficult to avoid as it can infiltrate tight areas. However, it cannot regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, limiting its longevity in prolonged engagements.

In combat, the swarm uses its Bites action, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit modifier, considered good. It has a reach of 0 feet, meaning it can only target creatures within its space. A successful hit deals 18 piercing damage on a full hit, or 9 piercing damage if the swarm is at half hit points or fewer. Additionally, it inflicts 3 poison damage on top of its piercing damage, adding an extra layer of potential lethality. Overall, the Clockwork Beetle Swarm presents a formidable foe with unique strengths and significant resilience, making it a dangerous encounter for unsuspecting adventurers.</detail>
