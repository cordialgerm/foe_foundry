<MonsterName/>Roper</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>A Roper is a monstrous, stone-like creature that blends into cavern walls, lying in wait for unsuspecting prey. Its long, rope-like tendrils can extend outwards to grapple and reel in creatures, dragging them towards its maw filled with sharp teeth. Ropers are ambush predators, often lurking in dark caves or underground tunnels, using their camouflage to remain hidden until the perfect moment to strike. Despite their slow movement, their tendrils have an impressive reach, making them highly dangerous to anyone who enters their lair.</summary>
