<summary>The Ancient Black Dragon is a terror of the swamp, with scales so dark they seem to absorb the light around them. Its massive wings create a shadow over the land as it soars through the air, and its breath is a stream of highly corrosive acid. These dragons are twisted and cruel, reveling in tormenting their enemies both physically and psychologically. Their lairs are often in decayed ruins or deep in murky swamps, where they thrive in the putrid, fetid air. The Ancient Black Dragon is a cunning strategist, often enslaving lesser creatures and manipulating them to achieve its dark goals.</summary>

<summary>The Ancient Black Dragon is a powerful and imposing creature, classified as a Gargantuan dragon. With an armor class of 22, it presents a formidable challenge to adventurers, boasting an impressive pool of 367 hit points. This dragon is known for its amphibious nature, allowing it to thrive both in air and underwater, with a speed of 40 feet on land, 80 feet in the air, and 40 feet through water. It has a devastating attack combination, capable of delivering piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage, as well as powerful acid attacks. The Ancient Black Dragon is a cunning ambusher, particularly effective in aquatic environments, where it can utilize its stealth prowess to surprise enemies. Its legendary resistances and spellcasting abilities make it a considerable threat, while its challenge rating of 23 indicates the level of expertise required to defeat this creature. </summary>

<detail>

The dragon's physical attributes are exceptional, with a Strength of 26 (+8 modifier, considered exceptional), Dexterity of 14 (+2 modifier, average), Constitution of 24 (+7 modifier, considered very good), Intelligence of 16 (+3 modifier, good), Wisdom of 14 (+2 modifier, average), and Charisma of 18 (+4 modifier, good). For saving throws, it excels in Constitution with a +14, which is exceptional, and has good bonuses in Charisma (+11) and Wisdom (+9). The dragon has proficiency in skills such as history (+10, good), perception (+9, good), and stealth (+9, good). Notably, it is immune to acid damage, giving it an edge in combat against less prepared opponents. Its senses include blindsight up to 60 feet, darkvision extending 120 feet, and it has a passive perception of 22.

The Ancient Black Dragon possesses several remarkable special abilities. "Ambusher" allows it to have advantage on stealth when submerged and to deal damage while grappling an unseen target. Its "Amphibious" trait grants it the ability to breathe in both air and water. With "Legendary Resistance" (three times per day), the dragon can choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, shedding scales that turn to mud, resulting in a temporary decrease in armor class when uses are depleted. The "Ruthless" ability enables it to make a claw attack after scoring a critical hit, increasing its offensive capabilities significantly. Its "Innate Spellcasting" allows for casting spells without needing material components; its spell save DC is 19, and it can cast powerful spells like fog cloud and insect plague, which can alter the battlefield and affect enemy visibility and movement.

In combat, the Ancient Black Dragon’s "Multiattack" allows it to make one bite attack and two claw attacks, or to use its "Acid Spit" in place of one of its melee attacks. The "Bite" attack, with a +15 to hit and a damage output of 30 piercing plus 9 acid damage, can also grapple (escape DC 23) an opponent, placing them in a vulnerable position. The "Claw" and "Tail" attacks each do 21 damage (both having a +15 to hit), with the tail attack also capable of pushing targets away. "Acid Spit" forces a creature to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, potentially dealing severe damage and inflicting ongoing acid damage on failure. The "Acid Breath," with a recharge of 5-6, unleashes a significant line of acid damage over a wide area, blinding targets that fail their saves.

Additionally, the dragon has a "Tail Attack" reaction, which it can use when targeted by opponents, allowing it to make a retaliatory tail strike. For legendary actions, it can create magical darkness with "Darkness," frighten foes with "Roar," and perform a "Wing Attack," pushing enemies back and knocking them prone, while allowing the dragon to reposition in combat. Overall, the Ancient Black Dragon is a master of both offense and defense with numerous options that can turn the tide of battle in its favor.

The Ancient Black Dragon is a formidable and fearsome creature, known for its immense size and devastating power. This gargantuan dragon is typically found in dark and swampy environments. With an impressive Armor Class of 21, it is well-protected by its natural armor, making it quite difficult for opponents to hit. The dragon boasts a massive pool of Hit Points at 355, allowing it to withstand a significant amount of damage before defeat. Its Challenge Rating of 20 indicates that it poses a serious threat, suitable for high-level adventurers. The Ancient Black Dragon possesses formidable physical and magical abilities, including the ability to deal both piercing and acid damage with its attacks, as well as potent breath attacks that can devastate multiple foes. However, despite its strengths, it has a few weaknesses, such as being vulnerable to certain types of magic and tactics that can exploit its fearsome presence.

In terms of attributes, the Ancient Black Dragon excels in most physical statistics with a Strength modifier of +9, which is very good for melee attacks, a Dexterity modifier of +8, which is good for agility-based actions, and a Constitution modifier of +13, representing its exceptional resilience. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma are also present with modifiers of +3, +9, and +10 respectively, with Wisdom being good for perception checks while Charisma is exceptional, making it potent in any social interactions that involve intimidation or persuasion.

The dragon has various special abilities that enhance its threat level. It is amphibious, allowing it to breathe both air and water. Its Acidic Vapors ability creates a poisonous aura after it uses its Acid Breath, forcing creatures nearby to make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of their next turn. This adds an ongoing area of effect that punishes foes for getting too close. Moreover, with Legendary Resistance available three times a day, the dragon can automatically succeed on saving throws, mitigating its vulnerability against certain spells or effects.

In combat, the Ancient Black Dragon's Multiattack action allows it to initiate its Frightful Presence, attempting to frighten its foes, and then follow up with a Bite attack, which does 20 piercing damage plus 9 acid damage, and two Claw attacks, each dealing 16 slashing damage. Its Bite and Claw attacks' high hit bonuses of +15 ensure that it is likely to land hits on most opponents. The Tail attack, also at +15 to hit, deals 18 bludgeoning damage, further ensuring that it can effectively deal damage from different positions.

The Fear Aura, or Frightful Presence, can incapacitate adventurers by forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) or be frightened for one minute. This adds significant crowd control to its combat tactics, and frightened creatures may struggle to approach or attack the dragon.

Its Acid Breath, which can be used after a recharge of 5 to 6, unleashes a 90-foot line of acid that requires a Dexterity saving throw (DC 21) or face 67 acid damage, with half damage on a successful save. This area effect can decimate enemy ranks, forcing them to spread out or suffer the consequences.

The dragon can also take legendary actions, allowing it to take actions outside its turn. It can detect creatures and traps within 30 feet automatically, make a Tail attack, or use powerful elemental abilities like Elemental Roar, which can make enemies vulnerable to acid damage, or Wing Attack, which knocks enemies prone within reach and allows for tactical repositioning without provoking opportunity attacks.

Finally, the Ancient Black Dragon's presence can alter its surroundings significantly. After its death, various regional effects may fade, depending on how many days it had established its domain, leaving a lasting impact on the environment.</detail>
