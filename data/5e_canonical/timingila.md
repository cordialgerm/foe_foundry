<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Timingila is a gargantuan monstrosity that embodies the nature of chaos and destruction. This creature is neutral evil, thriving in aquatic environments and capable of devastating attacks both in and out of water. With a solid Armor Class of 18, it boasts a substantial pool of hit points totaling 232, making it a challenging adversary for any party. The creature excels in close-quarters combat through its various melee attacks and has the unique capacity to obliterate structures thanks to its Siege Monster ability. While it has exceptional strength indicated by a Strength score of 28, its Dexterity is very poor, reflecting how slow and clumsy it is on land. Being primarily an aquatic creature, its ability to only breathe underwater limits its versatility outside of its oceanic domain.</summary>

<detail>

The Timingila's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 28 (+9) - exceptional modifier. 
- Dexterity: 5 (-3) - very bad modifier. 
- Constitution: 21 (+5) - very good modifier. 
- Intelligence: 8 (-1) - bad modifier. 
- Wisdom: 7 (-2) - bad modifier. 
- Charisma: 14 (+2) - good modifier. 

To withstand assaults, the Timingila has a saving throw proficiency in Constitution (+10, very good) and Wisdom (+3, average). It also has a notable passive Perception score of 18 and skills in perception (+8, exceptional) and stealth (+7, good). When it comes to damage outcomes, the Timingila has immunities to cold and thunder damage, as well as an immunity to the frightened condition.

In terms of special abilities, the Timingila's Siege Monster ability allows it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it highly effective in destroying enemy fortifications. It also possesses Water Breathing, meaning it can only breathe underwater, restricting its mobility to aquatic environments.

For its actions during combat, the Timingila can make multiple attacks in a single turn through its Multiattack option, enabling it to unleash a total of four attacks comprised of one bite attack, one tail slap, and two flipper strikes. 

The Bite attack has a hit modifier of +14 and a reach of 10 ft, allowing the Timingila to deal 25 piercing damage on a hit. If it successfully hits a Large or smaller creature, that target must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is subjected to blindness and restrained conditions, taking ongoing acid damage of 21 at the start of the Timingila's turns. If the Timingila takes 30 or more damage in one turn, it must pass a DC 20 Constitution saving throw to avoid regurgitating swallowed creatures.

The Flipper attack also has a +14 to hit and a reach of 5 ft, dealing 16 bludgeoning damage. The Tail Slap has the same hit modifier of +14 and a longer reach of 20 ft., dealing 18 bludgeoning damage while pushing the target back up to 10 feet if they fail a DC 18 Strength saving throw, knocking them prone in the process.

Moreover, the Breach ability allows the Timingila to move swiftly through water, creating a massive wave upon returning to the surface. This ability can carry vehicles away and has a chance of capsizing them, showcasing its overwhelming power.

Finally, the Resonating Roar is a fearsome, area-effect ability that requires a recharge roll (5-6). It creates a 90-foot cone of thunderous sound, dealing 45 (10d8) damage on a failed DC 18 Constitution saving throw and deafening creatures for 1 minute. It also has an effect on vehicles, affecting creatures inside regardless of their location in relation to the roar, adding a layer of strategic importance to its usage within combat scenarios. 

Overall, the Timingila presents a formidable threat in aquatic battles, utilizing both brute strength and powerful area control abilities to dominate its foes.</detail>

If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the timingila. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the timingila, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the timingila’s turns.<br><br>If the timingila takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the timingila must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the timingila. If the timingila dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

- **Breach:** The timingila swims up to its swimming speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If it breaches the water’s surface, it crashes back down, creating a wave in a 30-foot-wide, 120-footlong line that is 30 feet tall. Any Gargantuan or smaller vehicles in the line are carried up to 100 feet away from the timingila and have a 50 percent chance of capsizing.
- **Resonating Roar (Recharge 5-6):** The timingila roars in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t deafened. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br>If a vehicle is in the area, the roar travels into the vehicle and resonates inside it. Each creature inside the vehicle, even if the creature is outside the roar’s area, must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take half the damage from the roar.
