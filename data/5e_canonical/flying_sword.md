<summary>A Flying Sword is an enchanted weapon, typically a sword, that hovers in the air and attacks under its own power. Created by magical means, Flying Swords are often used as sentinels or guards, patrolling areas without needing a wielder. They can move with incredible speed and precision, striking at intruders with deadly accuracy. While they lack intelligence, they follow simple commands set by their creators and are relentless in their attacks. Flying Swords are typically found in ancient castles, wizard's towers, or other places where powerful magic is present.</summary>

<summary>The Flying Sword is a small construct that serves primarily as a magical guardian or combatant in various scenarios. With an armor class of 17, it has decent defenses for its size and a moderate hit point total of 10, making it relatively fragile but capable of taking a few hits. Its primary mode of movement is flying, allowing it to maneuver easily across the battlefield with a flying speed of 30 feet. The creature has a Challenge Rating of 1/4, indicating that it can be faced by low-level adventurers, providing a manageable threat that can still be dangerous in the right circumstances. Notably, it has considerable resistances and immunities to various forms of damage and conditions, making it a resilient opponent.</summary>

<detail>

The Flying Sword has the following ability scores: Strength of 12, Dexterity of 12, Constitution of 10, Intelligence of 1, Wisdom of 10, and Charisma of 1. The Strength and Dexterity scores give it a good modifier of +1 for physical actions, meaning its effectiveness in melee combat is above average. Its Constitution score ensures that its hit points are stable, but since it's a construct, it cannot be affected by many debilitating conditions like poison or psychic attacks. The Intelligence and Charisma scores, being very low, render it incapable of thinking strategically or interacting socially.

In terms of skills, the Flying Sword does not possess any special skills but benefits from immunities—it is immune to poison and psychic damage, resistant to piercing damage, and immune to conditions like being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. It has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its environment in that radius, though it cannot see beyond. Its passive Perception score is 10, which is average, meaning it can perceive threats that are near to it but is not particularly alert.

The Flying Sword features a couple of special abilities: "Spell-created," which means that its destruction requires a dispel magic with a difficult DC of 19, making it harder to eliminate through magical means. The "False Appearance" ability allows it to remain motionless and appear indistinguishable from a regular sword, providing a strategic advantage by hiding its true nature when not engaged in combat.

For its actions, the Flying Sword can execute a melee attack with its longsword. It rolls a +3 to hit, making it capable of landing hits consistently against foes of low to average defenses. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and deals 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage on a hit, providing it with the potential to inflict respectable damage for its size. In combat, this means that, while it may not have many hit points, it can pose a threat to unsuspecting or unguarded targets.

The Flying Sword is a small construct that embodies a mechanical weapon, designed for both offensive capabilities and strategic combat advantages. With an armor class of 16, it possesses good durability, while its 11 hit points make it relatively fragile in prolonged encounters. This creature has a unique speed characteristic; although it cannot move on the ground, it can fly at a speed of 50 feet and remains capable of hovering. It is classified with a low challenge rating of 1/4, making it a manageable opponent for low-level adventurers. Notably, the Flying Sword has special abilities that reflect its nature as an animated weapon, including immunity to common forms of crowd control and effects that typically hinder living creatures. However, its susceptibility to antimagic means that it can be rendered inert in the presence of magical dampening fields.

The Flying Sword has the following attributes with associated modifiers: Strength +1 (average), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence -5 (very bad), Wisdom -3 (bad), and Charisma -5 (very bad). Its senses include a keen sense within a range of 60 feet, allowing it to detect features or creatures nearby. However, it cannot perceive beyond this radius, and its Perception score of 7 indicates a poor ability to notice details.

One of its special abilities, Antimagic Susceptibility, renders the Flying Sword incapacitated when it is within an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC; failure results in the sword falling unconscious for one minute. The Construct Nature ability signifies that the Flying Sword does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without fatigue. Its Construct Resilience grants it immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is also immune to exhaustion and the conditions of charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it a reliable combatant without the need for rest or recovery.

In terms of stealth, the Flying Sword has a score of 13, enabling it to be effectively hidden when motionless. Its False Appearance ability allows it to blend in as a normal sword while not flying, making it suitable for ambush tactics.

For actions, the Flying Sword can execute a melee weapon attack named Slash, where it has a +3 bonus to hit and a reach of 5 feet. Upon a successful hit, it deals an average of 5 slashing damage (1d8 + 1). When its hit points are reduced to 6 or fewer, it can use its Bonus Action ability called Whirling Blade, allowing it to make a Slash attack against a target within 5 feet that it can sense. This feature helps maintain its threat even in a weakened state, providing it a last chance to defend itself or take down an opponent.</detail>
