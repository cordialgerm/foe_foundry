<summary>The Cueyatl is a small, humanoid creature embodying a lawful evil alignment. This creature possesses unique abilities and adaptations that make it a formidable opponent in its natural habitat. With a decent level of cunning and dexterity, the Cueyatl excels in stealth and mobility, making it a threat in jungle terrains. Despite its relatively low armor class and hit points, its capacity for quick maneuvers and advantageous terrain interactions gives it a strategic edge in combat. The Cueyatl primarily uses its spear for attacks, capable of inflicting significant poison damage along with piercing damage, enhancing its lethality in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Cueyatl has an armor class of 11, which is considered average, making it somewhat vulnerable to attacks. It has 21 hit points, derived from rolling six six-sided dice, signifying a low to moderate endurance in combat situations. The creature can perform well with its movement capabilities, boasting a speed of 30 feet on foot, 20 feet for climbing, and 30 feet for swimming. The challenge rating of 1/2 signifies that it is manageable for a novice party but can be quite dangerous if underestimated.

In terms of attributes, the Cueyatl has a strength score of 10, meaning its physical power is average. Its dexterity is slightly above average at 12, allowing effective maneuvers and some proficiency in stealth. The constitution score of 11 indicates an average resilience, while intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores all sit at 10, meaning they are average in mental faculties and social interactions. The Cueyatl has proficiency in stealth, with a total of +3 when attempting stealth checks, making it effective at hiding.

The creature’s senses include darkvision out to 60 feet, and a passive perception score of 10, which gives it a basic awareness of its surroundings. The Cueyatl can communicate in its own language.

The Cueyatl possesses several special abilities that enhance its survivability and effectiveness in its environment. Being amphibious, it can breathe both air and water, allowing it to thrive in various environments. Its jungle camouflage provides it with an advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when hiding in jungle terrain, making it especially stealthy in its native habitat. The slippery ability grants it advantage on saving throws and ability checks when trying to escape grapples, increasing its chances of evasion during melee encounters. Furthermore, the standing leap ability allows it to jump long distances—up to 20 feet horizontally and 10 feet vertically—making it exceptional at navigating challenging landscapes.

In combat, the Cueyatl can attack with a spear, which can be used either as a melee or ranged weapon. When attacking with the spear, it has a +2 modifier to hit, suggesting a slightly below-average attack capability. The reach of this attack is 5 feet for melee and ranges from 20 to 60 feet for ranged attacks, hitting only one target. The spear inflicts 3 piercing damage plus additional poison damage of 7 (from rolling two six-sided dice) on a hit, totaling a potential damage of 10. Alternatively, if the spear is wielded with two hands for a melee attack, it can deal 4 piercing damage along with the same 7 poison damage, bringing the total damage to 11. This versatility in attack, combined with the potential for poison damage, makes the Cueyatl a significant threat in any encounter.</detail>
