<detail>

The Gold Dragon Wyrmling has an Armor Class of 17, which is considered good, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being injured. It has 75 hit points, with a notable constitution score of 16 (+3), contributing to its resilience. Its speed is versatile, allowing it to walk 30 feet, fly 60 feet, and swim 30 feet, providing excellent mobility options. The creature's ability scores are as follows: Strength is 18 (+4), Dexterity is 14 (+2), Constitution is 16 (+3), Intelligence is 14 (+2), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 16 (+3). The high Strength and Charisma values indicate it can deliver compelling physical attacks and have a strong presence in social interactions. 

For skills, the Gold Dragon Wyrmling has a perception score of +3, which is considered average, and a stealth score of +4, regarded as good, enabling it to be somewhat effective in remaining unnoticed. It is immune to fire damage, making it highly resistant to fire-based attacks. Its sensory abilities include blindsight out to 10 feet and darkvision out to 60 feet, with a passive Perception score of 13, allowing it to detect hidden or lurking threats in dim light or darkness. The Gold Dragon Wyrmling speaks Draconic, which limits its communication primarily to those who understand the language.

In terms of actions, the Gold Dragon Wyrmling has several powerful options. The Bite is a melee weapon attack that has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, allowing it to target one enemy. If hit, this attack deals 9 piercing damage, which is an average amount of damage for a creature of this level.

The creature can utilize two types of Breath Weapons, both of which can significantly affect gameplay. The Molten Breath, which has a recharge requirement of rolling a 5 or 6 on a d6, unleashes a cone of molten gold over a distance of 15 feet. Creatures in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; those who fail take 22 (4d10) fire damage, while successful saves result in halved damage. This mechanism introduces a crucial element of area damage, forcing opponents to either spread out or risk significant damage.

The Slowing Breath, also having a recharge of 5-6, exudes a gas in a 15-foot cone. Creatures that are caught in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failing this throw results in disadvantage on weapon attack rolls for one minute, greatly diminishing their effectiveness in combat. A creature affected by this ability can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, providing a strategic element as they work to overcome the disadvantage.

Overall, the Gold Dragon Wyrmling is a well-rounded creature that combines offensive and defensive capabilities with a touch of magical prowess, offering both formidable challenges and unique tactical opportunities in Dungeons & Dragons campaigns.

The Gold Dragon Wyrmling is a formidable Medium dragon, exuding both power and majesty. This creature serves as an impressive adversary or ally, particularly suited for younger adventurers who encounter dragons. Its armor class of 17, paired with 68 hit points, makes it a strong opponent in combat. With a challenge rating of 3, this dragon boasts impressive attributes, including a good combination of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores, allowing it to be agile and tough. However, its Intelligence and Wisdom, while above average, are not as high, which could limit its strategic capabilities. Notably, the Gold Dragon Wyrmling has an array of abilities and attacks that can significantly impact the battlefield, showcasing its versatility both in physical confrontations and through powerful breath attacks.

The Gold Dragon Wyrmling has the following attributes: a Strength of +4, Dexterity of +4, Constitution of +5, Intelligence of +2, Wisdom of +5, and Charisma of +4. Its high Constitution means it has good durability in battles, while the Dexterity is also good, assisting in mobility and avoidance of attacks. The Wisdom modifier is also good, which contributes to its Perception checks, making it quite aware of its surroundings. The attributes relating to Intelligence may be considered average, limiting its ability to strategize effectively in certain situations.

The dragon has some special abilities. Amphibious allows it to breathe both air and water, making it highly adaptable in aquatic environments. The Pounce ability enables the dragon to knock a target prone if it moves quickly towards them and successfully strikes with a claw, giving it the opportunity to attack again as a bonus action if its target is downed.

In combat actions, the Gold Dragon Wyrmling can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and one Claw attack in a single turn. The Bite attack is made with a +6 modifier to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage upon a successful hit. The Claw attack, similarly, is made with a +6 modifier to hit, reaching the same distance, and deals 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage. 

Two notable breath attacks enhance the creature's offensive capabilities. The Fire Breath is a powerful ability that requires recharge on rolls of 5 or 6. It allows the dragon to unleash fire in a 15-foot cone, with affected creatures needing to succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Those who fail take a staggering 33 (6d10) fire damage, while successful creatures only take half damage. The Weakening Breath, on the other hand, has a recharge timing requiring a roll of 6. This ability releases a gas in a 15-foot cone, forcing targets to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Creatures that fail this save suffer from disadvantage on all Strength-based attacks, checks, and saves for one minute. Importantly, they can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect early.

Overall, the Gold Dragon Wyrmling is a versatile and powerful creature that can significantly influence combat dynamics through its physical attacks and devastating breath abilities.</detail>
