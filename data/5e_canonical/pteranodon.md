<summary>The Pteranodon is a large beast resembling a prehistoric flying reptile. In the game, it serves as a nimble aerial threat with the ability to swoop down on unsuspecting prey and retreat without suffering attacks. With an Armor Class of 13, it is relatively resilient but not exceptionally tough, boasting 30 hit points, which gives it decent durability for a creature of its type. The Pteranodon has a Challenge Rating of 1/2, indicating that it poses a moderate challenge to low-level adventurers. Its strengths lie in its flying speed of 60 feet, allowing for quick movement in combat and strategic advantage over grounded opponents. However, its low intelligence and charisma scores indicate that it is not particularly adept in social interactions or problem-solving situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Pteranodon has the following attributes: Strength is 12, which translates to a modifier of +1, indicating that it has average physical power. Dexterity is 14, with a +2 modifier, making it quite agile and able to avoid attacks efficiently. Constitution is also 14, contributing a +2 modifier that grants it good resilience against various effects. Intelligence is notably poor with a score of 2 and a modifier of -4, categorizing it as very bad in cognitive tasks. Wisdom is average at 11 with a +0 modifier, while charisma is very low at 5, leading to a -3 modifier, categorizing it as very bad in charming or social skills. The Pteranodon possesses a passive Perception score of 11, which reflects an average awareness of its surroundings.

One special ability the Pteranodon possesses is called Flyby. This ability allows it to fly out of a creature's reach without provoking an opportunity attack, enabling it to maneuver more freely during combat and escape from melee engagements without risk. 

For its offensive capability, the Pteranodon can use its Bite action, which is a melee weapon attack that adds +3 to hit. This gives it a good chance to successfully strike its prey within a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 5 piercing damage, calculated by rolling 1d8 and adding 1. Overall, the Pteranodon serves as a quick and evasive element in combat, making it a notable foe that utilizes its flight capabilities to outmaneuver and surprise adventurers.</detail>
