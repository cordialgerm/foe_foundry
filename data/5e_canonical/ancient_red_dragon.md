<summary>The Ancient Red Dragon is the most feared and dangerous of all dragons, with scales that burn like molten lava and smoke constantly rising from its nostrils. These dragons make their homes in volcanic mountains, surrounded by vast hoards of treasure. Red Dragons are driven by greed and an overwhelming sense of superiority, believing themselves to be the pinnacle of dragonkind. Their breath weapon is a devastating blast of fire, capable of incinerating entire cities in moments. Ancient Red Dragons are ferociously territorial and will destroy anything that dares to challenge their dominance or lay claim to their treasure.</summary>

<summary>The Ancient Red Dragon is a gargantuan creature known for its immense power and ferocity. This apex predator dominates its surroundings, exhibiting both physical and magical prowess that makes it a formidable opponent. With a Challenge Rating of 26, it presents an exceptional challenge to even the most experienced adventurers, boasting high offensive and defensive capabilities. The dragon has an extraordinary Armor Class of 22, making it very hard to hit, paired with a massive pool of 448 hit points, which allows it to soak up substantial damage. Its strengths lie in its overwhelming damage potential, particularly through its powerful bite, claws, and fire breath attacks. One notable ability, Legendary Resistance, grants it the opportunity to succeed on saving throws an impressive three times per day, enhancing its survivability. However, the Ancient Red Dragon possesses weaknesses, such as vulnerabilities to spells that target its lesser ability scores, notably its below-average Dexterity. Its innate magical abilities and fear-inducing presence make it not only a deadly combatant but also a strategic contender.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient Red Dragon has the following attributes:
- Strength: 30 (+10) which provides an exceptional modifier for physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0) resulting in a very bad modifier, indicating that it is not agile and can be outmaneuvered.
- Constitution: 28 (+9) offering an exceptional modifier for endurance and health.
- Intelligence: 18 (+4) giving it a good modifier that reflects its cunning.
- Wisdom: 16 (+3) indicating a good connection to perception and insight.
- Charisma: 22 (+6), which provides a very good modifier, aiding in its spellcasting and intimidation.

The dragon's saving throw modifiers are: Dexterity +8 (bad), Constitution +17 (very good), Wisdom +11 (good), and Charisma +14 (very good). It also possesses skills like intimidation +14 (very good), perception +11 (good), and stealth +8 (average). Notably, it is immune to fire damage, showcasing its resilience against fire-based attacks, and has blindsight out to 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive Perception score of 24.

In terms of special abilities:
- Legendary Resistance (3/Day) allows the dragon to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw, shedding scales that turn to charcoal in the process. After expending all uses, its Armor Class drops to 20 until it completes a long rest.
- Searing Heat inflicts 14 (4d6) fire damage to any creature that touches the dragon or attacks it in melee for the first time on a turn.
- Volcanic Tyrant provides immunity to poisonous gases from volcanic sources and negates any difficult terrain caused by lava.
- Innate Spellcasting, with a DC of 22, allows it to cast spells without needing material components, with notable spells including command, hold person, glyph of warding, and wall of fire available three times a day, while antimagic field and dominate monster can be used once per day.

The dragon's actions are as follows:
- Multiattack enables it to bite once and claw twice per turn, or take an alternative action by Spitting Fire instead of biting.
- The Bite attack has +18 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, deals 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage, and adds 9 (2d8) fire damage on a hit.
- Claws have +18 to hit, reach of 10 feet, and do 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.
- The Tail attack has +18 to hit, a reach of 20 feet, delivering 23 (3d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage and pushing the target 10 feet away.
- Cruel Tyranny allows it to intimidate a single creature it can see to make an immediate weapon attack with advantage. If bloodied, it can target three minions instead.
- Spit Fire targets one creature within 60 feet, forcing a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw for 22 (4d10) fire damage, halved on success. Failure also incurs an additional 11 (2d10) ongoing fire damage, which can be ended by the target using an action.
- Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6) unleashes a devastating blast in a 90-foot cone, forcing a DC 25 Dexterity save. Failures take 98 (28d6) fire damage and ongoing fire damage as well as being frightened until the ongoing effect ends, which can be mitigated by using an action.

The Ancient Red Dragon also has potent reactions:
- Tail Attack allows it to retaliate with a tail swipe whenever it is hit by a melee attack from a creature within 10 feet.
- Taskmaster lets it boost the odds for a creature failing an ability check or saving throw within 60 feet, potentially turning a failure into a success by adding a roll of a d10.

Lastly, the dragon has legendary actions that can be utilized at the end of another creature's turn. It can take the following actions:
- Use Cruel Tyranny as previously described.
- Roar creates fear in every creature of its choice within 120 feet, who must make a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute, with chances to save at the end of each turn.
- Wing Attack pushes and knocks prone creatures within 15 feet after making a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, potentially allowing the dragon to reposition itself by flying up to half of its distance.

The Ancient Red Dragon is a gargantuan and fearsome creature characterized by its immense physical strength, resilience, and mastery over fire. As one of the most powerful monsters in Dungeons & Dragons, it holds a challenge rating of 21, making it a formidable foe for even the most experienced adventurers. With a staggering 382 hit points, an impressive Armor Class of 22, and notable abilities that allow it to dominate the battlefield, this dragon embodies the terror and majesty of its kind. Its mobility is remarkable, as it can fly at 80 feet and has climbing and walking speeds of 40 feet. However, its intimidating presence and powerful attacks can be countered through strategic planning by players, especially considering its reliance on saving throws and possible vulnerabilities.

The Ancient Red Dragon possesses an array of attributes that greatly enhance its combat capabilities. It has a Strength of +10, which is exceptionally effective for physical attacks. Its Dexterity of +7 is very good, granting it a decent level of agility. With a Constitution of +16, the dragon showcases an exceptional capacity to absorb damage, benefiting its already high hit points. Intellect and Wisdom are average at +4 and +9, respectively, allowing it limited effectiveness in certain mental challenges, while a Charisma score of +13 is very good, enhancing its fear-inducing abilities.

The dragon's senses include darkvision up to 120 feet and keen senses at 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures in darkness and gain a significant advantage in stealth-related scenarios. It has a Perception skill of 26, making it excellent at noticing threats or hidden foes and a Stealth score of 17, which is good for remaining undetected. The Ancient Red Dragon is fluent in Common and Draconic, allowing it to communicate effectively with multiple characters.

One of the dragon's notable abilities is "Boil Over," which produces extreme heat around the dragon when its Fire Breath weapon is not in use. Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage. Failing this save by 5 or more also inflicts one level of exhaustion on the creature, which can severely limit its abilities in combat.

Additionally, the dragon has "Legendary Resistance," allowing it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw up to three times per day, effectively mitigating its susceptibility to certain effects and spells.

In combat, the Ancient Red Dragon carries out a "Multiattack," first invoking its "Frightful Presence" ability, which forces nearby creatures to make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw to avoid becoming frightened, incapacitating them with fear for up to one minute. It can then make a bite attack with a +17 to hit, delivering 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage and adding 14 (4d6) fire damage, demonstrating its exceptional offensive power. In addition to its bite, it can make two claw attacks, each providing 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage and another tail attack delivering 19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

The dragon's "Fire Breath" is a devastating ranged attack that can be unleashed in a 90-foot cone. Creatures caught in this fiery breath must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 105 (30d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on success. This attack is available once every few rounds, provided a recharge roll of 5 or 6 is successful.

Moreover, the dragon possesses legendary actions to manipulate the battlefield further. It can use "Detect" to pinpoint every creature and trap within 30 feet. With a "Tail Attack," it can deliver additional damage to a target. "Elemental Roar" allows the dragon to roar at two creatures within 120 feet, requiring them to make a DC 21 Charisma save or become vulnerable to fire damage for a turn. Lastly, the "Wing Attack" allows it to clear space around it, dealing damage and knocking opponents prone if they fail a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw.

In terms of environmental impact, the dragon creates regional effects that can lead to various hazards and dangers in its territory, persisting for a certain number of days after its death. Overall, the Ancient Red Dragon is a powerful and iconic monster, with abilities that can deeply influence encounters in any Dungeons & Dragons campaign.</detail>
