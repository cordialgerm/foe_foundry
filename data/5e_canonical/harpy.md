<summary>Harpies are vicious, winged creatures with the upper body of a human woman and the lower body of a bird. Their voices are hauntingly beautiful, and they use their songs to lure unsuspecting victims to their doom. Once their prey is close, Harpies swoop down and attack with sharp talons and claws. They are known for their cruelty and love of torment, often playing with their victims before delivering a fatal blow. Harpies typically make their nests in high cliffs or remote islands, where they can ambush travelers and sailors from above.</summary>

<summary>The Harpy is a Medium-sized monstrosity known for its alluring and dangerous presence. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, particularly through its ability to charm and manipulate enemies. Although its physical attributes are average, its strength lies in its Luring Song ability, which can incapacitate foes, rendering them vulnerable to its attacks. However, the Harpy is relatively fragile, with only 38 hit points and an armor class of 11, making it susceptible to damage if enemies can successfully save against its charms or if they can close the distance and engage in combat. </summary>

<detail>

The Harpy has decent attributes, with a strength of 12 (+1), dexterity of 12 (+1), constitution of 12 (+1), intelligence of 10 (+0), wisdom of 10 (+0), and a charisma of 14 (+2). The Harpy's saving throw modifier for Wisdom is +2, which is considered average, meaning it can withstand some mental effects, but it is not exceptionally resilient. Its skills and senses are limited, with passive perception resting at 10, indicating average awareness. The Harpy can speak Common, which allows it to communicate with adventurers.

In combat, the Harpy can use its Multiattack ability to strike twice with its claws. Each claw attack has a +3 to hit, which is average, and can reach targets within 5 feet, dealing 4 (1d6 + 1) slashing damage. While this attack can be a nuisance, it will likely be overshadowed by its more potent Luring Song ability.

The Luring Song is a powerful bonus action that allows the Harpy to sing a magical tune. Any humanoid or giant within 300 feet who can hear this song must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails, it becomes charmed by the Harpy and is incapacitated, meaning it cannot take actions or reactions. Charmed creatures are compelled to move directly toward the Harpy, which can create a dangerous or distracting situation for the party. The charm lasts as long as the Harpy continues to sing and can recur every turn if the victim is not damaged. The creature can attempt its saving throw again whenever it takes damage or faces environmental hazards like lava. Success on the saving throw or ending of the charm effect grants immunity to future songs from that Harpy for 24 hours, allowing players to strategically handle their approach to this creature.

The Harpy is a Medium monstrosity known for its alluring songs and dual assaults in combat. With an Armor Class of 13 and Hit Points totaling 38, it possesses moderate durability in battle but is primarily designed for agility, boasting a flying speed of 40 feet and a ground speed of 20 feet. As a Challenge Rating 1 creature, the Harpy presents a moderate threat to adventurers. Its attributes reflect a balance between dexterity and strength, with a decent +3 modifier in Dexterity, which contributes to its agility and ability to evade attacks, rated as good. The Harpy is particularly notable for its ability to charm opponents, making it a cunning foe that can manipulate the tides of battle. However, its weaknesses include a low Intelligence score of -2, denoting very bad reasoning skills, which limits its strategic capabilities outside combat.

In terms of attributes, the Harpy has the following scores: Strength of 12 (+1, which is average), Dexterity of 16 (+3, good), Constitution of 12 (+1, average), Intelligence of 8 (-2, very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0, average), and Charisma of 12 (+1, average). With a darkvision range of 120 feet, the Harpy can effectively see in darkness, enhancing its stealth, which has a modifier of +3, classified as good.

Special abilities include "Monstrosity Resilience," granting the Harpy resistance to exhaustion and the frightened condition, allowing it to sustain its performance in prolonged encounters and avoid panic effects.

In action economy, the Harpy has a "Multiattack" ability, enabling it to make two attacks in one turn, either Claw or Screech. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit that can deal 8 slashing damage (2d4 + 3), which is effective against softer targets. The Screech is a ranged spell attack that targets one enemy within 30/120 feet, also scoring a +4 to hit and dealing 8 thunder damage (2d6 + 1). 

The Harpy can also use its "Luring Song" as a bonus action. This magical melody influences all Humanoids and Giants within 300 feet who can hear the song, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 11. If they fail, they become charmed until the song ends. The Harpy must spend subsequent turns as a bonus action to continue singing, but can stop at any point, and the effect ceases if the Harpy becomes incapacitated. This ability is particularly powerful as it can incapacitate foes, allowing the Harpy and its allies to seize control of the encounter.</detail>

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.
