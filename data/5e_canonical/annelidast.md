<summary>The Annelidast is a colossal monstrosity that operates effectively as a formidable opponent in combat. With its high Armor Class of 18 and significant hit points totaling 184, this creature is designed to withstand substantial damage while dealing it out aggressively. Its strengths lie in powerful melee attacks and unique abilities that capitalize on its burrowing nature and poisonous aura. However, despite its impressive Strength score of 26 and Constitution of 20, the Annelidast is lacking in Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, which can pose limitations in certain interactions. Its challenge rating of 12 indicates it requires a well-coordinated party to defeat, leveraging its defensive capabilities and high damage output.</summary>

<detail>

The Annelidast has an Armor Class of 18, which provides good protection, while its 184 hit points, derived from 16d12 plus a Constitution modifier of 5, makes it exceptionally resilient. It possesses a walking speed of 30 feet and a burrowing speed of 40 feet, enabling it to navigate terrain with ease. 

In combat, the Annelidast relies on its physical attributes, particularly its Strength score of 26, which gives it a +8 modifier—an exceptional bonus for melee attacks. The creature’s Constitution save of +9 and Wisdom save of +4 reflect its good resilience against various effects, but it has virtually no skills or notable abilities beyond its immunity and resistances. It is immune to poison damage and bludgeoning damage from nonmagical attacks and is resistant to lightning damage, while being immune to the poisoned condition. 

The Annelidast can sense its surroundings with tremorsense up to 120 feet but lacks any form of communication or languages, which limits its interaction with other beings.

The Annelidast has special abilities that enhance its lethality and survivability in combat. The "Deep Earth Dweller" ability allows the creature to operate without air, which is particularly useful in underground environments. The "Primordial Aura" ability creates a hazardous zone around the creature. Any creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot radius must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, or suffer 7 (2d6) poison damage. Additionally, any creature resting nearby could develop tumors and become poisoned unless cured by greater restoration or similar magic, making it a significant threat not only in battle but also to long-term adventuring plans. The "Tunneler" ability is another tactical advantage, allowing the Annelidast to dig through rock, creating 10-foot-diameter tunnels and positioning itself advantageously.

In terms of actions, the Annelidast can make a multiattack, allowing it to deliver three Slam attacks. Each Slam attack uses a melee weapon attack modifier of +12 to hit and has a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, it deals 21 (2d12 + 8) bludgeoning damage. Targets struck must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pushed back up to 15 feet, while restrained creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw. Additionally, it can use its "Crush" action when recharged, slamming down in a 20-foot line and dealing significant area damage. Creatures caught in this line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (7d12) bludgeoning damage while being knocked prone and restrained. Successful saves result in half damage and positioning them safely away from the Annelidast. If the Annelidast has burrowed for at least 20 feet, it grants disadvantage on this saving throw, making the ability more menacing.

As a defensive measure, the "Defensive Recoil" reaction allows the Annelidast to strike back with a Slam attack against any creature restrained by it when it takes damage, enabling it to maintain offensive pressure even when injured.

Overall, the Annelidast breeds chaos and risk on the battlefield, with its potent mix of damage potential, terrain manipulation, and poison-based abilities making it a thrilling and dangerous adversary.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Deep Earth Dweller:** The annelidast doesn’t require air.
- **Primordial Aura:** A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the annelidast must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage. A creature that finishes a long rest within 1,000 feet of the annelidast must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or develop tumors across its body and become poisoned until the tumors are removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.
- **Tunneler:** The annelidast can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The annelidast makes three Slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (2d12 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from the annelidast. A creature restrained by the annelidast automatically succeeds on this saving throw.
- **Crush (Recharge 5–6):** The annelidast launches most of its massive bulk into the air and crashes down on the ground in a 20-foot line that is 10 feet wide. It then retracts itself into a space along that line and can occupy the space of one or more Large or smaller creatures. Each creature in the line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (7d12) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is restrained while it shares a space with the annelidast, as it is pinned beneath the annelidast’s body. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, isn’t knocked prone, and is pushed out of the annelidast’s space into an unoccupied space of the creature’s choice within 5 feet of the annelidast. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 17 Strength check. If the annelidast burrows along the surface of the earth at least 20 feet before using this action, creatures in the line have disadvantage on the saving throw.

### Reactions

- **Defensive Recoil:** When the annelidast takes damage, it can make one Slam attack against a creature restrained by it.
