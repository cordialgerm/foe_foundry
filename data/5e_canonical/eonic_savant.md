<summary>The Eonic Savant is a formidable Medium humanoid creature that plays a dual role in combat: both as a spellcaster and a melee combatant. With an Armor Class of 13, which can increase to 16 when using mage armor, and a substantial health pool of 115 hit points, it is able to withstand significant damage. The savant's Challenge Rating of 7 suggests it presents a serious threat to adventurers, rewarding teams with 2,900 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths lie in its high Intelligence score of 20, allowing it to excel in arcane knowledge and powerful spellcasting. Notably, it possesses abilities that manipulate time, making it unpredictable and difficult to combat effectively. However, its average Strength and Wisdom scores indicate that it is not as proficient in physical combat or willpower related tasks. </summary>

<detail>

The Eonic Savant's attributes include a Strength of 9, which is very bad for physical combat; a Dexterity of 16, which is good, providing it with agility; a Constitution of 16, also good, granting it resilience; an exceptional Intelligence of 20, reflecting its magical prowess; an average Wisdom of 11; and a Charisma of 15, which is good, enhancing its interactions and spells involving social influence. Its saving throws reveal a specific strength in Wisdom, granting it a +3 modifier, which is average for resisting mental effects. 

The Eonic Savant has several special abilities that enhance its tactical options in combat. "Amend Time" allows it to influence the outcomes of attacks directed at allies or enemies within a 30-foot range. Friendly targets gain advantage on their next weapon attack roll, while hostile targets risk suffering disadvantage unless they can succeed on a Charisma saving throw with a DC of 15. "Magic Resistance" provides the savant with a significant defensive edge, granting it advantage on saving throws against magical effects, making it harder to control through spells. 

One of its most intriguing abilities is "Past and Future, Present." This ability allows the Eonic Savant to have past and future versions of itself present in the same space, effectively creating a buffer against damage and expanding its spell-casting capability. The savant can concentrate on two spells at once and has a damage mitigation mechanism that allows it to absorb incoming attacks through its other selves, halving the damage dealt during those instances.

As a spellcaster, the savant is a 9th-level wizard with a spell save DC of 15 and a +8 to hit with spell attacks. The prepared spells include a range of powerful spells such as "fireball," "counterspell," and "dimension door," as well as useful utility cantrips like "fire bolt" and "mage hand," allowing it to engage in both direct damage-dealing and support roles as the situation demands.

In combat, the Eonic Savant can make three melee attacks as part of its "Multiattack" action, utilizing its "Time Warping Staff." This weapon has a +6 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals a combination of bludgeoning and force damage, totaling 13 on a hit (6 from the bludgeoning damage and 7 from force damage). Overall, the Eonic Savant is a complex and powerful creature that poses a significant challenge to any adventuring party.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amend Time:** As a bonus action, the savant alters the strands of time surrounding a creature it can see within 30 feet.

If the target is hostile, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on its next weapon attack roll.
- **Magic Resistance:** The savant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Past and Future, Present:** A savant is always accompanied by its past and future selves. They occupy the savant’s same space seconds before and after the savant and can’t be targeted separately. They provide the savant with the following benefits. 
* The savant can concentrate on two spells simultaneously. If it casts a third spell that requires concentration, the savant loses concentration on the oldest spell. If the savant is concentrating on two spells and loses concentration because of taking damage, it loses concentration on the oldest spell.
* When a creature targets the savant with an attack, roll a d6. On a 1 through 4, the attack hits one of the savant’s future or past selves, halving the damage the savant takes. On a 5 or 6, the attack hits the savant, and it takes damage as normal. The savant is still the target of the attack and is subject to effects that trigger when a creature is hit or damaged.
