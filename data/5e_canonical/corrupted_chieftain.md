<MonsterName/>Corrupted Chieftain</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Giant</CreatureType>

<summary>The Corrupted Chieftain is a formidable opponent, embodying the chaotic evil typically associated with giants. Its large frame, combined with impressive physical attributes, grants it significant offensive capabilities. With a challenge rating of 7, this giant can absorb considerable damage with 133 hit points and an armor class of 17 due to its natural armor. Its strengths lie in its high strength (23), granting it exceptional melee attack damage, as well as its constitution (18), which enhances its durability in combat. However, it is notably weak in dexterity (8) and intelligence (5), which reflects a poor ability to dodge attacks and perform complex problem-solving. The chieftain wields both magical weaponry and powerful abilities that can turn the tide of battle, making it a terrifying foe for adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The Corrupted Chieftain has a Strength score of 23, providing it with a very good +6 modifier for melee attacks. Its Dexterity is a poor 8, leading to a -1 modifier that hinders its ability to avoid ranged attacks. The Constitution score of 18 results in a good +4 modifier, enhancing its saving throw effectiveness. Its Intelligence (5) and Wisdom (7) are very low, rendering it bad at tasks requiring mental acuity and perception, reflected in its passive perception of 8. Charisma stands at 12, imparting a mediocre +1 modifier on Charisma saving throws. The chieftain is proficient in saving throws for Constitution and Charisma, with respective bonuses of +7 and +4, enhancing its resilience against various effects.

One of the chieftain's defining features is its Magic-Infused Weapons ability. This allows all weapon attacks made by the chieftain to count as magical, dealing an additional 2d8 force damage on a hit, which greatly increases its damage potential. The Spiked Hide special ability inflicts 5 (2d4) piercing damage to any creature that makes melee contact with the chieftain or attacks it while within 5 feet, creating a deterrent for close-range combat.

In terms of actions, the Corrupted Chieftain can make a multiattack, using one of its special abilities, Chieftain’s Command or Chieftain’s Might, before striking twice with either a Greatclub or Javelin. The Greatclub attack has a +9 to hit, dealing 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, supplemented by an additional 9 (2d8) force damage, making it a highly damaging melee option. The Javelin can be thrown or used in melee, also with a +9 to hit, dealing 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) force damage, granting versatility in range. 

Chieftain’s Command allows the giant to grant advantage on the next attack roll of a Giant ally within 30 feet, while also imposing disadvantage on the next attack against that ally, creating a tactical advantage in the fight. Chieftain’s Might intimidates nearby foes, forcing them to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of their next turn, effectively reducing the actions of those affected. Lastly, through the Aggressive bonus action, the chieftain can swiftly close the distance to a visible enemy, enabling it to maintain pressure on its targets.</detail>
