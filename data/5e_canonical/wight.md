<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>A Wight is an undead creature driven by hatred and malice, often serving dark powers or necromancers. Wights retain the intelligence they had in life but are twisted by death and the dark magic that animates them. They drain the life force from living creatures with their touch, creating new undead from those they slay. Wights are skilled combatants, often wielding weapons they carried in life, and they are immune to many effects that harm the living. Their ability to raise the dead makes them particularly dangerous, as they can quickly amass an army of undead servants.</summary>
