<summary>A Wight is an undead creature driven by hatred and malice, often serving dark powers or necromancers. Wights retain the intelligence they had in life but are twisted by death and the dark magic that animates them. They drain the life force from living creatures with their touch, creating new undead from those they slay. Wights are skilled combatants, often wielding weapons they carried in life, and they are immune to many effects that harm the living. Their ability to raise the dead makes them particularly dangerous, as they can quickly amass an army of undead servants.</summary>

<summary>The Wight is a Medium undead creature typically found in dark and ominous locations. As an undead entity, it has the ability to drain the life force of its victims, thereby gaining strength and power. With an Armor Class of 15 and 45 hit points, the Wight is moderately resilient, making it a formidable foe for lower-level adventurers. Its attack abilities include both melee and ranged options, allowing it to adapt to various combat situations. However, the Wight is significantly hindered in sunlight, suffering disadvantages that may leave it vulnerable in well-lit areas. Its various resistances, including to cold and necrotic damage, further add to its defensive capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Wight has the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2) indicating good physical power, Dexterity is also 14 (+2) showcasing its agility, Constitution is notable at 16 (+3), offering very good resilience, Intelligence is at 10 (+0), making it average in cunning, Wisdom is 12 (+1), giving it a slight edge in perception, and Charisma is 14 (+2), which is quite good for interactions related to undead abilities. 

It has the following skill proficiencies: Perception at +3, which is average, and Stealth at +4, which is good. Its damage resistances include cold, necrotic, and damage from nonmagical, non-silvered weapons, making it an effective combatant against many physical attacks. The Wight has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception of 13, allowing it to see in darkness and be aware of its surroundings effectively. It understands the languages it knew in life.

The Wight has several special abilities: 
- **Cold Aura:** Any creature that starts its turn grappled by the Wight, touches it, or strikes it with a melee attack within 5 feet takes 3 (1d6) cold damage, which can only occur once per turn. This ability is negated if the Wight has been affected by fire damage recently. 
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** In sunlight, the Wight experiences disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks reliant on sight, rendering it less effective in bright conditions.
- **Undead Nature:** This ability allows the Wight to not require air, food, or sleep, making it a relentless opponent.

In terms of actions, the Wight has three primary attack options:
- **Longsword:** Acts as a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage on a successful hit.
- **Seize:** Another melee weapon attack that also has a +4 to hit, dealing 3 (1d6) cold damage and grappling the target (escape DC 12). The grappled target is restrained and the Wight can only use its Life Drain attack on them until the grapple ends.
- **Longbow:** A ranged weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a range of 150/600 feet. It deals 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage along with 3 (1d6) cold damage.

As a bonus action, the Wight can use **Life Drain:** This ability also requires a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) necrotic damage. The target then makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, their hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount of necrotic damage dealt, and this reduction persists until the target completes a long rest. Additionally, if a humanoid or beast is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, they die and rise as a zombie under the Wight's control within 24 hours.

The Wight, with its assortment of offensive and defensive capabilities, serves as a dangerous adversary, especially in dark, cold environments where its abilities can be utilized effectively.

The Wight is a formidable Medium undead creature that embodies the typical traits of a malevolent spirit returned from the grave. With a Challenge Rating of 3, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, particularly due to its ability to drain life and create servitors from fallen foes. The Wight features solid defensive capabilities with an Armor Class of 14 and 69 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage. However, it has a notable weakness in sunlight, which impairs its effectiveness in combat. With good physical attributes and a range of offensive actions, it is standout in combat scenarios, making it a challenge for lower-level parties.

The Wight possesses a Strength score of 16 (+3), Dexterity of 14 (+2), Constitution of 16 (+3), Intelligence of 10 (+0), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 14 (+2). Its physical attributes are generally good, with Strength and Constitution providing very good stress durability and attack power. Its Dexterity, while helpful for initiative and ranged attacks, is only average. The Wight has a good Perception score of 13, which aids in noticing hidden creatures or traps.

With darkvision of 60 feet, the Wight can see in dim light as if it were bright light, which is an advantage in shadowy conditions. It also has exceptional stealth with a Stealth score of 14, making it capable of ambushing an unsuspecting party. It understands the languages it knew in life, enabling basic interaction with intelligent adversaries or allies.

The Wight has several special abilities. The Martial Adept ability allows the Wight to deal an additional die of damage with its manufactured weapon attacks, making its strikes particularly deadly. However, the Wight suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and severely hampers its perception in direct sunlight, representing a very bad state in those conditions. The Undead Nature ability means that it does not need air, food, drink, or sleep, giving it exceptional resilience in prolonged encounters. Lastly, Undead Resilience grants it immunity to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, making it difficult to disable through common status effects.

In combat, the Wight utilizes the Multiattack action, allowing it to strike twice with either its Longsword or Longbow, and it can substitute one of these attacks with a powerful Life Drain attack. The Life Drain is a melee spell attack that adds +5 to hit and deals 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage if successful. Not only does this damage hurt the target, but they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer a decrease in their hit point maximum equal to the damage dealt, lasting until the target finishes a long rest. This effect can lead to death if it reduces the targetâ€™s hit point maximum to zero, adding a significant strategic element in combat. Additionally, if a humanoid is slain by this attack, they rise as a zombie under the Wight's control after 24 hours, provided their body remains intact.

The Wight can use its Longsword for melee attacks, which has a +5 to hit and inflicts either 12 (2d8 + 3) or 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage when wielded with one or two hands respectively. It can also employ its Longbow for ranged attacks with a +4 to hit, inflicting 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage within a range of 150 feet, and up to 600 feet at disadvantage.

As a bonus action, the Wight can activate Command Horde, allowing it to command up to five friendly skeletons or zombies to perform various tactical maneuvers. This includes the Protect action, which enhances the defenses of nearby allies; the Overwhelm option, granting advantage on attack rolls for coordinated strikes; and the Shamble action, allowing minions to reposition themselves effectively while minimizing the risk of opportunity attacks by granting disadvantage on such attacks. This capability makes the Wight not just a dangerous foe in direct combat, but also a strategic commander on the battlefield, directing its minions to enhance their chances of victory.</detail>
