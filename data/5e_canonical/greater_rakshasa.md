<summary>The Greater Rakshasa is a formidable and manipulative fiend, known for its cunning and malevolent nature. This creature serves as a powerful adversary in any campaign, wielding both physical prowess and potent magical abilities. With an armor class of 18, it is quite resilient in combat, and its substantial hit points total 144, making it a daunting opponent. The creature's strengths lie in its high Dexterity and Charisma, enabling it to evade attacks while also effectively manipulating others through its charm and spellcasting. Notably, it possesses damage immunities to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from non-magical attacks, making it further difficult to confront without magic. However, it has vulnerabilities to piercing damage from magic weapons wielded by good creatures, which can be exploited by its adversaries. </summary>

<detail>

The Greater Rakshasa has the following attributes: Strength is 14 with a modifier of +2, which is considered average; Dexterity is 18 with a modifier of +4, rated as good; Constitution is 18, also +4, making it good; Intelligence is 15 with a +2 modifier, regarded as average; Wisdom is 16 with a +3 modifier, classified as good; and Charisma is 20 with a +5 modifier, which is exceptional. The creature excels in skills like Deception with a +10 modifier, making it very good at lying and misleading others, and Insight with +8, indicating a good ability to read intentions and emotions.

One of the Greater Rakshasa's key special abilities is Limited Magic Immunity, which allows it to remain unaffected or undetected by spells of 7th level or lower unless it chooses to be. Additionally, it gains advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects, making its defenses very strong against magic. The Puppet Master ability enhances its charm spells, allowing it to target up to five creatures simultaneously with the charm person spell and extends the dominate person spell's duration to up to 8 hours while maintaining concentration. 

The creature's innate spellcasting relies on its Charisma, with a spell save DC of 18 and a +10 to hit with spell attacks. It can cast a variety of spells at will — such as detect thoughts, disguise self, mage hand, and minor illusion — without needing any material components. It can also cast spells like charm person, detect magic, invisibility, major image, and suggestion three times per day each. Furthermore, it can cast dominate person, fly, plane shift, and true seeing once per day. These spells grant it significant versatility and tactical options during encounters.

During combat, the Greater Rakshasa can make a multiattack, allowing it to execute two claw attacks. Each claw attack has a +7 to hit, which is considered good. It deals an average of 9 slashing damage (2d6 + 2) and can curse its target; this curse prevents the victim from benefiting from short and long rests until removed by specific magic. Another powerful combat ability is Harrowing Visions, which can be used after a recharge of 5-6. This ability creates a 30-foot radius of horrific illusions that can inflict up to 66 (12d10) psychic damage and frighten those affected unless they succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw.

The Greater Rakshasa is also capable of performing legendary actions. It can make a claw attack, which allows it to strike its adversaries even outside of its turn. For a more strategic approach, it can spend 2 actions to use Misleading Escape, becoming invisible while creating an illusory double, effectively confusing its enemies. Alternatively, it can cost 3 actions to cast a spell from its innate spell list, adding more power to its already impressive magical capabilities during combat.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Limited Magic Immunity:** The greater rakshasa can't be affected or detected by spells of 7th level or lower unless it wishes to be. It has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.
- **Puppet Master:** When the greater rakshasa casts the charm person spell, it can target up to five creatures. When it casts the dominate person spell, the spell's duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The greater rakshasa's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The greater rakshasa can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: detect thoughts, disguise self, mage hand, minor illusion
3/day each: charm person, detect magic, invisibility, major image, suggestion
1/day each: dominate person, fly, plane shift, true seeing

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The greater rakshasa makes two claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, and the target is cursed if it is a creature. The magical curse takes effect whenever the target takes a short or long rest, filling the target's thoughts with horrible images and dreams. The cursed target gains no benefit from finishing a short or long rest. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.
- **Harrowing Visions (Recharge 5-6):** The greater rakshasa chooses a point it can see within 60 feet, conjuring a terrifying manifestation of its enemies' worst fears in a 30-foot-radius around the point. Each non-rakshasa in the area must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 66 (12d10) psychic damage and becomes frightened for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't frightened. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The greater rakshasa can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The greater rakshasa regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Claw Attack:** The greater rakshasa makes one claw attack.
- **Misleading Escape (Costs 2 Actions):** The greater rakshasa becomes invisible at the same time that an illusory double of itself appears where it is standing. This switch is indiscernible to others. After the double appears, the greater rakshasa can move up to its speed. Both effects last until the start of the greater rakshasa's next turn, but the invisibility ends if the greater rakshasa makes an attack or casts a spell before then.
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions):** The greater rakshasa casts a spell from its list of innate spells, consuming a use of the spell as normal.
