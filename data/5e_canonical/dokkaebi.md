<detail>

The Dokkaebi has an Armor Class of 12, which is considered average, making it somewhat challenging to hit but not overly difficult. With 78 hit points, calculated by rolling 12 eight-sided dice and adding 24, it has good endurance in battle, capable of withstanding damage for a fair amount of time. The Dokkaebi moves at a speed of 30 feet, allowing it to navigate the battlefield effectively. It has a Challenge Rating of 2, which signifies that it provides a moderate level of challenge to a party, making it suitable for mid-level adventurers.

In terms of attributes, the Dokkaebi possesses a Strength score of 16, which gives it a modifier of +3, categorized as good, enhancing its melee attacks and grappling ability. Its Dexterity is also commendable at 15 (+2), which bolsters its initiative and improves its defense against physical attacks. The Constitution score of 14 (+2) contributes positively to its hit points and stamina. Its Intelligence score is 13 (+1), which provides a slight bonus for knowledge checks. However, its Wisdom is low at 9 (-1), making it vulnerable to certain effects like wisdom saving throws. The Charisma score sits at 12 (+1), affording it limited effectiveness in social interactions.

For saving throws, the Dokkaebi has a +4 bonus to Dexterity saves, which is considered good, enhancing its resilience against effects that require a Dexterity saving throw. Its skills include perception at a -1 modifier, indicating that it has very bad awareness, despite its darkvision allowing it to see in darkness up to 60 feet. The creature can communicate in Common, Elvish, and Sylvan.

In combat, the Dokkaebi can utilize its special abilities to gain tactical advantages. The "Invisibility Hat" allows it to magically become invisible. This ability can only be used by others if they have the Dokkaebi's permission to wear the hat, which makes tactical cooperation important in gameplay since the hat loses its magical properties if not returned upon request. The "Wrestler" ability provides the Dokkaebi with an advantage on all Strength (Athletics) checks made to grapple as well as on checks and saves to escape grapples, enhancing its effectiveness in controlling opponents.

In terms of actions, the Dokkaebi can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three attacks using a club each turn. With a melee weapon attack bonus of +5, the Dokkaebi employs its "Dokkaebi Bangmangi" attack to inflict 5 (1d4+3) bludgeoning damage on a target at a range of 5 feet, which represents a decent damage output for a creature of its Challenge Rating. The Dokkaebi also has the ability to cast "Invisibility," allowing it to magically become invisible until it either attacks or its concentration ends, providing it with strategic maneuverability in combat.

Overall, the Dokkaebi stands out as a versatile creature, capable of engaging in both direct confrontations and clever evasion with its unique abilities and spells. Its playful and unpredictable nature can significantly impact the dynamics of any encounter it participates in.</detail>
