<summary>The Angelic Enforcer is a powerful creature known for its role as a divine protector and punisher within celestial realms. This large celestial being embodies the principles of law and good, making it a formidable presence in combat. Its notable strengths include high armor class, significant hit points, and a range of potent abilities and spells that allow it to deal heavy damage while resisting many forms of attacks. Additionally, the enforcer possesses innate spellcasting abilities, making it effective in both combat and supportive roles. Its primary weaknesses include a vulnerability to magic attacks, despite its resistance to nonmagical damage, and its reliance on maintaining a lawful good nature which can impact its interactions with potentially evil characters.</summary>

<detail>

The statistics of the Angelic Enforcer are as follows: it has a Strength score of 22, providing a strong modifier of +6, indicating exceptional physical power. Its Dexterity score of 18 grants a good +4 modifier, allowing for decent agility and reflexes. The Constitution score of 18 also gives a good +4 modifier, providing substantial endurance. The Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are all 18 and 20, respectively, which correspond to a good +4 for Intelligence and Wisdom, alongside an exceptional +5 for Charisma. This makes it not only tough but also very wise and charismatic, affecting its interactions and spellcasting capability.

In terms of saving throws, the Angelic Enforcer has a Wisdom saving throw of +9 and a Charisma saving throw of +9, both representing exceptional defenses against effects targeting these attributes. The skills it excels in include Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival, each having a bonus of +9, making it highly effective in social and situational awareness contexts. 

The enforcer has damage immunities to radiant damage, which means it takes no damage from this type of attack, and it has resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, reflecting an overall good defense against most physical harm. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, and frightened, providing exceptional resilience against debilitating effects. It possesses truesight to a range of 120 feet, allowing the enforcer to see through illusions and deceptions, and a passive perception of 19 contributing to its effectiveness in noticing threats. The creature can communicate in all languages and has telepathy with a range of 120 feet, facilitating communication even in challenging situations.

The special abilities of the Angelic Enforcer include Blazing Weapons, where its weapon attacks are magical and deal an additional 4d8 fire damage, significantly enhancing its melee effectiveness. Its Divine Awareness ability allows it to know when it hears a lie, which is very useful in both combat and negotiating situations. The enforcer's Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells, making it exceptionally durable against magical attacks. It also possesses innate spellcasting abilities, allowing it to cast spells such as Detect Evil and Good at will, and can cast Counterspell, Dispel Evil and Good, Dispel Magic, and Protection from Evil and Good three times per day each, making it flexible in both combat and protective roles.

In terms of actions, the Angelic Enforcer can make two melee attacks during its turn, known as Multiattack, but it can only use its Bite attack once per round. The Bite attack has a +10 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 17 piercing damage plus the potential for a curse if the target fails a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. This curse hinders healing, making the Bite a significant threat. Its Greatsword attack similarly has a +10 to hit and deals 20 slashing damage in addition to 18 fire damage, representing a formidable total damage output.

Lastly, the Angelic Enforcer has a Change Shape ability, allowing it to polymorph into a humanoid or a lion that has a challenge rating no higher than its own and revert back to its true form. Upon changing forms, it retains its game statistics and ability to speak but adopts the statistics and capabilities of the new form for combat purposes. This versatility in form and capability makes the Angelic Enforcer a unique and unpredictable threat or ally in various scenarios.</detail>
