<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>The Diminution Drake is a Medium-sized dragon of neutral evil alignment, known for its cunning and deceptive capabilities. With an Armor Class of 15 and 71 hit points, it can withstand moderate damage while effectively maneuvering in combat due to its fly speed of 60 feet and walk speed of 30 feet. As a Challenge Rating 5 creature, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, particularly due to its unique size-altering abilities and poison-based attacks. Its strengths lie in speed, stealth, and its potent shrinking abilities, while it is particularly weak against psychic attacks, given its low Intelligence score. </summary>

<detail>

The Diminution Drake possesses the following ability scores: Strength 14 (+2), Dexterity 18 (+4), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 6 (-2), Wisdom 13 (+1), and Charisma 10 (+0). The Dexterity score is very good, providing it with excellent agility and reflexes, while its Intelligence is very bad, indicating poor mental acuity. The drake has solid saving throws with Dexterity at +7 (very good), Constitution at +4 (average), and Wisdom also at +4 (average). It is skilled in perception, stealth, and survival, each at +4 (average).

As for immunities, the Diminution Drake has damage immunity to poison and is condition-immuned to being blinded, deafened, and poisoned. Its blindsight at 30 feet enhances its ability to detect unseen creatures within the range. The drake understands Common and Draconic but lacks the ability to speak, limiting its communication. 

The Diminution Drake has several unique abilities and actions:
- **Change Scale**: This ability allows the drake to change its size to Tiny or Small as a bonus action for 1 minute. While shrunk, it cannot use its In One Bite attack but gains advantage on stinger attacks against larger creatures. It can also end this effect early as a bonus action, providing it with tactical flexibility.
  
- **Keen Smell**: This special ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, increasing its effectiveness in detecting creatures nearby.

In terms of combat actions, the Diminution Drake can perform the following:
- **Multiattack**: The drake can make two claw attacks and one stinger attack in a single turn, efficiently dealing damage to multiple foes.
  
- **Claw**: This melee weapon attack has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 10 slashing damage (2d6 + 3).

- **In One Bite**: With a +7 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, this attack targets one Tiny creature. If it hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature’s hit points drop to 0 and it becomes stable. If it remains swallowed for a minute, it dies, providing the drake a powerful means of incapacitating foes. Should the drake die while having a creature swallowed, that creature’s hit points return to its original amount and it falls prone nearby.

- **Stinger**: With a +7 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, this melee attack deals 6 piercing damage (1d4 + 4) and requires the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target's size is reduced by one category until they complete a short or long rest. This allows the drake to alter the battlefield by decreasing enemies' sizes, thereby limiting their capabilities.

- **Shrinking Breath** (Recharge 5-6): This potent breath weapon allows the drake to exhale poison in a line that is 15 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 17 poison damage (5d6) and is reduced in size by one category until completing a short or long rest. Successful saves halve the damage without size reduction, making it a dangerous area attack that can shape encounters by shrinking foes.

In summary, the Diminution Drake excels in mobility, size manipulation, and stealth, using its powers to control engagements and undermine opponents effectively.</detail>
