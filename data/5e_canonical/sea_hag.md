<summary>A Sea Hag is a grotesque, fey creature that dwells in the depths of the ocean or along desolate, rocky shores. With matted hair, slimy skin, and an appearance so horrifying it can paralyze those who look upon her, Sea Hags delight in spreading misery and despair. They are skilled in illusion and enchantment magic, using their powers to lure sailors to watery graves or curse those who trespass into their domain. Sea Hags are vicious and cruel, often forming covens with other hags to amplify their powers and terrorize coastal communities.</summary>

<summary>The Sea Hag is a Medium-sized Fey creature that embodies the sinister and unsettling aspects of the sea. With an Armor Class of 14, it is moderately tough to hit in combat, and with 52 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage before being taken down. The hag can move at a speed of 30 feet on land and 40 feet in water, showcasing its amphibious nature, which allows it to thrive in both environments. As a Challenge Rating 2 creature, it poses a formidable threat to lower-level adventurers, primarily using deception, psychological manipulation, and spellcasting to overwhelm its foes. Key strengths include its high Strength and Constitution scores, coupled with strong Charisma, which aids in its spellcasting and social deception. However, its Dexterity is only average, making it less effective at avoiding attacks compared to faster foes. </summary>

<detail>

The Sea Hag's Strength is 16 (+3), making it very good at physical melee attacks; its Constitution score of 16 (+3) enhances its hit points and makes it resilient against effects that might cause it to be weakened. Dexterity at 12 (+1) is average, which impacts its ability to dodge attacks and affects ranged attacks. The hag's Intelligence is also average at 12 (+1), while its Wisdom and Charisma are both 12 (+1) and 16 (+3) respectively. The hag is effective at deception and charm-based attempts, benefitting from a good Deception modifier of +5 and a decent Insight score of +3. 

In terms of saving throws, the Sea Hag has a +5 for Constitution and +3 for Wisdom, making it good at resisting effects that impact health and bad mental statuses. It has darkvision, allowing it to see in low-light conditions for 60 feet, and possesses a passive perception of 11, which is average. The languages it speaks are Aquan, Common, and Giant, giving it a diverse means of communication.

The Sea Hag has several unique abilities that enhance its cryptic and deadly nature. The Amphibious trait allows it to easily navigate through water and breathe both air and water. The Curse ability lets the hag place a magical curse on any creature that makes a bargain with her, rendering them vulnerable to her spells for 30 days. When cursed, targets automatically fail saving throws against her scrying and geas spells, and the hag can cast Control Weather centered on the affected creature.

The hag's Innate Spellcasting, based on its Charisma (spell save DC 13), allows it to cast certain spells without needing material components. These spells include At Will spells such as Dancing Lights and Disguise Self, useful for creating illusions and manipulating perceptions, as well as more formidable spells like Control Weather, Geas, and Scrying, each usable once per day. 

In combat, the Sea Hag can use its Claws attack, where it strikes with a +5 to hit, making it good at engaging foes in melee. A successful hit inflicts 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. Additionally, it employs the Death Glare action, using its gaze to frighten enemies. A creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or else they drop to 0 hit points on a failure, or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage on a success.

As a bonus action, the Sea Hag can use Horrific Transformation, causing creatures that can see her within 30 feet to make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. Targets under her curse automatically fail this saving throw. On failure, they become frightened until the end of their next turn, while successful saves grant immunity to this effect for 24 hours. This ability creates tension and fear, solidifying the hag’s role as a master of psychological manipulation and horror in encounters.

The Sea Hag is a Medium fey creature known for its cunning and unsettling appearance. It serves as an antagonist in watery realms, often utilizing its amphibious nature and illusion powers to deceive and terrify adventurers. With an impressive swim speed and abilities that instill fear, the Sea Hag can incapacitate its foes mentally while delivering considerable damage with its claws. However, its moderate challenge rating and average defenses make it vulnerable to coordinated attacks from a party of adventurers. Its effectiveness in combat is amplified by its ability to manipulate its appearance and create fear, but it is not without its weaknesses as its relatively low hit points can lead to its downfall.

The Sea Hag has an Armor Class of 14, reflecting good natural defenses, and 51 hit points, which are considered average for a creature of its challenge rating (CR 2). It has a movement speed of 30 feet on land and 40 feet while swimming, giving it a very good ability to navigate aquatic environments. Its attributes include a Strength score of 13 (+3, which is good), Dexterity of 12 (+1, which is average), Constitution of 14 (+2, which is good), Intelligence of 12 (+1, which is average), Wisdom of 12 (+1, which is average), and Charisma of 12 (+1, which is average). The Sea Hag possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and a Perception score of 11, indicative of its average awareness. With a Stealth score of 13, it can blend in reasonably well, especially when taking advantage of its underwater camouflage.

The Sea Hag has several noteworthy abilities. Its Amphibious quality allows it to breathe both air and water, making it equally comfortable in both environments. Fey Resilience grants it resistance to being charmed or incapacitated, protecting it from a range of mental effects. The Horrific Appearance ability enables the Sea Hag to instill fear in nearby humanoids; when a creature that can see it begins its turn within 30 feet, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 12. If that creature fails, it becomes frightened until the start of its next turn. This ability can dramatically change the dynamics of a combat encounter by disabling opponents. Underwater Camouflage enhances the hag’s stealth ability when submerged, making it significantly harder to spot (with a Stealth rating of 18) while not using its Illusory Appearance.

In terms of direct actions, the Sea Hag can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to utilize its Death Glare ability followed by two Claw attacks. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack that deals 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage on a hit, which is a good damage output for its challenge rating. The Death Glare forces a creature within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 12; failure results in being frightened until the end of its next turn. If the target is already frightened and fails the save, it is reduced to 0 hit points, making this a powerful and potentially devastating move in the right circumstances. 

As a bonus action, the Sea Hag can utilize Illusory Appearance, cloaking itself and its possessions in a magical illusion that disguises it as a humanoid creature of similar size. This illusion can create strategic advantages in both combat and social interactions, as it enables deceptive tactics. 

For reactions, the Sea Hag has the Barnacle Block ability, which allows it to absorb some incoming damage. When the hag is damaged by an attack it can see, it can reduce the damage taken by 4 (1d8) by shifting the barnacles and scales on its body, enhancing its survivability in combat situations.

Overall, the Sea Hag’s unique blend of fear-inducing abilities, solid melee attacks, and magical illusions allows it to be a memorable and formidable opponent in aquatic settings.</detail>

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11

**Languages** Aquan, Common, Giant

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

***Amphibious***. The hag can breathe air and water.

***Horrific Appearance***. Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.

Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.

###### Actions

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage.

***Death Glare***. The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.

***Illusory Appearance***. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</statblock>
