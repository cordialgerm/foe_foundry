<MonsterName/>Golem, Chain</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Chain Golem is a formidable Large Construct that is unaligned, often employed by those who seek to harness its mechanical might. With a high armor class of 16 and substantial hit points totaling 119, it boasts notable durability for a creature of its kind. The Chain Golem is adept in grappling and restraining foes, making it effective in close-range combat. Its strengths include strong physical attacks that can inflict both damage and debilitating diseases on its targets. However, its low intelligence and charisma scores suggest it lacks sophistication in tactics and social interactions. The Golem's unique abilities, like Infernal Tetanus and Magic Resistance, heighten its role as a powerful combatant that can withstand spell effects while also posing serious threats to adventurers who engage it.</summary>

<detail>

The Chain Golem has the following attributes:
- Strength: 18 (+4), which provides a good modifier for physical attacks.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), giving it an average modifier for initiative and Dexterity saving throws.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), providing a good modifier for hit points and Constitution saves.
- Intelligence: 5 (-3), resulting in a very bad modifier, limiting its cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 11 (+0), indicating an average ability to resist certain effects.
- Charisma: 1 (-5), resulting in a very bad modifier, representing its total lack of social skill.

The Golem is immune to a broad range of conditions, including being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and prone, making it exceptionally resilient in various combat scenarios. It possesses darkvision out to 60 feet and has a passive perception of 10 but lacks the ability to communicate verbally despite knowing the Infernal language.

Key special abilities of the Chain Golem include:
- **Construct Nature:** This grants the Golem an exceptional level of independence from biological needs, meaning it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Immutable Form:** The Golem is immune to any spells or effects that could alter its form, ensuring its effectiveness in combat remains consistent.
- **Infernal Tetanus:** This toxic trait infects creatures that fail to resist its effects, leading to debilitating symptoms that can severely weaken the target's Dexterity and mobility. The infected creatures must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw after long rests, facing potential paralysis or becoming exhausted depending on their success or failure.
- **Magic Resistance:** The Chain Golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it very difficult to incapacitate with magic.
- **Magic Weapons:** Its weapon attacks are considered magical, bypassing resistance to non-magical damage.

In terms of actions:
- **Multiattack:** The Golem can perform two Chain attacks in a single turn, maximizing its potential damage output.
- **Chain:** This melee attack has a +7 modifier to hit, extending 15 feet and dealing an average of 18 (4d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is hit, it not only suffers damage but also contracts the Infernal Tetanus disease unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Additionally, if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it becomes grappled, further controlling its movement (with an escape DC of 14).
- **Imprison:** If the Golem grapples a Medium creature, it can create a prison of chains that restrains the target and inflicts 14 (4d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The imprisoned creature or an adjacent ally can attempt to free the captive, requiring a DC 16 Strength check, but in doing so, they incur 7 (2d6) piercing damage as a consequence.

The Chain Golem serves as a resilient and punishing entity in combat, making it a challenging adversary for any party that dares to confront it.</detail>
