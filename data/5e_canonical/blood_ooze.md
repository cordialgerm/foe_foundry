<summary>The Blood Ooze is a large, unaligned ooze that presents a formidable challenge in combat environments due to its unique ability to drain life from its opponents. With an Armor Class of 8 and 76 hit points, it relies on its resilience and special abilities rather than defensive capabilities. The creature excels in close-quarters combat, allowing it to inflict necrotic damage to whittle down the health of its foes while simultaneously healing itself. However, its dexterity score of 6 indicates a very bad ability to avoid attacks, making it vulnerable when targeted. It possesses immunities to several damaging conditions and types, enhancing its survival capabilities. Overall, the Blood Ooze is a dangerous foe, especially in scenarios where it can engage multiple enemies at close range.</summary>

<detail>

The Blood Ooze has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 6 (-2), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 8 (-1), and Charisma 2 (-4). Its Constitution score of 18 provides it with a good endurance level, enabling it to sustain damage in battle. Its very low Intelligence and Charisma scores indicate that the ooze lacks cognitive abilities and social interactions.

In terms of skills, the Blood Ooze benefits from damage immunities against acid, fire, necrotic, and slashing damage, which makes it very resilient to common forms of attacks. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, and prone, which significantly reduces the chances of crowd control effects being effective against it. It also has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures undetected by sight.

The Blood Ooze has some notable special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The Amorphous trait allows it to move through narrow spaces without hindrance, giving it exceptional maneuverability on the battlefield. Its Blood Drain ability is particularly dangerous; when a creature touches it or attacks it within melee range, the ooze inflicts 5 necrotic damage while gaining temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. This ability can significantly extend its lifespan in combat, as it can stack temporary hit points from multiple sources, although these temporary hit points cannot exceed half of the ooze's maximum HP. If the ooze takes radiant damage, it does lose the ability to drain blood until the start of its next turn but retains any temporary HP gained prior to that point. The Spider Climb trait allows it to navigate difficult surfaces, including ceilings, making it a sneaky opponent in various terrains.

In terms of actions, the Blood Ooze employs a Pseudopod attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet and can deal 6 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 16 necrotic damage. The necrotic damage it inflicts is particularly effective, as it results in the ooze gaining temporary HP equal to the damage taken by the opponent.

Finally, the ooze has a powerful reaction called Overflow. When hit by a melee attack, it can impose a DC 15 Constitution saving throw on the attacker, inflicting 11 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. The creature benefits from gaining temporary HP equal to the necrotic damage dealt, thus making it more challenging for enemies to eliminate it once the battle has begun. This combination of abilities and actions makes the Blood Ooze a dangerous and resilient adversary in any encounter.</detail>

It can add temporary hp gained from this trait to temporary hp gained from its pseudopod attack and Overflow reaction. Its temporary hp can't exceed half its maximum hp. If the ooze takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the ooze's next turn, although it retains any temporary hp it previously gained.

The ooze gains temporary hp equal to the necrotic damage taken.
