<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>A Night Hag is a fiendish creature that haunts the dreams of mortals, feeding on fear and misery. These ancient, malevolent hags have withered, gray skin and glowing red eyes. Night Hags can enter the Ethereal Plane to stalk their victims and infiltrate their dreams, where they plant nightmarish visions and sap the victim's life force. They are known for their dark magic, casting spells that curse or corrupt, and for their ability to shapeshift into more appealing forms to deceive their targets. Night Hags often collect the souls of their victims, trading them in the infernal markets of the Lower Planes.</summary>
