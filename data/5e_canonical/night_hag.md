<summary>A Night Hag is a fiendish creature that haunts the dreams of mortals, feeding on fear and misery. These ancient, malevolent hags have withered, gray skin and glowing red eyes. Night Hags can enter the Ethereal Plane to stalk their victims and infiltrate their dreams, where they plant nightmarish visions and sap the victim's life force. They are known for their dark magic, casting spells that curse or corrupt, and for their ability to shapeshift into more appealing forms to deceive their targets. Night Hags often collect the souls of their victims, trading them in the infernal markets of the Lower Planes.</summary>

<summary>The Night Hag is a Medium Fey creature embodying the essence of cunning and malice. With a challenge rating of 5, it poses a significant threat to adventurers, utilizing its formidable magical abilities and deceptive nature to manipulate foes. Its strengths lie in its solid defenses, including a high Armor Class of 17 and a substantial pool of 105 hit points, derived from its Constitution. The Night Hag's magical resistance grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells, rendering it difficult for spellcasters to neutralize. While it excels in magical deception and manipulation, its lack of mobility—moving at only 30 feet per turn—could be seen as a vulnerability.</summary>

<detail>

The Night Hag possesses a variety of attributes that bolster its effectiveness in combat. Its Strength score is 18, providing a very good modifier of +4 for melee attacks, while its Dexterity of 14 gives it a good +2 modifier for initiatives and dexterity-based skills. The creature’s Constitution score of 16 translates to a good +3 modifier, increasing its hit points and resilience. With an Intelligence of 16 (+3), the Night Hag is adept in arcana and deception, which align with its manipulative abilities. Wisdom and Charisma are also both strong at 14 (+2) and 16 (+3) respectively, allowing for insightful and persuasive engagements.

In terms of saving throws, the Night Hag has a +6 in Constitution and a +5 in Wisdom, indicating a good level of resilience against physical and mental challenges. The creature is skilled in several areas, boasting a +6 bonus to arcana and deception, along with a +5 to insight, perception, and stealth—making it a versatile adversary in both direct confrontations and subterfuge.

The Night Hag's special abilities further enhance its role. The "Curse" ability allows it to inflict a magical curse that lasts for 30 days, causing the target to have disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag, significantly hampering their combat capability. Additionally, the "Evil" ability radiates an aura of malevolence, unsettling those nearby. Its "Magic Resistance" lets it handle magical threats more effectively, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

In terms of actions, the Night Hag can attack with its "Claws," which provide a +5 to hit and deal an average of 12 slashing damage, while also applying its curse. For crowd control, the "Sleep Touch" allows it to incapacitate a target for up to 4 hours, making it a strategic tool in combat; however, it can use this ability only once until it finishes a long rest. The "Shapeshift" ability demonstrates its deceptive nature, allowing it to transform into a Small or Medium humanoid and retain its claws, enhancing its adaptability in various situations.

The Night Hag also has access to powerful magical abilities, such as "Planar Travel," which it can use three times per day to shift between planes of existence, making it challenging to pin down during combat. Its "Nightmare Haunting" ability is particularly sinister, allowing it to inflict lasting psychological damage on a cursed sleeping victim. If the target endures an hour of nightmares, their hit point maximum decreases, and should it reach zero, they die with their soul captured by the hag. This ability emphasizes the Night Hag's role as a terror in the nighttime and highlights the threat it poses even beyond a traditional confrontation.

Overall, the Night Hag serves as a compelling foe within the game, leveraging its mix of offensive capabilities, durability, and magical deceptions to instill fear and confusion among adventurers.

The Night Hag is a Medium fiend that embodies the essence of nightmare and despair, making it a formidable foe in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons. With a challenge rating of 5, the Night Hag is recognized for its magical abilities and psychological warfare. Its strengths lie in its solid defenses, notable speed, and ability to incapacitate foes with sorrow, while its weakness is its reliance on relatively low hit points compared to other creatures of its challenge rating. In combat, the Night Hag uses a combination of physical attacks and spellcasting, along with its unique ability to enter the Ethereal Plane, which allows for tactical retreats and ambushes.

The Night Hag has an Armor Class of 17, providing it with good protection due to its natural armor. It possesses 104 hit points, indicating moderate resilience. With a speed of 30 feet, it can maneuver efficiently in battle. Its attributes include Strength at +4 (good), Dexterity at +2 (average), Constitution at +3 (good), Intelligence at +3 (good), Wisdom at +2 (average), and Charisma at +6 (exceptional). The Night Hag also has notable sensory capabilities with truesight up to 120 feet, a Perception score of 15 (good), and Stealth at 15 (good). It can communicate in Abyssal, Common, Infernal, and Primordial languages.

One of the special abilities of the Night Hag is Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it very resilient to magic-based attacks. In terms of actions, the Night Hag can perform a Multiattack, which includes using the Cause Sorrow ability, followed by two attacks either using Claw or Arcane Bolt. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, reaching 5 feet and dealing 18 slashing damage on a hit (average), while Arcane Bolt is a ranged spell attack with +6 to hit and a range of 60 feet, dealing 19 force damage on a hit (average). 

The Cause Sorrow ability is particularly insidious, as it forces one creature within 10 feet of the Night Hag to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they become incapacitated and are filled with sorrow for one minute, experiencing distressing visions or memories. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns (if conscious) or at the end of each hour (if unconscious) to shake off the effect. 

In its spellcasting capabilities, the Night Hag can cast spells using Charisma as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 14. It can cast the spells ray of enfeeblement and silent image at will, while having two daily uses each of detect thoughts, plane shift (self only), and sleep. Ray of enfeeblement weakens a target, reducing their damage output, silent image creates an illusory object or creature that can deceive foes, detect thoughts allows the hag to probe the minds of creatures, plane shift permits her to travel between planes, and sleep can incapacitate multiple creatures if they fail their saving throw.

The Night Hag also possesses a few bonus actions that enhance its versatility in combat. The Change Shape ability enables it to transform into a Medium or smaller Humanoid or revert back to its true Fiend form, with its statistics remaining unchanged aside from size. The Etherealness ability allows it to shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, thus providing a method for escape or repositioning. While on the Ethereal Plane, the Night Hag can use Cause Sorrow against unconscious targets not on its current plane.

Overall, the Night Hag combines magical prowess with psychological manipulation, making her a uniquely dangerous opponent that challenges both the combat and mental resilience of players.</detail>
