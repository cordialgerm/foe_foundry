<summary>A Succubus is a fiendish, seductive creature known for its ability to charm and manipulate mortals. These demons take on an alluring, humanoid appearance, often using their beauty to deceive and corrupt their victims. Succubi drain the life force of their prey through physical contact, particularly kisses, leaving their victims weakened or dead. They are highly skilled in using magic to manipulate emotions, alter memories, and disguise themselves. Succubi thrive on temptation and chaos, often using their powers to turn mortals against one another or to carry out dark schemes for more powerful demons.</summary>

<summary>The Succubus is a Medium fiend with the ability to shapechange, known for its deceptive nature and seductive powers. As a Challenge Rating 4 creature, it possesses a solid mix of offensive capabilities and supportive abilities that can severely hinder opponents and manipulate allies. With an Armor Class of 15, it has decent defenses augmented by its ability to fly at a speed of 60 feet, making it agile in combat. It boasts 79 hit points, allowing it to endure some damage, but its strength primarily lies in its charm and psychic attacks. The Succubus is defined by its exceptionally high Charisma of +7, making it incredibly effective at charm-related abilities, though its physical attributes are rather weak, with a Strength score of -1. Overall, the Succubus excels at controlling the battlefield, but it is vulnerable to direct attacks and can be subdued if its charms fail.</summary>

<detail>

The Succubus has the following attributes: Strength -1 (very bad), Dexterity +3 (good), Constitution +1 (average), Intelligence +2 (average), Wisdom +1 (average), and Charisma +7 (exceptional). Its high Dexterity enhances its ability to avoid attacks and increases its initiative in combat, while its exceptional Charisma primarily influences its charm and manipulation tactics.

The creature's special abilities include "Telepathic Bond," which allows the Succubus to communicate telepathically with any creature it has charmed, without range limitations, even across different planes of existence. This enhances its capacity for manipulation and deception by enabling long-distance control over its targets.

In combat, the Succubus can take multiple actions. It has a "Multiattack" option, allowing it to make two Claw attacks or combine a Claw attack with a Draining Kiss attack. Its "Claw" attack, used only in its fiend form, has a +5 to hit and deals 10 slashing damage plus an additional 7 psychic damage. The "Draining Kiss" is especially dangerous, delivering 15 psychic damage and reducing the target's hit point maximum by the same amount until they finish a long rest. If the reduction brings a creature's maximum HP to 0, that target instantly dies.

One of the most impactful actions is "Charm," which targets one humanoid within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for one day, following the succubus’s commands. If harmed or given a harmful command, the target can make a save to end the effect. Additionally, after succeeding on the save or when charmed ends, the target is immune to that specific Succubus's charm for 24 hours.

For bonus actions, the Succubus can "Change Shape" into a Small or Medium humanoid or revert back to its true fiend form without changing its statistics other than size. It can also use "Etherealness," allowing it to shift into the Ethereal Plane, making it difficult to target from the Material Plane.

As a reaction, the Succubus has "Defend Me, Love!" which activates when a creature within 5 feet of a charmed creature attacks it. The Succubus can command the charmed creature to use its reaction to make a melee attack against the aggressor, providing a safeguard against potential threats.

In summary, the Succubus is a potent manipulator with strong charm abilities and psychic attacks, capable of dominating the battlefield while remaining elusive to direct confrontation.</detail>
