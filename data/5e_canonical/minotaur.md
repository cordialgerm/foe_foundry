<summary>A Minotaur is a fearsome, humanoid creature with the head of a bull and the body of a massive, muscular man. Minotaurs are known for their incredible strength, aggressive nature, and skill in combat. They often wield large axes or clubs, using their horns to charge at enemies and gore them in battle. Minotaurs are often found in labyrinthine ruins or underground lairs, where they use their keen sense of direction and savage cunning to hunt down intruders. Though they are often depicted as brutal and violent, some Minotaurs live in small tribes with their own customs and hierarchies.</summary>
