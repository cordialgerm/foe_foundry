<summary>The Faux-Garou is a Medium Construct that operates independently and is unaligned. It has an armor class of 12, which is considered average due to its natural armor. With 93 hit points, derived from rolling 11d8 plus a constitution modifier of 4, this creature can withstand a considerable amount of damage in battle, making it a formidable opponent. The Faux-Garou moves with a walking speed of 30 feet and presents a challenge rating of 5, which translates to 1,800 experience points for players who defeat it. This creature is adept at hunting particular targets, benefiting from special abilities that enhance its tracking and combat capabilities, but it lacks mental prowess, reflected in its low intelligence and charisma scores.</summary>

<detail>

The physical attributes of the Faux-Garou include a Strength score of 17, giving it a +3 modifier, which is good and enhances its melee combat effectiveness. Its Dexterity is 11, providing no modifier, resulting in average agility and reflexes. The creature's Constitution is strong at 18, granting a +4 modifier, making it quite resilient. Its Intelligence is exceptionally low at 4, leading to a -3 modifier, indicating a very limited ability to understand complex situations or engage in tactical thinking. The Wisdom score of 12 corresponds to a +1 modifier, which is average, giving it some capability in perception, while its Charisma score of 5, with a -3 modifier, is also very low, suggesting it lacks any charm or social influence.

In terms of skills, the Faux-Garou has a perception bonus of +1, contributing to its ability to detect hidden enemies or track targets. Additionally, it is immune to a broad range of conditions, including being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it a reliable force on the battlefield without the risk of being incapacitated by typical effects. Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet, with a passive perception score of 14, which is good and allows it to be alert to its surroundings. While it understands the language of its creator, the Faux-Garou is unable to speak.

The Faux-Garou has several special abilities, including Construct Nature, which allows it to function without the need for air, food, drink, or sleep. Its Druidic Vengeance ability enables it to gain advantage on attacks against specific creatures it was designed to hunt, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks related to finding and tracking them. Its Immutable Form gives it immunity to any spells or effects that would alter its form, and Magic Resistance provides advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its defense against magic users. Additionally, its weapon attacks are considered magical, and when it hits, it deals an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, making its offensive capabilities exceptional.

In combat, the Faux-Garou can execute a Multiattack, which consists of using its Frightening Gaze ability followed by two Claw attacks. The Claw attack has a +6 to hit, targeting a creature within 5 feet, and deals 7 slashing damage combined with the additional 10 necrotic damage from its necrotic weapon ability. The Frightening Gaze allows it to fix its gaze on a creature within 60 feet, potentially causing the target to become frightened for up to one minute unless they succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. This effect can significantly impact the target’s combat effectiveness, as frightened creatures have disadvantages on ability checks and attack rolls while the Faux-Garou can maintain pressure on them. Additionally, the target can attempt to save against this effect at the end of each of its turns, with the consequences of being immune to the Faux-Garou's frightful influence for the next 24 hours if they succeed.

As a bonus action, the Faux-Garou can Change Shape, transforming into a Large or smaller Beast that matches the type of lycanthrope it resembles (for example, turning into a wolf if it resembles a werewolf). In this form, its physical attributes remain the same except for size and speed, allowing it to adapt to various battle scenarios. However, it retains its constructed appearance and claws regardless of form. Any items worn or carried do not change with it, and upon its death, it reverts back to its true form.</detail>
