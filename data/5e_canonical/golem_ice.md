<MonsterName/>Golem, Ice</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Ice Golem is a formidable large construct that serves as a guardian or protector in icy environments. This creature stands out for its high durability and its ability to grapple and preserve enemies within its icy core, rendering them incapacitated. With an Armor Class of 16 and 114 hit points, the Ice Golem is tough to take down. It boasts a Strength score of 20 (+5), making its physical attacks quite powerful, while its Constitution score of 18 (+4) enhances its resilience in combat. However, its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are extremely low, indicating it is not designed for complex problem-solving or interaction with others. The Ice Golem's primary strengths lie in its immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage, as well as being immune to a wide array of conditions. It can effectively deal with adventurers who rely on physical attacks likely due to its damage immunities against nonmagical attacks that are not made with adamantine weapons.</summary>

<detail>

The Ice Golem's attributes include a Strength of 20 (+5), which signifies exceptional physical prowess, making its attacks very effective. Its Dexterity is average at 11 (+0), indicating it doesn’t have inherent agility. With a Constitution score of 18 (+4), it has good health and stamina. Intelligence at 3 (-4) is very bad, meaning it lacks reasoning capabilities. Wisdom is average at 10 (+0), and Charisma at 1 (-5) indicates it is very bad at interacting with others.

In terms of its special abilities, the Ice Golem has a unique Ice Cavity feature that enables it to trap and preserve creatures within it. When it suffers 15 or more points of fire damage in one turn, the cavity can liquefy. Should a creature touch it or make a melee attack against it while within 5 feet, it inflicts 9 (2d8) cold damage. If the Ice Cavity liquefies, a creature can use an action to attempt to pull a petrified creature from the Golem, although this also inflicts 9 (2d8) cold damage and requires a successful Strength check to accomplish. The Golem possesses Immutable Form, granting it immunity to spells or effects that alter its form, enhancing its defense. Additionally, it has Magic Resistance, providing it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it even tougher to defeat.

The Ice Golem can perform a Multiattack action, allowing it to make two Slam attacks or one Slam attack in conjunction with using its Preserve Creature ability. The Slam attack has a +8 bonus to hit and, on a successful hit, deals 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 9 (2d8) cold damage. If it grapples a creature that is Medium or smaller, the escape DC is 16, making it quite difficult for such creatures to escape once engaged.

The Preserve Creature action is particularly noteworthy, as it allows the Golem to grapple a creature and prevent it from breathing, essentially freezing it in place. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of its next turn, or else it takes 18 (4d8) cold damage and becomes petrified within the Ice Golem for total cover from attacks and effects. If the damage from this ability reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it automatically stabilizes, but a successful save reduces the damage by half and ejects the creature to a space nearby. The creature remains preserved in the Ice Cavity until it thaws or takes fire damage, but the Golem is limited to preserving only one creature at a time and cannot use this ability if the cavity is frozen.

As a reaction, the Ice Golem can choose to Freeze or Liquefy its Ice Cavity, giving it the ability to control the state of the creatures trapped within it during combat. This versatility makes it a challenging opponent for adventurers trying to navigate battles in environments where the Ice Golem is present.</detail>
