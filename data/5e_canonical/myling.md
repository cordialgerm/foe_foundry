<summary>The Myling is a Small undead creature with chaotic evil tendencies that embodies the essence of malevolent spirits in the Dungeons and Dragons universe. With an Armor Class of 13, it possesses a reasonable level of defense, making it somewhat challenging to hit in combat. Its hit points total 45, providing a moderate buffer against attacks, while its challenge rating of 2 indicates it can pose a significant threat to lower-level adventurers. The Myling's effective movement includes a walk speed of 10 feet and a burrow speed of 30 feet, allowing it to navigate terrain creatively, especially in ambush scenarios. Its core strengths lie in its agility with a Dexterity score of 16, which gives it exceptional maneuverability and skill in Stealth. However, it is vulnerable to silvered weapons and magical attacks due to its resistance and immunity profile. Notable abilities include damaging necrotic attacks and the potential for crippling strength reductions, which can drastically turn the tide of a battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Myling has the following attribute values: Strength 10 (+0), Dexterity 16 (+3), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma 10 (+0). The Dexterity score is particularly good, enhancing its Stealth skill with a +5 modifier, making it quite adept at sneaking and ambushing unsuspecting foes. The creature is immune to necrotic and poison damage, has resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons, and is also immune to conditions that include charmed, frightened, poisoned, stunned, and unconscious. It possesses darkvision to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 11, allowing it to see in darkness effectively and remain alert to its surroundings. The Myling can communicate in the languages it knew in life.

Special abilities of the Myling include Enfeebling Attacks, which allows it to inflict necrotic damage that can lower the Strength score of targets below half their hit point maximum, potentially leading to their death if their Strength reaches zero. This strength reduction lasts until the target completes a short or long rest, making it effective at disabling opponents over time. Additionally, its Undead Nature means the Myling does not require basic survival needs such as air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without the need for rest.

In terms of actions, the Myling can perform a Claw attack as a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit. Upon successfully hitting a target, it deals a total of 10 slashing damage augmented by an additional 7 necrotic damage. If this attack hits, the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become attached to the Myling, suffering from severe consequences in subsequent turns. Once attached, it cannot perform other attacks but deals 17 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, representing the Myling sinking its teeth into the victim.

As a bonus action, the Myling can use its Bury Alive ability, which can be activated once it is attached to a creature. This ability allows it to knock the targeted creature prone, dragging it underground and burying it just below the surface. The targeted creature becomes restrained and is unable to breathe or stand up until freed, which requires a DC 13 Strength check by the buried creature or any ally attempting to rescue them. This ability adds a layer of crowd control for the Myling, making it a dangerous opponent for unprepared adventurers.</detail>
