<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>A Manticore is a fearsome predator with the body of a lion, the wings of a bat, and a human-like face with a mouth full of sharp teeth. Its tail is covered in barbed spikes, which it can fling at enemies with deadly accuracy. Manticores are cunning hunters, often stalking their prey from the air before swooping down to attack. They are territorial and aggressive, attacking anything that enters their domain. Manticores are known for their cruelty and hunger for human flesh, making them feared by travelers and adventurers alike. They often make their lairs in mountains or remote wilderness areas.</summary>

<summary>The Manticore is a large monstrosity known for its fearsome appearance and abilities, making it a formidable opponent in combat. With an armor class of 14 and hit points totaling 68, it possesses good resilience in battle, allowing it to withstand several attacks. The creature's speed capabilities are noteworthy, as it can walk 30 feet and fly 50 feet, giving it significant mobility on the battlefield. Rated at a challenge level of 3, it offers moderate experience points of 700 XP, making it suitable for a party of adventurers seeking a challenging encounter. The Manticore has a strong physical presence with high strength (16) and constitution (16), along with dexterity (14), allowing it both offensive and defensive capabilities. However, it has low intelligence (8) and charisma (8), which limits its interactions and magical abilities. The Manticore's multiattack feature allows it to strike multiple times in a single turn, and it has several unique actions, including a volley of tail spikes, enhancing its role as a ranged attacker.</summary>

<detail>

The Manticore's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 16 (+3), which provides a good modifier for physical attacks, resulting in good overall combat effectiveness.
- Dexterity: 14 (+2), giving it an average modifier that improves its finesse and ability to evade attacks.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), offering a good modifier that contributes to its hit points, enhancing its endurance in prolonged battles.
- Intelligence: 8 (-1), a very bad modifier indicating poor problem-solving and tactical abilities.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), an average modifier enabling basic perception and insight.
- Charisma: 8 (-1), a very bad modifier reflecting its unattractiveness in social interactions.

The Manticore has a passive perception score of 11, allowing it to notice threats reasonably well, although it is reliant on its sensory capabilities, such as darkvision up to 60 feet. It understands Common but has limited ability to communicate.

In terms of actions, the Manticore uses its Multiattack to make both a bite and claw attack in one turn, allowing it to deal significant damage. The bite attack has a +5 to hit and inflicts 6 piercing damage, while the claws also have a +5 to hit and deal 8 slashing damage, with an added effect: if the Manticore moves at least 20 feet towards a target before attacking with its claws, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or fall prone. This tactic can provide strategic advantage in combat.

The Manticore is also equipped with a tail attack, which has a reach of 10 feet and deals 7 piercing damage, further expanding its range of melee options. The Tail Spike Volley is a powerful ranged attack that can be used four times a day, allowing the Manticore to launch spikes in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 14 piercing damage, or half that damage on a successful save, making this ability capable of dealing high damage to multiple targets in an area.

For reactions, the Manticore has a Tail Whip ability. If it is hit by a melee attack from a creature it can see, it can retaliate with a tail attack against that creature. If the attack hits, the Manticore can then fly up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the attacker. This allows the Manticore to reposition itself effectively in combat after being targeted, enhancing its survivability and tactical options.

The Manticore is a large monstrosity known for its fearsome presence and cunning abilities. With an Armor Class of 14, the Manticore is fairly resilient in combat, allowing it to withstand a moderate amount of damage. With 80 hit points, it exhibits a robust constitution which lends to its effectiveness in battle. The creature is capable of both ground and aerial maneuvers, possessing a speed of 30 feet on land and the daunting ability to fly at 50 feet. As a Challenge Rating 3 creature, it poses a notable threat to adventurers, combining physical attacks with ranged capabilities and tactical options like mimicry to confuse foes. The Manticore's ability to regrow tail spikes makes it a persistent adversary in combat, though it has a slight weakness to effects that apply exhaustion or fear, as it is resistant to such conditions.

In terms of attributes, the Manticore has a Strength of +3, Dexterity of +3, and Constitution of +3, all of which are considered good. This grants the creature decent physical prowess and survivability. However, its Intelligence of -2 is very bad, indicating limited problem-solving capabilities and knowledge. Wisdom of +1 is average, giving it moderate insight and perception, while Charisma of -1 is very bad, suggesting it lacks any significant social skills or presence.

The Manticore possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The ability 'Mimicry' allows it to imitate humanoid voices, which can be used to deceive adventurers into thinking they are hearing their allies or other familiar sounds. However, a successful Wisdom (Insight) check with a DC of 13 can reveal the imitations. Its 'Monstrosity Resilience' makes it resistant to exhaustion and the frightened condition, giving it an edge against crowd control tactics. Additionally, the 'Tail Spike Regrowth' ability allows it to regain used tail spikes after taking a long rest, ensuring that it can keep launching ranged attacks without a long-term energy cost.

During combat, the Manticore has access to several actions. With its 'Multiattack', it can perform either one Bite and two Claw attacks or two Tail Spike attacks. The Bite attack has a +5 bonus to hit, reaching a target within 5 feet, and deals 7 piercing damage on a hit. The Claw attack also has a +5 bonus to hit and can deal 10 slashing damage. The Tail Spike is a ranged attack with a +5 bonus and a range of 100 feet, causing 7 piercing damage plus an additional 5 poison damage if both spikes hit the same target; that target must then succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn.

For its reactions, the Manticore can employ 'Spiky Retaliation', which allows it to jab a spike into a melee attacker within 5 feet when attacked. The attacker must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 13; on a failure, they take 5 poison damage. 

Overall, the Manticore is a versatile creature that combines melee and ranged attacks with clever tactical capabilities, making it a dangerous foe that adventurers must be prepared to outthink and overcome in battle.</detail>
