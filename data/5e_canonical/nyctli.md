<MonsterName/>Nyctli</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fey</CreatureType>

<summary>The Nyctli is a tiny fey creature characterized by its chaotic evil nature. Known for its mischievous and malevolent demeanor, the Nyctli excels in stealth and surprising its opponents with its unique abilities. With a moderate armor class of 14 and limited hit points totaling 7, it is relatively fragile in direct combat. However, its high Dexterity and specialized abilities give it the edge to evade attack and inflict status effects on its foes. Its primary weaknesses include low physical stats such as Strength and Constitution, making it vulnerable in direct melee confrontations. Notably, the Nyctli can also manipulate lighting conditions, providing tactical advantages in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Nyctli has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 2, which is very bad, resulting in a -4 modifier.
- Dexterity: 18, which is very good, granting it a +4 modifier.
- Constitution: 10, which is average, giving it a +0 modifier.
- Intelligence: 6, which is bad, leading to a -2 modifier.
- Wisdom: 14, which is good, resulting in a +2 modifier.
- Charisma: 12, which is average, allowing for a +1 modifier.

In terms of skills, the Nyctli has a +4 modifier in Perception, indicating a good ability to notice details in its surroundings, and a +6 modifier in Stealth, denoting an exceptional aptitude for sneaking and hiding. Its senses include darkvision with a range of 60 feet and a passive perception score of 14. It can communicate in Sylvan, the language of the fey.

The Nyctli can perform the following actions in gameplay:

- Stingers: As a melee weapon attack, the Nyctli has a +6 to hit, which is a good chance of successfully striking a target within a 5-foot reach. When it hits, it deals 1 piercing damage alongside an additional 3 necrotic damage, totaling 4 damage. The target must also succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer the blinded condition until the end of its next turn. This ability can significantly hinder an opponent’s effectiveness in combat by reducing their ability to attack and defend.

- Douse Light: This ability allows the Nyctli to magically extinguish a single magical or nonmagical light source within 30 feet of it. However, the Nyctli cannot dispel light created by spells of 3rd level or higher. This can impact gameplay by creating darkness and confusion on the battlefield, providing opportunities for the Nyctli to hide or escape from combat scenarios or ambush unsuspecting foes.</detail>
