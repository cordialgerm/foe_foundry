<summary>The Adult Blue Dragon is a majestic, serpentine creature with shimmering sapphire scales and large, muscular wings. Its long, curved horns and ridged spine give it a regal appearance, befitting its prideful and territorial nature. These dragons thrive in deserts and arid landscapes, where they can blend in with the sand and strike with the ferocity of a thunderstorm. Their breath weapon is a powerful bolt of lightning, capable of reducing enemies to ash in an instant. Blue Dragons are known for their cunning, often using mirages and deception to outwit their foes before moving in for the kill.</summary>

<summary>The Adult Blue Dragon is a formidable and powerful creature that dominates the skies and deserts of the Dungeons and Dragons universe. As a Huge Dragon with a challenge rating of 19, it boasts an impressive array of abilities and resistances that make it a significant threat to adventurers. This dragon's armor class of 19 and substantial hit points totaling 275 make it exceptionally durable in battle. Its strengths lie not only in its physical attacks but also in its innate magical abilities. However, it has limited dexterity, which could leave it vulnerable to certain tactics. With the capabilities to fly, burrow, and swim, as well as proficient knowledge of lightning and terrain manipulation, the Adult Blue Dragon presents both a physical and strategic challenge for any group of heroes.</summary>

<detail>

The Adult Blue Dragon has an extraordinarily high Strength of 24, providing a very good modifier of +7 for its physical attacks. Its Constitution score of 22 gives it a good +6 modifier, bolstering its resilience. Intelligence and Charisma scores of 16 and 18, respectively, yield average and very good modifiers of +3 and +4, enhancing its spellcasting and interaction prowess. The dragon's Wisdom score of 14 provides a good +2 modifier, aiding in perception and survival skills. Its Dexterity is average at 10, resulting in a +0 modifier, which is not particularly effective for evasive maneuvers.

The saving throws for the Adult Blue Dragon add to its survivability; it has +6 for Dexterity, +12 for Constitution, +8 for Wisdom, and +10 for Charisma, showcasing its exceptional ability to resist effects like spells or severe damage on certain attacks. It is immune to lightning damage, an attribute that accentuates its theme as a blue dragon.

In terms of special abilities, the dragon possesses several that allow it to navigate its environment deftly and enhance its stealth. With the Desert Farer ability, it ignores difficult terrain caused by sand or gravel, even while airborne, and is unaffected by extreme heat. The Dune Splitter ability lets it submerge in sand and gravel for extended periods, gaining advantage on stealth checks to conceal its presence. Its Legendary Resistance allows the dragon to choose to succeed on failed saving throws up to three times a day, though this results in it losing some scales, potentially lowering its armor class after its uses are exhausted.

The Adult Blue Dragon is an innate spellcaster with a spellcasting ability tied to Charisma and a save DC of 18. It can cast three spells each per day, including Blur, which grants it the ability to become harder to hit, Silent Image for creating illusions, Blight for causing significant necrotic damage to its foes, and Hypnotic Pattern to incapacitate and mesmerize enemies.

In terms of actions, the dragon can make a Multiattack, which combines one bite attack dealing an average of 23 piercing damage plus 4 lightning damage, along with two claw attacks that deal an average of 20 slashing damage each. It also has access to a powerful tail attack that bludgeons a target for an average of 16 damage and can push them away. The Arc Lightning action lets the dragon create a chain lightning effect, forcing a target to make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer damage and the potential to jump the damage to another target. Its Lightning Breath is a devastating area attack with a long reach, dealing an average of 77 lightning damage, and it can restrict the reactions of those who fail to save against it. The Quake ability allows the dragon to cause a thunderous pulse that can knock creatures prone and restrain them in loose sand.

As a reaction, the dragon can execute a Tail Attack against a creature that successfully lands a melee attack against it, showing its ability to respond in combat.

For Legendary Actions, the dragon has access to three unique options: Roar induces fear in nearby creatures with a Charisma saving throw, Wing Attack can push and knock down surrounding foes while allowing the dragon to reposition in the air, and Quake can be activated for additional disruption, costing two actions. This versatile combination of magical abilities, physical attacks, and powerful defensive strategies makes the Adult Blue Dragon a compelling foe in any campaign.

The Adult Blue Dragon is a formidable and imposing creature, often seen as one of the apex predators in its environment. As a huge dragon, it boasts a powerful presence, high durability, and formidable electrical attacks, making it a significant challenge for any adventuring party. With an Armor Class of 19 and a substantial pool of 267 hit points, it is well-equipped to withstand considerable damage. Its challenge rating of 16 indicates that it is intended for high-level encounters. The dragon excels in both melee and ranged combat, leveraging its impressive speed and powerful breath weapon, while its special abilities and legendary actions allow it to control the battlefield and instill fear in its opponents. However, its reliance on lightning damage means that enemies resistant or immune to such damage may have an advantage against it.

The Adult Blue Dragon has the following attributes: Strength of +7 (very good), Dexterity of +5 (good), Constitution of +11 (exceptional), Intelligence of +3 (average), Wisdom of +7 (very good), and Charisma of +9 (exceptional). It has darkvision with a range of 120 feet and keensense vision out to 60 feet, allowing it to detect hidden creatures and environments effectively. Its Perception score is 22 (exceptional), making it highly aware of its surroundings, while a Stealth score of 15 (average) indicates its ability to move quietly despite its size. The dragon can communicate in Common and Draconic.

The Adult Blue Dragon has notable special abilities. Its Charged Hide ability allows it to build up electrical charges when its Lightning Breath is not used, incapacitating any creature that starts its turn within a 20-foot radius unless they succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. It can use Legendary Resistance three times per day to automatically succeed on a saving throw it failed, greatly enhancing its survivability.

During combat, the dragon can perform a Multiattack action, which includes using its Frightful Presence to instill fear in nearby creatures before executing a Bite attack and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack has a +12 to hit and deals 18 piercing damage plus an additional 5 lightning damage. The Claw attack also has a +12 to hit, dealing 14 slashing damage, while the Tail attack deals 16 bludgeoning damage with the same attack bonus.

Frightful Presence affects all creatures of the dragonâ€™s choice within a 120-foot radius. Affected creatures must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, or be frightened for one minute, with the possibility of repeating the save at the end of subsequent turns. The Lightning Breath is a powerful ranged attack, allowing the dragon to exhale a line of lightning 90 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures within that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 lightning damage on a failure or half that on a success; this ability recharges after a short duration.

The Adult Blue Dragon also has access to legendary actions that allow it to make additional attacks or disrupt opponents. It can automatically detect all creatures and traps within 30 feet (Detect), perform a Tail attack, or use Elemental Roar to make targets vulnerable to lightning damage for a short duration. Furthermore, its Wing Attack can potentially knock creatures prone and allow the dragon to reposition itself without provoking opportunity attacks, adding to its tactical versatility.

Overall, the Adult Blue Dragon is an awe-inspiring foe designed to challenge and intimidate adventurers, requiring strategic planning and resilience to overcome.</detail>
