In terms of attributes, the Enchantress has a Strength score of 10, which is average and does not contribute much to her melee prowess. Her Dexterity is 15, granting a good +2 modifier for agility-related tasks. With a Constitution score of 14, she has a good resilience to physical damage. Her Intelligence is average at 12, providing only an average bonus to intelligence checks. Importantly, her Wisdom of 17 gives her a very good +3 modifier, enhancing her perception and ability to resist various mental attacks. However, her standout attribute is her Charisma of 18, which grants her an exceptional +4 modifier, vital for spellcasting and manipulation effects. The Enchantress has saving throw bonuses of +5 in Dexterity, +6 in Wisdom, and +7 in Charisma, which are all effective against various threats.

Her skill set includes notable proficiencies: +4 in Arcana, +7 in Deception, +6 in Perception, +7 in Persuasion, and +5 in Stealth, showcasing her ability to manipulate situations to her advantage. The Enchantress has darkvision, allowing her to see in dim light and darkness within a range of 60 feet and possesses a passive Perception of 16, indicating that she is very aware of her surroundings. She can communicate in Common, Elvish, and Umbral.

The Enchantress has special abilities that enhance her combat effectiveness and survivability. Fey Ancestry gives her advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and it also prevents her from being put to sleep by magical means. Her Phrenic Weapons ability means that all her weapon attacks deal an additional 4d6 psychic damage, significantly increasing the damage output from her strikes. However, her Sunlight Sensitivity is a drawback; she suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight in bright light.

In combat, the Enchantress uses a rapier for melee attacks, with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 6 piercing damage plus additional 14 psychic damage upon a successful hit. For ranged attacks, she employs Shadow Bolt, which requires a ranged spell attack roll of +7 and has a range of 120 feet, dealing 11 cold damage and 9 necrotic damage on a hit. One of her key abilities is Beguiling Whispers, which has a recharge time and allows her to charm an enemy, requiring a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If the target fails, they take on a disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against her spells for the duration. 

Additionally, the Enchantress utilizes Leadership, which can be activated after a short or long rest. It provides an ally within 30 feet an advantage by allowing them to add a d4 to their next attack roll or saving throw. Her spellcasting abilities are versatile; she can cast spells like command and message at will without material components. She can also cast charm person, enthrall, fear, hold person, and hypnotic pattern up to three times a day. Once per day, she can cast powerful spells such as confusion, dominate person, greater invisibility, hold monster, and phantasmal killer, all using Charisma as her spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 15.

As a bonus action, she can utilize Shadow Traveler up to three times a day, allowing her to teleport from one shadow to another within 30 feet, leaving a tendril of smoky inky energy at both locations. This ability enhances her mobility, especially in dim light or darkness, allowing her to reposition herself quickly during battles. Overall, the Enchantress is a powerful spellcaster and manipulator, making her a significant challenge for any adventuring party.</detail>
