<summary>An Earth Elemental is a towering creature made of rock, stone, and dirt, animated by powerful elemental magic. Its massive, hulking form is slow but incredibly strong, capable of smashing through walls and crushing anything in its path. Earth Elementals are often summoned by druids or wizards to serve as guardians or to assist in battles. They move through the ground as easily as walking, blending into the earth and emerging to surprise their foes. Earth Elementals are nearly unstoppable in combat, using their immense strength to batter enemies and their ability to merge with stone to avoid attacks.</summary>

<summary>The Earth Elemental is a powerful and resilient creature, classified as a Large Elemental in Dungeons & Dragons. With a strong armor class of 17 and a significant pool of hit points totaling 114, it excels in combat situations, making it a formidable opponent with a challenge rating of 5. One of its major strengths lies in its high Strength and Constitution scores, granting it exceptional physical attacks and resilience against damage. The elemental's ability to burrow through earth without disturbing it allows for strategic movement on the battlefield, while its immunity to poison and resistance to nonmagical weapons makes it a tough adversary. However, it has low Dexterity and Intelligence scores, which limits its agility and cognitive abilities. Overall, the Earth Elemental is adept at dealing melee damage while evading most threats due to its unique characteristics.</summary>

<detail>

The Earth Elemental has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 18 (+4), indicating it has exceptional physical strength, allowing it to hit hard and grapple effectively.
- Dexterity: 10 (+0), representing an average level of agility, meaning it is neither particularly nimble nor clumsy.
- Constitution: 18 (+4), showcasing its exceptional durability, which contributes to its high hit points.
- Intelligence: 6 (-2) and Charisma: 6 (-2), both indicate its very bad capabilities in mental functions and social interactions.
- Wisdom: 10 (+0), marking it as average in perception and insight.

The Earth Elemental has several special abilities:
- **Earth Glide:** This ability permits the elemental to burrow smoothly through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without creating disturbances, allowing for stealthy movements and surprise attacks.
- **Siege Monster:** When it attacks objects or structures, the elemental inflicts double damage, making it highly effective in demolishing fortifications.
- **Elemental Nature:** As an elemental, it does not require air, food, or sleep, which makes it tireless and unburdened by environmental needs.

In combat, the Earth Elemental employs multiple actions:
- **Multiattack:** It can make two slam attacks in a single turn, increasing its potential damage output significantly.
- **Slam:** This melee attack has a +7 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, showcasing its strength.
- **Earth's Embrace:** This attack, which also has a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, targets one Large or smaller creature. If it hits, it deals a powerful 17 (2d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage and grapples the target. The grappled creature must succeed on an escape DC of 15 to break free, and while grappling, the elemental can only perform limited actions, though it has advantage on attacks against the grappled target.
- **Rock:** A ranged weapon attack with a +7 to hit and a range of 30/90 feet. This attack deals 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage to a single target, allowing the elemental to engage enemies from a distance as well.

These attributes and abilities make the Earth Elemental a dynamic and resilient force in any encounter, capable of dealing substantial damage both in melee and at range, while also having unique capabilities for mobility and environmental interactions during gameplay.

The Earth Elemental is a formidable creature embodying the essence of earth, known for its strength and resilience. As a Large elemental, it occupies a significant role in battles, excelling in melee combat with formidable physical attacks. With a high Armor Class of 17 and 114 hit points, it is difficult to take down, making it a durable adversary. Its powers allow it to move stealthily through various terrains and to disrupt the battlefield with earth-shaping abilities. However, it does have limitations, such as susceptibility to magical attacks and reliance on physical force. The Earth Elemental is particularly adept at engaging in direct combat or sieging fortifications, thanks to its ability to deal double damage to structures. 

The Earth Elemental has several key attributes that affect its performance during gameplay: it has a Strength of 20 (+5 modifier, which is exceptional), Dexterity of 9 (-1 modifier, which is bad), Constitution of 20 (+5 modifier, which is exceptional), Intelligence of 8 (-2 modifier, which is very bad), Wisdom of 10 (+0 modifier, which is average), and Charisma of 6 (-3 modifier, which is very bad). Its senses include darkvision and tremorsense, both extending 60 feet, granting it excellent perception capabilities with a Perception score of 13 (which is good). It also has limited Stealth ability with a score of 9 (which is bad) and can understand the Terran language.

The Earth Elemental possesses several special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Earth Glide ability allows it to burrow through nonmagical earth and stone without disturbing the terrain, making it highly mobile in environmental settings. With Earthen Camouflage, it can utilize the terrain to improve its Stealth score to 14 in rocky or muddy environments. As an Elemental, it does not require basic needs such as air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously in various situations. Its Elemental Resilience grants it resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, immunity to poison damage, and protection from exhausting or debilitating conditions. Finally, its Siege Monster ability enables it to deal double damage to objects and structures, making it a significant threat to fortifications.

When it comes to actions, the Earth Elemental can employ a Multiattack feature, allowing it to make three Slam attacks or two Lob Stone attacks. Each Slam has a +8 to hit with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage upon a hit. The Lob Stone, a ranged attack with the same +8 to hit, has a range of 20/60 feet and inflicts 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. Notably, if a creature is hit by two Slam or Lob Stone attacks, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, creating opportunities for further attacks from allies.

Additionally, the Earth Elemental can use a bonus action called Earth Tremor (which recharges on a roll of 4 to 6). This action causes the ground to shake violently at a point within 30 feet, forcing each creature within 10 feet of that point to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. This ability can turn the tides of battle by disrupting enemy formations and positioning.</detail>
