<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Ashwalker is a Medium-sized undead creature embodying a unique blend of draconic traits and malevolent energy. It is classified as Neutral Evil and has an overall challenge rating of 1, making it a relatively low-level adversary with a distinct threat due to its breath-based abilities. The Ashwalker has moderate resilience, having an Armor Class of 12, and a total of 31 hit points, which allows it to withstand a few hits before being incapacitated. Its strengths lie in its elemental resistances and abilities that deal damage based on the dragon type associated with its death. However, its intelligence and charisma are low, limiting its utility in social interactions and strategic planning. </summary>

<detail>

The Ashwalker has the following attributes: Strength 13 (+1; average), Dexterity 15 (+2; good), Constitution 10 (+0; average), Intelligence 7 (-2; bad), Wisdom 10 (+0; average), and Charisma 6 (-2; very bad). It possesses immunity to poison damage and is also immune to the poisoned condition. Its darkvision allows it to see in the dark up to 60 feet, and it has a passive Perception score of 10. While it understands all the languages it knew in life, the Ashwalker cannot communicate verbally.

The Ashwalker has several notable special abilities. Its "Breath Born" trait grants it immunity to a specific type of damage based on the dragon that caused its demise; for instance, it might be immune to fire if killed by a red dragon. The "Burst of Breath" ability means that any creature that comes into contact with the Ashwalker or attacks it in melee range will suffer 3 (1d6) damage of the elemental type linked to its Breath Born trait. The "Last Breath" ability is particularly dangerous, as the first time the Ashwalker drops to 0 hit points, it instead falls to 1 hit point and transforms into an energy form specific to its Breath Born trait. In this energy state, it is invulnerable to all damage and conditions like grappling for one turn before disintegrating. Lastly, its "Undead Nature" means the Ashwalker does not need air, food, drink, or rest, making it relentless in combat.

In terms of actions, the Ashwalker can make a "Slam" attack, which has a +4 to hit (good) and falls within a 5-foot reach. If it successfully hits, it deals 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage along with 3 (1d6) damage from its Breath Born trait. Additionally, it has the "Draconic Breath" action, which has a recharge time of 6. Upon using it, the Ashwalker exhales elemental energy in a 15-foot cone; enemies within this area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) damage of the type noted in its Breath Born trait, suffering only half damage on a successful save. This makes the Ashwalker's breath attack a potentially significant threat in combat, especially when multiple characters are clustered together.</detail>
