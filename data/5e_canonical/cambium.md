<summary>The Cambium is a powerful, large fiend of neutral evil alignment known for its cunning and deceit. It possesses a robust armor class of 19 characterized by natural armor, along with an impressive pool of hit points totaling 264, derived from 23d10 plus 138. With a challenge rating of 14, this creature can pose a significant threat to adventurers, providing 11,500 experience points upon defeat. The Cambium is capable of moving both on foot at a speed of 30 feet and flying at 40 feet, giving it an advantage in mobility during encounters. Its array of attributes showcases exceptional physical and mental capabilities, including a strength of 21 (+5), constitution of 23 (+6), and charisma of 18 (+4). </summary>

<detail>

The Cambium excels at saving throws, being particularly proficient in constitution with a +11 modifier, which is very good. It also has multiple skills including arcana, deception, and stealth with varying degrees of effectiveness; for instance, its deception skill has a modifier of +9, deemed very good. It is immune to poison damage and conditions like exhaustion, rendering it difficult to incapacitate, while having darkvision that enables it to perceive in low-light conditions within a 60-foot radius. The Cambium can communicate in Common, Draconic, and Infernal.

In combat, the Cambium can perform a melee attack using its Needle Fingers, which has a +10 to hit and a reach of 10 feet. This attack deals 21 piercing damage (3d10 + 5). It can also unleash a ranged attack called Poison Ray, which has a +9 to hit and a range of 60 feet. Upon a successful hit, it inflicts 22 poison damage (4d8 + 4) and forces the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails, it becomes poisoned until the end of its next turn.

The Cambium has notable spellcasting abilities that hinge on its charisma, with a spell save DC of 17. It can cast spells at will, including alter self, detect thoughts, and spare the dying. Additionally, it can cast hold person, protection from poison, and heal three times a day each, while having the ability to cast plane shift (self only) once per day. These spells expand its utility and can significantly alter the course of combat.

As a bonus action, the Cambium can twist the bodily humors of a non-Construct, non-Undead creature that it hit with Needle Fingers within the last minute. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer a reduction of its Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 1d4. If this reduction drops any score to 0, the target falls unconscious until they finish a long rest. The Cambium also has the ability to create an imbalance in a target’s bodily humors if it has struck the creature recently. This could cause various detrimental conditions such as preventing the target from regaining hit points (Sanguine Flux), inducing confusion (Choleric Flux), incapacitation and reduced speed (Melancholic Flux), or poisoning (Phlegmatic Flux), with potential ongoing effects that can be negated through successive saving throws. The Cambium is a master of manipulation in combat, turning its enemies' strengths against them through its unique abilities.</detail>

### Bonus Actions

- **Damage Ability:** The cambium twists the bodily humors of a creature within 30 feet of it that isn’t a Construct or Undead and that it hit with Needle Fingers in the past minute. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or its Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score (the cambium’s choice) is reduced by 1d4. The target falls unconscious if this reduces an ability score to 0. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
- **Imbalance Humors:** If the cambium has hit a creature that isn’t a Construct or Undead with Needle Fingers in the past minute, it can cause a surge in one of the target’s bodily humors, causing an imbalance. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer one of the following effects of the cambium’s choice. Unless noted otherwise, the target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Sanguine Flux:** The target can’t regain hp—naturally or magically—until after it finishes a long rest.
- **Choleric Flux:** The target becomes confused for 1 minute. This effect works as if the target failed a saving throw against the confusion spell, except the cambium doesn’t have to maintain concentration.
- **Melancholic Flux:** The target is incapacitated and its speed is halved for 1 minute.
- **Phlegmatic Flux:** The target is poisoned for 1 minute.<br><br><br>Carrion Beetle<br><br>The beetles wore golden bridles and carried huge leather sacks of stone and guano. They marched without stopping; dozens, even hundreds, bringing fresh earth to the white-fungus trees of the great forests. Their claws skittered with a sound like horseshoes slipping on stone, but their multiple legs ensured they never fell. The air around them singed the nostrils with the taint of acid.
