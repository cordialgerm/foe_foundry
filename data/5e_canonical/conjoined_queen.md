A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid being charmed for 1 minute, meaning they drop what they're holding and become stunned. The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, gaining immunity to this effect for 24 hours if successful.

- 2nd-level spells like detect thoughts for information gathering, misty step for mobility, and web for creating difficult terrain.
- 3rd-level spells including clairvoyance for spying, counterspell for negating enemy spells, and haste to enhance an ally's performance.
- 4th-level spells banishment to send enemies away and confusion to create disorder among foes.
- A 5th-level spell, insect plague, that can summon a swarm to besiege enemies.

In terms of actions, the Conjoined Queen can execute a multiattack, consisting of two slam attacks and one sting attack. 
- Slam attacks require a +8 to hit, reach 5 feet, and can deal 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- Sting attacks also need a +8 to hit with 10 feet reach, inflicting 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage and an additional 14 (4d6) poison damage.

Additionally, once per day, the queen can unleash Queen’s Wrathful Clattering, which empowers allies within 60 feet who can hear her, granting them advantage on their next attack roll while increasing their speed by 10 feet.

Overall, the Conjoined Queen combines versatile movement, charm abilities, and powerful spellcasting into a dangerous combination that can create chaos on the battlefield, making her a memorable encounter for any adventuring party.</detail>
