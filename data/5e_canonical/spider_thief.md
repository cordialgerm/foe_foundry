<summary>The Spider Thief is a small construct that embodies agility and cunning, designed for stealthy operations and swift movements. With an armor class of 13 and hit points totaling 66, it possesses decent durability for its challenge rating of 2, making it a moderate threat to unprepared adventurers. This creature shines in its ability to navigate through environments quietly, aided by its Stealth skill, and is equipped to pull itself towards targets efficiently using its hooked wire ability. However, despite its proficient attack capabilities, it struggles with low Intelligence and Charisma scores, making it limited in social interactions and mental challenges. The creature exhibits immunity to many conditions and damage types, which allows it to endure various combat situations effectively, though it remains vulnerable to psychic damage.</summary>

<detail>

The Spider Thief has the following attributes: Strength is rated at 10 with a modifier of +0, which is average, Dexterity is at 12 with a +1 modifier, also considered average, Constitution is at 14 with a +2 modifier, which is good, while Intelligence stands at 3 with a -4 modifier, indicating very bad effectiveness. Wisdom is average at 10 with a +0 modifier, and Charisma is substantially low at 1 with a -5 modifier, resulting in very bad effectiveness in any social scenario.

In terms of abilities, the Spider Thief benefits from its construct nature, which means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate continuously without the need for rest. Its immutable form grants immunity to any spell or effect that would change its physical appearance, making it resilient against transformation. Furthermore, its magic resistance allows it to have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its survivability in encounters with spellcasters.

For actions, the Spider Thief can perform a multiattack, enabling it to make one hooked wire attack and one sickle claw attack or two sickle claw attacks in a single turn. The sickle claw is a melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, boasts a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 10 slashing damage on a hit. The hooked wire can be executed as either a melee or ranged weapon attack, similarly with a +3 to hit, allowing for a reach of up to 5 feet or a ranged attack of 15/30 feet. With this attack, it deals 6 piercing damage and can pull itself towards its target up to 25 feet away, making it a versatile option in combat. Additionally, when moving this way, the Spider Thief can avoid opportunity attacks by giving attackers disadvantage on their rolls.

The Spider Thief also has a unique bonus action called Wire Jump. This action allows it to throw a hooked wire at a visible point on a surface within 30 feet, securing one end of the wire before reeling itself in to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that point. It can also carry objects or willing creatures, provided their total weight does not exceed 100 pounds. Opponents attempting to strike it as it performs this action suffer disadvantage on their opportunity attacks, showcasing its sneaky nature and tactical advantage in retreating or repositioning during combat.</detail>
