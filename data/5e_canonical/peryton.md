<detail>

The Peryton has the following ability scores: Strength is 16 (+3), which provides a good modifier for melee attacks; Dexterity is also 16 (+3), allowing it to avoid some attacks and improve its initiative; Constitution stands at 16 (+3), giving it good durability; Intelligence is 10 (+0), indicating average cognitive abilities; Wisdom is 12 (+1), providing a slight edge in perception checks; and Charisma is 12 (+1), slightly aiding in interactions. Its skill in perception is enhanced with a +3 modifier, which is considered good, allowing it to easily notice hidden creatures and objects. The creature enjoys damage resistance against nonmagical weapons, mitigating some commonly encountered attacks, and has a passive Perception score of 13, which is average for spotting danger without active searching. The Peryton understands the Common and Sylvan languages but is unable to speak them.

Among its special abilities, the Peryton has Keen Sight and Smell, granting it advantage on Perception checks reliant on these senses. This ability significantly boosts its effectiveness in detecting enemies or avoiding ambushes. In terms of actions, the Peryton can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to engage opponents with both its Gore and Talons attacks in one turn. 

The Gore attack is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, targeting a single creature within a 5-foot reach. On a successful hit, it inflicts 7 piercing damage (1d8 + 3). Notably, this attack can score a critical hit on rolls of 18, 19, or 20, and if it brings a humanoid target to 0 hit points, the Peryton can use a bonus action to rip out the target's heart, killing it outright in a gruesome display. 

The Talons attack also has a +5 to hit and impacts within the same reach. It deals 6 piercing damage (1d6 + 3) normally, but if the Peryton moves at least 20 feet straight toward the target before making this attack, the damage increases to 10 (2d6 + 3), making effective use of mobility crucial for maximizing damage output. Overall, the Peryton combines aerial agility with potent melee capabilities, making it a dangerous predator in its chosen habitat.</detail>
