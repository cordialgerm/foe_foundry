<summary>The Tiger is a large and powerful predator, known for its stealth and hunting prowess. With its orange and black striped fur, the Tiger blends into its natural jungle or forest environment, making it a master of ambush. Tigers are solitary hunters, using their speed and strength to bring down prey with a single pounce. Their sharp claws and powerful jaws allow them to tear through flesh with ease. While typically not aggressive towards humans, Tigers will defend their territory or cubs fiercely. In the wild, they are apex predators, feared by all creatures that share their domain.</summary>
