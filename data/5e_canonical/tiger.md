<summary>The Tiger is a large and powerful predator, known for its stealth and hunting prowess. With its orange and black striped fur, the Tiger blends into its natural jungle or forest environment, making it a master of ambush. Tigers are solitary hunters, using their speed and strength to bring down prey with a single pounce. Their sharp claws and powerful jaws allow them to tear through flesh with ease. While typically not aggressive towards humans, Tigers will defend their territory or cubs fiercely. In the wild, they are apex predators, feared by all creatures that share their domain.</summary>

<summary>The tiger is a formidable large beast known for its stealth and powerful physical presence. Its role in combat revolves around agility and melee attacks, making it a dangerous adversary, especially in environments that allow it to utilize its stealth. With moderate armor class and a reasonable amount of hit points, the tiger can withstand some attacks before falling. It boasts high strength and dexterity, which enhance its attacking capabilities, along with notable skills in perception and stealth. However, it has a very low intelligence and charisma, indicating that it operates purely on instinct rather than any kind of complexity in thought or social interaction. As a challenge rating 1 creature, it poses a balanced threat for low-level adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The tiger has an armor class of 12, which provides it moderate protection against attacks, making it somewhat vulnerable to skilled attackers. It has 30 hit points, calculated as 4d10 plus 8, suggesting its ability to endure some damage before being taken down. Its movement speed of 40 feet allows for good mobility on the battlefield.

In terms of attributes, the tiger ranks exceptionally with a strength of 16 (+3), which translates to a very good capability in dealing physical damage. Its dexterity is 14 (+2), providing it with a good defense and agility to avoid some attacks. With a constitution score of 14 (+2), the tiger possesses an average resilience. However, its intelligence score of 3 (-4) indicates a very bad understanding of complex tactics, while its wisdom of 12 (+1) shows an average capacity for awareness. Lastly, its charisma of 4 (-3) is very bad, making it ineffective in social situations.

The tiger's skills include a perception modifier of +3, which is good for spotting hidden threats, and a stealth modifier of +4, which is very good and allows it to remain undetected when moving. It can see in darkness up to 60 feet due to its darkvision and has a passive perception score of 13. The tiger does not communicate using languages.

One special ability the tiger possesses is keen smell, granting it advantage on perception checks that rely on its sense of smell. This ability allows the tiger to track prey and detect enemies more effectively, enhancing its effectiveness in the wild or during ambushes.

In combat, the tiger can perform several actions. Its bite is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 8 (1d10+3) piercing damage on a successful hit. Additionally, the tiger has a claw attack, which is also a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage. Notably, if the tiger moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target before using the claw attack, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw to avoid falling prone. This can significantly alter the dynamics of a combat encounter by enabling follow-up attacks on a downed target.

As a bonus action, the tiger can use its opportune bite ability, allowing it to make a bite attack against a creature that is already prone, taking advantage of its position to maximize damage.

Overall, the tiger is an efficient predator that capitalizes on its physical prowess and stealth in combat scenarios, making it a challenging encounter for adventurers unprepared for its tactics.

The Tiger is a formidable large beast that embodies ferocity and agility, often serving as a dangerous predator in its environment. With a challenge rating of 1, it poses a moderate threat to low-level adventurers, leveraging its speed, stealth, and heightened senses to gain the upper hand in combat. It possesses a solid armor class of 12 and a decent pool of hit points, totaling 38, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being subdued. While it has a good strength modifier of +3, enabling it to deal significant damage in melee, its intelligence is very low, indicating a lack of complex thought or strategy. The Tiger's ability to knock foes prone and maintain pressure with bleeding effects make it a tactical threat that can disrupt enemy formations. However, its reliance on physical attacks and vulnerability to magic or ranged combatants can be seen as weaknesses.

The Tiger's attributes are as follows: it has a strength of +3 (good), dexterity of +2 (average), constitution of +2 (average), intelligence of -4 (very bad), wisdom of +1 (average), and charisma of -1 (bad). These stats define its combat effectiveness and interactions. Its darkvision allows it to see in dim light up to 60 feet, and it possesses a good perception score of 13, enhancing its ability to detect hidden enemies. Additionally, with a stealth score of 16, the tiger can move quietly and ambush unsuspecting prey effectively.

One special ability of the Tiger is "Heightened Smell," which allows it to have a significantly improved perception score of 18 when relying on its sense of smell. This makes it particularly adept at finding creatures, making it a dangerous opponent in stealthy encounters. The "Pounce" ability grants the Tiger a tactical advantage in combat; if it moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and successfully hits them with its claws attack, that target must make a strength saving throw (DC 13) or be knocked prone. Being prone allows the Tiger to make a bite attack as a bonus action, increasing its damage potential significantly.

The Tiger can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make both a Bite and a Claws attack in the same turn. If both of these attacks hit a single creature, the target must succeed on a constitution saving throw (DC 13) at the start of its next turn or suffer 5 (2d4) damage due to bleeding from the wounds. This emphasizes the Tiger’s role as a vicious combatant, striking multiple times and causing ongoing harm to its foes. 

The "Bite" attack is resolved as a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet, dealing 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage upon hitting. The "Claws" attack also functions as a melee weapon attack, similarly with a +5 to hit and 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage on a successful strike. These attacks complement one another and showcase the Tiger’s dual threats in both grappling and cutting through its prey’s defenses.</detail>
