<summary>The Huli Jing is a formidable Medium Fey creature known for its enchanting abilities and strategic combat prowess. With a challenge rating of 9, it poses a significant threat to adventurers. Its strengths lie in its high Charisma, dexterity, and the ability to manipulate luck, both for itself and others. This creature possesses a unique shapechanging ability that allows it to take on the guise of a stunning human or revert to its true nine-tailed fox form, making it unpredictable in encounters. The Huli Jing is resistant to nonmagical physical damage that does not involve cold iron and is immune to poison and charm effects. However, its reliance on spellcasting and the need to maintain its deceptive appearances in combat can potentially be exploited by alert opponents. </summary>

<detail>

The Huli Jing has an Armor Class of 14 and 130 hit points, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage. Its strength is rated at 15, providing it with an average modifier of +2. The creature boasts an impressive dexterity score of 18, granting it a good +4 modifier, which enhances its agility and initiative in combat. Constitution is decent at 14, giving it a +2 modifier, while intelligence and wisdom are both at 16 with +3 modifiers, providing solid capabilities in related skill checks. Most notably, the creature's Charisma is exceptionally high at 20, resulting in a +5 modifier that bolsters its spellcasting and social maneuvers.

The Huli Jing has saving throw bonuses that reflect its strengths: +7 for Wisdom and +9 for Charisma, which are both considered very good. In terms of skills, it excels at perception with a +11 modifier and persuasion with a +9 modifier, making it adept at both detecting threats and influencing others. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 21, allowing it to see in low light and detect hidden foes effectively.

In terms of damage immunities, the Huli Jing is immune to poison damage and resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, but it is vulnerable to attacks made with cold iron. The various capabilities of the Huli Jing are marked by its special abilities and actions in combat situations. 

One of its most notable abilities is Shapechanger, which allows the Huli Jing to polymorph into a Medium female human or back into its fox form. This versatility allows it to adapt to different combat scenarios and engage in social interactions as needed.

The Huli Jing's innate spellcasting capability, focused on Charisma, allows it to cast spells without material components. Its spell save DC is 17, making it fairly difficult for enemies to resist its magic. The spells it can cast at will include charm person, which can manipulate a target into viewing it favorably, invisibility for stealth tactics, and major image for creating compelling illusions. It can cast cure wounds three times a day, providing healing to itself or its allies, along with disguise self for further deception. It has the fear spell to instill dread in enemies, and it can cast powerful spells like bestow curse and confusion multiple times a day to hamper foes.

In combat, the Huli Jing employs a multiattack strategy; in its fox form, it uses its Curse of Luck ability before making two bite attacks. The bite attack is a melee weapon strike with a +8 to hit, reaching 5 feet to target a single opponent. It inflicts an impressive 9-11 piercing damage and additional 14 psychic damage. In its humanoid form, it instead uses jade daggers with the same to-hit bonus, dealing 6 piercing damage along with 7 psychic damage.

The Curse of Luck is a strategic ability allowing the Huli Jing to impose disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws for up to three creatures within 60 feet unless they succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Alternatively, it can grant advantage on attack rolls and saving throws to willing allies within the same range. 

Lastly, its Draining Glance ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the Huli Jing to draw life energy from creatures in a 30-foot cone. Affected creatures must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw; failure results in taking 28 psychic damage, whereas success leads to half damage. The Huli Jing then regains hit points equal to the highest amount of damage dealt, making this a particularly potent ability in combat situations. Thus, the Huli Jing stands out as a multifaceted foe with capacities for charm, combat, and healing, capable of dominating the battlefield with careful planning and execution.</detail>

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the huli jing’s Curse of Luck for the next 24 hours. Alternatively, the huli jing can choose up to three willing creatures within 60 feet of it. Each target has advantage on attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute.
