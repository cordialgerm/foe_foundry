<summary>The Kezai is a formidable Medium monstrosity characterized by its ability to inflict both poison and fire damage, as well as its capacity for flight. It possesses a solid Armor Class of 16 thanks to its natural armor and has a decent pool of hit points totaling 67, making it a resilient opponent. The creature excels in Dexterity with a score of 18, giving it a +4 modifier that reflects an exceptional ability to evade attacks. However, it is weak in Intelligence, scoring a mere 4, which results in a significant -3 modifier, making it ineffective at tasks that require cleverness. The Kezai's challenge rating of 4 indicates that it is a moderate threat, suitable for groups of low to mid-level adventurers. It can utilize its flight speed of 50 feet to maneuver around the battlefield, and its gas attacks can limit the movement and effectiveness of nearby enemies.</summary>

<detail>

The Kezai has several notable characteristics: it is immune to fire damage, has blindsight within a range of 60 feet for detecting creatures without the need for sight, and presents a passive Perception of 11, which is average for perceiving hidden threats. Its lack of language suggests a beast-like nature, relying on instinct rather than communication.

The creature’s special ability, Nauseous Gas, creates a hazardous area around it. Any creature that begins its turn within 20 feet of the Kezai must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 2 points of poison damage. Additionally, this area is lightly obscured, complicating visibility and targeting for those within it.

In terms of actions, the Kezai can make a Multiattack, permitting it to perform three attacks per turn: one using its poison barb and two with its claws. The claws carry a +6 to hit, delivering an average of 7 bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. The poison barb, which can be used in melee or ranged scenarios, also has a +6 to hit and deals 6 piercing damage on a successful attack, alongside a poison effect that requires the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in an additional 7 poison damage and being poisoned for up to one minute, during which the poisoned creature takes 3 poison damage at the start of each turn.

The Kezai also has a powerful Searing Acid ability that can be used again after a cooldown period. When activated, this attack deals significant fire damage—up to 18 points on a failed DC 14 Dexterity saving throw—affecting all creatures within a 20-foot radius. Notably, this ability also temporarily deactivates the Nauseous Gas effect, encouraging strategic usage in combat scenarios.

Overall, the Kezai presents both a tactical challenge and a damaging threat, engaging players to navigate its gas attacks while avoiding its acid and poison effects.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Nauseous Gas:** The kezai produces a faint, nauseating gas. Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the kezai must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) poison damage. The area within 20 feet of the kezai is lightly obscured by the thin gas.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The kezai makes three attacks: one with its poison barb and two with its claws.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Poison Barb:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 7 (2d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 3 (1d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns.
- **Searing Acid (Recharge 6):** The kezai’s mandibles drip a searing acid, instantly igniting the gas around it. Each creature within 20 feet of the kezai must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The kezai’s Nauseous Gas trait becomes inactive for 1 minute. The kezai can’t use Searing Gas unless Nauseous Gas has been active for at least 1 minute.
