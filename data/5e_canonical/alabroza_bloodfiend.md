<summary>Alabroza, the Bloodfiend, is a small fiendish creature that embodies the essence of hunger and deceit, typically aligning with neutral evil intentions. With a Challenge Rating of 4, it poses a considerable threat to adventurers, utilizing a mix of magic, physical attacks, and a unique ability that revolves around its insatiable thirst for blood. Alabroza boasts an impressive mobility with a flying speed of 50 feet, making it exceptionally difficult to pin down or engage in melee combat. While it possesses a variety of resistances to elemental damage, its reliance on blood to sustain itself is both a strength in its lethality and a weakness in its dependency, as failing to feed leads to exhaustion.</summary>

<detail>

Alabroza's abilities are marked by its physical attributes: a Strength score of 16 with a modifier of +3, which is considered very good for melee attacks, a Dexterity of 15 (+2), providing good agility in combat, and a Constitution of 13 (+1), resulting in average durability. Intelligent creatures might find the Bloodfiend easy to outsmart with a low Intelligence score of 9 (-1), yet its Wisdom score of 15 (+2) and Charisma of 14 (+2) make it an impressive strategist and deceiver. Additionally, it has a hit point total of 72, ensuring it can endure several blows before succumbing in battle.

In terms of combat abilities, Alabroza possesses a Multiattack feature that allows it to strike multiple times in a turn. This includes three attacks with Broomsticks, two with Talons, or a single attack utilizing its Beak and a Talon. The Beak attack, available only in its Fiend form, has a +5 to hit and deals 12 (2d8+3) piercing damage while attaching itself to a target. Once attached, it inflicts an additional 12 (2d8+3) damage from blood loss at the start of each of its turns until the target manages to detach it, either through natural movement after reaching 0 hit points or by meeting a DC 13 Strength check. Its Talon attack is similarly potent, dealing 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage. 

In its Humanoid form, Alabroza can use a Broomstick to deal 7 (1d8+3) bludgeoning damage with a +5 to hit. One of its most dangerous abilities is the Hypnotic Gaze, which allows it to charm a creature within 10 feet. If the target fails a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, it becomes incapacitated, immobile, and refuses to detach the Bloodfiend. The charmed creature can attempt to save at the end of its turns, with success ending its effect temporarily for 24 hours, thus limiting its interactions with Alabroza.

Alabroza is also a spellcaster, using its Charisma for spellcasting with a spell save DC of 12 and no need for material components, allowing it to use spells at will, such as Minor Illusion, which creates a sound or image that lasts for one minute, and three times a day, it can cast Detect Thoughts to probe into the minds of others. It can also use Suggestion to influence a target's actions.

As a bonus action, Alabroza can Change Shape, transforming into a Small humanoid or a mist cloud while retaining its stats, though in mist form, it becomes weightless, can hover, and gains resistance to nonmagical damage. This transformation can make it particularly elusive, as it can pass through tight spaces and enter other creatures' spaces without squeezing, providing strategic options for evasion or surprise attacks.

In summary, Alabroza is a cunning and formidable opponent capable of dealing significant damage while controlling the battlefield through its charm and transformations, making it a memorable challenge for any adventuring party.</detail>
