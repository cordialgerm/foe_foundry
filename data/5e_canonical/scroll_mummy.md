<summary>The Scroll Mummy is a formidable undead creature known for its unique ability to absorb and inscribe spells, making it a dangerous opponent in any encounter. A medium-sized monster with a challenge rating of 6, it has a balanced combination of high hit points, decent natural armor, and various resistances that make it resilient in battle. The Scroll Mummy's most notable strength lies in its ability to cast spells and drain magical energy from foes, which adds a strategic layer to its combat style. With a moderate Speed of 30 feet, it can engage opponents effectively but is hindered by low Dexterity, impacting its agility significantly. Thus, while it possesses exceptional spellcasting capabilities, its physical defenses and agility are considered average.</summary>

The Scroll Mummy has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 16 (+3), which is good for melee attacks.
- Dexterity: 8 (-1), considered very bad, making it poor at dodging attacks.
- Constitution: 17 (+3), which is good, contributing to its overall resilience.
- Intelligence: 18 (+4), exceptional, enhancing its spellcasting abilities.
- Wisdom: 11 (+0), average, not significantly enhancing its perception or saving throws.
- Charisma: 14 (+2), which is good, aiding its interaction and spell effects.

In terms of saving throws, the Scroll Mummy has a +3 in Wisdom, which is average compared to some creatures. It also excels in Arcana and History skills, each at +7, both of which are exceptional, allowing it to be knowledgeable in magical lore and ancient events.

The creature has various immunities and resistances: it is immune to damage from fire, necrotic, and poison, giving it good survivability against many spellcasters. Additionally, it resists nonmagical attacks classified as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing, which is also advantageous in melee combat. The Scroll Mummy is immune to conditions such as charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned, making it a tenacious enemy that can endure many effects that would hinder other creatures.

The Scroll Mummy has the following special abilities:

- **Magic Resistance:** This ability grants it an advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, significantly improving its defenses against magical attacks.

- **Scroll Body:** This unique feature allows the Scroll Mummy to inscribe spells onto its wrappings, either by copying from a spellbook or by siphoning spells from a spellcaster it successfully hits with its melee attack. The spells inscribed can be cast once a day, increasing its versatility in combat.

- **Innate Spellcasting:** This trait denotes that the Scroll Mummy can cast spells without the need for material components, using only verbal components. Its spellcasting ability is based on Intelligence, with a spell save DC of 15 and a +7 to hit with its spell attacks. It can cast various spells, such as comprehend languages and fire bolt at will, and has a limited number of higher-level spells it can use later in the day. 

The Scroll Mummy can perform the following actions:

- **Multiattack:** The Scroll Mummy makes two attacks with its Spell-Siphoning Fist, which allows it to potentially inflict damage twice in a single turn.

- **Spell-Siphoning Fist:** This melee attack has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage and 11 (2d10) force damage. Additionally, if the target of this attack is a spellcaster, they must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If they fail, they lose one random unused spell slot, which the Scroll Mummy can then inscribe onto its body, enhancing its own spell repertoire for the day.

Overall, the Scroll Mummy is a dynamic opponent with unique abilities that can turn the tide of battles by disabling spellcasters and utilizing their own magical prowess against them.</detail>
