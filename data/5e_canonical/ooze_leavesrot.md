<summary>The Leavesrot is a large, unaligned ooze that serves as a formidable opponent in combat encounters. It possesses a substantial amount of hit points, making it resilient against damage. The ooze's primary strengths include its ability to move through narrow spaces and its effective use of poison to hinder opponents. Its passive abilities allow it to blend in with its environment, making it difficult to detect until it strikes. However, its low movement speed and poor Dexterity can limit its effectiveness in evading attacks. Overall, while it can inflict significant damage and impose debilitating conditions on its foes, the Leavesrot is not particularly agile, making it susceptible to ranged attacks.</summary>

<detail>

The Leavesrot has an Armor Class of 8, which is very bad, making it easy for attackers to hit. It boasts 105 hit points, derived from 14d10 plus 28, which provides it with average durability against sustained damage during encounters. The ooze's movement speed is 20 feet, which is slow and may hinder its mobility in battle. It has a Challenge Rating of 4, and defeating it rewards 1,100 experience points.

In terms of attributes, the Leavesrot has a Strength score of 17, granting it a modifier of +3, which is good for physical attacks. Its Dexterity score is very low at 7, giving it a modifier of -2, which is very bad for avoiding attacks or performing agile maneuvers. The Constitution score is 15 with a +2 modifier, reflecting a good resilience against spells and effects requiring Constitution saving throws. Its Intelligence is extremely low at 1, yielding a -5 modifier, which is very bad for any intellectual challenges, while Wisdom and Charisma scores of 8 and 1, respectively, render it equally ineffective in perception and social situations.

The Leavesrot has proficiency in perception with a +1 modifier, which is average. It has damage immunities to acid, bludgeoning, and cold, rendering it safe from these forms of damage. Additionally, it is immune to several conditions, including being blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, and prone, making it exceptionally durable against a range of debuffs. The creature has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures within that range, though it is blind beyond that distance. It does not possess any languages, further emphasizing its simplistic nature.

The Leavesrot has several special abilities. "Amorphous" allows the ooze to move through spaces that are at least 1 foot wide without squeezing, enhancing its mobility in confined areas. "False Appearance" lets it remain motionless, making it indistinguishable from an ordinary pile of leaves, which can surprise unsuspecting adventurers. As part of its "Ooze Nature" ability, it does not require sleep, allowing it to remain active at all times. Its "Rotting Leaves" ability activates when a creature strikes it with a melee attack while within 5 feet; spores and decomposing matter erupt from the wound, poisoning all creatures within a 5-foot radius unless they succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

In terms of actions, the Leavesrot can use its "Pseudopod" attack. This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit and has a 5-foot range, dealing 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 13 (3d8) acid damage. The target that is hit is also grappled, with an escape DC of 13. While grappled, the target is restrained and cannot escape the ooze's grasp easily. The Leavesrot is limited to attacking only the grappled target with its Pseudopod attack during this time, which balances its ability to deal consistent damage.

The Leavesrot can also release spores as a special action, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This action affects all creatures within a 20-foot radius, dealing 14 (4d6) poison damage. Affected creatures must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to avoid taking full damage and suffering the choking condition. Creatures that are choking can attempt to save at the end of each of their turns, and success ends the choking effect. This ability can dramatically alter the flow of battle by hindering multiple foes at once, showcasing the Leavesrot's potential to control the battlefield with its toxic spores.</detail>
