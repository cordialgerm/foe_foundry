<summary>The Initiate of the Elder Elementals is a small humanoid creature associated with evil alignments, embodying the elemental forces of nature. With a Challenge Rating of 2, it is fairly powerful for its level, wielding both physical attacks and potent spells. This creature has a decent Armor Class of 12, which increases to 15 when utilizing the spell mage armor, making it reasonably hard to hit. It possesses 33 hit points, indicating moderate durability in combat. The Initiate is particularly strong in Intelligence and Constitution, which enhances its spellcasting and resilience against certain effects. However, its low Strength makes it physically weak, representing a significant vulnerability in melee engagements. Notably, it has several special abilities that provide it with unique advantages in battle, particularly when working alongside allies.</summary>

<detail>

The Initiate has the following attributes: Strength 9 (very bad), Dexterity 14 (good), Constitution 15 (good), Intelligence 16 (very good), Wisdom 11 (average), and Charisma 12 (average). Its saving throws are +4 for Constitution and +5 for Intelligence, both of which are very effective against many types of attacks. In addition, the creature is skilled in Intimidation (+3) and Religion (+5), making it capable of both social and combat interactions. It has darkvision, allowing it to see 60 feet in darkness, and a passive Perception score of 10.

The Initiate of the Elder Elementals has several special abilities that enhance its performance in combat. The "Blessing of the Elder Elementals" grants it advantage on saving throws against damage from acid, cold, fire, or lightning, making it resilient against those elemental types. "Pack Tactics" allows it to have advantage on attack rolls when an ally is nearby, which significantly boosts its chances of hitting opponents. However, it suffers from "Sunlight Sensitivity," imposing disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks in bright light, presenting a notable disadvantage during daytime encounters. Additionally, through "Versatility of the Elder Elementals," the Initiate can change the damage type of its spells, providing tactical flexibility on the battlefield.

As a 5th-level spellcaster, the Initiate uses Intelligence for spellcasting, with a spell save DC of 13 and a +5 to hit with spell attacks. It can cast several spells: At will, it knows cantrips such as pummelstone, light, mage hand, and ray of frost. In the 1st level slots, it has burning hands, mage armor, and tidal barrier, while its 2nd level slots include gust of wind, misty step, and scorching ray. Finally, with its 3rd level slots, it can cast lightning bolt and frozen razors, all of which allow for diverse and impactful strategies in combat.

In terms of actions, the Initiate is equipped with a dagger, which it can use for melee or ranged attacks. It has a +4 to hit with the dagger, capable of inflicting 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. Additionally, it has the "Gift of the Elder Elementals," a ranged spell attack with a +5 to hit and a range of 60 feet. This attack inflicts 7 (2d6) damage of acid, cold, fire, or lightning, while also disadvantaging the target on its next saving throw against any of the Initiate's spells of the chosen damage type, enhancing its effectiveness in subsequent rounds.</detail>
