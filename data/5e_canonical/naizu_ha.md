<detail>

The Naizu-Ha has the following ability scores: 
- Strength of 17 (+3), which means it has a good capacity for physical activities and melee attacks.
- Dexterity of 15 (+2), granting it a decent agility and finesse.
- Constitution of 17 (+3), providing it with good stamina and durability.
- Intelligence of 13 (+1), reflecting a bit of cleverness and strategy, although this is only average.
- Wisdom of 11 (+0), indicating it is neither particularly perceptive nor insightful, which is average.
- Charisma of 13 (+1), suggesting it has a certain charming quality but is not exceptionally persuasive.

The Naizu-Ha has certain condition immunities, specifically to being blinded or grappled. It is capable of passive perception at a level of 10, which is average but may vary depending on specific circumstances. It speaks Common and Sylvan, allowing it to communicate effectively with a range of creatures.

Special abilities of the Naizu-Ha include:
- Blunting Ambiance: This ability requires any creature dealing piercing or slashing damage with a bladed weapon within 30 feet to roll damage dice twice and take the lower result, effectively reducing the damage output from melee attacks against it.
- Dagger Form (usable once per day): As a bonus action, the Naizu-Ha can turn itself into a magical dagger. Any creature wielding this dagger gains a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls, and can score critical hits on rolls of 19 or 20. However, to use the Disengage action, the wielder must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, creating a risk for the user in combat situations.
- Spider Climb: This ability allows the Naizu-Ha to climb difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without needing to make an ability check, giving it excellent maneuverability and the ability to evade attacks or set ambushes.
- Tripping Charge: If the Naizu-Ha moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and hits it with a scythe tail attack, the target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target falls, the Naizu-Ha can make an additional attack against it as a bonus action, leveraging its positioning to inflict more damage.

In terms of actions, the Naizu-Ha can perform the following:
- Multiattack: The creature can make three attacks in a single turn—two using its scissor claws and one with its scythe tail. If both attacks with the scissor claws hit the same creature, that target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or suffer an additional 7 slashing damage.
- Scissor Claws: This melee attack has a +6 to hit, and if it connects, it deals 10 slashing damage (2d6 + 3).
- Scythe Tail: Also with a +6 to hit, this attack has a reach of 5 feet and inflicts 12 slashing damage (2d8 + 3) on hit.
- Dagger Legs: This attack is available against prone creatures, allowing the Naizu-Ha to hit automatically with a +6 to attack and deal 8 piercing damage (2d4 + 3).

In combat, the Naizu-Ha's abilities create a unique combination of offense and defense, making it a tricky adversary for both novice and experienced players alike. Its capacity to impose damage penalties, coupled with its varied attack types, can significantly alter the dynamics of a battle.</detail>
