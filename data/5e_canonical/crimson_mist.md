<summary>The Crimson Mist is a Medium undead creature characterized by its chaotic evil nature. Hovering in a spectral form, it combines the traits of a vampire with mist-like qualities, making it a formidable opponent to adventurers. With an armor class of 15 and a total of 68 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage. The creature excels in dealing necrotic damage and can threaten the life of characters with blood by reducing their hit point maximum while recovering its own vitality. Although it possesses several strengths, such as immunities to various damage types and conditions, the Crimson Mist is notably vulnerable to sunlight, which can severely handicap its effectiveness in combat. </summary>

<detail>

The Crimson Mist has the following attributes: Strength 17 (plus 3 modifier, which is good), Dexterity 15 (plus 2 modifier, which is average), Constitution 18 (plus 4 modifier, which is very good), Intelligence 3 (minus 4 modifier, which is very bad), Wisdom 20 (plus 5 modifier, which is exceptional), and Charisma 18 (plus 4 modifier, which is very good). Its saving throws provide good resistance to Dexterity (plus 8), average resistance to Wisdom (plus 4), and bad resistance to Charisma (plus 2). The creature is immune to cold, necrotic, and poison damage but resistant to acid, lightning, and thunder. Additionally, it is also resistant to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, a passive perception of 11, and understands languages known as a vampire, although it cannot speak.

The Crimson Mist has several special abilities. Its "Pseudocorporeal" trait allows it to be weightless, meaning it can occupy the space of a hostile creature freely, without being hindered. The "Sanguine Feast" ability is particularly dangerous; whenever the mist deals necrotic damage to a creature with blood, it not only reduces that creature's hit point maximum by the amount of damage dealt, but also heals itself for half of that damage. This reduction lasts until the affected creature completes a long rest, and if a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to zero, it dies. The Crimson Mist also suffers from weaknesses characteristic of vampires. It cannot enter a residence without an invitation, takes 20 force damage if it ends its turn in running water, and suffers 20 radiant damage when starting its turn in sunlight, along with disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while exposed to sunlight.

In terms of actions, the Crimson Mist can use "Engulf," where it moves up to its speed, entering the space of a Medium or smaller creature. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or it will take 15 (4d6) necrotic damage and become engulfed. An engulfed creature is restrained, unable to breathe, and takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the mist's turns. The engulfed creature can attempt to escape by making a DC 14 Strength check on its turn. Success allows the creature to escape and position itself 5 feet away from the mist. Alternatively, a creature adjacent to the mist can use an action to pull an engulfed friend out, requiring a DC 14 Strength check, which also inflicts 14 (4d6) necrotic damage to the rescuer. Only one creature can be engulfed at a time, adding strategic importance to the battlefield.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Pseudocorporeal:** The crimson mist is weightless and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing.
- **Sanguine Feast:** Whenever the crimson mist deals necrotic damage to a living creature with blood in its body, the creature's hp maximum is reduced by the same amount and the mist regains hp equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. The reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Vampire Weaknesses:** The crimson mist has the following flaws:
Forbiddance. The crimson mist can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
Harmed by Running Water. The crimson mist takes 20 force damage if it ends its turn above or within running water.
Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The crimson mist takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

### Actions

- **Engulf:** The mist moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter a Medium or smaller creature's space. When the mist enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the mist. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.<br><br>On a failed save, the mist enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the mist's turns. When the mist moves, the engulfed creature doesn't move with it, and is freed. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the mist. A creature within 5 feet of the mist can take an action to pull a creature out of the mist. Doing so requires a DC 14 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The mist can only engulf one Medium or smaller creature at a time.
