The "Sweeping Maul" attack has an attack bonus of +7, with a reach of 5 feet, dealing 18 (4d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a hit. This attack also forces the target to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone, adding a tactical layer to its offense. It can also make a "Fist" attack, which similarly has a +7 attack bonus and deals 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a hit, showcasing its capability for repeated strikes in close-quarters combat.
