In addition to its impressive combat stats, the Dread Knight features several special abilities:
- **Undead Nature:** This ability signifies that the creature does not require air, food, or rest, making it relentless in its pursuit of foes.
- **Unholy Aura:** The Dread Knight and allies within a 30-foot radius gain advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, while enemies within the same area suffer disadvantage on those saving throws. This ability significantly enhances the survivability and effectiveness of itself and its allies in battle.

The Dread Knight's actions include the following:
- **Cursed Greatsword:** This melee weapon attack has a +12 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and deals 13 slashing damage plus an additional 14 necrotic damage. Moreover, the necrotic damage reduces the target's hit point maximum by an amount equal to the necrotic damage until the target finishes a long rest. A target's hit point maximum can be reduced to 0, resulting in death.
- **Fire Blast (1/Day):** This ranged attack creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of black fire at a point within 120 feet. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to take 63 fire damage, or half as much on a success. This blast ignores fire resistance and affects creatures that are normally immune to fire as if they had resistance.
- **Ice Wall (1/Day):** The Dread Knight can summon a wall of ice that is 1 foot thick, up to 50 feet long, and 15 feet high. Each section has an armor class of 12 and 30 hit points, is vulnerable to fire damage, and immune to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If any creature is within the space when the wall appears, it is pushed aside and can take cold damage unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw.
- **Soul Wrack (1/Day):** A target within 60 feet must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 70 necrotic damage on a failure or half damage on a success, in addition to being knocked prone if the saving throw fails.
- **Summon Fiendish Steed (1/Day):** This ability allows the Dread Knight to summon a fell nightmare or wyvern that serves its commands and can attack on its turn upon being summoned.

Additionally, the Dread Knight has bonus actions:
- It can repeat an attack with its **Cursed Greatsword**.
- **Break Magic:** With this ability, the Dread Knight can end all spell effects created by a spell of 5th level or lower within a 30-foot range, targeting a creature, object, or point.

Overall, the Dread Knight is an overwhelmingly powerful foe that combines high durability, significant damage output, and a suite of abilities that manipulate both allies and enemies, posing a dire threat in any encounter.</detail>
