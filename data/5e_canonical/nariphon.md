With a high armor class of 10 and a substantial amount of hit points at 195, it is able to withstand considerable damage. Its challenge rating of 13 indicates that it poses a significant threat, worth 10,000 experience points to those who defeat it. Although the Nariphon has low Dexterity and Intelligence, giving it average mobility and poor cognitive ability, its strength and constitution are exceptional, allowing it to deal and withstand damage efficiently. Notably, it possesses various immunities to damage and conditions, making it a robust creature in battle. Additionally, its ability to create vegetative clones allows it to manipulate the battlefield effectively.</summary>

<detail>

The Nariphon's attributes include a Strength of 24, resulting in a +7 modifier, which is exceptional and makes its melee attacks particularly dangerous. Its Dexterity is low at 6, giving it a -2 modifier, considered very bad for initiative rolls or ranged attacks. Its Constitution is very good at 21, providing a +5 modifier, meaning it has a solid foundation for mitigating damage taken. Intelligence is similarly low at 6, indicated by a -2 modifier, showcasing its lack of cognitive abilities. Wisdom is at a good value of 14 with a +2 modifier, allowing it to be somewhat perceptive, while its Charisma is poor at 9, represented by a -1 modifier, making it ineffective in social interactions.

The Nariphon has a passive perception score of 17 due to its Wisdom, indicating a good awareness of its surroundings. It has damage immunities to bludgeoning, piercing, and poison, as well as condition immunities to exhaustion, poisoned states, and being prone. It uses tremorsense to detect movement within a range of 120 feet, which provides it with exceptional awareness of unseen enemies.

The Nariphon has several special abilities. Its ability to appear indistinguishable from an ordinary tree allows it to avoid detection, presenting itself as a natural part of the environment through its "False Appearance" trait. The "Vegetative Clone" ability allows the Nariphon to create clones that resemble creatures it attacks, and it can control these clones using its senses. This means it can act almost like a puppet master, presenting a significant strategic advantage in combat.

In terms of combat actions, the Nariphon can make four attacks during its turn, either using its roots or thorns. When attacking with its "Roots," it makes a melee weapon attack at +12 to hit, with a reach of 15 feet. This attack deals an average of 18 points of bludgeoning damage and can grapple the target, imposing a DC 18 for escape. A grappled creature is restrained and takes additional poison damage each turn. Alternatively, its "Thorns" attack is a ranged weapon that also features a +12 to hit, dealing average piercing damage of 17. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 18, a thorn can create a vegetative clone that the Nariphon controls.

As a bonus action, the Nariphon can use the "Bury" ability on a grappling target, dragging them into the ground and restraining them. This action is especially dangerous as it forces the victim to make an escape attempt using a Strength check against a DC of 18 to free themselves.

Overall, the Nariphon is a dangerous opponent that uses its environment and cloning abilities to wreak havoc on adventurers, providing a challenge combining brute strength with strategic manipulation.</detail>
