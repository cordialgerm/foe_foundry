<MonsterName/>Fleshpod Hornet</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Beast</CreatureType>

<summary>The Fleshpod Hornet is a large, unaligned beast known for its agility and potent attacks. With an Armor Class of 14 and 120 hit points, it is reasonably durable, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before falling. It has a flying speed of 60 feet, which, combined with its ability to hover and moderate walking speed, gives it exceptional maneuverability in combat. The Fleshpod Hornet presents a significant challenge with a Challenge Rating of 6 and rewards adventurers with 2,300 experience points upon defeat. Its strengths lie in its skills and unique abilities, particularly its capacity to inflict poison damage and debilitating effects through its stinger. However, despite its strong Dexterity score of 18 (+4), it has poor intelligence and charisma, limiting its influence in social or strategic situations.</summary>

<detail>

The Fleshpod Hornet possesses the following statistics:
- Strength: 14 (+2) - Good
- Dexterity: 18 (+4) - Exceptional
- Constitution: 15 (+2) - Good
- Intelligence: 3 (-4) - Very bad
- Wisdom: 12 (+1) - Average
- Charisma: 6 (-2) - Bad

The creature has a passive Perception of 14, allowing it to detect hidden enemies or traps effectively. It is proficient in Perception, providing a +4 modifier to perception checks.

One of its unique traits is the Flying Charge ability. If the Fleshpod Hornet flies at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and successfully lands a slam attack in the same turn, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is knocked prone, providing the hornet with an advantageous position for further attacks.

The Fleshpod Hornet takes its turn using the Multiattack action, allowing it to perform two attacks in one turn: one with its slam and one with its stinger. 

For its Slam attack, it makes a melee weapon attack with a +7 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and targets one creature. On a hit, it deals 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

The Stinger attack has a +7 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and also targets one creature. If it hits, the stinger deals 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. In addition, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 21 (6d6) poison damage. If this damage occurs, the target is infected with the Fleshpod Hornet's eggs. The eggs form a tumor resembling a circular lotus pod, approximately half a foot in diameter, on the target within one minute of the injection. While this tumor is present, the target suffers disadvantage on skill checks and saving throws. After 24 hours, the tumor erupts, releasing a young Fleshpod Hornet that inflicts 33 (6d10) slashing damage on the target.

The infected target can attempt to remove the tumor with a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, causing 16 (3d10) slashing damage if successful. If attempted without the check, the host must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; failure results in 22 (4d10) slashing damage. This combination of abilities makes the Fleshpod Hornet a formidable opponent capable of inflicting lasting harm and creating additional threats through its young.</detail>
