<summary>A Nightmare is a fiendish horse wreathed in flame, with dark, smoky mane and glowing red eyes. Its hooves burn with fire as it gallops through the night sky or across the planes. Nightmares are typically summoned by evil creatures to serve as steeds, especially for powerful fiends or necromancers. These creatures can travel through the Ethereal Plane, making them excellent for stealthy missions or quick escapes. Their fiery breath and hooves make them dangerous in combat, and their presence often brings a sense of dread and terror.</summary>
