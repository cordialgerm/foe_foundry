<summary>A Nightmare is a fiendish horse wreathed in flame, with dark, smoky mane and glowing red eyes. Its hooves burn with fire as it gallops through the night sky or across the planes. Nightmares are typically summoned by evil creatures to serve as steeds, especially for powerful fiends or necromancers. These creatures can travel through the Ethereal Plane, making them excellent for stealthy missions or quick escapes. Their fiery breath and hooves make them dangerous in combat, and their presence often brings a sense of dread and terror.</summary>

<summary>The Nightmare is a Large Fiend known for its role as a fearsome steed and harbinger of dread. Typically associated with dark magic and evil entities, this creature possesses a range of strengths including high mobility with its flying speed, decent armor class, and formidable melee attacks. With 68 hit points, it can withstand a fair amount of damage, while its fire resistance adds to its durability against elemental attacks. However, the Nightmare is also limited by its challenge rating of 3, which indicates that it would be best suited for encounters with lower-level adventurers. It has a mix of physical and magical abilities that allow it to interact with both combat and exploration elements of the game effectively, making it a versatile opponent.</summary>

<detail>

The Nightmare has the following attributes: Strength is 18 (+4), Dexterity is 14 (+2), Constitution is 16 (+3), Intelligence is 10 (+0), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 14 (+2). Its high Strength score indicates that it is exceptionally capable of dealing damage in melee combat, while its good Constitution allows for resilience in battle. The Dexterity score is average, contributing moderate effectiveness to initiatives and ranged attacks, and while its Intelligence is average, it doesn’t pose as a strategic threat. The Wisdom score provides a little awareness, and the Charisma score indicates a good presence, fitting for a fiendish creature.

The Nightmare has several special abilities. The Evil aura it radiates signifies its malevolent nature, potentially affecting how characters perceive it. The Fiery Hooves ability allows the Nightmare to illuminate its surroundings, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet; moreover, it leaves charred hoofprints that can indicate its path. Its Fire Resistance ability provides an added strategic advantage by granting fire resistance to a rider, which can be particularly useful in fiery encounters.

In terms of actions, the Nightmare can perform a melee weapon attack using its Hooves. It has a +6 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, targeting one creature. Upon a successful hit, it deals 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage. Notably, if the Nightmare moves at least 20 feet straight toward the target before the attack, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or fall prone, giving the Nightmare an operational advantage in controlling the battlefield. The Nightmare can also move through the space of a prone creature, allowing for fluid movement during combat.

Furthermore, the Nightmare has a special action known as Ethereal Shift, which can be used after a recharge period of 5-6. This ability allows the Nightmare and a rider to magically transition between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane, creating unique tactical opportunities for escape or repositioning during encounters. 

Overall, the Nightmare presents a blend of physical prowess and mystical abilities, making it an intriguing foe or ally in any D&D campaign.

The Nightmare is a formidable Large fiend that serves as both a mount and a menacing creature in combat scenarios. With an Armor Class of 13 derived from its natural armor and a solid pool of 76 hit points, it presents a decent level of durability for a creature of its Challenge Rating (CR 3). Its speed is impressive, allowing it to move 60 feet on the ground and 90 feet while flying. The Nightmare’s high Strength (+4) and decent Dexterity (+2) make it a solid attacker, while its Charisma (+2) provides some minor social advantages. However, it has a low Intelligence and its situational resistance to fire damage through its special abilities and effects demonstrate its prowess in fire theme-based encounters. Overall, the Nightmare excels in creating chaotic conditions in battle, punishing intruders who venture too close with fire and evasive movements but suffers from its inability to communicate verbally.

The Nightmare has the following attributes: Strength is +4 (very good), Dexterity is +2 (average), Constitution is +3 (good), Intelligence is +0 (very bad), Wisdom is +1 (average), and Charisma is +2 (average). These attributes dictate its combat effectiveness, resilience to damage, and performance in social situations or skill checks. 

Among its special abilities, the Nightmare emits Illumination, casting bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, which can influence stealth and visibility during encounters. It also possesses the Riding Flames ability; any creature riding the Nightmare with its consent gains resistance to fire damage, while those who attempt to ride without permission take fire damage each turn. 

In terms of actions, the Nightmare can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to deliver two Flaming Hoof attacks in one turn. The Flaming Hoof attack has a +6 to hit and deals 7 points (1d6 + 4) of bludgeoning damage alongside an additional 7 points (2d6) of fire damage, making this attack particularly dangerous against enemies weak to fire. Additionally, the Ethereal Stride ability enables the Nightmare and up to three adjacent willing creatures to transition between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, providing unique tactical options for evasion or positioning.

As a bonus action, the Nightmare can activate its Burning Hoofprints feature. By intensifying the heat of its hooves, it leaves a trail of burning tracks behind it. Any creature entering or starting its turn on these burning hoofprints must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 3 points (1d6) of fire damage. The hoofprints disappear at the beginning of the Nightmare’s next turn, adding an element of environmental hazard to its movements in battle. 

In summary, the Nightmare combines strong physical capabilities with fire-themed abilities, offering both offensive and tactical maneuvering options that can shift the dynamics of a combat encounter considerably.</detail>
