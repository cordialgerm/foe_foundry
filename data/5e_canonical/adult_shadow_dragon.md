<summary>The Adult Shadow Dragon is a formidable creature that embodies the essence of darkness and malevolence, serving as a powerful adversary in any campaign. As a Huge Dragon, it boasts a high Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 212, making it incredibly resilient in battle. The dragon is agile in movement, capable of walking, climbing, and swimming at 40 feet per round, with a flying speed of 80 feet. With a Challenge Rating of 19, it presents a significant challenge to high-level adventurers, rewarding them with 22,000 experience points upon defeat. The dragon is not only physically powerful but also possesses a variety of special abilities and a potent spellcasting capability, primarily based on its high Charisma score of +6. However, its reliance on shadow-based tactics can be a double-edged sword; if it is exposed to radiant damage, it loses some of its potent abilities. </summary>

<detail>

The ability scores of the Adult Shadow Dragon are impressive: it has a Strength of 22 (+6), a Constitution of 22 (+6), and a Charisma of 23 (+6), all yielding very good effectiveness in relevant checks and saving throws. Its Dexterity is average at 14 (+2), while its Intelligence, Wisdom, and other mental attributes are also average at 14 (+2). The dragon enjoys notable saving throw bonuses, such as +8 on Dexterity, +12 on Constitution, and +20 on Charisma, making it exceptionally resilient against various effects. It has a good suite of skills, including deception at +12, insight at +8, nature at +8, perception at +8, and stealth at +8, making it a capable manipulator and ambusher.

The Adult Shadow Dragon is immune to necrotic and poison damage, and it possesses substantial resistances to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage as well as damage from nonmagical weapons. It is immune to conditions like fatigue, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, poisoned, prone, and restrained, further enhancing its survivability in combat. Its extensive darkvision of 240 feet and a passive perception of 18 make it adept at sensing its surroundings, particularly in low-light environments.

The dragon has several notable special abilities. The Evil aura radiated by the dragon influences interactions with it, potentially causing fear or hesitation among adventurers. Its Incorporeal Movement allows it to pass through creatures and objects, taking minor force damage if it ends its turn inside one. With its Legendary Resistance used 3 times per day, it can turn a failed saving throw into a success, temporarily losing its incorporeal nature and resistances in the process. Its Essence Link ties the dragon to a specific area, limiting its ability to regain the benefits of a long rest and imposing fatigue and strife on creatures who enter the connected area after its death.

The dragon also has innate spellcasting, with a spellcasting ability based on Charisma, requiring a save DC of 20. It can cast spells such as darkness, which obscures vision and creates an area of magical darkness; detect evil and good, which senses the presence of celestial, fiendish, or undead creatures; bane, which reduces the efficacy of enemies; and create undead, allowing it to animate corpses as servants.

In combat, the Adult Shadow Dragon employs a multiattack capability, utilizing Grasp of Shadows to restrain opponents. The dragonâ€™s Bite attack features a +12 to hit and inflicts 22 piercing damage along with 4 necrotic damage, while its Claw attacks also deliver slashing damage combined with necrotic effects. Grasp of Shadows requires a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 16, grappling enemies in shadowy tendrils on a failed save. The Anguished Breath, which can be used every 5-6 turns, inflicts massive necrotic damage in a cone and instills a level of strife in affected creatures.

For its legendary actions, the dragon can utilize Corrupting Presence to impose strife on nearby foes, Lurk to become invisible in low light, Slip Through Shadows to teleport, and Horrid Whispers, which damages nearby creatures while allowing the dragon to regain hit points. These abilities allow the Adult Shadow Dragon to manipulate the battlefield and maintain control of the encounter, making it a terrifying foe.</detail>
