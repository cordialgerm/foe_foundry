<summary>The Vengeful Ghost is a Medium Undead creature that embodies the remnants of a person who has significant unfinished business or emotional turmoil. It is a formidable opponent with a Challenge Rating of 8, making it suitable for mid-level adventurers. With a total of 58 hit points, an Armor Class of 11, and a flying speed of 40 feet, it can maneuver effectively in combat. The ghost is exceptionally resilient against many forms of damage due to its immunities to cold, necrotic, and poison damage, as well as resistances to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder. However, it is vulnerable to radiant damage, and its physical attributes indicate it is relatively weak in terms of strength and constitution, translating to very bad physical attacks and defenses. The creature's most notable traits include its ability to haunt and intimidate foes, as well as a unique capacity for possession.</summary>

<detail>

The Vengeful Ghost has the following attributes:  
- Strength: 8 (-1), which is very bad and limits its effectiveness in melee combat.  
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), providing an average level of nimbleness and initiative.  
- Constitution: 10 (+0), indicating average durability.  
- Intelligence: 10 (+0), marking an average intellect.  
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), which is average and provides some insight.  
- Charisma: 16 (+3), which is very good, allowing it to excel in manipulative abilities and interactions.

This ghost has various special abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness:  
- Ethereal Sight allows it to see into both the Material and Ethereal Plane, giving it an exceptional tactical advantage during encounters.  
- Incorporeal grants it the ability to move through other creatures and objects, although it incurs 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.  
- Undead Nature signifies that the ghost does not require air, food, or sleep, making it less vulnerable to deprivation.  
- Unquiet Spirit means that if the ghost is defeated in combat, it will return after 24 hours unless it is put to rest through a remove curse spell or resolves its unfinished business.  
- Graveborn Strength imposes disadvantage on saving throws made against its Horrifying Visage and Possession abilities when not in sunlight, enhancing its effectiveness during nighttime encounters.

The Vengeful Ghost can perform several actions:  
- Withering Touch is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit and a reach of 5 feet that inflicts 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage. If the target is frightened, it suffers magical aging based on a roll of 1d4 multiplied by 10 years, which can only be reversed with a greater restoration spellâ€”a significant effect that can greatly demoralize and debilitate foes.  
- Ethereal Jaunt allows the ghost to shift between the Material and Ethereal Plane, enabling strategic repositioning during combat, often making it difficult for foes to target it.  
- Horrifying Visage forces each non-undead creature within 60 feet who can see the ghost to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Failure results in being frightened for 1 minute, adding fear to the combat environment. Creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turns. Success makes them immune to this effect for 24 hours.  
- Possession (Recharge 6) lets the ghost attempt to possess a humanoid within 5 feet, requiring a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. If failed, the humanoid becomes unconscious, allowing the ghost to control their body, sharing their statistics and actions while granting immunity to charm and fright. The possession ends under various conditions, such as when the possessed creature takes damage or if the ghost is turned. 

Additionally, the ghost has a reaction that allows it to use Horrifying Visage upon taking damage from an attack or spell, ensuring it has a method to frighten enemies even in a defensive position. This ability keeps the pressure on attackers and can alter their decision-making in combat. Overall, the Vengeful Ghost embodies a haunting presence, influencing combat encounters through fear and possession.</detail>
