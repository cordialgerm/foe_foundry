<summary>The Fennec Fox is a tiny, unaligned beast known for its exceptional senses and speed. With its high Dexterity and ability to stealth effectively, it excels in evasion and reconnaissance roles, making it a valuable companion in exploration scenarios. Despite its low hit points and average defenses, it can leverage its speed and keen senses to avoid direct confrontations. The Fennec Fox is notably fragile but compensates with stealthy movement and advantageous sensory abilities, enabling it to remain undetected in most encounters.</summary>

<detail>

The Fennec Fox has an Armor Class of 11, which is considered average and offers minimal protection in combat. It has 7 hit points, calculated as 2d4 plus 2, making it quite vulnerable to attacks, as it can potentially be defeated in one or two hits. Its speed allows it to walk at 40 feet per round, which is good, and it can also burrow at 5 feet, though this is a very limited form of movement. The Challenge Rating for the Fennec Fox is 1/8, translating to 25 experience points, indicating it is a low-level creature that presents minimal threat to stronger adventurers.

In terms of ability scores, the Fennec Fox has a Strength of 6, which results in a modifier of -2, making it very bad in melee combat strength. Its Dexterity score is 12, providing a +1 modifier, which is good for its stealth and agility. The Constitution score is also 12, granting an average +1 modifier to its hit points. Intellect is deficient at 2, leading to a -4 modifier; therefore, it is very bad at tasks requiring intelligence. The Wisdom score of 14 results in a +2 modifier, considered good and enhancing its perception, while its Charisma score of 10 carries a +0 modifier, indicating average social interaction abilities.

The Fennec Fox has a skill bonus in stealth of +3, which is good and reflects its capacity to remain hidden while moving silently. It possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in darkness as if it were dim light, which enhances its nighttime escapades and makes it effective in low-light situations. Its passive perception is 12, indicating an average ability to notice hidden enemies or traps without active searching.

The Fennec Fox exhibits the special ability of Keen Hearing and Sight, granting it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight. This means that when the Fennec Fox attempts to notice something using those senses, it rolls two d20s and takes the higher result, effectively raising its chances of success significantly in those scenarios.

In combat, the Fennec Fox can use its Bite attack, which is a melee weapon attack that adds +3 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. If successful, it deals 3 piercing damage calculated as 1d4 plus 1. This damage output is low and might not prove significant in many engagements, but the fennec fox is more suited to scout and evade rather than overwhelm opponents directly.</detail>
