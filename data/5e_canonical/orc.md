<summary>Orcs are fierce, green-skinned humanoids known for their savage nature and warlike culture. Standing taller and stronger than most humans, Orcs are brutal warriors who live for battle and conquest. They often form raiding parties or large warbands, attacking settlements and taking what they want by force. Orcs are known for their strength, aggression, and lack of fear, charging into battle with little regard for their own safety. They typically wield crude but effective weapons like axes, spears, or clubs, and are often led by chieftains or powerful shamans.</summary>

<summary>The Orc is a medium humanoid creature that serves as a formidable combatant on the battlefield, known for its resilience and aggression. With a Challenge Rating of 1/2, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers, capable of dealing significant damage while withstanding some punishment due to its decent hit points and the ability to resist effects that would hinder it. Orcs are characterized by their straightforward approach to combat, wielding heavy weaponry and charging toward foes. However, they lack sophistication in intelligence and charm, providing them with weaknesses when faced with more cunning or charismatic opponents. </summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Orc has the following values: Strength is +3, which is considered very good and contributes to their physical prowess in melee attacks. Dexterity is +1, viewed as average, and aids in their agility and some ranged attacks. Constitution is also +3, again very good, enhancing their durability. Intelligence is -2, regarded as very bad, limiting their tactical options and ability to understand complex situations. Wisdom is +0, which is average; this affects their Perception checks and general awareness. Charisma is +0 as well, indicating no particular social prowess.

The Orc has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Their Perception skill is notably good at 12, making them reasonably aware of their surroundings, while their Stealth ability is slightly better at 11, indicating an average proficiency in sneaking. They can communicate in Common and Orc, allowing interaction with other humanoids and some more primitive beings.

Among its special abilities, the Orc has "Stalwart," which allows it to make saving throws against ongoing effects that provide a repeated save to end the effect earlier in its turn and with advantage. This ability is very good, granting the Orc a tactical edge during combat, especially against debilitating effects.

The Orc’s primary action is the "Greataxe" attack, where it makes a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, landing a hit for 9 slashing damage on average, using a d12 for damage roll plus a +3 modifier. This damage output is significant and can be quite deadly in close encounters. Alternatively, the Orc can use a "Javelin," which can be either a melee or ranged attack, also with a +5 to hit. This attack has a reach of 5 feet or a range of 30 feet/120 feet, dealing 6 piercing damage on a successful hit, which is an average hit.

As a bonus action, the Orc can use "Warrior’s Advance" to move up to its speed towards a hostile creature that it can see. This ability enhances its mobility, allowing it to close the distance to foes quickly, making them more aggressive and less predictable in combat.

Overall, the Orc is a straightforward yet effective combatant that thrives in melee situations, with decent hit points and resilience against certain conditions, making it a noteworthy adversary in any encounter.</detail>
