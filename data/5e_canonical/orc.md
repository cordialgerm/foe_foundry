<summary>Orcs are fierce, green-skinned humanoids known for their savage nature and warlike culture. Standing taller and stronger than most humans, Orcs are brutal warriors who live for battle and conquest. They often form raiding parties or large warbands, attacking settlements and taking what they want by force. Orcs are known for their strength, aggression, and lack of fear, charging into battle with little regard for their own safety. They typically wield crude but effective weapons like axes, spears, or clubs, and are often led by chieftains or powerful shamans.</summary>
