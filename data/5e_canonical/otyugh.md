<summary>An Otyugh is a grotesque, three-legged creature with a bloated, writhing body covered in filth. Its long, tentacle-like appendages end in spiked, clawed grips, which it uses to snatch prey. Otyughs are typically found in sewers, refuse heaps, or other filthy places, where they feed on garbage, carrion, or any living creature that gets too close. They are highly adaptable scavengers, able to live off almost any kind of waste. Though not particularly intelligent, they are cunning enough to set ambushes or trap prey using their tentacles and sharp teeth.</summary>

<summary>The Otyugh is a large aberration notable for its grotesque appearance and repulsive habits. It typically inhabits the sewers or other waste-filled areas, often lurking in filth and muck. With a solid armor class of 14 and a substantial pool of hit points totalizing 110, it presents a formidable challenge, particularly for less experienced adventurers. Its challenge rating of 6 means it can provide a significant threat, especially given its multi-attack capabilities and grappling proficiency. While its defensive attributes are decent, the Otyugh’s intelligence is notably low, reflecting its base instincts rather than strategic thinking. It excels in close combat, using its tentacles and bite as primary attacks, but its movement speed is average at 30 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Otyugh has the following attributes: Strength 16 (+3, good), Dexterity 10 (+0, average), Constitution 16 (+3, good), Intelligence 6 (-2, very bad), Wisdom 14 (+2, good), and Charisma 5 (-3, very bad). It possesses a decent defensive presence, holding a +6 modifier for both Strength and Constitution saving throws, which falls into the good category. The creature has darkvision up to 120 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, making it quite effective in its natural habitats. It communicates through telepathy within 120 feet, enabling it to convey thoughts and images to allies.

In combat, the Otyugh makes two tentacle attacks as part of its multiattack action. Each tentacle attack has a +6 to hit and can reach up to 10 feet, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage and an additional 4 (1d8) piercing damage on a successful hit. If it grapples a Medium or smaller creature, it restrains them until the grapple is released, making it harder for the target to escape.

Furthermore, through the Tentacle Slam ability, the Otyugh can slam creatures it is grappling into a hard surface or into each other, forcing them to make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. If they fail, they take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, are stunned until the end of the Otyugh’s next turn, and are pulled up to 5 feet closer to the Otyugh, which can significantly shift the dynamic of the battle.

As a bonus action, the Otyugh can perform a Bite attack with a +6 to hit, reaching 5 feet to deal 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If this attack lands and targets a creature, that creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On failure, the target contracts a disease that poisons them. This disease reduces the target's hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) with each failure on subsequent saving throws they make every 24 hours, creating a lasting threat even after the encounter ends.

Lastly, the Swallow ability allows the Otyugh to engulf Medium or smaller creatures that are stunned. If successful, the swallowed creature gains total cover from outside attacks, but is blinded and restrained within the Otyugh's body, suffering 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of the Otyugh’s turns. If the swallowed creature inflicts 15 or more damage to the Otyugh in one turn, they can escape, adding another tactical consideration during confrontations with this unsettling creature.

The Otyugh is a large aberration creature known for its strength and resilience in combat. With a Challenge Rating of 5, it presents a moderate threat to adventurers. It boasts a formidable 108 hit points and an Armor Class of 14, which provides good defensive capabilities. The Otyugh is equipped with special abilities that render it resistant to various conditions, make it capable of simple telepathic communication, and have a noxious stench that can poison nearby creatures. Offensively, it uses multiattack tactics that involve biting, grappling with tentacles, and slamming opponents together. Its bite can inflict disease, potentially crippling affected foes in prolonged encounters. Overall, the Otyugh thrives in close combat, utilizing its physical prowess and unique abilities to dominate the battlefield.

The Otyugh has the following attributes: 
- Strength: +3 (good) 
- Dexterity: +0 (average) 
- Constitution: +7 (very good) 
- Intelligence: -2 (bad) 
- Wisdom: +1 (average) 
- Charisma: -2 (bad)

The creature possesses darkvision with a range of 120 feet, allowing it to see in complete darkness as if it were dim light. Its passive Perception score is 11, meaning it has an average chance to notice hidden creatures, and it has a Stealth score of 10, indicating a lack of effectiveness in remaining undetected. The Otyugh can communicate in its own language, but it is unable to understand languages spoken by others.

Among its special abilities, the Otyugh exhibits Aberrant Resilience, granting it resistance to being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned. This ability allows it to effectively ignore many debilitating effects from spells and abilities, thus enhancing its survival in combat. Through Limited Telepathy, it can convey simple messages and images to allies within 120 feet, facilitating non-verbal communication during encounters without allowing for direct responses. The Stench ability requires nearby creatures to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn if they are within 10 feet; failure results in poisoning, which can hinder their performance in fights until cured.

In terms of actions:
- The Otyugh can perform a Multiattack, making one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks, or it can replace both Tentacle attacks with a Tentacle Slam.
- For its Bite attack, it uses a +6 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, it deals 12 piercing damage (2d8 + 3) and forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against infection from a disease. If infected, the target becomes poisoned and must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours with the risk of losing additional hit points.
- The Tentacle attack also uses a +6 to hit, has a reach of 10 feet, and deals a combination of 15 damage (6 bludgeoning and 9 piercing). If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled, requiring a DC 13 escape check to break free.
- The Tentacle Slam allows the Otyugh to slam grappled creatures against each other or objects. Creatures must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw; failure results in 14 bludgeoning damage (4d6) and being stunned until the end of their next turn, while success results in half damage and no stunning effect.

This combination of defensive and offensive capabilities makes the Otyugh a formidable opponent in the depths of its layers, capable of controlling the battlefield and potentially debilitating multiple foes simultaneously.</detail>
