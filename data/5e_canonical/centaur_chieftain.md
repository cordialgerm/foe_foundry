<summary>The Centaur Chieftain is a large monstrosity characterized by its blend of brute strength and tactical leadership, functioning as a formidable combatant on the battlefield. This chaotic neutral creature has a strong physique, boasting a high Strength score and respectable Constitution, making it both a dangerous melee attacker and a resilient opponent. Its Dexterity allows for some agility, but it is not as pronounced as its strength. Notable strengths include its high hit points and several damaging attacks, while its overall average Intelligence can make it less strategic in certain contexts. The chieftain also commands its allies effectively through its Leadership ability, and its Charge ability can significantly amplify its damage output. However, it may struggle against more intelligent foes who can exploit its predictability in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Centaur Chieftain has an Armor Class of 16, which is considered good for its Challenge Rating of 5, allowing it to withstand moderate attacks effectively. With 110 hit points, calculated as 17d8+34, it has very good durability. Its movement speed is impressive at 50 feet, enabling it to engage with enemies quickly. 

In terms of attributes, the Centaur Chieftain's Strength is exceptional at 19, providing a +4 modifier that enhances its melee attacks. Dexterity is relatively average at 12, giving a +1 modifier, while Constitution is good at 14, translating to a +2 modifier. Intelligence is quite low at 9, resulting in a -1 modifier, making it below average in knowledge-based tasks. Wisdom and Charisma both sit at 14, granting +2 modifiers which are good for perception and charisma-related interactions.

The saving throws are as follows: Dexterity at +4, Constitution at +5, and Wisdom at +5, indicating good resilience against physical and some magical effects. The Chieftain has proficiency in several skills, including athletics at +7, perception at +5, and survival at +5, showcasing its capabilities in physical feats and awareness of its surroundings.

Regarding combat actions, the Centaur Chieftain can make a Multiattack, performing two actions: one with its pike and another with its hooves, or two with its longbow. Its pike attack has a +7 to hit, a 10-foot reach, and deals 9 piercing damage (1d10 + 4). The hooves attack also has a +7 to hit, a 5-foot reach, and inflicts 11 bludgeoning damage (2d6 + 4). For ranged attacks, the longbow has a +4 to hit and can strike targets from 150 feet away, dealing 5 piercing damage (1d8 + 1).

The Centaur Chieftain possesses a special ability called Charge, where if it moves at least 30 feet straight towards a target before hitting with its pike, the target suffers an additional 14 piercing damage (4d6). This ability enhances its potential to deal significant damage when it can close gaps effectively.

The Leadership ability allows the Centaur Chieftain to enhance the performance of its allies. It can use this ability for 1 minute after a short or long rest, granting a d4 to attack rolls or saving throws made by nonhostile creatures within 30 feet who can hear and understand it. This bolstering effect makes the chieftain a valuable support unit during encounters.

Lastly, the Rearing Strike, which can be used after a recharge period of 5-6, allows the Chieftain to deal heavy area damage. It requires creatures within 15 feet to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw; on a failed save, they take 28 bludgeoning damage (8d6), or half on a successful save. However, using this strike leaves the chieftain vulnerable, reducing its Armor Class by 2 until its next turn, which can lead to increased risk if not used strategically.</detail>
