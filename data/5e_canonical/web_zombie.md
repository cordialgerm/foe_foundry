<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>The Web Zombie is a medium undead creature that embodies a neutral evil alignment. Serving as an unsettling adversary in encounters, it possesses unique attributes and abilities that make it both a threat and an aberration. The Web Zombie is relatively weak in terms of durability, with an Armor Class of 8 and 22 hit points, but it compensates for this with its ability to cause necrotic damage and its unsettling mobility on vertical surfaces. While it can climb and ignore webbing constraints, its low Dexterity makes it less agile. This creature can be simultaneously a hindrance to players due to its entrapment skills while being a menace with its augmented melee damage. Notably, its Undead Fortitude allows it to potentially remain in the fight after sustaining fatal blows, which could lead to unforeseen complications during combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Web Zombie has the following attributes:
- Strength: 13 (+1), which gives it an average melee attack capability.
- Dexterity: 6 (-2), indicating a very bad ability to dodge or evade attacks.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), providing a good amount of stamina, contributing to its hit points and resilience.
- Intelligence: 3 (-4), showcasing a very bad capacity for reasoning and problem-solving.
- Wisdom: 6 (-2), indicating a very bad insight and perception level.
- Charisma: 5 (-3), reflecting a very bad capability for social interactions.

When it comes to saving throws, the Web Zombie has a Wisdom save bonus of +0, which is average. It is immune to poison damage and is unaffected by the poisoned condition, highlighting its undead nature. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and a passive Perception of 8, which is below average.

The abilities of the Web Zombie enhance its combat effectiveness. The Necrotic Weapons ability allows it to inflict an additional 1d6 necrotic damage on a successful melee hit, making its melee attacks particularly dangerous. With the Spider Climb ability, it can traverse difficult terrain, including ceilings, without difficulty, giving it an edge in vertical combat scenarios. The Web Walker ability further allows it to move freely through webbing, preventing it from becoming trapped or hindered in such scenarios. Finally, the Undead Fortitude provides a second chance for survival; when it is reduced to 0 hit points, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the damage taken. If successful, it drops to 1 hit point instead, allowing it to continue fighting unless it suffers critical damage or radiant damage.

In terms of actions, the Web Zombie can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make two slam attacks. If both attacks successfully hit a Medium or smaller target, that target becomes restrained in webbing. The affected target can attempt to escape with a Strength check (DC 11) or the webbing can be attacked directly, requiring a hit to destroy. The Slam action is a straightforward melee weapon attack with a +3 to hit, dealing 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage on a successful strike. Overall, the combination of its special abilities and actions creates a creature that can effectively entrap, damage, and withstand attacks during encounters.</detail>
