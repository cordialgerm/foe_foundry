<summary>A Solar is one of the most powerful celestial beings, second only to the gods themselves. Towering with a radiant, muscular form and large, feathered wings, Solars are divine warriors who serve the forces of good. They are incredibly strong and wield potent weapons imbued with holy power. In addition to their martial prowess, Solars are capable of casting powerful healing and protective magic. Their presence alone can inspire awe and fear in both allies and enemies. Solars are sent to fight evil, lead celestial armies, or serve as divine champions for their gods.</summary>

<summary>The Solar is a formidable celestial creature, embodying divine power and serving as a beacon of truth and justice. With a large frame and impressive stats, it boasts an exceptional Armor Class of 21, making it quite difficult to hit. With a robust health pool of 319 hit points, the Solar can withstand considerable damage. Being a challenge rating 21 creature means it is designed for high-level encounters, presenting both a threat and a source of aid to those who respect its virtues. Notably, the Solar is immune to necrotic and poison damage, has resistance against radiant damage and nonmagical weapons, and possesses several unique abilities that define its combat style. However, despite its strengths, it relies heavily on its melee capabilities and spellcasting for damage output, making it somewhat limited against ranged combat without relying on its innate abilities.</summary>

<detail>

The Solar has the following attributes, which reflect its incredible physical and mental prowess: a Strength score of 28, which translates to a +9 modifier, indicating exceptional physical power; a Dexterity score of 22 (+6), reflecting above-average agility; a Constitution score of 28 (+9), offering exceptional vitality; an Intelligence score of 22 (+6) denoting above-average intellect; a Wisdom score of 30 (+10), marking it as exceptionally perceptive; and a Charisma score of 30 (+10), demonstrating an extraordinary ability to influence others. In terms of saving throws, it is particularly adept at Charisma-based checks with a +17 bonus, while its Wisdom saving throw is significantly lower, being effectively average at +0.

In combat, the Solar can take multiple actions, starting with a Multiattack option that allows it to strike twice with its Holy Sword. This melee weapon attack has a +16 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals substantial damage of 23 (4d6 + 9) slashing plus an additional 21 (6d6) radiant damage on a successful hit. Additionally, the Solar possesses a potent area attack known as Column of Flame, which creates a fiery cylinder in a specified area that inflicts both fire and radiant damage (21 (6d6) of each) to those caught within it unless they succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw.

One of the Solar's defensive abilities is its replenishing defenses via Forceful Parry, which activates when the Solar is bloodied. If a creature misses with a melee attack against it, the Solar's parry inflicts 21 (6d6) lightning damage, along with a DC 24 Constitution saving throw that, upon failure, pushes the attacker back and prone.

Furthermore, the Solar can utilize legendary actions, taking up to three during other creatures’ turns. This includes Teleportation, allowing it to move up to 120 feet to any location it sees. It can also Heal others by restoring 60 hit points and cleansing them of certain ailments. A notably powerful legendary action is Deafening Command, which affects creatures within 30 feet who can hear it. Affected creatures must make a DC 24 Charisma saving throw, suffering 21 (6d6) thunder damage upon failure, and must obey the Solar's commands, which may result in them falling prone, using their reactions to approach, fleeing, or surrendering.

Additionally, the Solar benefits from special abilities like Champion of Truth, automatically detecting lies while being unable to tell them. Its innate spellcasting allows it to cast powerful spells such as commune, control weather, and resurrection once per day without the need for material components, showcasing its ability to interact with the world beyond physical combat.

Through these varied abilities and high stats, the Solar stands as a powerful guardian and a force of divine retribution, making it a memorable encounter within any campaign.

The Solar is a powerful celestial being characterized by its angelic nature, making it a formidable entity in combat as well as in roleplay scenarios. With a Challenge Rating of 21, it boasts impressive physical abilities, incredible defenses, and potent magical capabilities. It has a high Armor Class of 21 derived from its natural armor, allowing it to withstand significant attacks while presenting a substantial threat to opponents with its multiattack feature. The Solar has a massive pool of hit points, totaling 306, which allows it to endure prolonged encounters. Its array of special abilities grants it resilience against various damage types, immunity to certain conditions, and the ability to sense and combat supernatural threats effectively. Overall, the Solar serves as an extraordinary ally for good-aligned parties or a perilous foe for those who oppose its divine ideals.

The Solar has the following attributes: Strength is +8, Dexterity is +6, Constitution is +8, Intelligence is +14, Wisdom is +14, and Charisma is +17. These represent very good to exceptional qualities, particularly in Charisma, making it an imposing presence in both combat and social interactions. Its high Wisdom and Intelligence also contribute to its effectiveness in divination and control.

The Solar possesses a range of special abilities. It is resistant to radiant damage and to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, categorizing these defenses as very good. Additionally, it is immune to exhaustion as well as the charmed and frightened conditions, thus maintaining its effectiveness in various situations. With Angelic Senses, the Solar can detect Aberrations, Celestials, Fiends, and Undead within 30 feet, allowing it to assess threats in its vicinity effectively. The Solar's attacks are particularly potent; its Angelic Weapons ability ensures that any attack made with its weapons deals an extra 6d8 radiant damage, making its melee attacks exceptionally lethal. Divine Awareness grants the Solar the ability to discern when a lie is spoken in its presence, a mechanic that can significantly impact narrative interactions. 

Defensively, the Solar has advantage on spell saving throws due to its Magic Resistance, improving its resilience against magical attacks. Its Divine Protection ability forces Aberrations, Celestials, Fiends, and Undead to have disadvantage on their attacks against it, providing an exceptional edge in encounters with typical foes of its kind. The Solar's Immortal Nature allows it to operate independently of food or rest, placing it at an unparalleled advantage in sustained engagements. For crucial moments, it has Legendary Resistance, allowing it to succeed on saving throws that it would otherwise fail, up to three times per day.

In combat, the Solar can make a Multiattack with its Greatsword or Holy Fire Bolt, delivering damage on multiple fronts. Its Greatsword attack has a +15 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, inflicting 22 slashing damage plus an additional 27 radiant damage, making it a high-damage threat. The Holy Fire Bolt, a ranged spell attack with +14 to hit, has a range of 60 feet and deals 34 radiant damage plus 14 fire damage, providing versatility at a distance. Additionally, the Healing Touch ability can restore 40 hit points to a target and remove debuffs such as curses or diseases, making the Solar invaluable for sustaining its allies during combat.

The Solar's spellcasting ability enables it to perform several powerful spells without the need for material components, utilizing Wisdom as its spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 22. At will, it can cast command and invisibility on itself. It can use greater restoration and resurrection three times a day, and once per day, it can invoke holy aura to bolster its defenses and that of its allies.

For its bonus actions, the Solar employs Celestial Tactics, choosing to empower weapon strikes for allies, inspire resolve with temporary hit points and removal of conditions, or manipulate the battlefield for strategic repositioning of allies without provoking attacks of opportunity.

In addition to its standard actions, the Solar has several legendary actions, allowing it to react more dynamically in combat. It can teleport up to 120 feet to reposition itself, unleash Searing Burst to deal damage in an area, or use Intimidating Glare to impose penalties on multiple enemies, showcasing an exceptional level of tactical control.

Ultimately, the Solar is not only a powerful adversary or ally in battle, but its extensive abilities also offer rich narrative opportunities for storytelling and character interaction within any campaign.</detail>
