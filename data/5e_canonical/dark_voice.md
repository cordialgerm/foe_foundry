<summary>The Dark Voice is a medium humanoid creature aligned with neutral evil, effectively serving as a cunning and manipulative adversary in combat. With a solid armor class of 16 due to its chain mail and a significant pool of 91 hit points, it is notably resilient. Its primary strengths lie in its high charisma of 18, as well as its impressive abilities in persuasion and intimidation, making it a formidable foe in social interactions and conflicts alike. The creature's regeneration ability allows it to heal in dim light or darkness, enhancing its survivability, while its proficiency in both melee and ranged attacks enables it to deal considerable damage. However, its weakness lies in its sunlight sensitivity; when exposed to sunlight, it suffers disadvantages on attacks and perception checks. Overall, the Dark Voice is a potent enemy that thrives in low-light conditions, using its abilities to manipulate and frighten adversaries.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Dark Voice are as follows: Strength is 14, which provides it with a good modifier of +2, making it capable of moderate physical prowess. Dexterity is average at 10, posing no benefit or detriment. Constitution is somewhat good at 15, offering a +2 modifier that contributes to its durability. Intelligence is average at 11, giving it a +0 modifier, which indicates that it's neither particularly clever nor dull. Wisdom is 16, resulting in a good +3 modifier, signifying perceptiveness and insight. Lastly, Charisma is exceptional at 18, granting a +4 modifier, which significantly boosts its effectiveness in social interactions.

The Dark Voice has notable special abilities that enhance its effectiveness in battle and challenge opponents. "Dark Devotion" allows the Dark Voice to have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, making it resilient to many forms of magical influence. Its "Regeneration" ability allows it to recover 5 hit points at the start of its turn while in dim light or darkness, allowing it to sustain itself in battle unless it begins its turn with 0 hit points and cannot regenerate. However, it suffers from "Sunlight Sensitivity," which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks in sunlight, making it vulnerable when out in the open.

In terms of actions, the Dark Voice can execute a "Multiattack," allowing it to make two attacks with its mace during its turn. The mace attack itself has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) cold damage on a successful hit. For ranged combat, the Dark Voice can use a "Heavy Crossbow," which has a +3 to hit and can target foes within a range of 100 feet (at normal range) to 400 feet (at disadvantage). This attack delivers 5 (1d10) piercing damage, also supplemented by 7 (2d6) cold damage.

One of its most intriguing abilities, "Whispers of Shadow," recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allowing the Dark Voice to create an area of dim light within 30 feet around it. This ability imposes further effects on non-dark folk creatures, requiring them to succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to avoid taking 13 (3d8) psychic damage and becoming frightened until the start of their next turn, adding a layer of psychological terror to combat scenarios and manipulating the battlefield to the Dark Voiceâ€™s advantage.</detail>
