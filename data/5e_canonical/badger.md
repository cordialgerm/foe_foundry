<summary>The Badger is a small, stocky mammal with powerful digging claws and a black-and-white striped face. Badgers are solitary and territorial, making their homes in burrows that they dig into the ground. Though generally peaceful, badgers are fearless when provoked, attacking with sharp claws and teeth. They are known for their relentless nature, often fighting larger predators if threatened. Their digging skills allow them to create elaborate tunnel systems, where they store food and raise their young.</summary>

<summary>The badger is a tiny beast known for its strong sense of smell and modest physical capabilities. With an Armor Class of 10 and only 3 hit points, it is not a formidable opponent in combat; however, it can be useful for scouting and sneaking due to its burrowing ability and keen senses. The badger has a challenge rating of 0, indicating it poses very little threat to experienced adventurers, granting only 25 experience points upon defeat. Its low strength and intelligence make it weak in direct confrontations, but its advantage in Perception checks relying on smell allows it to be a relatively effective tracker or scout in specific scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The badger's attributes show a low strength score of 4, resulting in a modifier of -3, which is considered very bad. It has a dexterity score of 10, giving it an average modifier of +0, meaning it does not excel in agility but can perform basic maneuvers. Its constitution score is 12, translating to a good modifier of +1, allowing it to endure minor harm. The intelligence score is extremely low at 2, leading to a modifier of -4, which is exceptionally poor. The wisdom score is moderate at 12, providing a good +1 modifier that supports its perception abilities, while its charisma of 4 results in a very bad modifier of -3.

In terms of senses, the badger possesses darkvision that allows it to see in low light up to 30 feet, augmenting its ability to navigate dark environments. It has a passive perception score of 11, reflecting its capability to notice details in its surroundings without actively seeking them out.

One of the badger's notable special abilities is "Keen Smell," which grants it advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell. This means when the badger attempts to detect creatures or objects through scent, it can roll two d20s and take the higher result, significantly increasing its chances of success.

In combat, the badger can perform a "Bite" action, which is a melee weapon attack with a +2 to hit and a reach of 5 feet targeting one creature. If it successfully hits, it deals 1 piercing damage. However, a unique aspect of this attack is that if the damage would reduce a Small or larger target to 0 hit points, that target takes no damage from the badger’s bite. This mechanic helps prevent the badger from potentially eliminating larger creatures outright, highlighting its role as more of an annoyance rather than a serious threat in battles.

The badger is a tiny beast that serves primarily as a minor nuisance in the world of Dungeons & Dragons. With very low combat capabilities and a Challenge Rating of 0, it poses little threat to adventurers due to its basic stats and damage output. However, it showcases some interesting mechanics, such as its tendency to act aggressively towards those who have harmed it and its strong sense of smell. While it lacks any significant power or defenses, its ability to burrow can provide tactical advantages in certain scenarios.

In terms of attributes, the badger has a Strength score of -3, making its physical attacks very bad. Its Dexterity is 0, providing average agility but not much evasiveness. The Constitution at +1 gives it an average capability to withstand damage, while its Intelligence at -4 is very bad, indicating a lack of reasoning or complex thought. The Wisdom score of +1 is average, allowing it some awareness of its surroundings, and the Charisma at -3 is very bad, meaning it has little personal charm or influence.

The badger has a basic Armor Class of 10, offering minimal protection. With only 9 hit points, it can easily be defeated in combat. It possesses a movement speed of 20 feet and can burrow at a speed of 10 feet, allowing it to escape or maneuver underground. The badger has darkvision that extends 30 feet, enhancing its visibility in low-light conditions.

The badger has a few notable special abilities. The "Grumpy" ability dictates that it will specifically retaliate against the last creature that damaged it, as long as that creature is within attack range or can be reached without provoking opportunity attacks. Otherwise, it will target the nearest hostile creature, which reflects its aggressive nature in combat. "Heightened Smell" enhances its Perception score to 16 when detecting smells, indicating a very good ability to notice things through its sense of smell.

When it comes to actions, the badger can perform a "Bite" attack, which is a melee weapon attack with a -1 to hit. This makes its chance of successfully landing an attack low, contributing to its overall ineffectiveness in combat. The damage dealt by the bite is 1 piercing damage, as it rolls 1d4 and subtracts 3 due to its low Strength score.

Overall, while the badger may not be a formidable opponent, it features a flavor of character and simple mechanics that can be fun in the context of a larger adventure.</detail>
