### Special Abilities

- **Contortionist:** The pombero can contort its body into unnatural positions, allowing it to easily move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The pombero’s destination must still have suitable room to accommodate its volume.
- **Forest Camouflage:** The pombero has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forested terrain.
- **Speak with Beasts:** The pombero can communicate with Beasts as if they shared a language.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The pombero makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Charming Touch, if available.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Charming Touch (Recharge 5–6):** One creature the pombero can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 10 minutes. If the target suffers any harm, the effect ends. Otherwise, the target can repeat the saving throw at the end of every minute, ending the effect on itself on a success. The pombero can have only one creature charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous creature ends.
- **Invisibility:** The pombero magically turns invisible until it attacks or uses Charming Touch, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the pombero wears or carries is invisible with it.
