The Blood Giant boasts high hit points, exceptional physical strength, and effective combat skills, complemented by its capacity to use powerful magic abilities.

<detail>

The Blood Giant has an Armor Class of 15, which denotes a good level of defense thanks to its natural armor. It possesses 126 hit points, calculated from rolling 12 twelve-sided dice, plus an additional 48, which provides it with a strong survivability in combat situations. The creature has a walk speed of 40 feet, allowing it to maneuver effectively on the battlefield. It has been assigned a Challenge Rating of 8, indicating that it provides a significant challenge worth 3,900 experience points for defeating it.

The Blood Giant's attributes reflect its physical prowess and resilience. It has a Strength of 23 (+6), which is exceptional, allowing it to hit very hard in combat. Its Dexterity is average at 12 (+1), so while it can evade attacks, it's not particularly agile. With a Constitution of 18 (+4), the Blood Giant is very good at resisting physical effects and maintaining its hit points. Intelligence is low at 8 (-1), indicating poor mental acuity; Wisdom is strong at 16 (+3), giving it good insight and perception; however, Charisma is very low at 5 (-3), suggesting it has little to no social capability.

In terms of saving throws, the Blood Giant has an exceptional Constitution saving throw at +7, a good Wisdom saving throw at +6, and a bad Dexterity saving throw at +4. 

It possesses skills in History (+2), Perception (+6), and Religion (+2). With damage immunities to cold and poison, along with resistances to necrotic damage, this giant is well-protected against several types of attacks. It is immune to being exhausted and poisoned, enhancing its longevity in battles. The Blood Giant has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 16, allowing it to sense its surroundings effectively.

The Blood Giant's special abilities enhance its combat effectiveness. With Blood Sense, it can detect living creatures within 60 feet and generally sense their direction within a mile, making it a dangerous predator. Additionally, its weapon attacks are considered magical.

In terms of actions, the Blood Giant can use Multiattack to make two attacks with its Blood Spear. The Blood Spear is a melee attack that has a +9 to hit and deals 19 (3d8 + 6) piercing damage along with additional cold damage of 7 (2d6). It also has a ranged attack option called Rock, which also has a +9 to hit within a range of 60/240 feet, dealing 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

The creature also has access to Blood Magic, which requires it to recharge on a roll of 5-6. Blood Magic offers three potential effects: Impale creates 10-foot-high blood spikes in a designated area that forces affected creatures to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, inflicting significant piercing and cold damage. Drown allows the Blood Giant to poison a single creature, causing it to become incapacitated until the next turn and subsequently poisoned for one minute after. Lastly, Vaporize envelops the Blood Giant in a 20-foot-radius mist that obscures vision yet does not impair the Giant's own sight, hindering the visibility of its foes for 1d4 rounds.

Overall, the Blood Giant combines brute force, magic prowess, and tactical control over the battlefield, making it an awe-inspiring challenge for any adventuring party.</detail>
