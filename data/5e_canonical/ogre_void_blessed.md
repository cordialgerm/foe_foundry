<summary>The Ogre, Void Blessed, is a formidable and chaotic evil giant of large stature. It boasts considerable hit points and natural armor which make it resilient in combat, and its challenge rating of 6 indicates it poses a significant threat to adventurers. The creature possesses outstanding physical strength and constitution, enabling it to deal heavy damage and withstand attacks. However, it is hampered by low dexterity and intelligence, which limits its agility and tactical awareness. Notable for its psychic immunity and its ability to inflict mental confusion, the Void Blessed Ogre can blind its foes and unleash necrotic energy, making it a fearsome opponent in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Ogre has the following attributes: 
- Strength: 20, providing a very good +5 modifier, enabling it to excel in melee combat.
- Dexterity: 8, resulting in a bad -1 modifier, which affects its ability to react quickly or dodge.
- Constitution: 19, granting a very good +4 modifier that contributes to its impressive health pool.
- Intelligence: 5, resulting in a very bad -3 modifier, indicating limited cognitive abilities.
- Wisdom: 16, providing a good +3 modifier that enhances its perception and insight.
- Charisma: 6, resulting in a very bad -2 modifier, which does not aid in interactions that require charm or presence.

The Ogre is proficient in Constitution saving throws with a +7 modifier, which is very good for resisting effects that would reduce its health, and has a +6 modifier in Wisdom saving throws, also very good, helping it to withstand mind-altering effects. Its perception skill is good with a +3 modifier, allowing it to notice hidden creatures or traps effectively.

This creature possesses several key immunities and resistances:
- It is immune to psychic damage and conditions like being blinded and poisoned.
- It has resistance to necrotic and poison damage, which mitigates its vulnerability to certain types of attacks.

The Ogre's unique sensory abilities include blindsight up to 30 feet and tremorsense up to 120 feet, allowing it to detect movements and vibrations even without vision in its immediate environment. It can communicate in the languages Giant and Void Speech.

Special abilities of the Ogre include:
- Keen Hearing and Smell, which grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on these senses. This enhances its effectiveness in detecting stealthy foes.
- Tentacle Senses indicates that it cannot use its tremorsense if it is grappled or restrained, limiting its awareness in such situations.

In combat, the Ogre employs two primary attack options through its Multiattack ability:
- Tentacle Lash: A melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, allowing it to strike targets within 15 feet. It deals an average of 12 bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 psychic damage and inflicts blindness until the end of the target's next turn, forcing a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw to avoid the blindness effect.
- Void Bite: A melee weapon attack that also has a +8 to hit, this attack targets foes within 5 feet, dealing an average of 10 piercing damage along with 9 necrotic damage. 

Additionally, it can opt to make three Void Spit attacks instead, each with a +6 to hit over a distance of 60 feet, dealing an average of 12 necrotic damage.

As a reaction, the Ogre can utilize its Volatile Stomach ability. When it takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it can regurgitate stomach contents, creating a hazardous pool filled with necrotic energy. Each creature within 5 feet suffers 4 necrotic damage and may become poisoned until the end of their next turn with a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to negate. The ill effects of the pool persist, damaging and potentially poisoning creatures that enter it or start their turn there, demonstrating the Ogre's dangerous presence on the battlefield.</detail>
