<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The Forest Gnome Illusionist is a unique and versatile spellcasting creature that plays a supportive and controlling role in combat. With a challenge rating of 6, it possesses a decent amount of hit points and armor class, making it relatively durable for a spellcaster. Its strengths lie in its high intelligence and dexterity, allowing it to cast powerful spells effectively while also being nimble enough to escape danger. The illusionist is particularly adept at handling crowds with potent area control spells, making its presence important in larger engagements. However, the creature's melee capabilities are weak, and its lack of high charisma limits its social interactions, making it less effective in situations where charm or persuasion is necessary.</summary>

- 2nd-level spells feature alter self, allowing transformation, and misty step for quick teleportation.
- 3rd-level spells allow for control with hypnotic pattern, which incapacitates up to three creatures, counterspell to interrupt foes' casting, and fireball, which causes significant area damage.
- At the 4th level, dimension door enables teleporting short distances, greater invisibility provides concealment for itself or allies, while the devastating cone of cold can deal up to 36 cold damage in a wide area.
- For bonus actions, misty step allows the illusionist to reposition quickly.
- Finally, it can react to incoming spells using counterspell to disrupt enemy magic or shield to boost its defense against attacks.

Overall, the Forest Gnome Illusionist is a crafty and resourceful spellcaster that excels in control and ranged combat, while its animal communication abilities and spellcasting provide it with a diverse toolkit to handle a variety of situations dynamically.</detail>

- **Hypnotic Pattern (3rd-Level; S, M, Concentration):** A swirling pattern of light appears at a point within 120 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of the pattern that can see it makes a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the creature is charmed for 1 minute. While charmed  the creature is incapacitated and its Speed is 0. The effect ends on a creature if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it out of its daze.
- **Fireball (3rd-Level; V, S, M):** Fire streaks from the mage to a point within 120 feet and explodes in a 20-foot radius  spreading around corners. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw  taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
- **Dimension Door (4th-Level; V):** The mage teleports to a location within 500 feet. They can bring along one willing Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. If a creature would teleport to an occupied space  it takes 14 (4d6) force damage  and the spell fails.
- **Greater Invisibility (4th-Level; V, S, Concentration):** The mage or a creature they touch is invisible for 1 minute.
- **Cone of Cold (5th-Level; V, S, M):** Frost blasts from the mage in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw  taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Misty Step (2nd-Level; V):** The mage teleports to an unoccupied space they can see within 30 feet. The mage can't cast this spell and a 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.

### Reactions

- **Counterspell (3rd-Level; S):** When a creature the mage can see within 60 feet casts a spell, the mage attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the mage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If the mage casts counterspell with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of counterspell.
- **Shield (1st-Level; V:** When the mage is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of their next turn.
