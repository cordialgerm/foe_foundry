<summary>The Troglodyte is a medium humanoid creature known for its cunningness and its reliance on stealth and ambush tactics. With a challenge rating of 1/2, it is considered a low-level threat, making it an ideal encounter for beginner adventurers. Its strengths lie in its ability to surprise its enemies, thanks to its stealth skills and special abilities like Stench, which can incapacitate foes. However, it struggles in direct sunlight, incurring disadvantage on attacks and perception checks when exposed. With moderate durability, the Troglodyte can inflict consistent damage through its multiattack capabilities, but it is still vulnerable to well-coordinated attacks from adventurers who are aware of its weaknesses.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Troglodyte has the following values: Strength is 14, which offers it a good melee attack capability; Dexterity is 12, granting it average agility; Constitution is also 14, providing good hit points; Intelligence is 10, indicating average cognitive ability; Wisdom is 12, giving it average insight and perception; and Charisma is 10, representing a neutral social presence. The defensive capacity of this creature consists of an Armor Class of 11 and hit points totaling 19, derived from rolling 3d8 and adding 6. With its challenge rating, it yields 100 experience points upon defeat.

The Troglodyte possesses notable skills, particularly a stealth skill modifier of +3, which reflects its ability to remain undetected in shadowy areas, making it good at ambushing targets. Its darkvision allows it to see in total darkness up to 120 feet, while its passive Perception score is 11, which is average, enabling it to detect hidden threats effectively. It communicates using the Troglodyte language.

One of the Troglodyte's special abilities is its Stench. Any non-Troglodyte creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they become poisoned until the start of their next turn, which can hinder their performance in combat. On a successful save, they gain immunity to the Stench for 24 hours. The second special ability, Sunlight Sensitivity, imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks when the Troglodyte is in direct sunlight, making it less effective in bright environments.

In combat, the Troglodyte can use a Multiattack feature to deliver both a bite and claw attack. The bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, causing 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. Additionally, it forces the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw; failure results in infection by the Troglodyte Stench. The claw attack functions similarly, also with a +4 to hit and dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage. Lastly, the Troglodyte can use a Dart as a ranged weapon attack, with a range of 20/60 feet, dealing 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage and an additional 3 (1d6) poison damage upon a successful hit. This versatility in attacks allows the Troglodyte to engage effectively both at range and in close combat.</detail>
