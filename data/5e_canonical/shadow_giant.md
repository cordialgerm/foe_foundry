<summary>The Shadow Giant is a Huge chaotic evil creature that embodies the darkness of the Shadow Realm. With a formidable presence on the battlefield, it poses a significant threat to any adventuring party. With a high Armor Class of 17 and an impressive 209 hit points, it can withstand considerable punishment while delivering devastating attacks. Its Strength and Dexterity are both notably high, granting it powerful melee attacks and excellent agility in combat. Despite its strengths, the Shadow Giant has a medium-level Challenge Rating of 15, suggesting that while it is a challenge, it can be effectively managed with strategy. It has notable resistances to cold and necrotic damage, making it more durable against certain attacks. However, its reliance on vision and the mechanics of its special abilities, particularly in relation to saving throws, can present opportunities for clever adventurers.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Shadow Giant are as follows: Strength is 18, which gives it a modifier of +4, indicating it has good physical prowess; Dexterity is exceptional at 25, yielding a +7 modifier, allowing for very good agility; Constitution is 17 (modifier +3), which is average and indicates reasonable resilience; Intelligence is 12 (+1 modifier), highlighting average cognitive abilities; Wisdom is 13 (+1 modifier), also suggesting average perception; and Charisma is high at 21, with a +5 modifier, allowing it to be quite persuasive and impactful in social interactions. The saving throw for Wisdom is +6, which is adequate but can be overcome with strong spellcraft or abilities focused on Wisdom, and it has a perception skill of +6, indicating it is very competent in spotting hidden creatures or objects.

Among its special abilities, the Shadow Giant's Blacklight Strobe creates a significant tactical challenge for opponents. Creatures within 30 feet that can see the giant must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be limited to one attack per turn and cannot use any bonus actions or reactions until the start of their next turn. This ability can effectively cripple the damage output of its enemies. The Distracting Flicker ability affects spellcasters specifically; those within the same range maintaining concentration on spells must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. A failure means the creature loses concentration, which can disrupt key spells during combat. Its Shadow Sight allows it to see in magical darkness, negating a common tactic used against creatures with vision limitations.

The Umbral Glimmer allows the Shadow Giant to potentially shift to the Plane of Shadow after its turn ends. It rolls a d20, and on an 11 or higher, it can enter this other dimension, providing it a strategic retreat or repositioning advantage that can make it a moving target. While in the Plane of Shadow, it cannot interact with anything on the Material Plane but can observe it from a distance of 120 feet.

When it comes to actions, the Shadow Giant can initiate a Multiattack, allowing it to strike three times using its Tenebrous Talons. Each melee weapon attack has a +12 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, providing it good odds of landing strikes. On a hit, it deals 14 slashing damage plus an additional 18 necrotic damage, making its attacks exceptionally powerful. Additionally, it can use its Cold Shadow ability, which requires a recharge on a roll of 5 or 6. In a 60-foot cone, it forces each affected creature to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, dealing significant cold damage (52 damage or half on a success) and imposing disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of the creatures' next turn if they fail their saves. This ability can turn the tide of battle by limiting the effectiveness of multiple adversaries simultaneously.</detail>
