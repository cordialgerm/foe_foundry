<summary>The Sporous Crab is a small, unaligned beast that thrives in filthy environments, often found in swamps or dank caves. With an armor class of 14, it possesses natural armor that provides decent protection. It has a total of 33 hit points, giving it a moderate amount of durability in combat. The crab's speed allows it to walk and swim at 30 feet, making it quite mobile in both aquatic and terrestrial settings. Being a challenge rating of 1, it is a manageable opponent for low-level adventurers, providing an experience reward of 200 XP when defeated. Its primary strengths include its ability to infect creatures with spores and its resistance to bludgeoning damage, while it is vulnerable to fire attacks. The Sporous Crab relies on its special abilities and attacks to incapacitate and overwhelm foes, with some limitations in its overall offensive potential.</summary>

<detail>

The Sporous Crab has the following attributes: Strength is 14 (+2), which is good for physical attacks; Dexterity is 8 (-1), which is bad and reflects a lack of agility; Constitution is 15 (+2), providing good durability; Intelligence is 3 (-4), indicating extremely low brain power and making it incapable of complex thought; Wisdom is 13 (+1), offering average perception; and Charisma is 4 (-3), suggesting it lacks social appeal and presence. The crab possesses darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light, and has a passive Perception score of 11, providing decent awareness of its surroundings.

In terms of abilities, the Sporous Crab has several notable features. It is amphibious, enabling it to breathe in air and water. Its "Filthy" ability means that any creature that touches it or strikes it with a melee attack while within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Failure results in being poisoned until the end of their next turn, and if the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the creature contracts sewer plague. A successful save grants immunity to this effect for the next 24 hours.

The crab has a standard multiattack feature, enabling it to make two claw attacks during its turn. The claw attacks have a +4 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 4 points (1d4 + 2) of bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. 

Its unique "Spore" action can be used every 6 turns. When activated, the crab sprays spores in a 15-foot cone, requiring creatures in the area to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. A failed save results in 7 points (2d6) of poison damage and an infection with spores. Successfully saving means taking half damage and avoiding infection. The infected creatures develop visible symptoms after an hour and must continue to make saving throws after each long rest. If they fail for 7 consecutive days, young Sporous Crabs hatch from their bodies, dealing an additional 9 points (2d8) of slashing damage. The spores can be removed early with a lesser restoration spell or similar magical means, adding a layer of urgency and strategy to encounters with the Sporous Crab.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The sporous crab can breathe air and water.
- **Filthy:** The sporous crab makes its home in grime and muck and is covered in filth. A creature that touches the sporous crab or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it also contracts sewer plague. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the crab’s Filthy trait for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sporous crab makes two claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
- **Spore (Recharge 6):** The sporous crab sprays spores in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) poison damage and becomes infected with the crab’s spores. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t infected with spores. After 1 hour, small bubbles and bumps appear across the skin of the infected creature. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the infected creature’s body fights off the spores and no longer has to make the saving throw. If a creature fails the saving throw every day for 7 days, young sporous crabs hatch from the creature’s skin, and the creature takes 9 (2d8) slashing damage. The spores can also be removed with a lesser restoration spell or similar magic.
