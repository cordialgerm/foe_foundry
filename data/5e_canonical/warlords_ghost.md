<summary>The Warlord's Ghost is a medium undead creature that embodies the essence of a once-great warrior, now transformed into a haunting apparition bent on revenge. This spectral entity possesses notable strengths, including the ability to phase through obstacles and evade many harmful conditions that typically afflict living beings. Its high Charisma makes it exceptionally powerful in terms of spell-like abilities, particularly those that manipulate the fate of its adversaries. However, it also has weaknesses; its physical robustness is average, and it can still be harmed by magical attacks or by those who can see through its ethereal nature.</summary>

<detail>

The Warlord's Ghost has an Armor Class of 13, which provides a basic defense that is considered average. It has 58 hit points, which translates into a decent durability for a creature of its challenge rating, making it a moderate threat in battle. Its movement capabilities include a walking speed of 30 feet and a flying speed of 40 feet, allowing for versatile positioning during encounters.

In terms of attributes, the Warlord's Ghost has a Strength score of 8, which is poor, and does not contribute effectively to melee combat. Its Dexterity score of 16 provides a good bonus of +3, enhancing its ability to avoid attacks and improve its initiative. The Constitution score of 10 is average, contributing little to its overall resilience. An Intelligence score of 12 (+1) shows that it can hold its own in strategic discussions, but it does not excel in mental acuity. With a Wisdom score of 10, it has no particular strengths or weaknesses in perception. Most notably, its Charisma of 18 (+4) indicates a strong presence and is vital for its powerful abilities.

The Warlord's Ghost is immune to cold, necrotic, and poison damage, showcasing its undead nature. It also has resistances to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, as well as immunity to damage dealt by nonmagical weapons, making it quite difficult to harm for standard attackers. It is immune to a wide range of conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, frightened, or poisoned, which allows for exceptional control in combat scenarios. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet and has a passive perception score of 10, allowing it to see in darkness and react when necessary. It can communicate in the languages it spoke in life.

The Warlord's Ghost has several special abilities. Its Death Howl allows it to unleash a devastating Baleful Wail when reduced to 0 hit points, causing significant psychic damage to its enemies. The Detect Life ability enables the ghost to sense living creatures up to 5 miles away, providing an advantage in stalking prey. It has Incorporeal Movement, allowing it to pass through solid objects and creatures, though it incurs minor damage if it ends its turn in an object. As an undead creature, it does not require air, sustenance, or sleep. The Unquiet Spirit trait ensures that if it is defeated, it will rise again on the anniversary of its death unless permanently put to rest through specific conditions.

In terms of actions, the Warlord's Ghost can use Presage Death to target a creature within 60 feet that can hear it. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, failing which it suffers 11 (2d6 + 4) psychic damage and becomes magically cursed for one hour. While cursed, this target faces disadvantage on its saving throws against the Warlord's Ghost's Baleful Wail ability, making it significantly easier for the ghost to incapacitate its foes.

The Baleful Wail is a powerful attack that allows the Warlord's Ghost to unleash a horrific shriek. All living creatures within 30 feet that can hear it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 11 (2d6 + 4) psychic damage. If a creature is already cursed, it drops to 0 hit points instead of simply taking damage, which can instantaneously eliminate any weakened adversaries nearby.

For its reaction, the Warlord's Ghost can activate Wounded Warning when it takes damage from a creature within 60 feet. This reaction allows it to immediately use Presage Death on the attacker, retaliating against those who harm it.

Overall, the Warlord's Ghost is a formidable undead opponent with abilities and traits that can turn the tide of battle, particularly against unsuspecting adventurers.</detail>
