<summary>The Chronomatic Enhancer is a formidable Large Construct that plays a unique role in combat and tactical scenarios. Its primary strength lies in its ability to manipulate time around it, providing significant advantages to allies while debilitating enemies. With robust defensive capabilities, including damage immunities and resistances, it is a challenging opponent to overcome. However, the Chronomatic Enhancer's low Intelligence and Charisma suggest that it may lack strategic cunning compared to more intelligent creatures, which could be considered a weakness. Overall, this construct presents a blend of offensive power and strategic support, making it a valuable asset on the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Chronomatic Enhancer has an Armor Class of 16, providing it with good protection against attacks. It possesses 152 hit points, which places it at the high end of durability among monsters of its Challenge Rating, making it very difficult to defeat quickly. Its speed of 30 feet allows for average mobility. With a Challenge Rating of 12, it is suitable for a party of characters around level 12, giving approximately 8,400 XP upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Chronomatic Enhancer has a Strength score of 21, allowing it to make extremely effective melee attacks due to a +5 modifier, which is considered exceptional. Its Dexterity score of 11 results in a +0 modifier, translating into average agility; however, its Constitution score of 19 gives it a +4 modifier, making it very resilient. The creature has low Intelligence (9, -1) and Charisma (5, -3), indicating very poor mental capabilities. It has a Wisdom score of 15, resulting in a +2 modifier, which is considered good for perception-based tasks. 

The Chronomatic Enhancer benefits from several advantages in battle, such as damage immunities to poison and psychic damage, and resistances against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage unless inflicted by adamantine weapons. It is immune to various conditions including charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and tremorsense out to 10 feet, providing good sensory capabilities, as well as a passive perception of 16. Although it understands the languages of its creator, it cannot communicate verbally.

The Chronomatic Enhancer features the special ability "Delay," which allows it to postpone the damage it takes until its next turn. This means that while it will still need to make any required saving throws and will face immediate effects of any damage (like being slowed), the overall hit point loss is deferred, giving it a chance to react. Its "Immutable Form" makes it immune to spells or effects that would alter its physical form, reinforcing its durability.

In combat, the Chronomatic Enhancer's "Multiattack" lets it execute a series of actions, enabling it to use its Time-Infused Gears before making three slam attacks. Each slam attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit, reaching 5 feet, and dealing an average of 14 bludgeoning damage (2d8 + 5) per hit.

The "Time-Infused Gears" ability allows the Chronomatic Enhancer to affect time around it, benefiting allies or hindering enemies. It can release "Energizing Electricity," which boosts the speed, AC, and Dexterity saving throws for up to three creatures, essentially transforming them into more formidable allies for the duration of the effect. Alternatively, it can unleash "Slowing Gas," inflicting penalties on up to three enemies, including halving their movement speed and restricting their actions. Finally, it can use "Stasis," temporarily freezing its opponents in time if they fail a saving throw, rendering them unable to act while remaining conscious.

As a reaction, the Chronomatic Enhancer can activate "Alter Timeline" when a friendly creature within 15 feet takes damage. It can reduce the damage taken by changing all rolled damage dice to 1s, which significantly minimizes the impact on its allies.

In summary, the Chronomatic Enhancer represents a powerful combination of offensive capabilities and strategic asset deployment, using its unique control over time to alter the dynamics of battle in its favor.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Delay:** When damage is dealt to the chronomatic enhancer, the enhancer doesn’t take the damage until its next turn. The enhancer must still make the appropriate saving throws, and it immediately suffers any extra effects of the damage, such as the speed-reducing effect of the ray of frost spell. Only the damage is delayed.
- **Immutable Form:** The chronomatic enhancer is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The chronomatic enhancer can use its Time-Infused Gears. It then makes three slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Time-Infused Gears:** The chronomatic enhancer spins its time-infused gears, altering time near it. It can’t affect itself with its gears. When activating its time-infused gears, it uses one of the following: <br>* Energizing Electricity. The chronomatic enhancer releases mild electricity into up to three creatures the enhancer can see within 30 feet of it. Each target has its speed doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to its AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional bonus action or reaction (target’s choice) until the end of its next turn. <br>* Slowing Gas. The chronomatic enhancer releases a slowing gas, affecting up to three creatures it can see within 20 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can’t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last until the end of the target’s next turn. <br>* Stasis (Recharge 6). The chronomatic enhancer stops time for up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be frozen in time until the end of its next turn. A creature frozen in time is treated as if it is petrified, except it isn’t transformed into an inanimate substance and its weight doesn’t increase.

### Reactions

- **Alter Timeline:** When a friendly creature within 15 feet of the chronomatic enhancer takes damage, the enhancer can modify time to protect the creature, changing all damage dice rolled to 1s.
