<summary>The Sazakan is a Medium elemental creature embodying the essence of cold and ice, categorized as lawful neutral. It boasts an impressive Armor Class of 16 due to its natural armor, making it relatively resilient in combat. With 142 hit points, derived from rolling 19d8 plus a constitution modifier, it can withstand significant damage before being defeated. The Sazakan is recognized for its Challenge Rating of 8, making it a formidable foe worth 3,900 experience points. It has decent physical and mental attributes, particularly notable for its above-average Wisdom score of 18, which contributes to its proficiency in saving throws and perception. While it excels in dealing cold damage, it also has resistances and immunities that give it an advantage in specific situations, while its weaknesses lie in its inability to change wind conditions and reliance on environmental factors. </summary>

<detail>

The Sazakan has the following ability scores: Strength of 17 (+3, which is good), Dexterity of 14 (+2, average), Constitution of 16 (+3, good), Intelligence of 11 (+0, average), Wisdom of 18 (+4, very good), and Charisma of 9 (-1, bad). Its saving throws are most effective in Wisdom, with a modifier of +4, which is considered very good. It possesses skills in perception with a modifier of +4, also very good.

The creature has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, helping it reduce damage from common physical attacks. Additionally, it is immune to conditions such as exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, and poison, which makes it particularly difficult to incapacitate. The Sazakan has darkvision that extends 60 feet and blindsight up to 30 feet, along with a passive perception of 17, allowing it to be highly aware of its surroundings. It communicates in Aquan, Common, and Giant languages.

A notable special ability of the Sazakan is the "Blizzard Heart," which allows it to alter weather conditions within a one-mile radius, changing precipitation and temperature every hour without requiring an action. This ability mimics the control weather spell's effects while being limited in its capacity to create extreme heat. The "Icy Nature" trait enables the Sazakan to require only half the amount of air, food, and drink that a humanoid of its size would need, granting it an advantage in resource management. Its "Wintry Aura" inflicts cold damage on nearby creatures at the start of its turn, dealing an average of 7 cold damage, which presents a constant threat to those closing in.

In combat, the Sazakan can initiate a "Multiattack," allowing it to make three Icy Wind Lash attacks in one turn. The Icy Wind Lash attack utilizes a melee or ranged spell attack roll, achieving a +7 to hit, showcasing very good offensive capability. It deals slashing damage of 8 (1d8 + 4) along with an additional 7 cold damage (2d6). If it scores a critical hit, the target becomes restrained by ice until the end of its next turn, significantly limiting the target’s mobility.

The Sazakan can also unleash the "Ice Whirlwind" ability, which has a recharge mechanic that activates on a roll of 5-6. By creating a vortex of icy wind, it affects each creature within 10 feet, dealing a substantial 28 cold damage (8d6) while pushing creatures up to 15 feet away and knocking them prone. A creature can attempt a DC 15 Strength saving throw to halve the damage and resist being pushed or knocked prone. Failing this saving throw by 5 or more results in additional effects, where the creature is encased in ice, becoming restrained until freed via a DC 15 Strength check or if the encased creature takes fire damage. This ability effectively controls the battlefield and can severely hinder multiple foes at once.</detail>
