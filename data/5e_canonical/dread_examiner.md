<MonsterName/>Dread Examiner</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Aberration</CreatureType>

<summary>The Dread Examiner is a large aberration with a neutral evil alignment, presenting a formidable presence in any encounter. With an impressive armor class of 19 and a staggering 322 hit points, this creature is built to withstand significant damage while dealing out formidable attacks. It boasts exceptional intelligence and charisma, making it not only a powerful physical adversary but also a master of manipulation and strategic planning. Its exceptional spellcasting abilities complement its physical prowess, allowing it to dominate both in melee and ranged combat. However, the Dread Examiner does have its weaknesses; it has limited effectiveness against magical attacks, despite its magic resistance, and relies heavily on its psychic abilities for reconnaissance and manipulation.</summary>

<detail>

The Dread Examiner has the following attributes: Strength at 20 with a modifier of +5 (very good), Dexterity at 16 with a modifier of +3 (good), Constitution at 22 with a modifier of +6 (very good), Intelligence at 25 with a modifier of +7 (exceptional), Wisdom at 23 with a modifier of +6 (very good), and Charisma at 25 with a modifier of +7 (exceptional). When it comes to saving throws, the Dread Examiner has a +1 bonus to Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saves, which is considered average. It has a high perception skill at +6, enabling it to be aware of its surroundings effectively.

The Dread Examiner possesses several immunities to damage and conditions, including immunity to poison and nonmagical physical attacks, as well as resistance to acid, cold, and fire. It is also immune to effects that cause exhaustion, paralysis, petrification, poisoning, being prone, or restrained. With truesight extending 120 feet and a passive perception score of 23, the Dread Examiner can see through normal and magical darkness, allowing it to perceive creatures as they truly are. It can communicate in all languages and uses telepathy to communicate within 120 feet.

Among the Dread Examiner's notable special abilities is its Legendary Resistance, which allows it to succeed on failed saving throws three times per day, enhancing its survivability. Additionally, its Magic Resistance confers an advantage on saving throws against spells or magical effects. The Otherworldly Form ability enables it to ignore effects that would normally alter its physical form or sever limbs, while the Psychic Awareness ability allows it to be acutely aware of any observers within 120 feet, seeking to maintain an upper hand in combat. Its Sense Magic ability can detect magical auras within 120 feet at will, functioning similarly to the Detect Magic spell but without being magical itself.

In terms of actions, the Dread Examiner can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three attacks using either Force Swipe or Force Blast, and it may replace one attack with a spellcasting action. The Force Swipe is a melee spell attack with a +14 to hit, dealing 43 force damage and potentially pushing the target up to 10 feet if they fail a DC 20 Strength saving throw. The Force Blast is a ranged spell attack, also with a +14 to hit and a range of 120 feet, dealing the same damage and knocking the target prone if they fail the same saving throw.

Its spellcasting ability allows it to cast specific psionic spells using a Charisma-based DC of 22, without requiring spell components. It can cast Dispel Magic and Telekinesis at will, Fabricate as an action, and has a limited number of higher-level spells such as Animate Objects (three times a day), Wall of Force (once a day), and True Polymorph (once a day).

The Dread Examiner also has legendary actions that enhance its versatility in battle. It can Teleport up to 120 feet to any unoccupied space, taking its equipment with it. The Reform action allows it to regain 36 hit points by rearranging its form, while the Psychic Surge unleashes a wave of psychic energy in a 20-foot radius, inflicting 21 psychic damage to any nearby creatures, who also suffer disadvantage on their next attacks and ability checks unless they succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw to halve the damage and negate the other effects. This combination of traits makes the Dread Examiner a threat that requires careful strategy and planning to confront effectively.</detail>
