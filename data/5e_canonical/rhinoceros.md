<summary>A Rhinoceros is a large, herbivorous mammal with thick, tough skin and a distinctive horn on its nose. Found in grasslands or savannas, Rhinoceroses are solitary creatures that graze on plants and foliage. While generally peaceful, they can become highly aggressive if threatened, charging at perceived dangers with surprising speed and using their horn to gore attackers. Their size and thick hide provide natural protection, making them formidable animals in their environment.</summary>

<summary>The rhinoceros is a large beast known for its immense physical strength and simple but powerful attacks. It has moderate defensive capabilities with an Armor Class of 12 and a total of 45 hit points, allowing it to absorb a fair amount of damage in combat. The rhinoceros moves quickly for its size, boasting a walking speed of 40 feet. With a challenge rating of 2, it presents a reasonable threat to low-level adventuring parties. Its main strengths lie in its powerful melee attack called Gore, which can deal significant bludgeoning damage and potentially knock down opponents. However, it has a low Dexterity score, making it less agile, and its Intelligence and Charisma scores are also notably low, indicating that it lacks complex thought and social interaction capabilities.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the rhinoceros has a Strength score of 20, which provides it with a +5 modifier, leading to very good effectiveness in physical tasks and combat situations. Its Dexterity score of 8 gives it a -1 modifier, resulting in poor agility and reflexes, classifying it as bad. With a Constitution score of 14, it provides a +2 modifier, indicating good resilience, while its low Intelligence score of 2 gives it a -4 modifier, making it exceptionally unwise in matters of knowledge and understanding. A Wisdom score of 12 grants a +1 modifier, which is average and offers a slight edge in perception. Finally, its Charisma score of 4 yields a -3 modifier, categorizing it as very bad when it comes to social interactions.

The rhinoceros has the following notable action:

- **Gore:** This melee weapon attack allows the rhinoceros to strike at a target with a +7 to hit, making it very good at landing its blows. The attack has a reach of 5 feet and targets one opponent. On a successful hit, this attack deals 14 (2d8+5) bludgeoning damage. Additionally, if the rhinoceros has moved at least 20 feet in a straight line toward the target before executing this attack, it deals an additional 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage and forces the target to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. If the target fails this saving throw, it falls prone, giving the rhinoceros and its allies an advantageous position in combat.

The Rhinoceros is a powerful and formidable creature classified as a large beast, often found in a variety of environments. With an Armor Class of 11, its natural armor provides some protection, while its 63 hit points enable it to endure significant damage during battles, making it a durable adversary. Its challenge rating (CR) of 2 indicates that it presents a moderate challenge to adventurers. Notably, the Rhinoceros excels in physical attacks, leveraging its strength, which has a modifier of +5, rated as very good. However, its Dexterity and Charisma modifiers are low, at -1 and -2 respectively, making it vulnerable to attacks that rely on agility or social interactions. Its high Constitution modifier of +2 provides it with resilience against effects that require saving throws.

The Rhinoceros has several notable abilities and actions. With a Charge ability, it can gain extra damage by moving quickly toward a target before attacking, which can also push the target and knock it prone if they fail a Strength saving throw. This makes it an aggressive creature in combat, seeking to close the gap and initiate powerful melee attacks. During a typical round, it can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make two Gore attacks in one action. The Gore attack has a +7 to hit and deals significant damage, averaging 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. 

Additionally, the Rhinoceros can use its Quaking Stomp as a bonus action. This ability shakes the ground around it, forcing creatures nearby to make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone, creating strategic opportunities for the Rhinoceros and disrupting enemy formations. Overall, this creature serves as a front-line fighter, using its strength to overpower opponents and control the battlefield with its abilities while relying on its durability to withstand retaliatory strikes.</detail>
