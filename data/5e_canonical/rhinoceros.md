<summary>A Rhinoceros is a large, herbivorous mammal with thick, tough skin and a distinctive horn on its nose. Found in grasslands or savannas, Rhinoceroses are solitary creatures that graze on plants and foliage. While generally peaceful, they can become highly aggressive if threatened, charging at perceived dangers with surprising speed and using their horn to gore attackers. Their size and thick hide provide natural protection, making them formidable animals in their environment.</summary>
