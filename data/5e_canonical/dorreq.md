<summary>The Dorreq is a Medium aberration that embodies the traits of Neutral Evil beings, making it a deceptive and dangerous opponent in combat. With a considerable amount of strength and dexterity, it poses a significant threat, particularly through its physical attacks and special abilities. The Dorreq's ability to warp space around it and inflict both thunder and necrotic damage makes it a formidable adversary. However, its relatively low hit points and limited movement can be considered drawbacks. The Dorreq is designed for ambush tactics, relying on its powerful physical attacks and the use of its special abilities to control the battlefield.</summary>

<detail>

The Dorreq has an Armor Class of 15, which is considered good, providing it decent protection against incoming attacks. It possesses 93 hit points, derived from rolling 17d8 plus an additional 17, indicating its durability is above average. Its movement speed is 15 feet, which is rather slow for a creature of its nature. The Dorreq has a Challenge Rating of 4, meaning it is suitable for a group of adventurers looking for a moderate challenge, granting them 1,100 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of attributes, the Dorreq exhibits strong physical capabilities with a Strength score of 19 (+4 modifier) and a Dexterity score of 19 (+4 modifier), both classified as very good. It has an average Constitution of 13 (+1 modifier) which provides a reasonable amount of resilience. Its Intelligence is average as well at 11 (+0 modifier), while its Wisdom of 8 (-1 modifier) indicates poor situational awareness. The Charisma score of 10 (+0 modifier) signifies that it has a neutral presence in social interactions.

The Dorreq excels in Dexterity saving throws, having a modifier of +6, categorized as very good. It has skills in Intimidation (+2), Perception (+1), and Stealth (+8), with Stealth being particularly exceptional, making the Dorreq adept at remaining undetected. It is resistant to acid, cold, and lightning damage, which provides it with a versatile defense against various forms of attack. It has darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 11, allowing it to see in darkness and detect hidden creatures easily. The Dorreq communicates through Void Speech, a unique form of communication that may not be understood by all.

The primary special ability of the Dorreq is Void Warping. Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the Dorreq must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. Failure results in the creature's speed being halved until the start of its next turn, potentially limiting movement options for adversaries and allowing the Dorreq to maintain control over its surroundings.

In combat, the Dorreq can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack, a melee weapon attack, has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage on a successful hit. The Tentacle attack also has a +6 to hit but a reach of 10 feet and deals 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, they are grappled with an escape DC of 14 and are pulled 5 feet closer to the Dorreq, rendering them restrained until the grapple ends. The Dorreq can grapple a maximum of two creatures simultaneously.

Another notable action is Void Thrum, which charges on a roll of 5 or 6. The Dorreq emits a barely audible thrum that affects all creatures within 20 feet. Creatures must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 10 (3d6) thunder damage and 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, thereby dealing significant damage; half damage is inflicted on a successful save.

As a bonus action, the Dorreq can use Stone Step to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space visible to it, provided both the starting and destination points have a stone or rocky surface. This ability enhances its tactical mobility, allowing it to reposition quickly during combat.</detail>
