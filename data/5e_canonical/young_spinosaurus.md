### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath:** The spinosaurus can hold its breath for 1 hour.
- **Reptilian Affinity:** The spinosaurus never willingly attacks a reptilian Humanoid, such as a lizardfolk or dragonborn, unless attacked first. If magically forced to attack such a creature, the spinosaurus has disadvantage on attack rolls against it. This trait doesn’t function if the spinosaurus’s rider or tamer directs it to attack.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The spinosaurus makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the spinosaurus can’t Bite another target.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.
