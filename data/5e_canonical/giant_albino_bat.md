<detail>

The Giant Albino Bat has an armor class of 15, making it relatively difficult to hit, representing a good defensive capability. It has 76 hit points, which is an average amount for its challenge rating, allowing it to sustain a fair amount of damage before being taken down. Its speed is notable, as it can fly at 80 feet and walk 10 feet, granting it excellent mobility in the air as well as limited ground movement.

In terms of attributes, the bat possesses a strong strength score of 19 (+4 modifier), resulting in very good effectiveness when performing physical attacks. Its dexterity score of 16 (+3 modifier) is also good, enhancing its agility and armor class. Its constitution of 15 (+2 modifier) provides average resilience against attacks. The bat's intelligence is very low at 7 (-2 modifier), making it ineffective at complex tasks or problem-solving. It has a moderate wisdom score of 14 (+2 modifier), allowing it to perceive its surroundings decently, but its charisma is particularly poor at 6 (-2 modifier), indicating a lack of social skills or presence.

The bat's special abilities include echolocation, which allows it to navigate and detect prey within a range of 60 feet as long as it is not deafened. Its keen hearing grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that depend on auditory stimuli, enhancing its ability to identify threats or targets in its environment.

In combat, the Giant Albino Bat can use its multiattack action to make two separate attacks during its turn. It can perform one bite attack and one claw attack, effectively combining its offensive capabilities. The bite attack has a melee weapon attack bonus of +6 to hit and deals 11 points of piercing damage on a successful hit, which is quite potent. The claw attack also has a +6 to hit, dealing 9 points of slashing damage. Additionally, if the target is a Large or smaller creature, the bat can grapple it, forcing the target to succeed on a DC 13 escape check to break free. While grappled, the target is restrained, meaning it cannot move or make attacks, and the bat must focus on restraining that target, preventing it from using its claws on others.

Overall, the Giant Albino Bat is a fierce and deadly opponent, utilizing its physical prowess and keen senses to dominate encounters, making it a notable threat in any adventurer's path.</detail>
