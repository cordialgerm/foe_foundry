<summary>The Chuhaister is a large, chaotic evil giant notable for its raw physical strength and imposing presence on the battlefield. With an Armor Class of 16, it possesses a good natural defense due to its thick skin, making it quite resilient to physical attacks. Its impressive hit points of 157, derived from 15d10+75, allow it to endure considerable damage before being defeated. While its Dexterity is somewhat lacking, reflected in a modifier of -1, the Chuhaister compensates with excellent Strength and Constitution scores, with +6 and +5 modifiers, respectively. This giant excels in melee combat thanks to its Multiattack ability, allowing it to strike twice with a powerful greatclub, dealing substantial bludgeoning damage. However, the Chuhaister is sensitive to bright light, suffering from disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks in such conditions. Its Feybane ability provides a unique advantage against fey creatures, preventing them from regaining spell slots and allowing the Chuhaister to see through magical illusions. Additionally, it has a reactive ability called Deadfall Shield, which can negate damage to itself or an ally, emphasizing its defensive capabilities in combat.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Chuhaister are as follows: Strength 22 (+6), Dexterity 9 (-1), Constitution 20 (+5), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 11 (+0), and Charisma 12 (+1). The effectiveness of these modifiers ranges from very bad in Dexterity to exceptional in Strength and good in Constitution. The Chuhaisterâ€™s saving throw for Constitution stands at +8, which is very good, making it highly resistant to effects like poison.

In terms of skills, the Chuhaister has a +9 bonus in Athletics, making it exceptionally capable at physical tasks such as climbing, jumping, or grappling. It is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, while also being unaffected by charm effects, positioning it well against magical influences that would otherwise hinder its performance.

The Chuhaister has two primary actions: the Greatclub attack and the Rock attack. The Greatclub attack, with a +9 to hit, has a reach of 10 feet and offers a solid damage output of 23 (5d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage, making it a formidable choice in close combat. The Rock attack, giving a range of 30 feet normally and up to 120 feet at disadvantage, has a +2 to hit and deals a potent 33 (5d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit, providing effective ranged offense.

The unique ability, Deadfall Shield, which can be used when the Chuhaister or an ally within 30 feet is struck by an attack, creates a magical barrier that absorbs damage, reflecting its capacity for protection during encounters. This ability recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allowing for strategic use in difficult combat situations. 

Overall, the Chuhaister presents a versatile threat in battle, engaging opponents with powerful melee attacks while also possessing defensive capabilities and strategic strengths against spellcasters, particularly those of fey origin.</detail>
