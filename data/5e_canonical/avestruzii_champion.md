<detail>

The Avestruzii Champion's abilities include a variety of attacks and actions that enhance its combat effectiveness. Its Strength score grants it a +3 modifier, which is considered very good, allowing it to deal significant damage. Its Constitution score of 16, with a +3 modifier, also contributes to its resilience, making it a tough opponent to defeat. With a Dexterity of 12, its +1 modifier is just average, providing limited benefits to its agility or defense. Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are all average at 10, meaning they do not provide any significant advantages in skills or social interactions.

In terms of actions during gameplay, the Avestruzii Champion is capable of making a multiattack, which allows it to strike twice with its Greataxe in one turn, effectively applying pressure to its opponents. The Claw attack gives it the ability to deal slashing damage to an opponent in close range, rolling a d4 plus 3 for damage. The Greataxe, which is its primary weapon, provides a greater threat with a damage roll of 1d12 plus 3 piercing damage. Additionally, if the target is hit, they must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed back 5 feet, which can disrupt enemy positioning. The Shortbow provides a ranged option, allowing the champion to attack from a distance with piercing damage of 1d6 plus 1.

The Avestruzii Champion also has a reaction called "Dig In," which enhances its defensive capabilities, allowing it to bolster its position in anticipation of incoming attacks. This reaction is useful for maintaining momentum in battle, potentially minimizing damage taken during confrontations. 

The Avestruzii Champion exhibits strength and durability, making it a formidable force in combat scenarios, especially when used in conjunction with other allies to overwhelm opponents. Its varied attack options and reactions contribute to its effectiveness in battle, ensuring it can adapt to different combat situations.</detail>
