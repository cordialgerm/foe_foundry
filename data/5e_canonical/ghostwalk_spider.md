<summary>The Ghostwalk Spider is a formidable large monstrosity that embodies both stealth and strength, primarily functioning as a predator in its environment. With a neutral evil alignment, it typically engages its victims with cunning and lethality. This creature boasts an Armor Class of 15 and a substantial pool of Hit Points totaling 119, meaning it can withstand a significant amount of damage while dishing out high-damage attacks in return. It moves swiftly with a speed of 50 feet and has a Challenge Rating of 9, making it a significant encounter for adventurers. Notably, the Ghostwalk Spider has a diverse set of abilities, including an intrinsic resistance to various forms of elemental and non-magical damage while in its ghostly form, providing it with exceptional evasion capabilities. However, it does have weaknesses, primarily its low Charisma and Intelligence, which affect its ability to engage in social interactions or resist certain magical effects.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Ghostwalk Spider has a Strength score of 15, which gives it a +2 modifier, representing a good physical capability. Its Dexterity is exceptionally high at 20, providing a +5 modifier, making it very good at evading attacks and sneaking. The Constitution of 17 translates to a +3 modifier, giving it good resilience. Intelligence is below average at 9 (-1 modifier), while Wisdom stands at 14 (+2 modifier), allowing for good perception abilities. Charisma is most notably low at 8 (-1 modifier), which hampers its influence in social situations. It has proficient saving throws in Dexterity (+9) and Charisma (+3), along with skills in Perception (+6) and Stealth (+9). The Ghostwalk Spider is immune to poison damage and condition immunities against being poisoned.

Its sensory abilities include truesight up to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 16, which enhance its predatory skills significantly. Understanding Undercommon means it can comprehend certain languages, though it lacks the ability to speak them.

The Ghostwalk Spider possesses several special abilities. Its Ghostly Body while in Ghostwalk Form grants resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage. Additionally, it is immune to conditions that would otherwise immobilize it, such as grappling or paralysis. The Incorporeal Movement ability allows it to navigate through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, although it incurs force damage if it ends its turn inside a solid object. The Spider Climb ability lets it ascend difficult terrain effortlessly, including ceilings, while Web Walker enables it to ignore movement limitations posed by webs.

During combat, the Ghostwalk Spider can engage in a Multiattack, allowing it to perform one Bite attack and one Ghostly Snare attack, or two Bite attacks. The Bite attack is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit and reaches a 5-foot range, dealing a sharp 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage. If in its true form, it can also inflict poison damage, which requires the target to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid additional poisoning effects, leading to potential paralysis if the target is reduced to 0 hit points.

The Ghostly Snare attack is executed only in Ghostwalk Form and operates as a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60 feet and a +9 to hit. Upon hitting, the target is restrained by invisible webbing and becomes invisible themselves, complicating any attempts at escape. The restrained target can use its action to attempt a DC 15 Strength check to break free, or the webbing can be attacked to be destroyed.

Finally, it has a unique Bonus Action called Ghostwalk, allowing the Ghostwalk Spider to switch between ghostly and true forms without changing its statistics. Any items it is carrying also assume the ghostly characteristics, reverting to tangible form only upon its death.</detail>
