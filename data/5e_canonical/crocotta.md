<summary>The Crocotta is a Medium-sized monstrosity with a neutral evil alignment, renowned for its cunning and predatory instincts. With a formidable Armor Class of 14 derived from its natural armor and a healthy amount of Hit Points totaling 39, the Crocotta is a significant threat in combat, rated with a Challenge Rating of 3, which makes it suitable for encounters with mid-level adventurers. It boasts impressive physical attributes, particularly its Strength of 16, giving it a good attack modifier of +5 for melee attacks. While it can move swiftly with a speed of 50 feet, its intelligence is below average, which somewhat limits its tactical options. Notably, this creature can utilize its special abilities to deceive and incapacitate opponents, making it a strategic foe that can manipulate its environment and other creatures.</summary>

<detail>

The Crocotta has the following attributes: Strength: 16 (+3), Dexterity: 15 (+2), Constitution: 14 (+2), Intelligence: 8 (-1), Wisdom: 12 (+1), and Charisma: 8 (-1). Its Strength is quite good, enabling strong melee attacks, while its Dexterity provides it with a decent Armor Class and ability to remain stealthy, reflected by a +4 modifier in stealth checks. The Constitution score contributes to its good durability in fights. The Wisdom score allows for a heightened perception, represented by a +5 bonus for Perception checks, whereas its low Intelligence and Charisma hinder its social interactions and complex tactics.

In terms of defenses, the Crocotta has resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from metal weapons, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of such attacks, described as good defense. It is also immune to being blinded or charmed, making it a challenging enemy for spellcasters. The creature can communicate in Common and has a passive perception score of 15, making it alert and aware of its surroundings.

The Crocotta’s special abilities include Mimicry, Paralyzing Gaze, and Pounce. With Mimicry, it can imitate a range of sounds, confusing enemies or luring them into traps. However, a creature hearing these sounds can realize they are fakes with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check. The Paralyzing Gaze ability is particularly fearsome; creatures within 30 feet who can see the Crocotta must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn. Failure results in paralysis until the start of their next turn. Interestingly, canines are immune to this gaze, and canine-like humanoids, such as werewolves, have an advantage on their saving throw. Lastly, the Pounce ability allows the Crocotta to knock a target prone if it moves at least 20 feet toward it and successfully hits with a claw attack, which can lead to additional damage from a bite attack as a bonus action if the target is knocked prone.

For its actions, the Crocotta can make a Bite or Claw attack. The Bite attack has a +5 to hit and deals significant damage at 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage, making it very effective in close-quarters combat. The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit but inflicts slightly less damage at 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, which remains a good option for multiple strikes within a turn. Overall, the Crocotta combines speed, cunning, and physical prowess, offering a mix of tactical advantages in combat situations.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Mimicry:** The crocotta can mimic animal sounds, humanoid voices, and even environmental sounds. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check.
- **Paralyzing Gaze:** When a creature that can see the crocotta’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the crocotta, the crocotta can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the crocotta isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is paralyzed until the start of its next turn.

A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the crocotta until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the crocotta in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

Canines are immune to the crocotta’s Paralyzing Gaze, and canine-like humanoids, such as werewolves, have advantage on the saving throw.
- **Pounce:** If the crocotta moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the crocotta can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
