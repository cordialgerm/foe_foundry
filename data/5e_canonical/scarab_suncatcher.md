<summary>The Suncatcher Scarab is a gargantuan beast that embodies both strength and a degree of environmental control, making it a formidable opponent in any encounter. With an armor class of 19 due to its natural armor, it is quite resilient, supplemented by a substantial 145 hit points, which translates to a considerable buffer in combat. The scarab moves with agility, able to walk 30 feet, burrow 40 feet, and fly 15 feet, allowing it to adapt to various terrains. It possesses excellent strength with a score of 20 (+5), giving it powerful bite attacks, while its constitution of 18 (+4) enhances its durability. The scarab, however, suffers from a very low intelligence score of 1 (-5), rendering it incapable of strategic planning or communication. The challenge rating of 10 signifies that it poses a significant threat to an average party of adventurers. Notably, the Suncatcher Scarab can impose silence within its vicinity and features abilities that facilitate movement through difficult environments and stunningly effective attacks against objects.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Suncatcher Scarab are as follows: 
- Strength: 20 (+5, exceptional)
- Dexterity: 14 (+2, good)
- Constitution: 18 (+4, very good)
- Intelligence: 1 (-5, very bad)
- Wisdom: 12 (+1, average)
- Charisma: 16 (+3, good)

In terms of game mechanics, the creature has the following skills and resistances: 
- Skills: It has a perception skill that grants a +1 modifier, which is average for noticing threats.
- Damage Resistances: The scarab possesses resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, making it more durable against physical damage.
- Condition Immunities: It cannot be charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, or restrained, granting it significant resilience against various incapacitating effects.
- Senses: The creature has blindsight with a range of 90 feet but is blind beyond that radius. Its passive perception score is 11, which is average.
- Languages: The Suncatcher Scarab does not have any languages.

The Suncatcher Scarab has several special abilities:
- **Discordant Drone:** This ability creates a 15-foot radius around the scarab where creatures cannot hear each other’s spoken words. Furthermore, any creature within this area cannot cast spells that have verbal components, effectively mitigating spellcasting coordination among enemies.
- **Siege Monster:** Due to this ability, the scarab deals double damage to structures and objects, making it particularly dangerous when attacking fortifications.
- **Unstoppable:** The scarab can traverse difficult terrain without expending extra movement, and its speed cannot be reduced, making it a relentless force on the battlefield.

In combat, the Suncatcher Scarab is capable of performing multiple actions:
- **Multiattack:** It can make three Bite attacks in one turn.
- **Bite:** This melee weapon attack has a +9 to hit and can target a creature within 5 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 14 (2d8+5) piercing damage, along with an additional 7 (2d6) poison damage. The target is poisoned until the end of its next turn unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw.
- **Burrowing Burst:** If the scarab burrows at least 20 feet as part of its movement, it can use this action to burst out of the ground in a space occupied by enemies. This causes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage to those creatures and knocks them prone. Affected creatures must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw for half damage and to avoid being pushed back up to 10 feet. If there is no unoccupied space within range, the creatures fall prone in the scarab’s space, making it an effective area control move. The area within 10 feet of the scarab becomes difficult terrain, complicating enemy movement.
- **Wing Beat (Recharge 5–6):** By rapidly beating its wings, the scarab can unleash sound or light in a 60-foot cone, depending on whether its elytra are closed or open. When the elytra are closed, creatures in the area take 35 (10d6) thunder damage, are pushed 15 feet away, and knocked prone unless they succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. When the elytra are open, creatures take the same amount of damage, but instead receive radiant damage and are blinded until the end of their next turn, also offering a saving throw to avoid the glare.

This combination of powerful attacks and controlling abilities makes the Suncatcher Scarab a central threat in combat, capable of disrupting opposing team's strategies while dealing substantial damage.</detail>
