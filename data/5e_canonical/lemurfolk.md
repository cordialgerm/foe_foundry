With an armor class of 12, it possesses a relatively low defense, allowing it to be easily hit by more powerful creatures. Its hit points are 21, reflecting an average level of resilience for a creature of its challenge rating of 1/4, which translates to 50 experience points upon defeat. Lemurfolk are adept at moving stealthily and performing acrobatic maneuvers, with notable dexterity and skill in those areas.

Their gliding ability provides a tactical advantage, allowing them to mitigate falling damage and traverse spaces more effectively.</summary>

The attributes of the Lemurfolk include a strength score of 10, which signifies average physical power; a dexterity score of 15 (+2), denoting good agility and reflexes; a constitution score of 11, reflecting average resilience; an intelligence score of 12 (+1), indicating slightly above-average mental acuity; a wisdom score of 10, which is average; and a charisma score of 8 (-1), demonstrating a notable weakness in social interactions. The dexterity score is particularly important for the Lemurfolk, granting it a good modifier that enhances actions involving quick movements.

Lemurfolk have specialized skills that enhance their capabilities in specific tasks. They possess a proficiency in Acrobatics with a total bonus of +4, allowing for very good performance in maneuvers that require agility. Additionally, they possess a Stealth skill with a +4 bonus, contributing to their ability to remain unnoticed by others.

This creature has darkvision that allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light and in complete darkness as if it were dim light, although it can't discern color in darkness. Its passive perception is 10, which reflects an average awareness of its surroundings. The Lemurfolk speaks both Common and its own language, Lemurfolk.

The special abilities of the Lemurfolk include the Glide feature, which allows the creature to spread membranes between its limbs while falling. This ability enables it to descend at a controlled rate, falling only 60 feet per round while able to move horizontally by up to 5 feet for every foot it falls. It cannot ascend while gliding, but under favorable conditions, such as strong winds, it can glide further.

As for actions, the Lemurfolk can perform a melee attack called Slam, which is executed with a +4 to hit and has a reach of 5 feet. On a hit, this attack deals an average of 5 bludgeoning damage (1d6 + 2). In addition, it can use a blowgun for ranged attacks with a +4 to hit, effective up to a range of 25 feet for close targets and 100 feet for those further away. A successful blowgun attack deals 4 piercing damage (1d4 + 2) and forces the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. If the target fails this saving throw, it suffers the poisoned condition for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target becomes unconscious while also poisoned, waking only if it takes damage or is awakened by another creature. This highlights the Lemurfolk's ability to incapacitate foes and create tactical advantages in encounters.</detail>
