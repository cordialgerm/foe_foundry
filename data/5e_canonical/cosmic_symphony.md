<summary>The Cosmic Symphony is a formidable large celestial creature that serves as a powerful force in gameplay. With its impressive armor class of 18 and a substantial hit point total of 200, it can withstand significant damage in combat. The Symphony flies gracefully at a speed of 60 feet but is immobile on the ground, making it a tactical aerial combatant. With a challenge rating of 15, it represents a substantial threat, especially due to its high Dexterity, which provides it with exceptional speed and agility. While it lacks intelligence with a score of 2, its other attributes—particularly its high Charisma and Wisdom scores—allow it to excel in spellcasting and resistances. Its dual nature of being unaligned means it does not have a moral bias, making it a neutral entity in encounters. The Cosmic Symphony's notable strengths include its damage immunities and resistances, as well as its ability to incapacitate and stun opponents, creating opportunities for its allies or itself. However, its lack of physical mobility on the ground is a notable weakness.</summary>

<detail>

The Cosmic Symphony has the following attribute scores: Strength is 19 (+4), Dexterity is 26 (+8), Constitution is 25 (+7), Intelligence is 2 (-4), Wisdom is 21 (+5), and Charisma is 18 (+4). The low Intelligence reflects its minimal capacity for reasoning, indicating it may only react to stimuli and lacks strategic thinking. The impressive Dexterity gives it a very good modifier, enhancing its ability to avoid attacks and increasing its potency with ranged spell attacks. In combat, it is highly resilient with considerable constitution, providing it with good hit points and stamina, which is beneficial during prolonged engagements. 

In terms of saving throws, the Cosmic Symphony is proficient in Charisma with a modifier of +9, making it exceptional in resisting effects that target its willpower. Its Wisdom modifier is average at +1, which is less effective than its other defenses but still provides some degree of resilience against mental effects. The Symphony has a base perception skill of +5, enabling it to detect hidden opponents or environmental dangers effectively. It has immunities to radiant and thunder damage, is resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, and is immune to a variety of conditions, making it exceptionally difficult to hinder in battle.

The Cosmic Symphony possesses special abilities that enhance its combat capability. It is naturally invisible, which allows it to avoid detection and plan its attacks strategically. With Legendary Resistance available three times per day, it can choose to automatically succeed on failed saving throws, further increasing its durability in combat. Its Magic Resistance provides it with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, ensuring it can often dodge the most potent magical attacks.

For actions, the Cosmic Symphony can perform a multiattack which allows it to use its Universal Music ability, followed by either one Discordant Wave and one Slam attack or two Discordant Waves. The Discordant Wave can be either a melee or ranged spell attack, with a +10 to hit, delivering 27 (5d8+5) thunder damage on a hit. Additionally, targets within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become deafened until the end of their next turn. The Slam is a melee weapon attack with a +13 to hit, dealing 24 (3d10+8) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 22 (5d8) thunder damage, showcasing its significant physical power.

Its Universal Music is a powerful area control ability that can incapacitate multiple creatures within 120 feet, forcing them to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail the save are incapacitated for one minute, while those who fail by 5 or more are stunned for the same duration. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns, granting a chance to break free from the effect. This ability is particularly devastating as it can swing the tide of battle by rendering multiple opponents ineffective temporarily. 

The Celestial Crescendo is a recharge ability that inflicts 45 (10d8) thunder damage to all creatures within a 30-foot radius, while simultaneously deafening them for one minute unless they succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, which halves the damage and negates the deafening effect. This ability can deal substantial area-of-effect damage and further disrupt enemy tactics.

In addition to its standard actions, the Cosmic Symphony has several legendary actions. It can fly up to half of its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks, allowing it to reposition itself strategically. The Major Chord allows it to regain 18 (4d8) hit points, enhancing its sustainability in combat. Lastly, the Minor Chord forces each creature within 10 feet to make a DC 18 Constitution save or take 9 (2d8) thunder damage, providing it with an additional means to apply pressure on nearby enemies. This combination of abilities and actions makes the Cosmic Symphony a highly tactical creature that can control the battlefield effectively while remaining a formidable opponent in combat.</detail>
