<summary>Parzz’val is a large aberration embodying chaotic evil, known for its devastating capabilities in combat as well as its strategic use of area control through its unique abilities. With an armor class of 14, it relies on its natural armor to withstand attacks, while boasting a significant pool of 115 hit points, making it a challenging adversary rated at a challenge level of 8, which translates to 3,900 experience points for defeating it. Its movement speed is a nimble 50 feet, allowing it to engage or retreat efficiently during encounters. Notably, the parzz’val is vulnerable to thunder damage but is immune to acid, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from non-magical attacks, making it resilient against physical damage types. Its ability to regenerate health at the start of each of its turns adds to its longevity in battle.</summary>

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the parzz’val has strength rated at 21 (+5), which is exceptional and allows it to deal significant melee damage. Its dexterity of 16 (+3) is good, providing it with decent agility for avoiding attacks, while its constitution of 20 (+5) ensures it can sustain considerable damage. Its intelligence is very low at 5 (-3), making it inept in matters requiring cleverness or wit, and its wisdom of 10 (+0) reflects an average awareness. Charisma is also quite low at 7 (-2), indicating it's not persuasive or even particularly imposing outside of combat. The parzz’val has saving throw proficiency in constitution (+8), reinforcing its durability against various effects, and is stealthy with a +6 modifier to stealth checks.

The creature has several noteworthy special abilities. “Caustic Web” allows the parzz’val to spit a sticky and acidic web area, creating a zone of difficult terrain that can harm creatures trying to navigate through it. Those caught must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) acid damage, while successfully avoiding it reduces the damage by half. The web lasts for one minute, allowing the parzz’val to control the battlefield. The “Pummel” ability enables the parzz’val to gain advantage on melee attacks against a creature if it successfully deals damage to that creature with three attacks in a single round, heightening its threat level. Lastly, the “Regeneration” ability allows it to recover 10 hit points each turn, as long as it isn't incapacitated.

In terms of actions, the parzz’val can perform a multiattack, delivering three strikes on its turn—one with its oversized maw and two with its oversized fists. The “Oversized Fist” attack has a +8 to hit, with a reach of 10 feet, dealing 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The “Oversized Maw” attack, also with a +8 to hit, can deal 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus an additional 4 (2d8) acid damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it risks being swallowed by making a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Swallowed creatures are blinded and restrained, suffering from continuous acid damage each turn. This fierce offensive capability makes the parzz’val a formidable opponent, forcing characters to strategize carefully in their approach. If the parzz’val takes significant damage from the inside, there's a chance it will regurgitate the swallowed creature, further complicating the dynamics of the encounter.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Caustic Web (Recharge 5-6):** As a bonus action, the parzz’val can spit a sticky, acidic web in a 20-foot cube. The web must be placed wholly within 60 feet of the parzz’val and must be anchored between two solid masses or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. A web layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. The web is difficult terrain and lightly obscures the area.

A creature that starts its turn in the web or enters the web during its turn must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The web persists for 1 minute before collapsing. The parzz’val is immune to the effects of its web and the webs of other parzz’vals.
- **Pummel:** If the parzz’val deals damage to a creature with three melee attacks in one round, it has advantage on all melee attacks it makes against that creature in the next round.
- **Regeneration:** The parzz’val regains 10 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hp.

### Actions

- **Oversized Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Oversized Maw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 4 (2d8) acid damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the parzz’val. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the parzz’val, and it takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of the parzz’val’s turns. A parzz’val can have only one creature swallowed at a time.<br><br>If the parzz’val takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the parzz’val must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the parzz’val. If the parzz’val dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
