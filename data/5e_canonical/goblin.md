<summary>Goblins are small, green-skinned humanoids known for their cunning and mischievous nature. Standing about three to four feet tall, they live in caves, ruins, or forest hideouts, often forming raiding parties to attack and steal from travelers or nearby villages. Goblins are crafty and quick, favoring hit-and-run tactics and traps to overpower larger foes. While individually weak, they are dangerous in large numbers and often rely on ambushes and overwhelming their enemies with sheer numbers. They are cowardly by nature and will flee if the battle turns against them.</summary>

<summary>The Goblin is a small humanoid creature commonly found in various fantasy settings. It is often portrayed as a sneaky and cunning adversary, making it a favored choice for low-level encounters. With an Armor Class of 13 and 10 hit points, the Goblin has decent defensive capabilities for its challenge rating of 1/4, meaning it presents a minor threat to adventurers. Its most notable strengths lie in its agility, indicated by a Dexterity score of 12, which gives it a good ability to evade attacks and enhances its effectiveness in stealth. However, its physical strength is subpar, with a Strength score of 8 that results in a very bad modifier. The Goblin can use a variety of actions in combat, including melee and ranged attacks, and it benefits from its racial trait, Nimble Escape, allowing it to retreat or hide effectively in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Goblin has the following attributes: Strength 8 (very bad), Dexterity 12 (good), Constitution 10 (average), Intelligence 10 (average), Wisdom 10 (average), and Charisma 10 (average). Its skill in Stealth is notable as it has a +3 modifier, which gives it a good chance to remain undetected by characters, influencing surprise attacks or strategic retreats. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, enhancing its effectiveness in nocturnal operations.

In combat, the Goblin can perform the following actions: 

- Shortsword: This is a melee weapon attack that has a +3 to hit, meaning it is fairly effective against less armored opponents. It has a reach of 5 feet and deals 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage on a hit, representing a decent threat in close-quarter encounters.

- Shortbow: As a ranged weapon attack, the Goblin can use this weapon with a +3 to hit, making it a good option for attacking from a distance. It has a range of 80 feet for normal range and 320 feet at disadvantage, still allowing it to effectively strike targets without engaging them in melee. Like the shortsword, it also deals 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage on a hit.

In addition to its actions, the Goblin has a useful bonus action called Nimble Escape. This ability allows the Goblin to take the Disengage or Hide action, which is particularly advantageous for evading stronger opponents or launching ambushes from the shadows. Overall, the Goblin is a nimble and tactically clever creature that excels at hit-and-run tactics and stealth, making it a valuable asset for any low-level encounter.

The Goblin is a small humanoid creature, known for its cunning nature and agility. Typically found in groups, Goblins are low in strength, but they excel in dexterity, making them agile opponents in combat. With an Armor Class of 15 due to their leather armor and shield, they possess decent defenses for their size. Their low hit points of 12 mean that they can be quickly taken down if caught by surprise. As a Challenge Rating of 1/4 indicates, they are generally not a major threat individually but can become dangerous when working in concert with other Goblins. Their notable special ability, "Gang Up," allows them to coordinate attacks effectively, leveraging their numbers for increased damage against a target.

The Goblin has the following ability scores: Strength -1 (very bad), Dexterity +4 (very good), Constitution +0 (average), Intelligence +0 (average), Wisdom -1 (very bad), and Charisma -1 (very bad). Their high Dexterity makes them exceptionally proficient in Stealth, providing a Stealth score of 14 (good), while their Perception is a modest 9 (average). Goblins can see in the dark up to 60 feet thanks to their darkvision, allowing them to navigate effectively in low-light conditions. They can communicate in Common and Goblin languages.

In terms of actions, the Goblin can attack with a scimitar or a shortbow. Their melee attack with a scimitar has a +4 to hit and deals 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage. Similarly, their shortbow attack also has a +4 to hit, with a range of 80 feet for normal and 320 feet for disadvantage. It inflicts 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage on a successful hit. 

The Goblin's special ability, “Gang Up,” allows them to move stealthily towards a visible target, initiating a coordinated attack. This ability can be used once per day and enables all friendly Goblins within 30 feet to react and join in the assault, moving half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If the initiating Goblin is within 5 feet of the target, the target must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw; failure results in 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage, while success halves the damage. Each additional Goblin joining the attack increases the damage by 1 for weapons thrown from various angles, though these Goblins cannot use this ability again until they complete a short or long rest.

As a bonus action, the Goblin can take "Nimble Escape," allowing it to use either the Disengage or Hide action to enhance its mobility in combat, enabling Goblins to avoid retaliation effectively.

Overall, the Goblin might seem weak when on its own, but in a group, its speed, stealth, and ability to work together make it a more formidable foe than one might expect.</detail>
