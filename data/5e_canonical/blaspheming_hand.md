<summary>The Blaspheming Hand is a Large fiend that embodies lawful evil, serving as a unique adversary in combat scenarios. With a reasonable Armor Class of 14, a substantial pool of 68 hit points, and a Challenge Rating of 3, it poses a moderate threat to adventurers. Notable for its flight ability and a variety of powerful actions, the Blaspheming Hand can control the battlefield through grappling and magical effects. However, it has weaknesses against magic weapons and can be overwhelmed if isolated from its allies, as its special ability Steadfast relies on having them nearby. The combination of damage immunities, resistances, and skill set makes it a formidable foe, best approached with strategic teamwork and spellcasting.</summary>

<detail>

The Blaspheming Hand has the following attributes: Strength of 18 (+4), Dexterity of 10 (+0), Constitution of 17 (+3), Intelligence of 6 (-2), Wisdom of 12 (+1), and Charisma of 12 (+1). Its Strength score is exceptional, making physical attacks particularly potent, while its Dexterity is average, indicating a lack of finesse in dodging. The Constitution is good, providing decent durability. Intelligence is very bad, indicating that the creature has poor cognitive abilities, and Wisdom and Charisma are average, suggesting moderate perception and social influence.

In terms of special abilities, the Blaspheming Hand has Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it particularly resilient against spellcasters. The Steadfast ability ensures that the creature cannot be charmed or frightened as long as at least one ally is within 30 feet, encouraging players to focus on removing its allies from the battlefield.

For its actions, the Blaspheming Hand can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make one Claw attack while also using its Evil Fingers ability. The Claw attack has a +6 to hit and deals 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage, and it can grapple a Medium or smaller target, restraining them and reducing its speed to zero while grappling. The escape DC is 14, meaning targets will need to succeed on a Strength check to break free.

The Evil Fingers ability allows the Blaspheming Hand to gesture at a creature within 60 feet, resulting in one of four effects, each with a DC of 14 for specific saving throws. The Beckoning Finger forces the target to attempt a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 30 feet closer to the hand. If they are pulled within 5 feet, the hand can make a Claw attack as a bonus action. The Punishing Finger inflicts 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed Charisma save and marks the target for punishment; every time the punished target attacks the hand or its rider until the start of the hand's next turn, they take an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage. The Repelling Finger pushes the target up to 10 feet away on a failed Strength save, dealing 11 (2d10) force damage and knocking them prone. Finally, the Unravelling Finger requires a Wisdom save, and if the target fails, they receive a magical mark. When the hand deals damage to a marked creature, it regains hit points equal to half of the damage dealt, with the mark persisting until it is dismissed or replaced.

Overall, the Blaspheming Hand serves as a complex enemy that rewards tactical thinking and cooperation among player characters, making it a memorable opponent in a campaign setting.</detail>
