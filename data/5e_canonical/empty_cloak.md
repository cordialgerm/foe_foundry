<CreatureType/>Construct</CreatureType>

<summary>The Empty Cloak is a Medium Construct with a neutral alignment, serving as an interesting encounter for adventurers, particularly due to its unique mechanics and behavior in combat. With an Armor Class of 13, it can withstand moderate damage, and it boasts a total of 45 hit points, which is a respectable figure for its Challenge Rating of 1/2, making it a suitable foe for lower-level parties. The creature has exceptional Strength at 18 (+4), allowing it to deal significant damage with melee attacks, while its Dexterity of 14 (+2) also grants it good agility in combat scenarios. However, its Charisma at 1 (-5) reflects a complete lack of social skills, making it ineffective in any interactions that rely on Charisma. The Empty Cloak is particularly vulnerable to fire damage and has several immunities including poison and psychic damage, making it a resilient opponent in varied combat situations.</summary>

The Empty Cloak possesses several notable abilities that enhance its effectiveness in battle. Its "Construct Nature" means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to remain functional in adverse conditions. With "Diligent Sentinel," it enjoys advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, enabling it to be very aware of its surroundings. The "Shadow Construction" ability allows it to burst into pieces upon receiving a critical hit, effectively negating that damage, which gives it a unique resilience in combat.

In terms of actions, the Empty Cloak can perform three main attacks. The "Razor Cloak" is a melee weapon attack that allows it to hit with a +6 bonus, dealing 8 slashing damage on a successful strike. The "Shadow Slam" functions similarly, also utilizing a +6 attack bonus, but deals less damage at 6 bludgeoning damage. Finally, the "Shadow Snare" enables it to grapple a creature within its range, also utilizing the +4 attack bonus and restraining the target with shadowy tendrils. This ability allows for tactical control in combat, forcing opponents into a disadvantageous position while they attempt to escape with a Strength check.

Additionally, the Empty Cloak can use a bonus action for "Protective Embrace." This ability allows the creature to briefly wrap around an ally within its space, reducing the damage that ally takes from an attack by half, while the cloak sustains the other half of the damage. This feature not only enhances its defensive capabilities but also showcases its ability to aid allies in battle.

Through its unique attributes and abilities, the Empty Cloak serves as both an offensive and defensive presence on the battlefield, capable of grappling foes, reducing damage to allies, and repositioning through its shadowy nature. However, it remains vulnerable to fire damage and requires strategic consideration from both players and the Dungeon Master when featuring this intriguing construct in a campaign.
