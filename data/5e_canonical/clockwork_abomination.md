<summary>The Clockwork Abomination is a formidable Large Construct characterized by its Lawful Evil alignment. As a challenging enemy with a Challenge Rating of 5, it presents a significant threat in combat due to its high offensive capabilities and resilience against various damage types. This creature has a robust Armor Class of 16 and can absorb a substantial amount of damage with 76 hit points.

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Clockwork Abomination has a Strength score of 21 (+5), which results in a very good modifier for melee attacks. Its Dexterity score is 12 (+1), yielding an average effectiveness in dodging but still providing some measure of agility through skills like Stealth. With a Constitution of 18 (+4), it can withstand a lot of damage, categorizing it as very good in terms of durability. The Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are around average, indicating that it is not especially insightful or charming but has sufficient perception to notice threats.

The Clockwork Abomination notably possesses several special abilities. Its Construct Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to operate indefinitely. When destroyed, its Explosive Infernal Power Source causes a dangerous 10-foot radius explosion, requiring nearby creatures to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take significant fire damage, creating additional hazards on the battlefield. The Immutable Form ability protects it from any forms of transformation, while Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against magical effects, making it harder to debilitate through spells. Finally, its Unstoppable ability allows it to traverse difficult terrain without movement penalties, ensuring it can engage targets readily.

In actions, the Clockwork Abomination is capable of performing a Multiattack, where it can execute both a Bite and a Slam. The Bite attack offers a +8 to hit with a range of 10 feet, dealing 14 piercing damage and an additional 7 fire damage on a successful hit, which embodies its explosive nature. The Slam attack also sports a +8 to hit but has a reach of 15 feet; it deals 12 bludgeoning damage upon a successful hit. Additionally, its Fire Breath ability, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, unleashes a formidable cone of flame dealing 21 fire damage if enemies fail a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, allowing it to affect multiple foes in close quarters. This combination of potent melee capabilities and area control makes the Clockwork Abomination a dangerous adversary in any encounter.</detail>
