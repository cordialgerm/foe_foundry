<summary>The Balbazu is a tiny fiend characterized by its chaotic evil alignment, making it a dangerous opponent in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons 5e. With a challenge rating of 2 and a total of 36 hit points, the Balbazu can be a surprising menace despite its small size. Its unique capabilities, including aquatic invisibility and a blood-draining ability, grant it both stealth and the potential to heal itself. However, the creature is physically weak, with a strength score of only 3, leading to very bad effectiveness in physical confrontations. While it withstands damage effectively due to resistances and immunities, it remains vulnerable to mental attacks, given its low intelligence and charisma scores. This combination of traits makes the Balbazu a strategic creature that thrives in environments where it can exploit its abilities while avoiding direct combat.</summary>

<detail>

The Balbazu's attributes are defined as follows: 
- Strength: 3, with a modifier of -4, making physical actions very bad.
- Dexterity: 16, with a modifier of +3, providing good agility for dodging and maneuvering.
- Constitution: 13, with a modifier of +1, leading to average resilience.
- Intelligence: 5, with a modifier of -3, marking it as very bad at mental tasks.
- Wisdom: 11, with a modifier of +0, rendering it average in perception and insight.
- Charisma: 7, with a modifier of -2, signifying very bad effectiveness in social interactions.

The Balbazu has proficiency in perception, granting it a skill value of +0. It benefits from damage immunities to poison and resistances to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. It is immune to being poisoned and has darkvision that allows it to see up to 60 feet in darkness. The creature understands the Abyssal language but lacks the ability to speak.

Special abilities assigned to the Balbazu include:

- Aquatic Invisibility allows it to become invisible while fully immersed in water, making it a formidable foe in aquatic settings.
- Blood Reservoir enables the Balbazu to store blood it has drained, increasing its reservoir with an amount equal to the hit points drained from a creature it harms.
- Demon Food permits a demon within close proximity to use a bonus action to draw from the Blood Reservoir, regaining hit points equal to the amount consumed, which enhances its utility among other demons.
- Magic Resistance is a powerful trait, providing the Balbazu with advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, greatly enhancing its survivability against spellcasting opponents.

In combat, the Balbazu's primary attack is its Bite, a melee weapon attack that has a +5 to hit and reaches 5 feet to target one creature. This attack deals 10 piercing damage (2d6 + 3) and enables it to attach itself to the target. While attached, the Balbazu does not perform further attacks but inflicts blood loss, draining 10 hit points (2d6 + 3) at the start of each of its turns. The initial attack, and any subsequent blood loss, is stealthy unless the target succeeds on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. If successful, the target becomes aware of the Balbazu's presence, and it can detach itself with a movement cost of 5 feet. Other aware creatures may use their action to detach the Balbazu, showcasing the necessity of awareness and strategy in mitigating its blood-draining abilities.</detail>
