<detail>

The Galidroo has an Armor Class of 17, which is good for a creature of its size, providing decent protection against attacks. It has a total of 172 hit points derived from rolling fifteen twelve-sided dice and adding seventy-five, making it capable of sustaining considerable damage during a confrontation. The creature can burrow at a speed of 20 feet and walk at a speed of 40 feet, showcasing its mobility. Its attributes are robust, with a Strength score of 22 (exceptional), Dexterity of 13 (average), Constitution of 20 (very good), Intelligence of 11 (average), Wisdom of 18 (very good), and Charisma of 14 (good). The Galidroo has saving throw bonuses of +9 for Constitution and +8 for Wisdom, which are strong defenses against various effects. Notably, it has proficiency in the Perception skill with a +8 bonus, allowing it to notice hidden or stealthy creatures easily. 

The Galidroo has damage immunities to psychic damage, making it resistant against mental attacks. It also has resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources, enhancing its durability in combat. Additionally, it is immune to exhaustion and has darkvision up to 90 feet, along with a passive Perception of 18. The creature communicates using Deep Speech and can use telepathy within a range of 60 feet, facilitating interaction with other entities, especially in discussions or negotiations.

One of the Galidroo's significant abilities is the Aura of Lassitude, which affects any creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot radius. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become lethargic, limiting their combat options significantly by making their speed halved, preventing reactions, and constraining them to one attack and either an action or bonus action on their turn. This effect can severely impact the flow of combat, as creatures become less responsive and weaker in their attacks. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this effect for the next 24 hours, providing a potential counter-strategy for players.

Additionally, the Galidroo possesses Selective Precognition, allowing it to innately cast the spells divination and legend lore once per day each without needing material components, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability. This ability grants the creature significant insight into past, present, and future events, enhancing its tactical options during encounters, though it cannot gain insights about itself.

Having two heads grants the Galidroo an advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, making it exceptionally proficient at spotting threats, and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious, making it resilient to various debilitating effects.

In combat, the Galidroo can execute a Multiattack, which allows it to make four attacks — two bites and two claw strikes, providing high damage potential. Each Bite attack has a +10 to hit, a reach of 10 feet, and deals an average of 17 piercing damage. Each Claw attack also has a +10 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and inflicts an average of 13 slashing damage. Alternatively, it can replace its claw attacks with a single Tail attack, which also carries a +10 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, and inflicts an average of 16 bludgeoning damage. This tail attack can grapple creatures that are Large or smaller, restraining them until the grapple ends.

The Galidroo has a powerful special action called Prophetic Screech, which can be used once it recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability releases a burst of psychic power in a 60-foot cone, forcing affected creatures to make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 35 psychic damage and is incapacitated for one minute due to overwhelming visions. Successful saves reduce the damage by half and prevent incapacity, but affected creatures can attempt to break free from incapacitation at the end of their turns, creating intense dynamics in combat.

In summary, the Galidroo presents a multi-faceted threat with its robust physical capabilities, psychic defenses, and powerful debilitating effects, making encounters with it both challenging and strategic.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Aura of Lassitude:** A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the galidroo must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or feel lethargic until the start of its next turn. While lethargic, a creature can’t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make more than one melee or ranged attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the galidroo’s Aura of Lassitude for the next 24 hours.
- **Selective Precognition:** The galidroo can see into the past, present, and future simultaneously. It can innately cast divination and legend lore once per day each, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom. The galidroo can’t use these spells to gain information about itself or its personal future or past.
- **Two-Headed:** The galidroo has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The galidroo makes four attacks: two with its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 17) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the galidroo doesn’t have another creature grappled. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the galidroo can’t use its tail on another target.
- **Prophetic Screech (Recharge 5-6):** The galidroo unleashes a burst of prophetic power in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) psychic damage and is incapacitated for 1 minute as its mind is bombarded with visions of its past and future. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t incapacitated. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
