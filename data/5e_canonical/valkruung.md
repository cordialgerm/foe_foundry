<MonsterName/>Valkruung</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Valkruung is a tiny monstrosity characterized by its chaotic neutral alignment, making it unpredictable and whimsical in nature. With an armor class of 13 and 22 hit points, it presents a modest challenge in combat, rated at a challenge level of 1/2, which makes it suitable for lower-level encounters. The creature is adept at evasion and manipulation, reflected in its high Dexterity score of 16, which grants it a good modifier of +3 for agility-related tasks. However, its other attributes, particularly its Strength of 8 (-1) and Intelligence of 5 (-3), show significant weaknesses, hindering its physical prowess and cognitive capabilities. Notably, the Valkruung's prehensile tendrils allow it to interact with its environment uniquely, making it versatile despite its weaknesses. </summary>

<detail>

The Valkruung's statistics are as follows: 
- Strength is 8, indicating a very bad modifier, leading to difficulties in physical confrontations.
- Dexterity is 16, giving it a good modifier of +3, enhancing its agility and ability to avoid attacks.
- Constitution is 14, resulting in a good modifier of +2, providing a reasonable level of endurance.
- Intelligence is 5, yielding a very bad modifier of -3, limiting its intellectual capabilities and skill checks related to mental tasks.
- Wisdom is 12, granting an average modifier of +1, allowing it some minor situational awareness.
- Charisma is 9, resulting in a bad modifier of -1, which impacts its ability to influence others or negotiate.

The Valkruung possesses two key special abilities—Prehensile Tendrils and Disarming Tendrils. Prehensile Tendrils consist of ten flexible tendrils that enable the creature to grasp tiny items within its reach, providing it with advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and allowing it to disarm opponents through the Disarming Tendrils reaction. This reaction forces an attacker targeting the Valkruung with a melee weapon attack to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, their weapon is knocked away into an unoccupied space. However, this ability is limited against heavy or two-handed weapon users.

In terms of offensive capability, the Valkruung can use its Claws action. This melee weapon attack has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet, and deals an average of 6 slashing damage (1d6 + 3). Additionally, if the attack is successful, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for up to one minute. This poison effect inflicts an itchy rash, forcing the target to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the start of their turn; on a failure, they must spend their action scratching the rash, thus incapacitating them temporarily until they can shake off the effect.

Overall, the Valkruung is a quirky adversary that utilizes its unique anatomy and abilities to enhance its combat strategy, trading raw power for cunning and skillful manipulation.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Prehensile Tendrils:** The valkruung has 10 shiny blue-gray tendrils that constantly grab at things in the environment. Each tendril can pick up or hold a Tiny object, such as a coin or piece of jewelry, that isn’t being worn or carried. If it uses all 10 of its tendrils, the valkruung can carry a single Small object, such as a backpack. The valkruung can use its tendrils to interact with objects, but it can’t use them to wield a weapon. It has advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks when using its tendrils and can use its tendrils to disarm opponents (see the Disarming Tendrils reaction).

### Actions

- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target suffers an itchy rash, and, at the start of each of its turns, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving or spend its action furiously scratching the rash. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

- **Disarming Tendrils:** When a creature the valkruung can see targets it with a melee weapon attack, the attacker must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or its weapon is knocked out of its grasp into a random unoccupied space within 5 feet of the attacker. The valkruung can’t use this reaction against attackers wielding a heavy or two-handed weapon.
