<summary>The Fey Revenant is a formidable creature that embodies both the cunning and danger of the fey realm, classified as large and lawful evil. With 161 hit points and an exceptional armor class of 19 due to its natural armor, it proves to be a tough opponent in combat. It possesses high dexterity and constitution scores, making it good at dodging attacks and resilient to damage. However, it is vulnerable to sunlight, suffering disadvantage on attacks and perception checks while exposed. The Fey Revenant excels in stealth and has several powerful abilities, including magical resistance, making it challenging to overcome with spells. This monster's unique mobility through shadows and its ability to cause damage through touch make it a versatile threat.</summary>

<detail>

The Fey Revenant’s attributes include a strength score of 14 (+2, which is average), dexterity of 18 (+4, which is very good), constitution of 18 (+4, also very good), intelligence of 10 (+0, average), wisdom of 14 (+2, average), and charisma of 14 (+2, average). Its saving throw for dexterity is +7, providing a good chance to succeed against effects that rely on this attribute. Notably, it has skills in perception (+5) and stealth (+7), showcasing its expertise in avoiding detection and noticing hidden dangers. It is immune to poison damage and is resistant to bludgeoning and piercing damage, making it resilient against many attacks while also being immune to the poisoned condition. The Fey Revenant can sense creatures from up to 120 feet in darkness thanks to its darkvision, and its passive perception score is 15.

One of its special abilities, Magic Resistance, grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, enhancing its durability in magical confrontations. Shadow Sight allows it to see through magical darkness without any limitation. The Shadow Traveler ability, usable four times a day, enables it to teleport from shadows or darkness to a location within 30 feet, creating a tendril of inky smoke as it moves. Its Spider Climb ability allows it to traverse difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without any checks. However, the Fey Revenant suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, which significantly hampers its attack effectiveness in bright light. The Thorn Body ability causes any creature that touches the Fey Revenant or attacks it with a melee weapon within 5 feet to take 4 piercing damage, deterring close combat interactions.

For actions, the Fey Revenant can perform a Multiattack, making three attacks either with its shortsword or longbow, or using its Queen's Grasp in place of one of those attacks. With its Shortsword attack, it has a +7 to hit and inflicts 7 piercing damage plus an additional 3 poison damage on a successful hit. Its Longbow attack also has a +7 to hit and can deal 8 piercing damage along with 3 poison damage at a range of 120 feet. The Queen's Grasp, a ranged attack with a reach of 30 feet, restrains its target in icy wisps of shadow, causing the restrained creature to take 7 cold damage at the start of its turns. To escape, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check. The icy shadow can be destroyed, offering another strategic element in combat where players may target it to free their ally.</detail>
