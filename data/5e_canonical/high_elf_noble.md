<MonsterName/>High Elf Noble</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Humanoid</CreatureType>

<summary>The High Elf Noble is a Medium humanoid creature, embodying elegance and charisma typical of high elf lineage. This character plays the role of a social manipulator and a skilled combatant, leveraging their high charisma and proficiency in deception, persuasion, and intimidation to exert influence in social encounters. With a modest challenge rating of 1/4, they are more suited for outsmarting opponents than direct confrontation, marking them as average in terms of hit points and armor class. The character's notable abilities in social interactions make them invaluable in diplomatic settings, but their weaknesses lie in their low physical strength and constitution, which limits their resilience in direct combat scenarios.</summary>

<detail>

The High Elf Noble has the following attributes:
- Strength: 10 (+0), which is average, indicating no particular physical prowess.
- Dexterity: 12 (+1), considered average, providing a slight benefit in agility.
- Constitution: 10 (+0), average, offering no bonus to stamina.
- Intelligence: 10 (+0), average, reflecting no exceptional mental acuity.
- Wisdom: 12 (+1), average, slightly enhancing their perceptiveness.
- Charisma: 14 (+2), which is good, making them adept at social maneuvers.

In terms of skills, the High Elf Noble excels in deception (+4), intimidation (+4), performance (+4), and persuasion (+4), showcasing their exceptional ability to manipulate and impress others. They possess average insight (+3) and below-average history (+2) proficiency, indicating a focus on immediate social interactions rather than extensive academic knowledge. Their passive perception of 11 suggests that they are aware of their surroundings but not exceptionally so. The noble can communicate in any two languages of their choice.

For actions, the High Elf Noble can attack with a rapier, which has a melee weapon attack bonus of +3 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. If they hit, they deal 5 piercing damage (1d8 + 1). This attack represents their capability in melee combat, although their other abilities describe a stronger focus on magic and social prowess.

The noble also has access to the cantrip "Ray of Frost," which requires verbal and somatic components to cast. This ranged spell attack has a +4 bonus to hit and a range of 60 feet, allowing them to target a creature effectively. On a successful hit, it deals 4 cold damage (1d8), and importantly, it reduces the target's speed by 10 feet until the start of the noble's next turn. This can create strategic advantages in combat by limiting opponents' mobility.

Finally, the High Elf Noble has the reaction ability "Parry." This ability allows them to add 2 to their AC against one melee attack that would hit them, provided they can see the attacker and are wielding a melee weapon. It offers them a modest defensive option during combat, enhancing their survivability in specific situations.</detail>
