<MonsterName/>Ratatosk Warlord</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Celestial</CreatureType>

<summary>The Ratatosk Warlord is a small celestial creature defined by its chaotic neutral alignment. Known for its cunning tactics on the battlefield, this creature blends speed and agility with a unique ability to command its kin. With an Armor Class of 16 and a decent pool of 77 hit points, it can withstand moderate assaults while delivering significant damage through both physical and psychic attacks. Its attributes reveal a high Dexterity of 18, granting it an exceptional modifier of +4, which enhances its agility and finesse in combat. However, its Strength is quite low at 7, resulting in a very bad modifier of -2, making it less effective in measures that rely on raw physical power. The Ratatosk Warlord serves as a formidable opponent often ambushing and outmaneuvering enemies, yet it relies on its swift strategy rather than brute strength.</summary>

<detail>

The Ratatosk Warlord possesses saving throw bonuses: +7 for Dexterity, indicating a very good ability to dodge attacks, and +5 for Wisdom, representing a good capacity for resisting mental effects. Its skills include Acrobatics at +7, also very good, which allows for impressive agility feats and evasive maneuvers, and Intimidation at +4, signifying a good presence in social interactions that may cause fear or awe. The creature has damage resistances to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical sources, allowing it to withstand conventional weaponry. It possesses darkvision with a range of 60 feet, enabling it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it communicates in Celestial and Common, as well as with telepathy up to 100 feet.

The special abilities of the Ratatosk Warlord enhance its tactical advantage in battle. With "I'm Bigger That's Why," it can use a bonus action to command another ratatosk within 30 feet to perform a melee attack, allowing for additional strikes in combat, stressing its role as a leader. "Warlord Skitter," another ability, lets the warlord take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on every turn, giving it unparalleled mobility on the battlefield that can be used to reposition effectively or escape from danger.

In combat scenarios, the Ratatosk Warlord can perform a "Multiattack," executing one strike with its gore attack and one with its Ratatosk shortspear during a turn. The Ratatosk Shortspear attack requires a +7 to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, or a ranged option of 20/60 feet, inflicting 11 piercing damage on a successful hit due to rolling 2d6 and adding the +4 modifier. The Gore attack also requires a +7 to hit with a reach of 5 feet and causes 6 piercing damage, plus an additional 14 psychic damage from rolling 4d6, making it a potent attack particularly effective against mental defenses. Finally, its ability "Chatter of War" can be a game-changer in battles; it requires creatures within 30 feet that can hear it to pass a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls until the start of the warlord's next turn, disrupting enemy effectiveness during crucial moments. This combination of mobility, command, and psychological tactics makes the Ratatosk Warlord a dynamic and dangerous opponent on the battlefield.</detail>
