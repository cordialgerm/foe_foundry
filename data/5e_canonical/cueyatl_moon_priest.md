The Cueyatl Moon Priest has an Armor Class of 13, which is considered average for a creature of its Challenge Rating. It has 81 hit points, resulting from rolling 18d6 with an additional bonus of 18, enabling it to withstand considerable damage during encounters.

It has a +4 modifier on Constitution saving throws, allowing it to be moderately resilient against effects that might reduce its hit points. The creature is skilled in medicine (+6), perception (+6), and religion (+3), indicating proficiency in healing and understanding spiritual matters, while possessing darkvision up to 60 feet and a passive perception score of 16, which is quite good, allowing it to notice hidden creatures and traps more easily. The languages it speaks are Common and Cueyatl.

The Cueyatl Moon Priest has several special abilities. The Amphibious ability allows it to breathe both air and water, facilitating its movements in diverse environments. Jungle Camouflage gives it advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made within jungle terrain, enhancing its capacity to avoid detection. The Slippery ability provides the priest with advantage on saving throws and ability checks to escape grapples, making it difficult to restrain. Standing Leap allows the creature to make impressive long and high jumps, reaching up to 20 feet horizontally and 10 feet vertically, regardless of a running start.

As a 5th-level spellcaster, the Cueyatl Moon Priest utilizes Wisdom as its spellcasting ability, resulting in a spell save DC of 14 and a +6 modifier on spell attack rolls. It has several spells prepared, including cantrips such as guidance, resistance, sacred flame, and spare the dying, which can assist in various situations for healing and protection. At 1st level, it can cast bane, cure wounds, and protection from evil and good; at 2nd level, it has hold person, silence, and spiritual weapon; and at 3rd level, it can cast bestow curse and spirit guardians. Each of these spells can significantly impact encounters by debuffing enemies, healing allies, or summoning protective spirits.

In combat, the Cueyatl Moon Priest wields a morningstar, making melee weapon attacks with a +3 modifier (deemed average). This weapon deals 4 piercing damage alongside an additional 7 poison damage on a hit. The special feature Night's Chill, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6, allows the priest to harness the powers of moonlight, extinguishing magical light within a 30-foot radius. All hostile creatures within this area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 16 cold damage (or half on a successful save), which can substantially alter the dynamics of battle due to its area effect and potential to debilitate foes. However, it does not affect creatures with total cover from the moon priest, thereby requiring strategic positioning to maximize its effectiveness.</detail>
