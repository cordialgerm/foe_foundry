<summary>The Chernomoi is a tiny fey creature that embodies a versatile combination of cunning and magical abilities. With a neutral alignment, it plays a role that can be both mischievous and helpful, depending on the situation. The creature possesses a relatively high Armor Class of 14, bolstered by its substantial Hit Points of 32, which allows it to endure in combat. Its main strengths lie in agility and magical prowess, with an exceptional Dexterity score of 18, granting it a very good modifier of +4 for actions reliant on finesse and evasion. However, its Strength is notably low at 9, resulting in a very bad modifier of -1, meaning it struggles in physical confrontations where brute force is needed. The Chernomoi's challenge rating of 1 indicates that it poses a moderate threat to adventurers at its level, earning it 200 experience points when defeated.</summary>

<detail>

The Chernomoi possesses the following ability scores: Strength 9 (-1), Dexterity 18 (+4), Constitution 18 (+4), Intelligence 12 (+1), Wisdom 11 (+0), and Charisma 16 (+3). The Dexterity and Constitution scores allow it to excel in dodging attacks and maintaining resilience, while its Charisma enhances its spellcasting capabilities and social interactions. The Chernomoi is skilled in Acrobatics with a +6 modifier, making it adept at nimble maneuvers. It also has a good Stealth modifier of +6, allowing it to move unnoticed, and a moderate Perception score of +2, giving it an average ability to notice hidden details.

In terms of damage resistances, the Chernomoi is particularly effective against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that are not made with silvered weapons, making it resilient against common physical threats. It also has darkvision that extends up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in low-light conditions, and it speaks several languages, including Common, Draconic, and Sylvan.

For actions, the Chernomoi can make melee weapon attacks using its Scimitar, which has a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 7 slashing damage on a successful hit. The Chernomoi can also use its Shriek ability, which has a recharge mechanic of 5-6; when activated, it emits a loud sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away. Each creature within 60 feet that hears it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) thunder damage on a failed save or half that amount on a successful one. This ability can be disruptive in combat, affecting multiple foes at once.

Finally, the Chernomoi's spellcasting is another critical aspect of its combat strategy. It can cast spells requiring no material components, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability with a spell save DC of 13. At will, it can cast spells like Detect Magic, Mage Hand, Mending, Message, and Prestidigitation, allowing it to perform various utility tasks and information gathering. Additionally, it can use the spells Detect Poison and Disease and Dimension Door once per day each, providing powerful options for both escape and investigation. These spells contribute to its effectiveness both in and out of combat, making the Chernomoi a well-rounded and intriguing creature for adventurers to encounter.</detail>
