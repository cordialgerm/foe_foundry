<summary>The Arcane Scavenger is a formidable Large Construct that plays the role of a resilient and versatile combatant. With a challenge rating of 9, it is well-suited for encounters with experienced adventurers seeking a significant challenge. This creature boasts a strong armor class of 17 due to its natural armor and a substantial amount of hit points totaling 127, making it difficult to bring down. Its primary strengths lie in its high dexterity and intelligence, providing it with solid defensive capabilities and powerful offensive options. The Arcane Scavenger's notable abilities include resistance to various damage types, immunity to many debilitating conditions, and a unique self-enhancement feature when its health is low. However, as a construct, it lacks the ability to communicate and requires no sustenance, which may limit its role in social interactions. </summary>

<detail>

The Arcane Scavenger has the following attributes: Strength 19 (+4), Dexterity 18 (+4), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 16 (+3), Wisdom 16 (+3), and Charisma 13 (+1). Its modifier values indicate good physical capabilities, particularly in strength and dexterity, which contribute to its effectiveness in battle. The saving throw bonuses are Dexterity +8 and Wisdom +7, allowing it to evade various effects with good effectiveness. Its perception skill grants a +3 modifier, which is considered average for detecting hidden enemies or traps.

This creature has several immunities and resistances, including immunity to force, poison, and psychic damage, along with resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks. It is also immune to conditions like blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned, making it exceptionally hard to incapacitate. It possesses truesight up to 60 feet and has a passive perception of 17, granting it an exceptional ability to see through various illusions and invisibilities.

The Arcane Scavenger features several special abilities. Its Construct Nature means it does not require air, food, drink, or sleep, allowing it to function continuously. The Eldritch Overload ability activates when the scavenger's health drops to half or lower, doubling its speed and granting it an extra action each turn for three rounds. This action can be used to dash, disengage, hide, use an object, or make one attack with either its Grabbing Claws or Excavation Beam. After three rounds, it suffers damage from a fire effect, specifically 10 (3d6) fire damage. The creature also possesses Magic Resistance, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, making it quite difficult to affect with such powers.

When it dies, the Ruinous Detonation ability triggers, causing it to explode and deal 21 (6d6) force damage to all creatures within 30 feet, flinging them up to 40 feet away and knocking them prone. A DC 16 Dexterity saving throw allows targets to take half damage and avoid being flung or knocked prone.

In terms of actions, the Arcane Scavenger can perform a Multiattack, making three attacks with either Grabbing Claws or Excavation Beams. The Grabbing Claw is a melee weapon attack with a +8 bonus to hit, reaching 15 feet and dealing 13 (2d8+4) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 7 (2d6) force damage, while also grappling the target with an escape DC of 16. Conversely, the Excavation Beam is a ranged spell attack with a +7 bonus to hit, effective at 60 feet, dealing 20 (5d6+3) fire damage to a single target.

Additionally, the Arcane Scavenger can cast spells without requiring material components. It has an Intelligence save DC of 15 and can use the following spells at will: Detect Magic and Locate Object. It can also cast Counterspell and Dispel Magic three times a day each, allowing it to negate or remove magical effects in combat effectively.</detail>
