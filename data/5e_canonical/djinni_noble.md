<detail>

The Djinni Noble's attributes are as follows: Strength 18 (+4, good), Dexterity 22 (+6, very good), Constitution 22 (+6, very good), Intelligence 14 (+2, average), Wisdom 16 (+3, good), and Charisma 20 (+5, very good). In terms of saving throws, it excels with Dexterity +10, Intelligence +6, Wisdom +7, and Charisma +9, making it very resilient against various effects. The Djinni is skilled in Acrobatics (+10), Insight (+7), and Perception (+7), allowing it to navigate and react effectively in combat situations. The creature possesses resistance to lightning and thunder damage, making it notably resilient against attacks of those types. With darkvision extending to 120 feet and a passive perception of 17, it remains alert and aware of its surroundings. The Djinni can speak Auran, the language of air elementals.

The Djinni Noble has several potent abilities. Its Innate Spellcasting is based on Charisma with a spell save DC of 17, allowing it to cast spells without needing material components. The Djinni can cast spells at will, including "alter self," which enables it to change its size, "detect magic," for sensing magical auras, and "wind wall," which creates a barrier of wind. It can cast powerful spells three times a day, such as "creation," which allows it to conjure objects, "major image," for creating illusions, "tongues," enabling it to communicate in various languages, and "wind walk," which allows for swift movement through the air. Additionally, it can summon an air elemental with "conjure elemental," control the weather, and produce food and water. It can even plane shift to the Elemental Plane of Air once per day.

In combat, the Djinni can execute a Multiattack, making three scimitar attacks. Each scimitar attack is made with a +10 to hit and can deal 13 slashing damage, alongside an additional 5 lightning damage, making it an effective close-range combatant. The Djinni can also unleash a powerful Lightning Blast as a ranged spell attack with a +9 to hit that inflicts a staggering 35 lightning damage. Once per day, the Djinni can utilize the Scimitar Sweep while in Giant Form, allowing it to attack multiple creatures within its reach simultaneously.

The Djinni Noble can transform into Giant Form once per day, becoming a Huge creature made of swirling clouds. In this form, it receives resistance to nonmagical damage, and its scimitars gain an extended reach of 10 feet, significantly enhancing its combat capabilities. Additionally, it can create a Whirlwind once per day, which acts as a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-tall magical whirlwind. This ability can engulf a creature, requiring a DC 18 Strength check to escape if they fail. The whirlwind can restrain a creature, allowing other characters to assist in freeing them if they come close enough. The Djinni can dismiss the whirlwind or it disappears under certain conditions, such as the Djinni losing sight of it or being incapacitated. This versatility in abilities and actions makes the Djinni Noble a dynamic and formidable foe in any encounter.</detail>

### Bonus Actions

In this form, it gains resistance to nonmagical damage, and its scimitar attacks gain a reach of 10 feet. The effect ends after 1 minute, when the djinni is incapacitated, or if the djinn becomes bloodied.
- **Whirlwind (1/Day):** A magical, 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-tall whirlwind appears in a space the djinni can see within 60 feet. The whirlwind may appear in another creatures space. If the whirlwind appears in another creatures space, or when it enters a creatures space for the first time on a turn, the creature makes a DC 18 Strength check, becoming restrained by the whirlwind on a failure. The whirlwind may restrain one creature at a time. A creature within 5 feet of the whirlwind (including the restrained creature) can use an action to make a DC 18 Strength check, freeing the restrained creature on a success. A freed creature can move to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the whirlwind.
- **As a bonus action:** The whirlwind disappears if the djinni loses sight of it, if the djinni dies or is incapacitated, or if the djinni dismisses it as an action.
