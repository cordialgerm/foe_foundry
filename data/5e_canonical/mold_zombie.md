<summary>The Mold Zombie is a Medium undead creature imbued with chaotic evil intentions. It thrives in grim environments, using its ability to spread disease and necrotic energy to weaken its foes. With a solid armor class of 13 and a moderately high hit point total of 75, it can endure a good amount of damage before being taken down. Its primary strengths lie in its resistant traits, including damage immunities to necrotic and poison damage. However, it has notable weaknesses, such as a very low Dexterity score, making it slow and susceptible to ranged attacks. Its challenge rating of 3 makes it a moderate threat for adventurers, able to deal decent amounts of bludgeoning and necrotic damage, while its unique special abilities allow it to affect the battlefield in significant ways.</summary>

<detail>

The Mold Zombie has a Strength score of 17, granting it a Strength modifier of +3, which is considered good for melee combat. Its Dexterity score of 8 results in a -1 modifier, indicating a very bad agility, which hampers its speed since it can only walk 20 feet per turn. The Constitution score of 16 provides it with a strong Constitution modifier of +3, making it resilient to damage, particularly benefiting its Undead Fortitude ability, which allows it a chance to stay active against lethal damage. Unfortunately, with an Intelligence score of 3 (-4 modifier), Wisdom of 6 (-2 modifier), and Charisma of 5 (-3 modifier), the Mold Zombie is very bad in terms of mental stats and lacks social interaction capabilities.

The Mold Zombie's saving throws include a +5 to Strength saving throws and a +0 to Wisdom saving throws, giving it a good chance to resist physical threats but a poor chance against mental or magical effects. The creature has both damage immunities to necrotic and poison damage and condition immunities to exhaustion and poisoned effects. It has darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, but its passive Perception score is quite low at 8.

The Mold Zombie possesses several special abilities that further enhance its threat level. The first is Spore Death, which triggers when it is reduced to 0 hit points, generating an explosion of spores that affect nearby creatures. Those within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and contract the iumenta pox disease. The second ability, Undead Fortitude, enables it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken) when reduced to 0 hit points, granting it a chance to remain standing with 1 hit point unless the damage was radiant or a critical hit.

In combat, the Mold Zombie can utilize its Multiattack feature, allowing it to make two slam attacks, which have a +5 to hit and can reach targets 5 feet away. Each slam attack deals 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage along with an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, merging physical and magical assaults. Lastly, the zombie can unleash its Plague Breath, which is a powerful attack that can be used again after a short recharge period. This ability sprays a 15-foot cone of spores that forces creatures in the area to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage upon failure, and potentially leading them to contract the iumenta pox, further spreading the threat of the Mold Zombie through its debilitating effects.</detail>
