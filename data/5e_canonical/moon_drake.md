<summary>The Moon Drake is a medium-sized dragon with neutral alignment, well-known for its dynamic abilities that correlate with the lunar phases. With an Armor Class of 15 and a robust 76 hit points, the Moon Drake proves to be a formidable foe in combat. Its impressive speed allows it to fly at 100 feet per turn while still being able to walk 25 feet. The Moon Drake is categorized with a Challenge Rating of 5, which denotes an experience worth 1,800 for its defeat. This creature has a strong Dexterity score of 20, providing a good modifier of +5, and a high Constitution of 19 gives it a good +4 modifier. The Moon Drake has a versatile presence in battle thanks to its special abilities and unique actions, but its powers are subject to the phases of the moon, making it both a powerful ally and a strategic challenge for adversaries.</summary>

<detail>

The Moon Drake's attributes are as follows: 
- Strength: 10 (modifier +0 – average)
- Dexterity: 20 (modifier +5 – good)
- Constitution: 19 (modifier +4 – good)
- Intelligence: 13 (modifier +1 – average)
- Wisdom: 18 (modifier +4 – good)
- Charisma: 14 (modifier +2 – average)

In terms of skills, the Moon Drake has proficiency in Arcana with a +4 modifier and Insight with a +7 modifier, both considered good. It possesses varying damage vulnerabilities and resistances depending on lunar conditions, while being immune to paralysis and unconsciousness. Its sensory abilities include darkvision with a reach of 120 feet and a passive perception of 14, allowing it to see in darkness and perceive hidden creatures well. The drake is capable of communicating in Celestial, Common, and Draconic.

The Moon Drake’s special abilities offer both therapeutic and combat functions. Its Curative Saliva can cure afflicted lycanthropes who consume it, requiring no saving throw, but it cannot remedy natural-born lycanthropes. The Moonbound ability determines the drake's resilience and damage output based on the moon's phase: during a full moon, it enjoys resistance to nonmagical damage and adds an additional 3 radiant damage to its attacks, while under a new moon, it faces vulnerability to such damage.

In combat, the Moon Drake can launch a Multiattack, making three separate attacks that consist of one bite and two claw strikes. Its Bite attack has a +8 to hit and can deal 12 piercing damage along with an additional 5 radiant damage. If the target is a shapechanger, they must revert to their true form and cannot change shapes again for 1d4 rounds if they take radiant damage from this attack. The Claw attack also has +8 to hit and results in 8 slashing damage upon a successful hit. The Moonlight Nip attack specifically targets creatures afflicted by lycanthropy, requiring a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to avoid being cured of their affliction (though natural-born lycanthropes are not affected).

Additionally, the drake can unleash a powerful attack called Lunarbeam, which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. This ability allows the drake to exhale radiant damage in a 60-foot line, requiring affected creatures to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, inflicting 33 radiant damage on a failed save, or half damage if they succeed. Shapechangers face disadvantage on this saving throw and also revert to their true forms if they fail.

For its defensive maneuver, the Moon Drake can employ the Form of Moonlight reaction when it suffers damage or is restrained. This ability allows it to become incorporeal and resist cold, fire, and lightning damage while becoming immune to nonmagical physical attacks. In this form, it can pass through narrow openings and transparent objects but will take force damage if it ends its turn within another object. This blend of offensive power and versatile defenses makes the Moon Drake a unique encounter for any adventuring party.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Curative Saliva:** The moon drake's saliva can be bottled, distilled, and used in 1-ounce doses. An afflicted lycanthrope that drinks this concoction is instantly cured of lycanthropy, requiring no saving throw. This draught can't cure a natural-born lycanthrope of the curse of lycanthropy.
- **Moonbound:** A moon drake's power waxes and wanes with the moon. Under a full moon, it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks and its weapon attacks deal an additional 3 (1d6) radiant damage. Under a new moon, it has vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Under any other moon, it gains no extra traits.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The moon drake makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) radiant damage. A shapechanger that takes radiant damage from this attack instantly reverts to its true form and can't assume a different form for 1d4 rounds.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Moonlight Nip:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature afflicted with lycanthropy. Hit: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be cured of lycanthropy (it can willingly fail this save). This attack can't cure a natural born lycanthrope of the curse of lycanthropy.
- **Lunarbeam (Recharge 5-6):** The drake exhales searing moonlight in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its true form and can't assume a different form for 1d4 rounds.

### Reactions

- **Form of Moonlight:** When the moon drake takes damage or is restrained, it can transmute its physical form into an incorporeal form of pure moonlight until the end of its next turn. While in this form, it has resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. While in this form, the drake can pass through openings at least 1 inch wide and through transparent objects. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
