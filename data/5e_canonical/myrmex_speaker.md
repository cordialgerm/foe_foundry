<summary>The Myrmex Speaker is a powerful elemental creature that plays a supportive and strategic role on the battlefield. It is neutral good in alignment, showcasing its nature-oriented demeanor and connection to earth and stone. With an armor class of 16, it has a solid defense due to its natural armor and a substantial pool of hit points totaling 119, making it difficult to take down. Its challenge rating is 9, indicating that it presents a significant challenge for adventurers. The Myrmex Speaker is very mobile, capable of walking, burrowing, and climbing at a speed of 40 feet each, which allows it to maneuver easily through various terrains. Its strengths include high physical attributes in Strength and Constitution, allowing it to deal and withstand damage effectively, while its Dexterity is average, making it less effective at avoiding attacks compared to other behaviors. The creature is uniquely equipped to avoid many common debuffs since it has immunities against exhaustion, paralysis, and more. However, it does not have any particularly high Charisma, which may affect its social interactions.</summary>

<detail>

The Myrmex Speaker has the following primary attributes: a Strength of 18 (+4, which is very good), Dexterity of 13 (+1, average), Constitution of 17 (+3, good), Intelligence of 12 (+1, average), Wisdom of 16 (+3, good), and Charisma of 10 (+0, very bad). Its skill in perception gives it a bonus of +3, which is average for spotting hidden creatures or objects. It has damage resistances against poison and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks, enhancing its resilience. The creature relies on blindsight up to 60 feet, meaning it can sense its environment without the need for sight, giving it an effective passive perception score of 17. It understands multiple languages including Common, Terran, and Undercommon but lacks the ability to speak, relying instead on telepathy to communicate within a range of 120 feet.

The Myrmex Speaker has several notable special abilities. Its Elemental Nature allows it to forego the need for air, food, drink, or sleep, enabling it to operate continuously. The Keen Smell ability grants it advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, which is beneficial for detecting invisible threats. Its Stone Walk trait allows it to traverse difficult earth or stone terrain without speed penalties, making it highly maneuverable in rocky environments.

In combat, the Myrmex Speaker can perform a Multiattack, allowing it to make three Bite attacks in a single action. Each Bite attack is a melee weapon attack that adds +8 to hit and deals 13 piercing damage on a hit, plus an additional 7 poison damage, making the attack quite strong. The Earth Shift ability serves as a ranged spell attack, with a +7 to hit, allowing the Myrmex Speaker to push a target up to 15 feet in a direction of its choice, significantly affecting enemy movement for half their speed until the end of their next turn. 

The Static Barrage is a special ability that can be used after a recharge of a roll of 5 or 6. It blasts all chosen foes within 30 feet, dealing 18 psychic damage with a saving throw against Intelligence (DC 15) for half damage, effective for dealing with multiple opponents at once. Additionally, it can create a Wall of Earth, similar to the wall of stone spell, using a 10 feet by 10 feet panel with an AC of 13 and 15 hit points, allowing the Myrmex Speaker to control the battlefield effectively. 

As a bonus action, the Myrmex Speaker can use Earth Manipulation to shape earth within a 30-foot range, allowing for creative battlefield control. This action can create temporary structures or symbols, manipulate the terrain to create difficult terrain or normalize difficult terrain features if made from earth or stone. The changes made by this ability are permanent, allowing for significant environmental control over time. 

Overall, the Myrmex Speaker is a versatile and strategic elemental that can manipulate the battlefield while dealing consistent damage, making it a valuable ally or formidable foe.</detail>
