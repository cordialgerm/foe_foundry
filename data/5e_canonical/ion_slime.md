<MonsterName/>Ion Slime</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Ooze</CreatureType>

<summary>The Ion Slime is a small oozing creature with unique properties that make it a formidable presence on the battlefield. Unaligned and capable of contorting through tight spaces, the Ion Slime excels in agility and resilience, particularly when exposed to lightning. It possesses a decent armor class of 13 and a substantial pool of health, totaling 112 hit points. In combat, the Ion Slime can deliver a potent mix of bludgeoning and lightning damage, making it a threat to unsuspecting foes. However, its vulnerability to cold damage and a lack of high Intelligence or Charisma scores suggest that it may be outmatched in specific tactical or social situations. </summary>

<detail>

The Ion Slime has the following attributes: Strength 10 (+0, average), Dexterity 17 (+3, good), Constitution 18 (+4, very good), Intelligence 2 (-4, very bad), Wisdom 4 (-3, very bad), and Charisma 1 (-5, very bad). Notably, it has a skill proficiency in perception with a modifier of +3, granted by its decent Dexterity. The creature is vulnerable to cold damage but resistant to thunder damage, showcasing its weaknesses and defenses in battle. It is immune to conditions like blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, and prone, which makes it stable in various combat scenarios. The Ion Slime has blindsight up to 60 feet, allowing it to perceive its environment without relying on sight.

The Ion Slime is equipped with several unique abilities that enhance its combat effectiveness. The "Amorphous" trait allows it to easily move through tight spaces that are at least one foot wide without impediment. The "Ionic Form" ability enables the slime to absorb lightning damage, healing itself for an equal amount and recharging its supercharge ability. However, if it is supercharged and takes cold damage, it risks losing that state based on a die roll. Its "Ooze Nature" trait means it does not require sleep, allowing it to remain active and ready for prolonged encounters. Additionally, it can utilize "Spider Climb" to traverse difficult terrain, including sheer surfaces and ceilings, without the need for ability checks.

In terms of actions, the Ion Slime can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to strike twice with its pseudopod. Each "Pseudopod" attack has a +6 to hit, deals 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage, and inflicts additional lightning damage totaling 9 (2d8). When in a supercharged state, it can use "Discharge" to unleash a powerful lightning effect against a target within 5 feet, dealing 27 (6d8) lightning damage with a DC 15 Constitution saving throw for half damage. Furthermore, the effect can chain to up to three additional targets within 20 feet, allowing for excellent area-of-effect damage potential.

As a bonus action, the Ion Slime can utilize "Charged Motion" while supercharged to either dash or dodge, enhancing its mobility. Finally, the "Supercharge" ability, which recharges on a 5-6, allows the Ion Slime to gather ambient electricity to bolster its defenses for three rounds, increasing its armor class by 2 and granting an extra action each turn. However, if it does not use "Discharge" by the end of that duration, it takes feedback damage of 18 (4d8) force, bringing a risk-reward element to its strategy. 

Overall, the Ion Slime is a dynamic and versatile ooze that can turn the tide of battle with its unique elemental interactions and combat capabilities, alongside some inherent risks that can be tactically managed.</detail>
