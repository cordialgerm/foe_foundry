With a Challenge Rating of 4, it presents a substantial threat to adventurers, leveraging a combination of strong physical attacks and resilience.

Its weaknesses include average Dexterity and Constitution scores, which while decent, do not make it exceptionally agile or hard to kill.

<detail>

In terms of attributes, the Bugbear Champion has the following: Strength 16 (+6, very good), Dexterity 14 (+2, average), Constitution 14 (+2, average), Intelligence 12 (+1, average), Wisdom 12 (+1, average), and Charisma 10 (+0, very bad). Its senses include darkvision up to 60 feet, allowing it to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and it has a Perception score of 11. The creature is stealthy, boasting a Stealth score of 16, which makes it quite capable of ambushing foes. It speaks Common and Goblin.

The Bugbear Champion can perform several special actions in combat. Its "Brutal" ability allows it to deal an extra die of damage with melee weapons, effectively increasing its damage output significantly. During its turn, it can utilize the "Multiattack" feature to deliver multiple strikes, opting for either two Spiked Club attacks and one Shield Smash attack, or three Javelin attacks. The Spiked Club attack has a +6 to hit and reaches a target within 5 feet, dealing an average of 13 piercing damage on a hit. The Shield Smash also has a +6 to hit, dealing 9 bludgeoning damage, with the potential to knock the target prone if it fails a DC 14 Strength saving throw. For ranged options, the Javelin attack also has a +6 to hit, delivering 11 piercing damage in melee or 7 damage at range.

As a reaction, the Bugbear Champion has "Stubborn Attacker," which recharges on a roll of 5 or 6. If it misses an attack, it can convert that miss into a hit, thus increasing its reliability as an attacker and heightening the threat level during encounters. This combination of strong offensive capabilities and tactical reactions makes the Bugbear Champion a dangerous opponent on the battlefield.</detail>
