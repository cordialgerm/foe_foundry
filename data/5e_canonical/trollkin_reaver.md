<detail>

The Trollkin Reaver has an Armor Class of 14, which is considered good for its challenge rating and is bolstered by its thick hide, granting it an additional +1 bonus to AC. With a good Constitution score of 16 (+3), it excels in saving throws against physical effects, receiving a +5 modifier in Constitution saving throws. The creature also possesses average Dexterity at 13 (+1), which allows it some agility in combat, although it is not exceptionally quick. This combination of attributes allows the Trollkin Reaver to maintain a solid position in battle, absorbing damage while dealing it in return.

In terms of actions, the Trollkin Reaver can execute a Multiattack, allowing it to make a combination of one Bite attack and two Claw attacks or three Handaxe attacks in a single turn. The Bite attack uses a +6 to hit modifier, with a potential damage output of 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage. The Claw attack also utilizes the same modifier and deals slashing damage, identical in output to the Bite. The creature can utilize a Battleaxe for a single melee attack, dealing either 8 (1d8 + 4) or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage when wielded with two hands. The Handaxe can be used as either a melee or ranged weapon, with a range of 20/60 feet, and similarly hits for 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.

Additionally, the Trollkin Reaver possesses the Howl of Battle ability, which can be used once every six rounds. When activated, this ability allows the reaver to howl a battle cry at up to three allied creatures within a 30-foot range. Each affected ally can immediately make one weapon attack as a reaction and gains advantage on the attack roll, significantly enhancing their effectiveness in combat.

One of the most notable features of the Trollkin Reaver is its Regeneration ability, which allows it to regain 5 hit points at the start of its turn, making it persistent in prolonged battles. However, this trait is negated if the trollkin takes damage from fire or acid, leaving it vulnerable if faced with such attacks. A critical point to note is that if the trollkin reaches 0 hit points and cannot regenerate, it dies, marking a clear threshold in its resilience on the battlefield. 

Lastly, the Trollkin Reaver’s darkvision ability allows it to see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, which provides a tactical advantage in low-light conditions. It communicates in Common and its own language, Trollkin, allowing it to coordinate with allies effectively. Overall, the Trollkin Reaver is a potent combatant with a blend of physical prowess, regenerative abilities, and a strong presence in melee engagements.</detail>
