<summary>The Herald of the Void is a powerful Large Fiend that embodies chaotic evil and serves as a formidable adversary in combat. Its notable strengths include high mobility, with the ability to hover, walk, and fly, and the capability to deal significant cold and force damage with its attacks. This creature has an impressive Armor Class of 17 and substantial Hit Points totaling 123, allowing it to withstand considerable damage in battle. The Herald's skill set includes exceptional Dexterity and Constitution scores, both at 20, which grant it impressive defensive capabilities and excellent saving throw bonuses. However, its average Strength of 12 means it relies more on finesse and ranged attacks than physical brute strength. The Herald is immune to several damage types and conditions, making it a challenging foe to defeat, particularly for parties without the means to counter its immunities and resistances.</summary>

<detail>

The attributes of the Herald of the Void are as follows: Strength is 12 with a modifier of +1, which is average. Dexterity is 20 with a modifier of +5, which is exceptional. Constitution is 20, also with a +5 modifier, which is exceptional. Intelligence is at 19 with a +4 modifier, which is very good. Wisdom is 15 with a +2 modifier, which is good. Charisma is 12 with a +1 modifier, which is average. 

In terms of saving throws, the Herald has a +9 bonus in Dexterity and Constitution, both of which are very good. Its skills reflect its capabilities well, with Perception at +10, which is exceptional, and Stealth at +9, also very good. The creature is immune to cold, necrotic, and radiant damage while resisting fire, lightning, and poison damage. It cannot be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, prone, stunned, or unconscious, showcasing exceptional resilience against status effects. With a truesight ability extending to 60 feet and a passive Perception of 20, the Herald possesses keen senses and awareness. It can communicate in Abyssal, Common, and its unique Void Speech.

The Herald of the Void's special abilities further enhance its threat level. The Annihilating Form ability means that any object that comes into contact with it vaporizes, and a creature can make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) to prevent that from happening, with advantages for magical items. The creature also possesses Legendary Resistance, allowing it to choose to succeed on a failed saving throw three times per day. Zero-Dimensional enables the Herald to maneuver through spaces freely, increasing its tactical options in battle.

When it comes to actions, the Herald can perform a Multiattack, which allows it to make two melee attacks with its Void Claw or use its Void Ray twice. The Void Claw is a melee weapon attack with a +9 to hit and a reach of 10 feet, dealing 18 cold damage along with 4 force damage if successful. The Void Ray is a ranged spell attack with a +8 to hit and a range of 120 feet, causing 9 cold damage and 9 force damage on a successful hit.

The Herald's signature action, The Final Song, can be used after recharging on a roll of 5 or 6. This action creates a 30-foot cone of psychic energy that forces creatures within to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 17) or take 27 psychic damage (or half on a successful save). Notably, creatures that understand Void Speech are immune to this effect.

Additionally, the Herald can use up to three legendary actions, which can be selected from various options. The Move action allows it to fly up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks. The Void Claw action costs two legendary actions and allows it to make one Void Claw attack. The Discorporate action targets up to two creatures within 30 feet, who must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 17) to avoid becoming intangible until the end of their next turn, incapacitating them for the duration. Lastly, the Song of Mighty Doom action, which costs three actions, grants temporary hit points to creatures within 30 feet that can understand Void Speech, strengthening allies while hindering enemies. This combination of abilities and damage potential positions the Herald of the Void as a captivating and formidable challenge for any adventuring party.</detail>
