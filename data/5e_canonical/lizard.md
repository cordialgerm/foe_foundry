<summary>A Lizard is a small, cold-blooded reptile commonly found in warm environments such as deserts, jungles, or rocky areas. Lizards are agile and quick, using their sharp claws and teeth to catch small insects and evade predators. Though individually harmless, some larger species of lizards can be more dangerous, especially when provoked. Lizards are often used as familiars or pets by spellcasters due to their stealth and adaptability. They are excellent climbers and can blend into their surroundings to avoid detection.</summary>
