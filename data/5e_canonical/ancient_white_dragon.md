<CreatureType/>Dragon</CreatureType>

<summary>The Ancient White Dragon is a savage and feral creature, with scales as cold and hard as ice. It rules the frozen tundras and glaciers, where it hunts anything unfortunate enough to cross its path. White Dragons are primal and instinct-driven, relying more on brute force than on cunning. Their breath weapon is a cone of icy cold that can freeze even the hardiest creatures in seconds. They are territorial and aggressive, making their lairs in massive ice caverns and jealously guarding their hoards. Ancient White Dragons are relentless predators, often toying with their prey before delivering a final, killing blow.</summary>

<summary>The Ancient White Dragon is a gargantuan and formidable creature known for its mastery of icy elements and its terrifying presence on the battlefield. With an exceptionally high Armor Class of 20 and a massive pool of Hit Points totaling 370, this dragon possesses both durability and resilience, making it a significant challenge for adventurers. Its movement options are versatile, including walking, flying, and even burrowing through snow and ice, allowing it to navigate various terrains with ease. This dragon's offensive capabilities are impressive, including powerful physical attacks and devastating cold-based abilities. However, it has lower Dexterity, which could make it vulnerable to ranged attacks if not adequately protected. The Ancient White Dragon excels in controlling the battlefield, devastating foes with icy breath weapons and powerful spells, making it a notable threat in any encounter.</summary>

<detail>

The Ancient White Dragon has the following attributes: Strength 26 (+8, exceptional), Dexterity 12 (+1, average), Constitution 26 (+8, exceptional), Intelligence 10 (+0, average), Wisdom 16 (+3, good), and Charisma 16 (+3, good).

This dragon possesses high saving throw bonuses in Constitution (+15, exceptional), Wisdom (+10, very good), and Charisma (+10, very good). Its Dexterity saving throw bonus is also robust at +8 (good). It has a reputation for intimidation (+10, very good) and keen perception (+10, very good), and is capable of stealth (+8, good). One of its key advantages is its immunity to cold damage, which allows it to withstand attacks from adversaries that utilize frost spells or weapons. With a blindsight of 60 feet, darkvision up to 120 feet, and a passive perception score of 23, it can effectively detect and engage foes in various conditions.

The Ancient White Dragon's special abilities include Cold Mastery, which allows it to move and see without hindrance in icy conditions and burrow through snow without leaving a trace. It also has Legendary Resistance, allowing it to automatically succeed on a failed saving throw three times per day, but using this ability reduces its Armor Class temporarily if overused. As a spellcaster, its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma, with a save DC of 18. It can cast several spells which include Dominating beasts, creating protective fire shields, charming animals, conjuring sleet storms, controlling weather, and forming walls of ice.

In combat, the Ancient White Dragon can make multiple attacks through its Multiattack option, delivering powerful bites and claw attacks. Its Bite attack has an attack bonus of +15 to hit, dealing 30 piercing damage plus an additional 9 cold damage on a successful hit. The Claw attack, with the same attack bonus, inflicts 21 slashing damage, and the Tail attack, also with +15, can deal 21 bludgeoning damage and push targets away.

Additionally, the dragon can unleash Spit Ice, a ranged attack that forces a target within 60 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer 22 cold damage, immobilizing them for their next turn. Its Cold Breath ability, which can be used only as it recharges, unleashes a frost cone affecting all within a 90-foot area, requiring enemies to make a Constitution saving throw or take severe cold damage and face movement restrictions.

In terms of reactions, the dragon can perform a Tail Attack when it is hit by a melee attack, retaliating against the attacker. Furthermore, it has access to Legendary Actions, allowing it to use abilities like Roar, which frightens nearby enemies; Wing Attack, which can push foes away and enable the dragon to reposition itself; and Raging Storm, creating an area of difficult terrain and cold damage for anyone moving within it.

The Ancient White Dragon is not only a fearsome foe but one that can manipulate the battlefield, making it a memorable and dangerous encounter for any adventuring party.

The Ancient White Dragon is a gargantuan and formidable creature that plays a dominant role as a powerful and dangerous foe in combat scenarios. With an impressive Armor Class of 20 and a massive pool of 301 hit points, this dragon is designed to withstand prolonged encounters and inflict significant damage. It boasts exceptional physical attributes, especially in Constitution with a +14 modifier, indicating very good durability, and Strength with a +8 modifier, allowing it to perform powerful attacks. Its challenge rating of 17 marks it as a significant threat that adventurers should approach with caution. Notably, the Ancient White Dragon embodies cold-based abilities, including a devastating Cold Breath attack, and has access to legendary actions, providing it versatility and the ability to turn the tide of battle in its favor. However, its lack of intelligence, represented by a +0 modifier, suggests limitations in tactical thinking, making it reliant on raw power rather than strategic planning.

The Ancient White Dragon has several notable attributes: its Strength is +8 (good), Dexterity is +6 (average), Constitution is +14 (very good), Intelligence is +0 (very bad), Wisdom is +9 (good), and Charisma is +9 (good). The dragon also has exceptional senses with darkvision out to 120 feet and keensense up to 60 feet, allowing it to detect creatures well beyond its immediate vicinity, along with a high Perception score of 25, showcasing its ability to notice hidden enemies and dangers. Its stealth ability is moderate with a score of 16. The dragon understands both Common and Draconic languages, facilitating communication with a variety of creatures.

The Ancient White Dragon possesses special abilities that enhance its capabilities. Ice Walk allows the dragon to traverse icy terrains effortlessly without needing to roll for ability checks, and it doesn't suffer movement penalties in difficult icy terrain. Legendary Resistance, usable three times a day, permits the dragon to choose to succeed on a saving throw that it would otherwise fail, significantly bolstering its survivability in battle. The Numbing Chill ability creates a significant threat: when the dragon has not used its Cold Breath, it emits a numbing chill, forcing creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turns or have their speed halved, complicating enemy movement and positioning.

In combat, the Ancient White Dragon can execute multiple attacks with its Multiattack action, which consists of using its Frightful Presence to instill fear, followed by one Bite and two Claw attacks. The Bite attack is particularly devastating, as it has a +14 to hit, a reach of 15 feet, and deals 19 piercing damage on a hit along with an additional 9 cold damage. The Claw attack functions similarly, dealing 15 slashing damage, while its Tail attack can deal 17 bludgeoning damage. The Frightful Presence can incapacitate numerous enemies by requiring them to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for an entire minute, which can severely hinder their ability to engage in combat.

The dragonâ€™s Cold Breath attack is an iconic and spectacular feature, allowing it to exhale a 90-foot cone of frigid air that necessitates a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. Creatures caught in this area face a staggering 63 cold damage on a failed save or half that damage on a successful one, making it a powerful crowd control option.

Additionally, the dragon can utilize legendary actions to maintain its dominance in battle. It can automatically detect creatures and traps within 30 feet, perform a Tail attack, or unleash an Elemental Roar which targets creatures within 120 feet, potentially rendering them vulnerable to cold damage for the remainder of their next turn. A powerful Wing Attack allows it to affect creatures within 15 feet, dealing bludgeoning damage and knocking them prone while allowing the dragon to reposition itself without fear of opportunity attacks.

Lastly, the Ancient White Dragon has regional effects that manifest in its territory, which can fade over a few days should it meet its demise, adding another layer of impact to its presence in the game world. Overall, engaging with an Ancient White Dragon is a formidable challenge for any adventuring party, and tactical planning is essential for overcoming this titanic foe.</detail>
