<summary>The Hinn is a large elemental creature that serves as a formidable combatant and spellcaster in varied environments. It possesses a strong defensive capability with an Armor Class of 17 and a significant pool of Hit Points totaling 199, which allows it to withstand substantial amounts of damage. With a Challenge Rating of 11, it is a powerful opponent. The Hinn showcases remarkable strengths through its physical and magical abilities, particularly in controlling Earth and utilizing special actions to manipulate the battlefield. Its weaknesses lie primarily in its lack of direct ranged attacks and reliance on close and mid-range combat strategies. Notable features include its ability to seamlessly travel through the earth without leaving a trace and its capability to transform into a cloud form, enhancing its stealth.</summary>

<detail>

The Hinn's attributes are as follows: Strength is at +6, indicating above-average physical power; Dexterity is +1, signifying a below-average nimbleness; Constitution is exceptionally high at +11, providing significant resilience and toughness; Intelligence is average with a +2, showing it is not particularly clever compared to other creatures; Wisdom is strong at +7, reflecting sharp perception and insight; and Charisma is also high at +8, indicating strong magical influence. The Hinn's darkvision allowing sight in dark environments extends up to 120 feet, making it a formidable presence in low-light conditions. Its Perception score of 17 is very good, giving it an impressive ability to notice hidden creatures or objects, while a Stealth score of 15 is also good, ensuring it can move quietly, especially in its cloud form.

Special abilities of the Hinn include Earth Glide, allowing it to burrow effortlessly through nonmagical earth and stone without disturbing the material above, which can be strategically advantageous for surprise attacks or escape tactics. In cloud form, its Nebulous trait boosts its Stealth score to 20, allowing it to hover, slip through tight spaces, and hide in various containers, which can be useful for evasion tactics or stealthy infiltration.

The Hinn can engage in combat using its Multiattack feature, making three attacks with either its Gem-Studded Mace or Lob Stone. The Gem-Studded Mace attack has a +10 to hit and inflicts an average of 13 bludgeoning damage plus 9 piercing damage. If two mace attacks hit the same target, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of its next turn, providing a significant tactical advantage. The Lob Stone ranged attack, which also has a +10 to hit, deals an average of 22 bludgeoning damage and can target creatures up to 60 feet away.

The Hinn can create an earth elemental once per day, summoning a creature of Challenge Rating 5 or lower that becomes its ally, obeying its commands for an hour or until it dismisses the elemental. Additionally, the Hinn can use Travel the Planes once per day to shift to another plane of existence, functioning similarly to the spell Plane Shift but solely for its own movement.

As a bonus action, the Hinn can utilize Churned Earth, causing the ground at a point within 60 feet to erupt. Creatures in a 15-foot radius must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 10 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone, disrupting positioning and creating chaos on the battlefield. The Genie Shape ability allows the Hinn to transform between its bipedal form and a cloud of dust, retaining its statistics in either iteration, offering versatility and providing tactical options during combat. The transformation does not affect its equipment, which changes form along with it; however, it cannot revert to its bipedal form while contained in a smaller object.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Earth Glide.** The hinn can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the hinn doesn’t disturb the material through which it moves.
- **Nebulous (Cloud Form Only).** The hinn’s Stealth is 20, it can hover while flying, can’t manipulate objects or attack, and it can pass through any space air can pass through without squeezing. In addition, it can enter and hide in any Tiny or larger container, such as a pouch, lamp, backpack, or barrel.

### Actions

- **Multiattack** . The hinn makes three Gem-Studded Mace or Lob Stone attacks. If two Gem-Studded Mace attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 16 CON save or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
- **Gem-Studded Mace.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) piercing damage.
- **Lob Stone.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
- **Create Earth Elemental (1/Day).** The hinn magically creates one earth-based Elemental of CR 5 or lower in an unoccupied space the hinn can see within 30 feet of it. The elemental acts as an ally of the hinn, obeying its spoken commands. The elemental remains for 1 hour, until the hinn dies, or until the hinn dismisses it as a bonus action.
- **Travel the Planes (1/Day).** The hinn transports itself to a different plane of existence. This works like the plane shift spell, except it can affect only itself and can’t use this action to banish an unwilling creature.

### Bonus Actions

- **Churned Earth.** The hinn causes the ground on a point it can see within 60 feet of it to erupt. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 16 DEX save or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
- **Genie Shape.** The hinn magically transforms into a Medium cloud of dust filled with miniscule clashing, bursting, and reforming rocks or back into its bipedal form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its bipedal form if it dies. The hinn can’t use this bonus action to transform into its bipedal form while inside a Medium or smaller container.
