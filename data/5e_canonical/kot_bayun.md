<CreatureType/>Monstrosity</CreatureType>

<summary>The Kot Bayun is a medium-sized monstrosity that embodies a blend of cunning and charm, found in neutral alignments. This creature has a decent Armor Class of 15, providing it with good defenses against attacks, while its hit points total 66, which is above average for its Challenge Rating of 3. Its speed is relatively slow, with a walking pace of 20 feet. The Kot Bayun excels in stealth, leveraging its dexterous abilities to gain an upper hand in battles. It possesses strong charisma, enabling it to enchant and manipulate others effectively. However, it is not overly resilient in terms of Constitution, having a somewhat average score in that attribute. This creature's notable abilities include its Slumbering Song and Invisibility, allowing for strategic combat maneuvers.</summary>

<detail>

The Kot Bayun has the following ability scores: Strength at 16, Dexterity at 16, Constitution at 13, Intelligence at 12, Wisdom at 16, and Charisma at 17. Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma are all positioned strongly with bonuses of +3, indicating good effectiveness in physical attacks and social interactions. Dexterity gives it a very good modifier for Stealth, allowing the Kot Bayun to evade detection easily. Its Wisdom score also enables it to maintain keen perception, although its Intelligence score places its understanding of complex situations at an average level. 

In terms of actions, the Kot Bayun can execute a Multiattack that includes its Slumbering Song ability, followed by one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. For the Bite attack, the creature has a +5 to hit, with a reach of 5 feet. It deals an average of 7 piercing damage on a hit. The Claw attack also has a +5 to hit and deals an average of 8 slashing damage, which is slightly more damaging due to its damage dice configuration of 2d4 plus the appropriate modifier.

The Kot Bayun can turn invisible, which grants it significant advantages in combat. This ability allows it to attack unsuspecting foes or retreat from battle without being seen. The invisibility lasts until it makes an attack or uses its Slumbering Song ability, or until it decides to end the effect through concentration.

Slumbering Song is a powerful ability that can incapacitate a target for up to one minute, giving the Kot Bayun an opportunity to control the battlefield. The creature must select one creature within range, who then must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to avoid falling unconscious. If the target fails the saving throw, they can attempt to shake off the effect at the end of their turns, but if the Kot Bayun chooses to continue singing as a bonus action, that target suffers disadvantage on subsequent saving throws. The effectiveness of this ability can shift dramatically, especially since it ends when a target takes damage while below half their hit points.

Additionally, the Kot Bayun has a limited-use healing ability called Healing Purr, which it can activate twice a day. This allows it to soothe a target within 15 feet, restoring an average of 10 hit points and curing various ailments such as diseases or conditions like blindness or deafness. This support capability makes it a valuable ally to any group when utilized strategically.</detail>
