<summary>The Kongamato is a large, unaligned beast known for its ferocity in combat and immense strength. With high natural armor and a considerable pool of hit points, this creature is a formidable opponent that can withstand significant damage while delivering powerful attacks of its own. Its movement capabilities include a fast walking speed and limited flight, allowing it to maneuver effectively in various environments. However, despite its physical prowess, the Kongamato has very low intelligence and charisma scores, which reflect its lack of social or tactical acumen. It serves as a challenging foe for adventurers, particularly with its unique abilities that disrupt standard combat strategies.</summary>

<detail>

The Kongamato has an armor class (AC) of 16, which provides good protection against attacks. It possesses 127 hit points, calculated by rolling 17 ten-sided dice and adding 34, giving it a robust resilience in battle. The creature’s speed is 60 feet while walking and 10 feet while flying, which allows it to cover ground quickly, although its flying speed is limited, especially when carrying creatures. Its challenge rating is 6, indicating that a party of adventurers should find it a significant threat, earning 2,300 experience points upon defeat.

In terms of its physical attributes, the Kongamato has a strength score of 19, which provides it a modifier of +4, making it very good at physical tasks and attacks. It has a dexterity score of 18, also yielding a modifier of +4, which contributes to its agility and ability to avoid attacks. The constitution score of 14 translates to a +2 modifier, providing it average endurance. The intelligence score of 2 results in a very bad modifier of -4, and its wisdom and charisma scores of 10 (+0) and 7 (-2) do not aid it in social interactions or perceptive tasks beyond its skills.

The Kongamato's skills include perception with a modifier of +3, establishing a passive perception of 13, which ensures it can notice incoming threats or hidden foes effectively. However, it does not possess any languages, limiting its ability to communicate in encounters.

The special abilities of the Kongamato further enhance its threat level in combat. The "Breaker of Boats" ability allows the creature to deal double damage to wooden objects, making it especially dangerous in environments with wooden structures or vessels. The "Carry Off" ability enables the Kongamato to move while grappling, permitting it to drag creatures in combat—a menacing tactic for capturing foes. With the "Flyby" ability, it can avoid opportunity attacks when leaving a melee range, allowing it to strike and retreat without reprisal.

In combat, the Kongamato can make a multiattack, performing one beak attack and two claw attacks on its turn. The beak attack uses a melee weapon attack roll with a +7 bonus to hit, targeting one creature within reach. On a successful hit, it deals 15 points of piercing damage, averaging a moderate amount of damage. Each claw attack also utilizes a +7 to hit and can grapple a target if it’s a medium or smaller creature upon hitting, which also deals 13 slashing damage. The escape DC for grappling is 15, which presents a good challenge for many characters.

Additionally, the Kongamato can unleash a "Terrifying Screech" as a special action, which requires a recharge on rolls of 5–6. This ability creates a 30-foot cone where each creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Creatures failing the save take 28 points of thunder damage and are frightened until the end of their next turn, while successful saves result in halving the damage without fear effects. This ability can sway the tide of battle, potentially incapacitating several foes at once.</detail>
