<MonsterName/>De Ogen</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Undead</CreatureType>

<summary>De Ogen is a medium-sized undead creature with an alignment of neutral evil. It serves as a potent adversary capable of incapacitating foes and evading attacks effectively. With its formidable Dexterity score of 20, the creature has exceptional agility, making it difficult to hit in combat. De Ogen boasts a fair amount of resilience, featuring damage immunities to elements such as fire, necrotic, and poison, while resisting various other forms of damage from non-magical sources. However, its strength is notably weak, making it rely on its other abilities rather than direct physical confrontations. The creature's challenge rating of 4 hints at its moderate difficulty level for adventurers, presenting a mixture of offensive capabilities and structural defenses, particularly when using its special abilities.</summary>

<detail>

De Ogen has an Armor Class of 15, which provides a good level of defense against attacks. It possesses 45 hit points, calculated as 6d8+18, allowing it to withstand a fair amount of damage before being defeated. Its movement is unique; while it has a flying speed of 40 feet, it cannot walk, and instead hovers, implying a strategic position in battles. 

The creature's ability scores reflect its characteristics:
- Strength: 1 (-5), which is very bad, indicating ineffectiveness in physical combat.
- Dexterity: 20 (+5), exceptional, granting considerable agility and enhancing its stealth abilities.
- Constitution: 16 (+3), good, contributing to its durability.
- Intelligence: 11 (+0), average, showing some understanding but not impressively so.
- Wisdom: 13 (+1), average, providing a slight bonus to perception tasks.
- Charisma: 10 (+0), average, showing no significant prowess or influence.

De Ogen has proficiency in stealth, reflected with a bonus of +9, allowing it to perform sneaky maneuvers effectively. It is immune to conditions such as being charmed, exhausted, or grappled and has significant resistances against different elemental forces and physical attacks, giving it good survivability in various combat scenarios. 

One of De Ogen's special abilities is Incorporeal Movement, allowing it to move through other creatures and objects, treating them as difficult terrain. However, if it ends its turn inside an object, it suffers 5 (1d10) force damage. It also suffers from Sunlight Sensitivity, granting disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight while in sunlight. Its Transfixing Gaze ability can incapacitate creatures within 30 feet, requiring a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to resist. If a creature fails, it becomes incapacitated and its speed drops to 0 until its next turn. Notably, creatures immune to fright are unaffected by this gaze. Additionally, De Ogen's Wilting Passage ability inflicts 5 (1d10) fire damage when it enters or moves through a creature's space or an object that isn't worn or carried.

In combat, De Ogen can use its Burning Touch attack, which requires a melee weapon attack roll with a +7 modifier to hit. If successful, it deals 14 (4d6) fire damage, and any humanoid slain by this attack rises after 24 hours as a shadow, which will aid De Ogen unless the humanoid is restored to life or its ashes are blessed with holy water. This attack makes De Ogen a threat not only in the present but a potential source of future adversaries.</detail>

### Special Abilities

- **Incorporeal Movement:** The de ogen can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the de ogen has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Transfixing Gaze:** When a creature that can see the de ogen starts its turn within 30 feet of the de ogen, the de ogen can force it to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw if the de ogen isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the de ogen until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the de ogen in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw.

Creatures immune to being frightened are immune to the de ogen’s Transfixing Gaze.
- **Wilting Passage:** The first time the de ogen enters or moves through a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. When the de ogen moves through an object that isn’t being worn or carried, the object takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.

### Actions

- **Burning Touch:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) fire damage. A creature slain by this attack turns to ash. A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a shadow, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its ashes are doused in holy water. The shadow isn’t under the de ogen’s control, but it follows in the de ogen’s wake and aids the de ogen when possible.
