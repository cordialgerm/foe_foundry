<summary>The Razorback Crab is a medium-sized beast characterized by its distinctive spiky shell and aggressive behavior. While it lacks any form of alignment, its instincts dictate its actions. It has a good Armor Class of 17 due to natural armor, making it relatively tough to hit. With 58 hit points, it can sustain some damage in combat. This creature possesses a challenge rating of 2, suitable for adventurers who are somewhat experienced but not yet experts. While it has decent Strength and Constitution scores, its low Dexterity and Intelligence make it less agile and less cognitively aware. The Razorback Crab’s main strengths lie in its unique abilities and its capability to grapple opponents, making it a formidable opponent in close combat, though it does have limited range of movement and strategy.</summary>

<detail>

The Razorback Crab has a Strength score of 16, which translates to a modifier of +3, categorizing it as good in physical attacks. With a Constitution score of 14 (+2), it has a solid endurance making it able to withstand hits better than many foes. However, its Dexterity is average at 10 (+0), meaning it does not excel at avoiding attacks. The Crab is unintelligent, with an Intelligence of 2 (-4), and has very low Charisma at 3 (-4), indicating it is not persuasive or charming. It has no special languages, and its perception skills are average.

In terms of special abilities, the Razorback Crab has a Bladed Shell feature which inflicts 3 (1d6) slashing damage when a creature touches it or engages it in melee combat within 5 feet. This can serve as a deterrent against close-range attacks. Additionally, its Pounce ability allows it to charge at a target, and if it successfully hits with its Shell Bash attack after moving at least 15 feet, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target becomes prone, the Crab can follow up with a claw attack as a bonus action, capitalizing on its advantage.

The Razorback Crab’s Multiattack allows it to make a combination of one Claw and one Shell Bash attack during its turn. Its Claw attack has a +5 to hit, and when it successfully strikes a target, it deals 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage and grapples the target, setting the escape DC at 13. This grapple ability can keep foes immobilized. The Shell Bash attack also has a +5 to hit, inflicting a total of 8 damage composed of 5 (1d4+3) bludgeoning and 3 (1d6) slashing damage upon a successful hit. 

Overall, the Razorback Crab presents a range of options for attack and defense, making it a creature that can effectively control the battlefield against adventurers who engage it in close quarters.</detail>
