<detail>

The Snake Lamia has the following attributes: Strength of 16 with a modifier of +3, Dexterity of 16 also with a +3 modifier, Constitution at 16 granting another +3 modifier, Intelligence at 14 giving a +2 modifier, Wisdom at 16 for a +3 modifier, and Charisma at 18 with an exceptional +4 modifier. This exceptional Charisma not only enhances its spellcasting but also makes it a master of deception, reflected in its skilled Deception score of +6. The Lamia has a passive Perception of 15, aided by darkvision that extends to 60 feet. It is fluent in Abyssal and Common languages.

The Lamia has several notable special abilities. It radiates a Chaotic Evil aura, which could affect creatures around it. Its innate spellcasting uses Charisma as the spellcasting ability, with a spell save DC of 14. It can cast spells like charm person and disguise self at will, allowing it to manipulate others and alter its appearance. The Lamia can also use more powerful spells like geas and scrying once a day.

In combat, the Snake Lamia has various actions it can perform. The "Dizzying Touch" is a melee spell attack with a +6 to hit and a reach of 5 feet. When it hits, the target is magically charmed for one hour or until it takes damage, suffering disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and ability checks during that time. The "Constrict" action is a melee weapon attack with a +5 to hit, dealing 10 bludgeoning damage on a hit and grappling the target (with an escape DC of 13), which restricts its ability to target others. For ranged attacks, the Lamia wields a dagger, providing it with a melee or ranged option +5 to hit. This attack deals 5 piercing damage and can poison the target if they fail a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, leading to additional poison damage and the poisoned condition for an hour.

Furthermore, the Lamia can use the "Hypnotic Pattern" spell as a 3rd-level concentration spell, creating a mesmerizing light pattern within 120 feet. Creatures within 10 feet of the pattern must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. Failing this save results in the creature being charmed and incapacitated for one minute, during which their speed drops to zero. The effect dissipates if the affected creature suffers damage or is shaken awake by another creature.

As a bonus action, the Snake Lamia can use "Misty Step," teleporting to any unoccupied space within 30 feet. However, this action is limited in that it cannot cast another spell of 1st level or higher during the same turn. Overall, the Snake Lamia is a crafty and dangerous adversary that combines allure and menace in equal measure.</detail>
