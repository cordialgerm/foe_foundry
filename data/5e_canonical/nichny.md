<detail>

The Nichny has a set of impressive ability scores that grant it useful combat advantages. Its strength is rated at 17, which translates to a good modifier of +3, enabling solid melee attacks. With exceptional dexterity at 19 (+4), it excels in ranged combat and avoids attacks with good effectiveness. The Nichny also boasts high intelligence (18, +4), wisdom (18, +4), and charisma (19, +4), making it adept at mental and social interactions, as well as maintaining powerful magical defenses. It is particularly effective with its dexterity saving throws, reflected by a +7 modifier.

In terms of abilities, the Nichny is equipped with several formidable special traits. Its "Aura of Luck" creates an intriguing battlefield dynamic. Friendly creatures within a 10-foot radius gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and saving throws, enhancing their effectiveness. Conversely, hostile creatures within this aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their attack rolls and saving throws until the end of their turn, thus severely hindering their performance. The Nichny also possesses "Magic Resistance," granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, which further increases its resilience in magical confrontations. Finally, its "Soothsaying" ability allows it to engage in a cryptic dialogue with a creature nearby, answering up to three questions with a mix of truth and deception.

In terms of actions, the Nichny can execute a "Multiattack," performing two Claw or Luck-Stealing Bolt attacks in one turn. The Claw attack is a melee weapon attack that has a +7 modifier. It has a reach of 5 feet, deals 13 slashing damage (2d8 + 4), and an additional 9 force damage (2d8), making it a potent close-quarters threat. The Luck-Stealing Bolt is a ranged spell attack with the same +7 modifier but has a range of 60 feet, dealing 22 force damage (4d8 + 4) while imposing disadvantage on the target's ability checks and attack rolls until the end of its next turn, thus significantly impairing its effectiveness.

The Nichny can also create a "Lucky Stone," imbuing a small stone with good luck. This grants a +1 bonus on saving throws to the creature carrying it, though the Nichny can only keep three of these stones active at a time. When creating a fourth, the oldest stoneâ€™s effect is dispelled. Moreover, the Nichny has the option to end the magic on any stone at will without needing an action. Its teleportation ability, which recharges on a roll of 6, allows the Nichny to quickly reposition itself by magically teleporting up to 120 feet to a space it can see, further enhancing its elusiveness in combat.</detail>
