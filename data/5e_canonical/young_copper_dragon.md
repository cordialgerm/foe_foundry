<summary>A Young Copper Dragon is a playful and quick-witted creature, known for its love of riddles, jokes, and pranks. Its copper-colored scales gleam in the sunlight, and its breath weapon can either create acid or a debilitating slowing gas. Young Copper Dragons are typically found in hilly or mountainous regions, where they enjoy playing tricks on travelers and collecting treasure. Although mischievous, they are generally good-natured and prefer to avoid violence, using their wit and agility to outmaneuver opponents. They defend their hoard with tenacity but always try to resolve conflicts with cleverness before resorting to combat.</summary>

### Special Abilities

- **Corrosive Scales.** When the copper dragon hasn’t spit its Acid Breath, the acid built up within the dragon causes the patina on its scales to spread to weapons that strike it. While the dragon’s Acid Breath is available, any weapon made of metal that hits the dragon corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If a nonmagical weapon’s penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the dragon is destroyed after dealing damage. A magical weapon can’t have a penalty greater than −5, and a magical weapon removes this penalty after 24 hours or after its attuned wielder finishes a long rest.
