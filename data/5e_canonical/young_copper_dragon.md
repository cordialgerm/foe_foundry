Its copper-colored scales gleam in the sunlight, and its breath weapon can either create acid or a debilitating slowing gas. Young Copper Dragons are typically found in hilly or mountainous regions, where they enjoy playing tricks on travelers and collecting treasure. Although mischievous, they are generally good-natured and prefer to avoid violence, using their wit and agility to outmaneuver opponents. They defend their hoard with tenacity but always try to resolve conflicts with cleverness before resorting to combat.</summary>

It has a strong presence in combat, capable of dealing substantial damage with its physical attacks and breath weapons. With an impressive Armor Class of 17 and a total of 144 hit points, this dragon is relatively durable and can withstand significant amounts of damage. It is especially dangerous at high altitudes, possessing excellent flying capabilities. However, it has average Dexterity, which makes it slightly less agile compared to other creatures. The Young Copper Dragon excels in stealth in mountainous environments, thanks to its special ability, "Flow Within the Mountain." In terms of magical capabilities, it can cast a variety of spells, enhancing its utility beyond just physical attacks. </summary>

<detail>

Its attributes are as follows: Strength is 18 (+4), Dexterity is 12 (+1), Constitution is 16 (+3), Intelligence is 16 (+3), Wisdom is 12 (+1), and Charisma is 14 (+2). The dragon's Strength modifier is exceptional, allowing it to deal significant damage with its attacks. The Dexterity modifier is average, providing it with a decent but not outstanding capacity for finesse. With a Constitution modifier that is good, it has resilience against physical attacks. The Intelligence and Charisma modifiers are both good, enhancing its spellcasting abilities and social interactions. 

For saving throws, the Young Copper Dragon has the following values: Dexterity +5, Constitution +7, Wisdom +5, and Charisma +6, all of which indicate good resilience against various effects. In terms of skills, it possesses deception +6, perception +5, and stealth +5, making it a well-rounded creature adept at both subterfuge and awareness in its environment. The dragon is immune to acid damage, which grants it a significant advantage against foes who rely on this damage type.

The dragon has a passive perception of 15, allowing it to notice hidden creatures or objects effectively. It is capable of communication in both Common and Draconic, making it interactively versatile in conversations or negotiations.

The Young Copper Dragon has several notable abilities. "Flow Within the Mountain" grants it advantage on Stealth checks when hiding in mountainous regions, making it exceptionally skilled in its preferred environment. Its innate spellcasting, governed by Charisma with a save DC of 15, allows it to cast spells such as "hideous laughter" and "suggestion" three times per day each. These spells can incapacitate or manipulate opponents, showcasing the dragon’s clever and strategic approach to combat.

In terms of actions, the Young Copper Dragon can perform a "Multiattack," allowing it to attack with its bite once and its claws twice in one turn. The bite is a melee weapon attack with a modifier of +8 to hit, and on a successful hit, it deals 15 piercing damage along with an additional 4 acid damage. The claws are also a melee weapon attack with a +8 to hit, and they deal 13 slashing damage on a successful hit.

The dragon's breath weapons offer powerful area-of-effect options. With a recharge requirement of 5-6, it can utilize either the "Acid Breath" or "Slowing Breath." The "Acid Breath" involves exhaling acid in a 40-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line, requiring creatures in that area to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. They take 45 (10d8) acid damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful one. The "Slowing Breath" involves exhaling toxic gas in a 30-foot cone, compelling creatures within to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A failure results in the creature being slowed for 1 minute, making them less effective in combat. They may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect.

The Young Copper Dragon is a formidable opponent that combines physical prowess, magical abilities, and cunning tactics, making it a memorable encounter for any adventuring party.

The Young Copper Dragon is a formidable creature in the Dungeons & Dragons universe, known for its intelligence and cunning in combat. This large dragon boasts an impressive Armor Class of 17, providing it with strong defense due to its natural armor. With a total of 144 hit points, it can endure a significant amount of damage before succumbing. The copper dragon is quite agile, facilitated by a movement speed of 40 feet, and possesses the ability to climb and fly at similar speeds, giving it excellent mobility in various environments. Rated with a Challenge Rating of 7, it is suitable for mid-level parties, presenting a substantial challenge. The dragon excels with its acid-based attacks, particularly its Acid Breath ability, which can cause wide-ranging damage. However, its weaknesses lie primarily in its reliance on its breath weapon, with a recharge mechanic that may limit its effectiveness during prolonged encounters.

The Young Copper Dragon has the following attributes: Strength +4 (good), Dexterity +4 (good), Constitution +6 (very good), Intelligence +3 (average), Wisdom +4 (good), and Charisma +5 (very good). With such impressive Constitution and Charisma, it maintains high hit points and effectiveness in social interactions. Its senses include darkvision up to 120 feet and keen senses, enhancing its ability to perceive threats. The dragon has a skill of 17 in Perception (very good) and can hide effectively with a Stealth skill of 14 (average). It understands Common and Draconic languages, enabling it to communicate with a variety of entities.

One of its notable special abilities is Corrosive Scales. This ability causes any metal weapon that strikes the copper dragon to corrode, reducing its effectiveness with a cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls each time it hits. If a nonmagical weapon's penalty reaches −5, it is destroyed. Furthermore, any nonmagical metal ammunition that impacts the dragon is also destroyed. Magic weapons are more resilient, suffering no greater than a −5 penalty and recovering after a long rest.

The Young Copper Dragon can utilize several actions in combat:
- **Multiattack:** This allows the dragon to make one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it can substitute a Bite attack for a use of Slowing Breath when available.
- **Bite:** A melee attack with a +7 to hit against a single target, causing 15 piercing damage on a successful hit.
- **Claw:** Similar to the Bite, this melee attack also has a +7 to hit but deals 11 slashing damage.
- **Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6):** The dragon exhales a destructive line of acid, stretching 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Creatures caught in this area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 40 acid damage (calculated as 9d8) on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.
- **Slowing Breath (Recharge 6):** This ability creates a 30-foot cone that can impede the movements of creatures caught within it. The affected creatures must also succeed on a DC 14 saving throw to avoid the effect.

Additionally, the dragon has a **Change Shape** bonus action, allowing it to transform into any beast or humanoid with a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or revert back to its true dragon form. In this new form, the Young Copper Dragon retains its hit points and ability to speak, while adopting the statistics and capabilities of the new form, fostering versatility in both combat and social situations.</detail>
