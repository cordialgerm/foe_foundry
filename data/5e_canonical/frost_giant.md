<summary>A Frost Giant is a massive humanoid with blue-tinged skin and white hair, towering over most other creatures. These giants live in the icy tundras and frozen mountains, where they hunt mammoths and other large prey. Frost Giants are brutal warriors, wielding enormous axes or hammers made of ice and metal. They are highly territorial and aggressive, raiding villages and settlements for resources and slaves. Their society is built around strength and domination, with the most powerful giants ruling over the weaker ones. Frost Giants are resistant to cold and can summon ice and frost to aid them in battle.</summary>

<summary>The Frost Giant is a formidable creature in Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a Huge Giant. With a Challenge Rating of 9, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, boasting impressive physical attributes and powerful melee attacks. The Frost Giant's armor class is 15, providing a good defensive capability, while its hit points total 138, ensuring it can sustain considerable damage before being defeated. It moves at a speed of 40 feet, allowing it to close the gap quickly with foes. This giant possesses exceptional strength with a Strength score of 22, allowing it to excel at grappling and causing significant damage. Its Constitution is also noteworthy at 20, contributing to its high hit point pool and resilience. However, the Frost Giant has very poor Dexterity, with a score of 8, making it relatively slow and less agile in combat. The giant is immune to cold damage, indicating a strong affinity with cold environments, while it is susceptible to fire damage, becoming rattled when hit by fire attacks, which can impact its performance in battle.</summary>

<detail>

The Frost Giant has a robust collection of saving throw bonuses, being very good in Strength (+10) and Constitution (+9), which makes it resilient against physical attacks. Its Wisdom and Charisma saving throws are average, with bonuses of +4 and +5, respectively. The giant's skills in athletics (+10), perception (+4), and survival (+4) indicate its prowess in physical challenges, detecting threats, and navigating its environment. 

In combat, the Frost Giant can take multiple actions, including a multiattack option where it can make two melee weapon attacks in a turn. Its primary weapon is a battleaxe, which has a +10 to hit and can deliver an average of 22 slashing damage. Additionally, if the battleaxe attack hits a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or fall prone, gaining a tactical advantage for the giant.

Another key attack is the giant's ability to throw rocks. With a +10 to hit and a reach of 60 feet, a successful hit inflicts 37 bludgeoning damage, and like the battleaxe, it can knock a Large or smaller creature prone on a failed DC 18 Strength saving throw. The Frost Giant can also throw a grappled creature, which can deal bludgeoning damage not only to the thrown target but also to a target it hits, presenting diverse combat options.

As a bonus action, the Frost Giant can attempt to grab a creature within 5 feet by forcing it to make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, the creature is grappled, making it easier for the giant to land attacks with advantage on that target. Once it has grappled a target, it cannot grab another until the first is released. Additionally, once per day, the Frost Giant can use a stomp attack against a prone creature, dealing 13 bludgeoning damage with +10 to hit.

Overall, the Frost Giant is a powerful melee combatant, possessing strong offensive capabilities, resilience, and various tactical options to control the battlefield, while its vulnerability to fire adds a strategic element for attacking characters.

The Frost Giant is a formidable creature, categorized as a Huge giant, typically serving as a guardian of icy realms or a powerful adversary in combat. With a robust challenge rating of 8, this creature boasts impressive statistics including high hit points and strong physical attributes, making it a significant threat on the battlefield. It excels in close-quarters combat with its powerful melee attacks and possesses noteworthy cold damage capabilities, but it is vulnerable when knocked prone. The Frost Giant's special abilities enhance its agility on icy terrain and allow it to see clearly through snow and sleet, adding to its tactical advantage during encounters.

The Frost Giant possesses the following attributes: Strength of +6 (exceptional), Dexterity of +2 (average), Constitution of +8 (exceptional), Intelligence of -1 (very bad), Wisdom of +3 (good), and Charisma of +4 (good). Its armor class is 14, primarily due to its hide armor, and it has a significant pool of hit points at 166. The creature moves at a speed of 40 feet and has decent perception, with a score of 13. It can communicate in Common and Giant languages, though it lacks any specialized sensory capabilities, such as darkvision.

One of the Frost Giant's notable special abilities, "Giant Attributes," grants it resistance to being stunned, which can be pivotal in combat, but it is vulnerable to being knocked prone. The "Ice Walk" ability allows the giant to traverse icy surfaces effortlessly, ignoring penalties usually associated with difficult terrain made of ice or snow. Another ability, "Snowsight," enables the giant to see through heavy snowfall and other wintry obscurities without hindrance.

In combat, the Frost Giant can utilize a "Multiattack" action, allowing it to make two attacks with either its Icy Greataxe or Ice Boulder. The "Icy Greataxe" is a melee weapon strike with a +9 to hit that can reach targets 10 feet away, resulting in a potential 25 slashing damage plus an additional 4 cold damage. The "Ice Boulder" serves as a ranged attack option, with a +6 to hit and a range of 60 feet; it deals 18 bludgeoning damage and adds 9 cold damage upon a successful hit.

Additionally, the Frost Giant has a potent special action called "Avalanche," which requires a recharge of 5 to 6 turns. This attack unleashes a wave of snow in a 30-foot cone, compelling affected creatures to make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 16. Failing the save results in the creature taking 14 bludgeoning damage and 18 cold damage while being buried under the snow, thereby becoming restrained. Those who succeed take half damage and remain unburied, while a buried creature can free itself or be freed by others with a successful Strength check.

As a bonus action, the Frost Giant can employ "Wintry Blast," targeting creatures in a 30-foot line with a width of 5 feet. Affected creatures must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 16; if they fail, their movement speed is halved until the end of their next turn. If they fail by a margin of 5 or more, they become petrified in ice for one hour or until they are heated by another creature for a minute.

Overall, the Frost Giant is a powerful adversary capable of dealing substantial damage while controlling the battlefield with its cold-themed abilities. Its strengths lie in its resistances and mobility across icy terrain, while its weaknesses primarily emerge when it is knocked prone.</detail>
