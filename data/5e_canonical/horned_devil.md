<summary>A Horned Devil is a fearsome, fiendish warrior from the Nine Hells, standing tall with bat-like wings, a spiked tail, and massive horns protruding from its head.

Loyal to the infernal hierarchy, Horned Devils serve higher devils as enforcers or generals, relishing combat and the opportunity to spread terror.</summary>

<summary>The Horned Devil is a powerful entity within the realm of fiends, specifically designed to be a formidable foe in encounters. With its large size and a challenge rating of 11, it presents a significant threat to adventurers, showcasing both physical resilience and formidable magical prowess. The Horned Devil possesses a robust armor class of 18, paired with 168 hit points that make it difficult to take down. Its strengths lie in its high strength and constitution, making it exceptionally adept in combat while also resistant to several forms of damage. However, despite its resilience, it has weaknesses, especially against certain types of magical attacks or the right strategies from clever players. </summary>

<detail>

The Horned Devil boasts impressive physical attributes: a Strength score of 20 provides a +5 modifier, leading to very good effectiveness in melee attacks. Strength and Constitution saving throws are notable, with a +9 and +7 respectively, making the devil exceptionally hard to affect with downward effects. Dexterity is also decent at +3, enabling an average reaction to more nimble situations. The devil has high Wisdom and Charisma scores at +3 each, which enhances its capabilities in interaction and spellcasting.

The creature is immune to fire and poison damage and resistant to cold and non-magical, non-silvered weapon damage. Additionally, it is immune to the poisoned condition. Its darkvision of 120 feet allows it to see in complete darkness as if it were normal light and has a passive Perception score of 13. The Horned Devil can communicate in Infernal and can utilize telepathy over a range of 120 feet.

In terms of special abilities, the Horned Devil benefits from Devil's Sight, allowing it to see through magical darkness, giving it an edge over opponents who might attempt to obscure the battlefield. Its Magic Resistance grants it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, making it tougher against spellcasting adversaries. The lawful evil alignment adds an additional layer to its menacing nature.

For actions, the Horned Devil conducts a Multiattack, which allows it to make two melee attacks with its Fork weapon and one with its Tail, or to replace any melee attack with Hurl Flame, a ranged attack option. The Fork attack has a +9 to hit and deals an average of 15 fire and piercing damage combined. The Tail attack similarly has a +9 to hit with an average damage output of 10 piercing damage and potentially inflicts ongoing damage if the target fails a Constitution saving throw.

Hurl Flame is a ranged spell attack with a +7 bonus, capable of delivering 10 fire damage at a distance of up to 150 feet. If the target is flammable, it ignites and suffers ongoing fire damage, heightening the threat level. The Inferno ability, usable once per day while bloodied, deals a devastating 49 fire damage to creatures surrounding it, challenging even the best-prepared adventurers.

Lastly, the Horned Devil has a reaction named Pin, which triggers when an opponent misses it with a melee attack. This ability allows the Horned Devil to counterattack and potentially grapple the attacker, causing ongoing damage until the grapple is escaped or alleviated by magical healing. This makes the Horned Devil a dangerous opponent capable of punishing careless attackers.

Overall, the Horned Devil's combination of damage immunity, magical resistance, multi-attack capabilities, and powerful special abilities creates a creature that is both strategically complex and a high-stakes challenge for adventurers.

The Horned Devil is a formidable and cunning foe in the realm of Dungeons & Dragons, classified as a Large fiend that embodies the characteristics of a devil. With an impressive Armor Class of 18 and a substantial pool of 185 hit points, it poses a significant challenge to adventurers, rated at Challenge Rating 11. It excels in both melee and ranged attacks, employing its innate abilities to dominate the battlefield, particularly against groups of enemies. Its strengths lie in its high Strength (+10) and Dexterity (+7) scores, allowing it to inflict substantial damage and evade attacks effectively. Additionally, the Horned Devil possesses exceptional magical resilience, being immune to fire and poison damage, along with a variety of resistances that make it a tough adversary to take down. However, despite its impressive defenses, it could be vulnerable to weapons imbued with magic, especially those targeting its few weaknesses or exploiting its limitations in specific scenarios.

The Horned Devil has an Armor Class (AC) of 18, which provides good defense against attacks. It boasts 185 hit points, indicating that it can sustain a fair amount of damage before being defeated. Its speed is 20 feet on the ground, but it can fly at a speed of 60 feet, giving it excellent mobility around the battlefield. The devil possesses the following ability scores: Strength at +10 (exceptional), Dexterity at +7 (very good), Constitution at +5 (good), Intelligence at +1 (average), Wisdom at +7 (very good), and Charisma at +7 (very good). These scores highlight its physical prowess, agility, and significant influence in social interactions.

One of its noteworthy special abilities includes Devil’s Sight, which allows the Horned Devil to see through magical darkness, rendering conventional hiding tactics ineffective against it. Additionally, its Devilish Resilience grants it resistance to cold damage and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. It is immune to fire and poison damage as well as the poisoned condition, making it a highly resilient opponent in extended encounters. Magic Resistance gives the Horned Devil advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, further enhancing its durability.

In terms of actions, the Horned Devil can make a Multiattack, in which it can perform either two Fork attacks and one Tail attack or three Hurl Flame attacks during its turn. The Fork is a melee weapon attack that uses its Strength modifier, hitting with a +10 to attack and dealing an average of 19 piercing damage on a successful strike. Its Tail attack is equally deadly, also using the +10 modifier but dealing an average of 22 piercing damage. Furthermore, if the Tail hits a creature that isn’t a Construct or Undead, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or suffer infernal wounds, leading to additional damage over time, making it quite devastating if it lands such a hit repeatedly.

Hurl Flame allows the Horned Devil to attack at range. This ranged spell attack has a +7 to hit, reaching out to 150 feet and dealing an average of 20 fire damage. If it targets a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried, that object catches fire, adding environmental hazards to the encounter. Moreover, as a bonus action, the Horned Devil can perform a Headbutt, which forces a creature within 5 feet to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw or take 7 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. This adds a tactical advantage, allowing the devil to disrupt enemy formations.

Overall, the Horned Devil combines high physical strength, impressive magical abilities, and a range of attacks, making it a versatile and dangerous opponent in Dungeons & Dragons. Its ability to inflict ongoing damage through wounds and manipulate the battlefield through magical attacks provides unique challenges for any adventuring party facing it.</detail>
