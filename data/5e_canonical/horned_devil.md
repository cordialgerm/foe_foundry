<MonsterName/>Horned Devil</MonsterName>
<CreatureType/>Fiend</CreatureType>

<summary>A Horned Devil is a fearsome, fiendish warrior from the Nine Hells, standing tall with bat-like wings, a spiked tail, and massive horns protruding from its head. Its red, scaly skin and muscular form give it a menacing presence. Horned Devils are brutal and ruthless, wielding wicked spiked chains or pitchforks in battle. Their barbed tails deliver venomous strikes, and their sheer physical strength makes them dangerous opponents. Loyal to the infernal hierarchy, Horned Devils serve higher devils as enforcers or generals, relishing combat and the opportunity to spread terror.</summary>
