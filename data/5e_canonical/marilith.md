During combat, the Marilith's Multiattack allows it to make six attacks using its longswords. Each longsword attack has a +10 to hit with a reach of 5 feet, dealing an average of 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage upon a successful hit. 

As a bonus action, the Marilith can use its Tail attack, which also has a +10 to hit, but with a longer reach of 10 feet. This attack deals 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage and can grapple the target if they fail to escape with a DC of 19.

The Marilith also has the ability to teleport. It can magically transport itself up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space within its sight, allowing it to reposition itself strategically during combat. Additionally, it has a Reactive Teleport feature; when hit or missed by a ranged attack, it can use its teleport ability as a reaction. If it teleports within 5 feet of a creature, it can immediately make a tail attack against that target, adding an element of surprise to its combat tactics.

The creature is adept in various combat styles, utilizing its six arms to attack multiple opponents and leverage its spells and commands to support allies. Its notable weaknesses are few, primarily its dependence on melee combat and susceptibility to tactical disadvantages against ranged attacks.

The Marilith has an Armor Class of 18 due to its natural armor, making it challenging for attackers to land hits. It benefits from a high constitution, enhancing its durability during fights. Its senses include truesight up to 120 feet, allowing it to see things as they truly are, even through magical disguises and illusions. It can communicate in Abyssal and has telepathy that extends to 120 feet, enabling it to coordinate with allies silently.

Special abilities include Demonic Resilience, which grants it resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, along with immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. Flaming Weapons is another potent ability, where any weapon attack made by the Marilith inflicts an additional 2d6 fire damage, representing a significant threat in melee combat. It benefits from Magic Resistance, giving it advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, thereby bolstering its defenses against spellcasters. Furthermore, the Reactive ability allows it to perform up to five extra reactions, strictly used for the Parry action.

In combat, the Marilith's Multiattack action allows it to strike with two dagger attacks, two mace attacks, and two longsword attacks, making it a multi-faceted threat in melee. Its dagger attack has a +9 to hit and deals 9 piercing damage plus an extra 7 fire damage. The mace attack also has a +9 to hit and inflicts 11 bludgeoning damage alongside 7 fire damage. The longsword attack is slightly stronger, hitting for 13 slashing damage plus 7 fire damage. Additionally, it has a tail attack that can deal a substantial 20 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Medium or smaller, it can grapple the opponent, restraining them until the grapple ends.

As a bonus action, the Marilith can issue commands to its allies with Marilith Tactics, allowing two targets within 30 feet to move without triggering opportunity attacks, gain the Parry reaction to enhance their defenses, or gain advantage on their next weapon attack. The Teleport ability gives the Marilith high mobility, allowing it to magically disappear and reappear up to 60 feet away, providing escape or repositioning options during combat.

In terms of reactions, the Marilith can utilize Parry to boost its Armor Class against a melee attack, adding 5 to its AC in response to an attack it can see. This further underscores its capacity to withstand direct assaults effectively. Overall, the Marilith represents a unique combination of offensive capabilities, defensive resilience, and tactical versatility, making it a significant threat in any encounter.</detail>
